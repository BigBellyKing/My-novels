Chapter 185: A Large-Scale Disaster Movie Scene (Fifth Update, Please Subscribe for Monthly Passes)

After *Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame* was launched,
countless Dark Souls players immediately wanted to witness the magnificent story of the Age of the First Flame.
Before entering the game, numerous players had imagined themselves wielding a sword and shield, with a Greatsword on their back.
They envisioned fighting ancient kings like Lord Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight, Nito, the First of the Dead, and the Witch of Izalith, to show them what it meant to be a Firelinker!
Gods? Nothing more than that!

However, after entering the game, these players were immediately subjected to various forms of brutal beatings.
First, the Asylum Demon delivered a rude awakening to countless players.
Then, upon arriving at Firelink Shrine, many accidentally ventured into the Catacombs and the New Londo Ruins.
Some even traveled quite far, directly lighting a bonfire in the Catacombs.
The tragic discovery they made was that they couldn't go back!

Another group of players who arrived at Undead Burg fared no better.
Black Knights, Havel, Wyvern Bridge.
They were directly taught what it meant to be Undead!
Instantly, regardless of national borders or time zones, countless players' bitter complaints emerged on major gaming forums, both domestic and international.
Though the languages and phrases differed, the core sentiment expressed was universally understood:
“This Prequel is too damn hard!”

After being brutalized, countless players cried out in unison.
Even though they had mentally prepared themselves beforehand,
upon entering the game, they instantly realized the true meaning of “there are always higher mountains and stronger opponents” (literally: “beyond mountains, there are mountains; beyond skies, there are skies”).
This difficulty, this trickery, was even more brutal than the original *Dark Souls*!

The Firelinkers, full of ambition, stepped into Lordran.
They instantly understood what truly makes a Sequel.
Familiar graphics? Familiar story? Familiar combat system?
Absolutely wrong! Only when you play it and feel that stirring in the depths of your soul is a game a worthy Sequel.
And without a doubt, *Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame* was precisely that.
This agonizingly fatal gaming experience felt so nostalgic and familiar.
It immediately helped them rediscover that feeling of being brutally beaten to death, just like in the old days.
The countless torments players suffered in the world of *Dark Souls* were
varied and numerous, a veritable large-scale disaster movie scene, never repeating.
Almost every corner bore witness to their suffering.

...................
A player who had accidentally wandered into the Valley of Drakes lost his way. When he saw a giant dragon that was dead, even decayed, he showed a happy smile.
Because next to the dragon's head, there were two items shimmering with white light.
However, after he cautiously checked his surroundings, confirming there were no traps falling from the sky,
the player grinned, “I wonder what good stuff it’ll give me!”
Full of joy, he ran over to pick up the items, but the moment he approached,
the dragon's corpse actually moved, performing a dragon head swing that sent him flying while it spat out a mouthful of venomous phlegm, sending him back to the bonfire.
“What the heck! Its body is rotten, but this guy is still alive!?”
Looking at the familiar three words “YOU DIED” on the screen, the player's mentality collapsed.

...................
Returning from the aqueduct to the Lower Undead Burg, the player who had previously defeated the Gargoyle Demon with Solaire was brimming with excitement.
Donning magnificent knight's armor, the player passed through the white fog gate.
Another thrilling BOSS battle was about to begin.

Amidst the broken and dilapidated ruins, the BOSS appeared before his eyes: a very imposing Goat Head Demon.
“Come on, let’s see which is stronger, your goat head or that Taurus Demon from before!”
The player looked at the Goat BOSS before him, full of fighting spirit.
The next moment, a ferocious sound echoed in his ears.
‘Woof woof woof!’
Accompanying the charging goat were two crimson dogs.
“Holy crap, what’s going on? You have two dogs too?”
“What the hell, why are these dogs so fierce!”
“Hanging up a sheep’s head and selling dog meat!”
Seeing the familiar three words “YOU DIED” on the screen, the player was stunned.
“Isn’t this BOSS a goat monster?! Why are there two dogs, and why are these two dogs so damn fierce?
It feels like the dogs are the real BOSS!”

...................
Beyond that, almost every area in *Dark Souls* was incredibly sadistic.
For example, the infamous Blighttown was hailed by countless players as being no less formidable than Farron Keep, and even surpassing it.
The Blighttown area itself had extremely low visibility for players.
Furthermore, its vertical span was enormous, making it easy for players to get lost. It also required items like the Sunlight Maggot to navigate properly.
Moreover, every monster there was poisonous, especially the mosquitoes in Blighttown, whose in-game models were so tiny that many players couldn't even hit them.
Once poisoned, health would drain as if a major artery had been severed, unstoppable without a Spider Shield and Antidote. One could say passing through Blighttown was a hellish difficulty.
Concurrently, the lower section was filled with countless dogs, and coupled with the Blowdart Snipers on the second floor, it could only be described as merciless.
There were also many truly disgusting monsters: freaks using corpses as weapons, large club-wielding fatties, giant maggots, mosquitoes, mad dogs—the entire map scene was incredibly oppressive.
What's more, Blighttown was merely the beginning of the game.
On the beams of Anor Londo, there was a path resembling a single-plank bridge.
But at this point, from the distant eaves of tall buildings, two archer guards would relentlessly shoot at you.
Although called arrows, the projectiles they fired were actually like javelins.
High damage was a minor issue; the critical problem was that on the beams of the royal city, the height above ground was immense.
Without Black Iron Leggings, a single arrow could send you flying into a bottomless abyss, and even with Black Iron armor, the damage was explosive.

In addition, Sen's Fortress featured killing mechanisms, giant axe pendulum single-plank bridges, and killing elevators; the Great Hollow harbored one-punch Mushroom Men; and the BOSS battle against the Bed of Chaos, the “Desk Cleaner Master,” where the most challenging part wasn't fighting the BOSS, but carefully avoiding environmental deaths that might occur during the fight.
Because the ground was entirely covered in cracks, a single misstep meant instant death, and the BOSS would also use its massive hands to “clear the desk.”

Even the players' first stop, Undead Burg, was similarly filled with malice.
There were Black Knights blocking the way, and the insane Wyvern Bridge.
After reaching the Undead Church area, the countless swarming Hollow Blademasters in the stairwell and hall taught players the true meaning of despair.
If it were just the Hollow Blademasters, it might have been bearable, but the crucial point was that someone was actually buffing these blademasters.
Coupled with the inability to warp from bonfires before acquiring the Lordvessel, countless players were on the verge of breakdown.
Although there were many shortcuts in the game, one needed the skill to use them.
God knows how truly soul-crushing that short journey back from Blighttown to Firelink Shrine was.
