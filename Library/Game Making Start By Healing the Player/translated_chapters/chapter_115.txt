Chapter 115: This Damned Sense of Oppression!

Currently, Wang Han was in a circular courtyard. To her right was a cliff, and to her left were countless gravestones and lit candle piles.

In the center stood Ash Judgment Gundyr, like a sculpted stone statue.

But what truly captivated Wang Han wasn't these, but the bloodstains on the ground.

Next to Gundyr the Ash, Wang Han’s vision showed at least twenty to thirty patches of bloodstains.

In *Dark Souls*, if players engaged in online multiplayer games, data would automatically be uploaded to the server.

One thing that differed from other games was that, besides in-game messages, the scenes of players dying in the game would also randomly appear in other players’ worlds.

Of course, this was random, with the highest priority given to the most recent death information.

The main reason for setting up so many of these near Gundyr the Ash was to offer players some comfort.

To let them know that in this despairing world, they weren’t fighting alone.

And that being “schooled” by Uncle Gundyr right after starting the game wasn’t an experience unique to them.

The twenty to thirty bloodstains before Wang Han currently meant that twenty to thirty people had already fallen on this land.

“My goodness! How many people have died here!” Wang Han’s earlier uneasy feeling grew stronger.

Wang Han controlled the in-game character ‘123’ to walk onto one of the bloodstains and pressed the interact button.

Then, Wang Han saw the bloodstain transform into a red shadow, rolling twice on the ground, then being stabbed into the sky by something unknown, falling back down, struggling, and collapsing.

She continued to examine some of the nearby bloodstains, and the states of death were basically bizarre and varied.

Some were directly launched into the air, some seemed to have been flattened, others looked as if they had been impaled.

But the only constant was that these shadows, before dying, were mostly rolling around on the ground.

“It’s over, I have a feeling this Ash Judgment Gundyr seems very powerful!”

Wang Han felt a bit intimidated watching.

Zhang Yi, standing nearby, also sensed that the “water temperature” was off, but he still offered his analysis: “I think you’re falling for a trap if you think that way. Why can you only see the moment of death?”

“This is Chen Xu’s conspiracy! He’s using this method to interfere with players’ judgment, making them more and more nervous. After all, the unknown is the most terrifying, just like *Outlast* back then.” Zhang Yi declared confidently.

Wang Han mused, “So you mean Ash Judgment Gundyr might be a weakling, and Chen Xu is just being mysterious with this design?”

Zhang Yi shook his head: “No… I mean, hurry up and start the BOSS fight. If you die, I’ll go next.”

“Get lost!” Wang Han retorted, exasperated.

With some nervous emotion, Wang Han took a deep breath, controlling her in-game character to step forward and trigger the plot.

The character in the game, with a strong twist of their waist, gripped the Coiled Sword plunged into Ash Judgment Gundyr’s chest, and slowly pulled it out.

*Pfffsh…*

A stream of black blood gushed from Gundyr’s chest, and at the same time, the Coiled Sword was slowly withdrawn from his chest.

When the Coiled Sword was fully pulled out, the screen trembled. Then, Gundyr, who had been kneeling on the ground like a stone statue, stood up, clutching his halberd.

Wang Han had already seen this BOSS, Ash Judgment Gundyr, in the previous online press conference video.

But watching a video and playing it herself were two different concepts.

Gundyr’s massive, grayish body stood up, taller than the three ‘123’ characters in the game combined.

His enormous figure blocked the cold sunlight, appearing incredibly imposing.

Accompanying Gundyr’s rise, the game’s grand background music, combined with deep chanting, gradually resonated, creating an atmosphere of “epicness” that made Wang Han in the game also inexplicably excited.

Simultaneously, at the bottom center of the screen, a long health bar appeared, along with the BOSS’s name: Ash Judgment Gundyr.

This was just the first BOSS battle in the game, but it gave Wang Han the feeling of facing a final BOSS in other games.

It could only be said that in terms of atmosphere rendering, *Dark Souls* was already phenomenal!

“This is going to be a desperate struggle! You won’t stop me from Linking the Fire!” Listening to the vast and majestic background music in the game, Wang Han felt her whole being ignited, and something called ‘drama’ suddenly surged within her.

At this moment in the game, the awakened Ash Judgment Gundyr had already launched his first attack.

Ash Judgment Gundyr took a deliberate step and charged towards Wang Han.

Dust flew everywhere. The massive halberd in Gundyr’s hand seemed weightless as he delivered a sweeping attack.

Instinctively, Wang Han immediately rolled twice backwards. After all, she seriously doubted whether her small, shabby shield could withstand Ash Judgment Gundyr’s halberd.

Having witnessed Zhang Yi’s first death scene earlier, she already knew the importance of the Stamina Bar in the game.

If the Stamina Bar was completely depleted, her situation would become even more perilous, so she felt that rolling would offer a higher margin for error.

Gundyr, not letting up after his first sweeping halberd attack, followed with a jumping slash towards Wang Han.

This time, Wang Han’s luck wasn’t as good.

She was hit directly, and her health bar seemed to have an artery cut, immediately losing half its length.

“My God! That attack power is too high!” Wang Han was completely stunned.

Now she finally understood why all the death scenes she had seen earlier involved a lot of rolling before dying.

Was this BOSS truly a beginner’s BOSS?

Rolling clumsily on the ground, a question formed in Wang Han’s mind.

Earlier, when she watched Zhang Yi fight the Crystal Lizard, she could still give expert advice from the side.

But watching and playing were two different matters. Once she actually got her hands on it, she realized this game felt a bit off!

The Crystal Lizard part was one thing; after all, there was a “Turn back” prompt right at the entrance.

But what was going on with this Ash Judgment Gundyr in front of her?

This damned sense of oppression, why was it so strong?!

Indeed!

It was a sense of oppression!

For Wang Han, who was experiencing *Dark Souls* for the first time, this BOSS battle brought her nothing but oppression.

The massive and formidable Gundyr, wielding his halberd, swept it around with broad, powerful swings, each move exuding dominance.

Especially as the halberd struck the ground, combined with the sound effects and the rising dust effects, it simply radiated an overwhelming sense of oppression.

Facing Ash Judgment Gundyr, Wang Han was basically scurrying around in panic the entire time.

At one point, mustering courage, she went in and got two hits in during Gundyr’s attack intervals, but then, due to insufficient stamina, she couldn’t roll continuously to create distance and was grazed by the halberd.

And that graze cost her half her life.

Her Estus Flasks were all gone now.

Out of ammo and out of food, at the end of her rope.

Looking at Gundyr, who had lost about a tenth of his health, and then at herself, with only a sliver of health left.

Wang Han controlled her game character ‘123’ and bravely charged forward.

She delivered a perfect set of “massage and manipulation” attacks to Gundyr’s feet.

Honestly, it actually dealt quite a bit of damage.

After a couple of hits with the small club, Gundyr the Ash’s health bar visibly dropped by another tenth or so.

But the next moment, Gundyr the Ash’s halberd delivered an uppercut.

Accompanied by the game character flying into the air and a tragic cry of ‘Uh-ah!’.

Three words appeared in the center of the screen — ‘YOU DIED’
