Chapter 18: Gaming Experience

After Chen Xu announced the existence of Undertale.

Ordinary players hadn't really noticed anything yet, only feeling that the conflict had escalated. This wasn't just a war of words; it was a full-on bayonet charge!

But for the well-informed gaming media, it felt like they'd just seen a chihuahua.

Well, well, well, they originally thought it was just youthful exuberance, standing up to directly confront. Turns out, this was a premeditated hype stunt!

But knowing is one thing; the traffic brought by this huge scoop simply couldn't be missed.

Under the reports from various media outlets, the popularity of both Undertale and Blooming quickly began to soar.

Regarding this, within the Hapai Culture & Sports media, Zhong Mei was quite vexed.

Because now these two games could be said to be bound together. The reason their popularity surged so quickly, aside from the official Weibo skirmishes between him and Chen Xu, was more importantly the significant game promotion funds he had invested. But now? It all served as a wedding gown for Undertale.

………………

On July 15th, Undertale officially launched on the Official Game Platform store. Compared to Blooming from Zhong Mei's side, Undertale launched 3 days earlier. It managed to seize an early advantage.

Many Game Designers and players were closely watching Undertale's performance. After all, this game wasn't a Gentleman's Game like Mirror (Game) was before. Although Mirror (Game) performed brilliantly, it was still an 18R Rating game. Now, everyone wanted to see the true quality of this game called Undertale, developed by Chen Xu.

In the editorial department of a media company named Game Timespace, Wu Tian, who had just started his job not long ago, was also sitting in front of his computer, preparing to review Undertale.

Even though it was just an ordinary Independent Game, its recent popularity was undeniable. The only thing that frustrated Wu Tian was that today was Sunday. This meant he had to work overtime.

“Never mind, I'll just bear with it. At least there's overtime pay.” Looking at the time, Wu Tian sighed. He remembered what his editor-in-chief had told him earlier: 'The company's overtime pay is quite good; just bear with it.'

After tidying up the clutter on his desk slightly, Wu Tian launched the game called Undertale.

It began with a simple LOGO icon, a black starry sky background, with the four large characters 'Nebula Games' emblazoned above, and a line of English text below.

After a brief black screen, a yellowed image appeared on screen. It depicted a small girl with an indistinct face holding a long spear, and an animal, also faceless, standing beside her. From its appearance, it looked a bit like a rabbit, a dog, or perhaps a goat?

Looking at the yellowed image, Wu Tian made his guesses inwardly.

Just like a comic, the opening animation began to turn pages.

“Is this because they don't have money for CG animation, so they're using a comic-style to tell the opening story? This approach isn't bad.”

Wu Tian speculated to himself. Just this opening alone had left Wu Tian with a good impression of Undertale. At least, there was a high probability that today's overtime journey wouldn't be a torture.

The images began to turn pages.

The background music started playing, simple scales, but quite flavorful.

‘Long ago, two races ruled Earth: HUMANS and MONSTERS.’

‘One day, war broke out between the two races.’

‘After a long war, the HUMANS were victorious. They sealed the MONSTERS underground.’

‘Many years later…’

‘Mt. Ebott – 201X. Legends say that those who climb the mountain never return.’

A simple background introduction, nothing particularly outstanding.

After naming the protagonist in the game, Wu Tian saw the character awaken on a grassy patch covered in yellow petals.

Following the game's operation prompts that appeared earlier, Wu Tian controlled the character to walk forward.

After reaching a large gate resembling a castle entrance, he walked inside, where a small sunflower appeared.

‘Howdy!’

‘I'm Flowey!’

‘Hehehe!’

‘You must be new to the Underground, aren't ya?’

‘Golly, you must be so confused.’

‘Looks like I'll have to teach you how things work around here.’

‘Flowey doesn't have a choice, I'll have to teach you myself. Ready? Let's go!’

What a strange character. Looking at the small flower in front of him, just like a sunflower, Wu Tian thought to himself.

“LV increasing to get stronger, shouldn't that be Level? What the heck is 'Love'?”

Looking at Flowey's dialogue, Wu Tian was a bit confused. Deliberately being mysterious?

And what are these 'friendliness pellets'? I just have a feeling this Flowey isn't good news.

Wu Tian thought to himself, and the subsequent game screen confirmed his suspicions.

Accompanied by an evil laugh. The seemingly friendly Flowey, after telling him that LV increased by touching friendliness pellets, revealed its menacing true colors. Upon touching the white pellets, his HP instantly dropped to 1.

‘You idiot! In this world, it's either kill or BE killed! Who would miss such a great opportunity?’

‘DIE!’

As expected, someone should be coming to the rescue next. A typical plot kill in an RPG.

Looking at the heart-shaped icon surrounded by countless white particles, Wu Tian felt no emotional fluctuation. He had more or less understood the combat part of the game; it was similar to bullet-hell dodging in rhythm games. But this plot arrangement felt a bit old-fashioned, wasn't it just a traditional RPG?

Sure enough, the next moment, just as the bullet-hell circles were about to hit him, his HP, which had only 1 point left, suddenly fully recovered, and the attacking bullet-hell disappeared.

Flowey in the game also showed a dumbfounded expression, and after a performance of over-the-top facial expressions, was directly struck by a ball of fire and sent flying.

A female figure with ram horns on her head appeared, saving the protagonist in the game.

‘What a cruel creature, tormenting such a weak, innocent child.’

‘Do not be afraid, my child. I am Toriel, caretaker of the RUINS.’

‘I pass through this place every day to see if anyone has fallen down. You are the first human to come here in a long time.’

‘Come! I will guide you through the catacombs.’

‘This way.’

After a brief conversation, the goat-like female named Toriel led Wu Tian along the path ahead.

She told him how to solve puzzles and how to use mechanisms. At the same time, she informed him that when encountering enemies, he didn't necessarily have to fight; he could also persuade NPCs.

The puzzles were very simple: just pushing stones and remembering not to step on leaves.

“While it's not a torturous journey, the quality is too dry. It feels even less interesting than the Match-3 game in Mirror (Game).”

Wu Tian sighed, looking at a monster he encountered, choosing not to talk or offer a merciful embrace. Instead, he directly entered combat.

So far, the only things he found somewhat interesting were Flowey's over-the-top facial expressions at the beginning and this combat segment. Although it was a dodgeball-style gameplay, different monsters displayed different combat methods. For example, a frog's combat involved a frog jumping within a square. It could be said that it matched the monster's image very well.

“I hope this game's progression isn't long and tedious, so I can get off work earlier.” Sighing, Wu Tian shook his head.
