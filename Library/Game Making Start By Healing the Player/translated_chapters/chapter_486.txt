Many VR players online were discussing content related to Nebula World, but many PC players without VR could only stare enviously.

After all, all this joy belonged to others and had absolutely nothing to do with them.

This time, however, was different; Chen Xu actually responded to them.

The official Weibo account's message was very simple.

'New game will launch simultaneously on PC'

Seeing Chen Xu's announcement, countless players became excited.

After all, many previous VR games hadn't launched PC versions due to graphics and technical capabilities.

Hmm... Resident Evil was an exception.

But now Chen Xu had directly announced that this unknown new game would simultaneously launch on PC?

This instantly got many players excited.

'Holy crap! Holy crap! Is Mr. Chen really serious about this?'

'What are you talking about? This isn't some unofficial news; it's Mr. Chen's official Weibo account!'

'PC players rejoice!'

'Finally, we don't have to go to VR experience stores to play!'

'I wonder what kind of game this new title will be!'

'VR veteran players, hurry up and find the easter eggs!'

Although PC players couldn't experience Nebula World on PC, their anticipation skyrocketed instantly upon learning that this new game would be simultaneously launched on PC.

Originally, they were just casually following Nebula World and its easter egg content, but now it was different.

One by one, they all started brainstorming online, helping others analyze where else there might be easter eggs.

Even though they hadn't played it, they had seen it. Theoretical masters were also very useful!

Many VR players experiencing Nebula World were also expressing their feelings.

At first, many people eagerly searched for easter eggs once they discovered them.

However, they soon discovered that the updated themed planes within Nebula World offered quite diverse gameplay.

For example, in Stormwind City in Warcraft, players could pick up a quest to suppress the prison next to the Mage Quarter.

At first, the easter egg content was very easy, making everyone think the difficulty wasn't high, but they were immediately taught a lesson upon entering.

The prisoners inside were all quite tricky, and while dynamic difficulty would weaken some monster attributes if playing solo instead of in a team,

facing a large group of monsters alone was still incredibly tough.

Many players who still had fresh memories of Warcraft enjoyed wandering around Stormwind City, and besides this dungeon, there were also related questlines in various corners.

Of course, the only thing that left players speechless was the racial choices.

Many players were puzzled to discover that the Night Elf race could only choose two classes.

'What's going on, Mr. Chen? Is this a bug?'

'Yeah, why can't my Night Elf choose to be a mage?'

'Discrimination! This is racial discrimination! This setting makes my heart go cold and my body tremble with rage! This is racial discrimination against my Night Elves!'

In the Stormwind City setting, Chen Xu also followed the early WoW versions from his previous life, not adding the mage class as an option like in later Cataclysm versions. As for the reason, Chen Xu didn't even need to explain it; players familiar with Warcraft lore quickly stepped forward to clarify.

'Trembling with indignation for what? Haven't you all played Warcraft? Mages, indeed! The Well of Eternity was blown up by you Night Elves messing with magic! And Night Elves are so good-looking, isn't it normal to nerf one class?'

'Ahem! Let's be more precise, upstairs. You're making it sound like the Night Elves themselves blew up the Well of Eternity. To be accurate, the Night Elves using magic attracted the Burning Legion into the village, and then it exploded during the final battle.'

'Isn't that the same damn thing!'

'But that's not quite right. Those who couldn't use magic were on Malfurion and Tyrande's side. The Sunstriders, those Highborne, didn't seem to give up their magic yo-yos. I wonder if the Highborne option will be updated later?'

'Who knows?'

As for Warcraft, which Chen Xu had previously launched, it could be said to have enjoyed extremely high popularity, with its rich RTS gameplay, vast worldview, and well-developed esports scene, maintaining very high activity to this day.

For casual players who couldn't get into RTS, the various rich RPG maps often allowed them to play a few rounds with friends in their free time.

So now, facing the VR version of Stormwind City, with the addition of new class combat, it could be said to have rekindled many players' nostalgia and passion for the game.

However, in the face of these discussions among Azeroth players, other spectators were left speechless.

Weren't they supposed to be looking for easter eggs?

How did the conversation veer off to Azeroth?

And it wasn't just Stormwind City from Warcraft; the other themed planes also offered unique gameplay.

For instance, in the New World of Monster Hunter, players could choose to gather mushrooms to complete quests, or they could opt to hunt dangerous prey.

Similarly, in Assassin's Creed, players could explore various hidden ancient tombs.

In Red Dead Redemption, players could pick up bounty hunting missions.

Regarding the new game's easter eggs, Chen Xu placed some openly, while more detailed content was hidden.

With players worldwide searching for easter eggs together, the efficiency was remarkably high.

Considering the dissemination and compilation of information, the easter eggs found by both domestic and international players were quickly and thoroughly cataloged.

Even ordinary VR players followed this guide to uncover the easter egg content.


Inside Nebula World, Song Ren was exploring Mount Massive Asylum from Outlast. There was no other way; according to online guides, two key easter egg items were hidden in Mount Massive Asylum and the Baker family's farm, which could be said to be full of Mr. Chen's malice.

Although there were already videos made about it online, Song Ren hadn't watched them. He still wanted to experience it himself, so he only searched for the locations of the various easter eggs and how to unlock them.

Soon, he had collected the last 'Madman's Knowledge'.

Returning to Nebula World, his world was now completely different.

With Money Power, his museum was already complete, displaying various game items.

Frostmourne from Warcraft, the various treasures Nathan found in Uncharted, the Apple of Eden from Assassin's Creed...

Besides this, he also bought a Palico, and the interior of his house was no longer shabby but had become luxurious.

"Now I just need to crush this, but it won't be a horror game, right?"

This 'Madman's Knowledge' was the key easter egg item, and crushing each one would increase something called Insight.

And as Insight increased, the shadowy figure by the sea became clearer, while the sky of the entire Nebula World gradually darkened, making Song Ren feel that the atmosphere was a bit off.

Furthermore, he had previously seen some information online that some players were saying Nebula Games' new title might be related to the Cthulhu Mythos.

He had never heard of this mythological system before, but a quick search online made him feel it was related to horror.

So now, he was genuinely a bit apprehensive.

Carrying this apprehension, Song Ren crushed the last 'Madman's Knowledge' in his hand.

The next moment, Song Ren saw a beam of light burst from the portal on Nebula World's island. The sky of the entire Nebula World instantly darkened, a blood moon slowly rose on the distant horizon, and behind the moon, there was the silhouette of a massive monster.

Then Song Ren's vision plunged into darkness. Accompanied by the ringing of bells, the world changed.
