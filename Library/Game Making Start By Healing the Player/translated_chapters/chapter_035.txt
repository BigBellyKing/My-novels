Chapter 35: Liva's Illness

The entire game employs a narrative technique of flashbacks. Almost all players understood this.

With a heart full of questions, time continued to move forward.

On the night before Liva and Johnny's wedding. The two, dressed in formal attire, leaned against the lighthouse, gazing at the moonlit scenery and chatting.

And on this very day, the lighthouse acquired a name—Anya.

Bathed in moonlight, Liva and Johnny ascended the lighthouse. Under the reflection of the beacon, Johnny and Liva's shadows flickered on the wall. Guided by the moonlight, Johnny earnestly taught Liva how to dance.

From night until day. Gentle, soothing piano music flowed like a stream, accompanying their dance. It imbued the entire game with a romantic atmosphere.

The game's visuals might not have been exceptional. Yet, thanks to the music and the atmosphere, this scene appeared incredibly romantic and beautiful.

"Wow, they danced all night!" Dong Zhen exclaimed, full of emotion.

He had to admit, the doubts that had lingered in his heart until this moment were temporarily cast aside. Because, at least for now, the game made even this tough guy feel something called romance.

Time moved to the next day. In front of the lighthouse, now named Anya, Liva and Johnny officially became husband and wife.

On the way to the wedding festivities, Liva saw a small white rabbit that had been hit and killed. Her reaction was a mixture of sadness and peculiarity. However, Johnny didn't notice anything amiss.

"So, is this why Liva kept folding paper rabbits later on? But what's the connection?" Dong Zhen was confused. Yet, he had no clues.

The plot continued to advance. Everyone at the wedding was very happy, but Dong Zhen noticed another detail. That was, at the wedding, Johnny's mother called him by a different name. Johnny's friend Nicolas in the game also expressed confusion. Johnny's reaction was natural, stating that it was his grandfather's name, and his mother used Joey as his nickname in remembrance.

"Joey? This name... I bet there's something going on here!" Dong Zhen's eyes narrowed.

Time progressed little by little, reaching Liva and Johnny's courtship period before their marriage. At this time, they were playing at a horse farm. Liva and Johnny were riding galloping steeds, enjoying themselves and laughing. This was based on a doctor's suggestion, that perhaps horseback riding could alleviate Liva's condition.

Like most couples in love, they shared various intimate gestures. At the same time, players finally understood what illness Liva had, confirming their previous suspicions.

"Asperger's Syndrome, is that Liva's illness?" From the notebook clues, Dong Zhen finally learned the name of Liva's condition. He had never heard of this illness before.

Glancing at the bullet comments, it was clear that the live stream's chat was completely bewildered.

"Patients with this condition exhibit symptoms such as difficulty in social interaction, difficulty in verbal communication, noticeably rigid behavioral patterns, and a stubborn adherence to certain specific, meaningless procedures and rituals."

"It's exactly the same, indeed."

He was somewhat enlightened; if she suffered from this condition, then Liva's previous strange actions could be fully explained. However, while the behaviors were explained, the meaning behind those actions had yet to be answered. At this moment, Dong Zhen was still full of curiosity.

Curiosity about Liva and Johnny. What did the paper rabbits represent? What kind of story did Liva and Johnny have? And why did Johnny want to go to the moon so badly?

By this point in the game, nearly two hours had passed. But why did Johnny want to go to the moon? Why was Liva willing to give up her life to build that house from which Anya could be seen? And why did she fold paper rabbits throughout her married life and ask Johnny about them?

These questions had not yet been fully answered.

As the plot advanced, it reached Johnny's teenage student years. During this time, he met Liva.

And Dong Zhen noticed something: the platypus. Liva, during her high school years, always carried that platypus with her. It seemed this doll held some important information for her. And it was also the medium through which Johnny first struck up a conversation with Liva.

With the help of his friend Nicolas, Johnny was pushed in front of Liva, who was squatting on the steps reading a book, to strike up a conversation.

"Hello!"

"Uh... hello..."

"Can you hear me?"

Standing in front of Liva, Johnny seemed a bit awkward.

And at that moment, Liva finally spoke: "Yes."

"Then why don't you... never mind... Hmm, that platypus is really cool." Johnny tried every way to find a topic to chat about.

And Liva just put down her book, glanced at the platypus next to her, then returned her gaze to the book.

"Uh... what are you reading?" Johnny continued to search for a topic.

"A book... just a book."

"About platypuses?"

"No."

"Oh... I, uh, I guess that's fine too."

Johnny seemed very awkward; clearly, he found Liva to be too aloof. Based on her demeanor, Liva at this time was indeed not very likable. One could even say she was unapproachable; even through the screen, one could feel how awkward Johnny must have been then, and how cold the atmosphere was.

However, through the game's flashback narrative, everyone understood that this wasn't the real Liva. She was only like this because she suffered from Asperger's Syndrome.

"Lighthouses!" Liva, after a moment of silence, spoke, cutting Johnny off.

"This country preserves a total of sixteen second-order Fresnel lens lighthouses. Nine of them are located in coastal areas, and among those, one was converted from an old kerosene lighthouse."

"Oh, is that what you're reading? Hmm, actually... I wanted to ask, would you like to go see a movie with me?"

"I don't know."

"That's okay, I can wait for you to consider."

"Cannot consider."

"Why?"

"No date, no time."

"Hmm... then, how about this Saturday at eight o'clock? Is that alright?"

"Okay."

This, however, made Dong Zhen, who had played up to this point, feel even more uncomfortable, even a little heartbroken. It was something a normal person simply couldn't comprehend.

Honestly, he couldn't personally grasp how much suffering Liva in the game must have endured. How agonizing it must be to have a condition where you clearly understand something in your heart but are unable to express it accurately through words and actions.
