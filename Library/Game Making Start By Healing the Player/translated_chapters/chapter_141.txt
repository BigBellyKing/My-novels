Chapter 140: New Game Ideas and Game of the Year Event (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

The news about Nebula Games acquiring Galaxy Smart Tech didn't make much of a splash in the gaming industry.

As for ordinary players, it could be said they didn't pay any attention to this at all.

After all, acquiring a company isn't the same as releasing a new game.

As for the gaming industry, they merely expressed some admiration for Nebula Games' big move.

Acquiring studios or other businesses isn't an uncommon occurrence either.

Furthermore, while Galaxy Smart Tech itself had some fame, it was still unfamiliar to most people outside of the smart AI research community.

Therefore, the ones who reacted most strongly to this acquisition were actually Nebula Games' internal employees.

During lunch break, employees from various departments at Nebula Games were chatting amongst themselves, all with surprised expressions.

Everyone was surprised by the company's move.

They actually acquired a company?

Its scale suddenly grew even larger!?

Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue, for instance, knew there was a big move coming, as Chen Xu had previously disclosed some related information to them.

It was just that at the time, they didn't know this big move involved investing heavily to acquire a company.

Qin Yi and many from the development team, however, were very excited.

Clearly, they had already begun fantasizing about how AI would be implemented in future games.

For games, an improvement in technical capabilities can entirely bring players a better sense of experience.

"If we introduce AI intelligence into Dark Souls, combined with a random mode, I wonder what kind of scenario that would create!" Qin Yi, sitting on the sofa, looked at the Dark Souls screen beside him, already filled with anticipation.

"Be a human!" Ruan Ningxue retorted, hearing Qin Yi's words.

Dark Souls itself was already difficult enough, and after the random mode was introduced, many "African" players generally believed that the random mode was even more difficult than the normal Dark Souls.

Because everything they faced was uncontrollable.

And now they want to add AI intelligence?

Wouldn't players be utterly crushed then?

"Is Mr. Chen acquiring this company to prepare for future Dark Souls sequels?" Yang Xin mused, chin in hand.

This wasn't just her speculation; it was also the speculation of many Dark Souls players.

But the next moment, a voice answered her question: "Don't overthink it, it's just for future strategic planning. Nebula Games' project types are bound to be diversified in the future, and we also need to accumulate technology."

Holding a cup of coffee, Chen Xu found a spot and sat down.

Listening to Chen Xu's words, Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin also nodded.

"But Mr. Chen, do you have any arrangements for the upcoming period?" Qin Yi asked Chen Xu.

Hearing Qin Yi's words, Chen Xu shook his head: "Of course, there are plans for new projects, but the timing definitely won't work out. This year's Spring Festival is earlier than usual. Also, in a few days, I'll need to attend the Game of the Year Event hosted by the Game Department."

Unlike his previous life, similar Game of the Year award events were held both domestically and internationally.

However, in this Parallel World, the event Chen Xu was invited to this time was hosted by the Game Department.

It had an official nature.

Moreover, compared to previous years, this year's Game of the Year event was slightly different.

In previous years, although it was also a Game of the Year awards ceremony, its impact was more significant on the industry.

On the player level, it had less impact than some more commercially-oriented award ceremonies.

Last year, Chen Xu's works were also nominated.

For example, Undertale received the Best Independent Game award, and To the Moon also won a Best Music award.

But this year was different.

The Game Department reformed the awards ceremony, striving to involve more players to expand its influence, and the level of attention was completely different from previous years.

This could be seen from the various Game Design Competitions held in the past two years.

This was also one of the reasons why NetDragon and TengHua suddenly brought out two VR blockbusters and went head-to-head this year.

On another note, Yang Chen, the Game Department Minister in Modu, also privately informed Chen Xu that certificates would be issued to designers promoted to senior job titles this year during the annual event.

So there was no way Chen Xu wouldn't go.

This meant Chen Xu would be very busy during this period; at least he wouldn't have much time to develop new games before the New Year.

After hearing Chen Xu's words, Qin Yi, Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, and others appeared very excited.

Clearly, they also understood that this year's Game of the Year event was very significant.

"Mr. Chen, do we have a chance to win any awards?"

"Yeah! We have quite a few games out this year, right? Overcooked, Fall Guys, Sanguosha, Valiant Hearts: The Great War, and Dark Souls!"

Several people were filled with anticipation.

"'Valiant Hearts: The Great War' will definitely get an award; as for the others, we'll let fate decide," Chen Xu said with a smile.

This was almost an unspoken rule, after all, Valiant Hearts: The Great War had previously won first place in this year's anti-war game design competition.

The Game Department couldn't possibly not give it an award, not even a consolation prize.

"Also, regarding new projects, I actually already have some ideas," Chen Xu said with a smile. "Dark Souls tormented players terribly, and they have a lot of complaints about me online. So, for the next one, I've decided to make a more wholesome game. After I finish with the Game Department's event, we'll have a meeting to discuss it in detail."

"Wholesome" again? Hearing Chen Xu's words, the expressions of Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and even Qin Yi turned subtle.

……………………

On the day of the Game of the Year Selection Event, the weather was quite good.

Compared to previous years, this year's Game of the Year selection's prestige and popularity could be said to have reached an all-time high.

On major live streaming platforms, there were dedicated channels broadcasting the entire event live.

Precisely because of this, various invited game designers from the gaming industry attended this event, regardless of their reasons, even if some knew they were essentially just going through the motions.

On one hand, they needed to show respect to the Game Department; on the other hand, boosting their presence was also good.

Just like the Oscar ceremony, even if they were just playing a minor role, it was still good to walk the red carpet.

The event was held at the Modu Convention Center Exhibition Hall.

As for accommodation, the Game Department had also made preparations in advance.

Compared to previous years, which had some lectures and industry exchange events.

This year, however, all of those were canceled, mainly because the event's theme was geared towards players.

Regular players were more concerned with which awards their favorite games received. As for industry exchange?

They didn't care at all!

Moreover, while it was called industry exchange, could the experiences shared in those lectures truly be called experience?

Every game designer had a set of mature concepts and new insights on how to design games.

But who would foolishly tell others their secrets directly?

So, many previous lectures were mostly just for show.

For ordinary game designers, they might be very helpful.

But for game designers who were directly invited to participate, even if not all were top-tier.

They were still the backbone of the industry, and these things had no substance for them.

It was purely just going through the motions.

So the Game Department simply canceled this segment, retaining only the awards segment, which was also what players most anticipated.

Before the event began, Chen Xu entered through the entrance, holding his pass.

There were a great many designers at the event venue.

However, they were basically divided into several factions.

TengHua, NetDragon... as well as game designers from some second and third-tier game developers, and some well-known game designers.

Compared to the designers from factions like TengHua and NetDragon who were at odds with each other, the relationships among ordinary game designers were relatively purer.

"I wonder who will win this year's Best Game of the Year award!"

"I feel like NetDragon's 'Star God' has a better chance."

"Not necessarily, TengHua's 'City of Sin' also performed quite well!"

"Speaking of which, is no one going to mention Dark Souls? I think Dark Souls is definitely top-tier."

"Ahem, I haven't researched it deeply enough to discuss."

"Exactly, I haven't even cleared Irithyll Dungeon yet."

"While excellent, I still feel the platform is too disadvantageous. If Dark Souls were VR, I'd consider it a strong favorite to win, but the PC platform is still too disadvantaged compared to VR, especially in these kinds of award selections."

"Yeah, sigh... Is that Chen Xu?"

"It looks like it, it really is!"

"Come on, let's go say hello together."

In a corner of the convention hall.

A group of independent game designers and game designers from second and third-tier developers, who knew each other, were gathered, discussing the event.

Several of them were game designers Chen Xu had met briefly at the previous gameplay Expo hosted by the Game Department.

Later, Chen Xu also joined one of their designer exchange and discussion groups.

However, only a few people were invited to participate this time.

As soon as Chen Xu entered the venue, before he had a chance to observe the situation, he heard someone call out to him from behind.

He turned his head and saw that they were all acquaintances.

"Everyone's here?" Chen Xu said, smiling and greeting the group.

"Fortunately invited, just here to gain some experience," one of them said with a smile.

"Mr. Chen, your Dark Souls this year truly taught the industry designers a lesson!"

"Look at you, saying that! Didn't Mr. Chen teach a lesson last year? How many people's jaws dropped with Undertale?"

The group entered commercial mutual flattery mode.

"Alright, alright, let's find a spot to talk, don't block the way," Chen Xu said, amused, looking at the crowd.

The group walked further inside, chatting as they went.

After finding a place, they continued chatting. Along the way, some other game designers noticed Chen Xu and specifically came over to exchange contact information and greet him to get acquainted.

Time quickly moved into the evening.

It was also the highlight of this event.

Media outlets from various corners of the gaming industry were basically all present, conducting simultaneous live broadcasts.

In the live stream room's bullet comments, many players waiting in front of their computers were discussing animatedly.

'Why hasn't it started yet!?'

'I feel like the Game Department has made much bigger moves in recent years compared to before!'

'Game of the Year, 'Star God'! I cast my vote!'

'You're overthinking it, 'City of Sin' is not to be trifled with!'

'I wonder if Dark Souls has a chance to win an award.'

'Stop rambling so much! By the way, where's Mr. Chen? I don't see him!'

'+1, I need to properly remember what Mr. Chen looks like. Dark Souls tormented me terribly!'

Various players in the live stream room were joking around.

Meanwhile, at the venue, Chen Xu and a host of other game designers entered one after another.

"Mr. Chen, what a coincidence!"

The seats at the venue were all pre-assigned.

The game designers in the front row were basically all those who had been nominated.

Chen Xu found his seat, and a familiar voice came from beside him.

"Teacher Meng, we meet again," Chen Xu said, memories instantly surfacing when he saw the other person's face.

After all, he still remembered the person's enthusiastic demeanor at the previous gameplay Expo.

"Indeed!" Meng Zuo said with a smile, but at this moment, he felt a little flustered involuntarily.

Because every time he met Chen Xu, it seemed like a tiny bit of the unexpected always happened!

Meng Zuo wasn't given much time to ponder.

As all the game designers entered, the entire awards ceremony event began.

Like yesterday, the rest was produced in the evening.
