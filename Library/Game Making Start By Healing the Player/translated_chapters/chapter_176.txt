Chapter 175: The Qualities a Conscientious Designer Should Possess (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Days passed, and the online buzz surrounding the game 'Hammer Swing Ascension' had subsided.

Unlike the previous 'It Takes Two' and 'Dark Souls,' this simple game didn't possess much depth.

The main points of discussion weren't actually about the game's content itself, but rather the various breakdowns players experienced after playing it.

It could be said to be a fleeting trend.

However, despite its fleeting popularity, it attracted countless independent game designers, who rushed to emulate it.

After all, the popularity at that time was truly astounding.

Moreover, games of this type aren't inherently high in cost.

But none of this concerned Chen Xu anymore.

At this moment, Chen Xu was in the research lab of Galaxy Smart Tech.

“The AI technology has achieved some results?” Chen Xu listened to the researcher's report, a little surprised.

Chen Xu subtly glanced at the system's UI interface.

The countdown on the golden item's progress bar he had used earlier was still running.

There are already results?

Like playing a game while it downloads, is there an incomplete version halfway through?

“Yes, Mr. Chen,” Zhong Yue explained to Chen Xu, “based on big data collection and its application in the gaming field, we have made some optimizations and improvements…”

Although Chen Xu didn't understand many of the technical terms, he grasped the general meaning of Zhong Yue's explanation.

That is, for AI technology applied in the gaming field, they have successfully applied for patent copyrights in various countries around the world, achieving significant breakthroughs in this area. However, it's still some distance from true perfect performance, and they need more time for testing and optimization.

But currently, an embryonic form has been created, and it can already be commercialized.

“Let me take a look.”

Chen Xu followed Zhong Yue to the laboratory, where tests were being conducted on a large screen.

The subject of the test was an internal DEMO of the in-development 'Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame,' primarily used for various numerical tests.

Since it was a test version, many monsters would randomly appear.

For example, Gundyr the Ash had run off into the ancient Northern Undead Asylum.

After debugging by Zhong Yue and the surrounding staff, Chen Xu quickly saw a practical demonstration.

In an empty courtyard, code was directly entered to summon Gundyr the Ash and place him in the center, followed by a regular Hollow wielding a short sword.

However, for the Hollow, new actions like rolling and running were added.

Gundyr the Ash still used his original AI behavior, while the Hollow utilized the AI with the new technology.

The official demonstration then began, and Chen Xu watched as the in-game Hollow, after gaining rolling and running actions, moved like a battle-hardened Undead.

It rolled to evade, stabbed from behind, and performed a flawless combo slash during Gundyr the Ash's attack intervals.

Gundyr the Ash's health plummeted. Unlike the fragile Undead who could only take two hits, the Hollow before him could only take one.

Yet, from start to finish, Gundyr the Ash didn't land a single hit on it. Like a precise robot, it perfectly dodged all of Gundyr the Ash's attacks.

The only thing was that it didn't have a shield. Otherwise, Chen Xu had no doubt that with the appropriate actions added, this fellow could perfectly parry and execute Gudako.

“If this AI is implemented in the game, I feel players won't be able to Link the Fire,” Chen Xu said after a moment of silence, looking at the AI's performance.

The original 'Dark Souls' was a memorization game, as BOSS attacks were predictable.

But with this AI, although the monsters' stats haven't changed, the key is that they've become more intelligent.

Not only would players need a proficient understanding of monster skills, but also on-the-spot reactions. Coupled with the monsters' extremely high attack and low-tolerance for errors in 'Dark Souls,' how could anyone Link the Fire?

“Ahem, Mr. Chen, this is an advanced mode,” Zhong Yue explained from the side. “In reality, our optimization direction is more about the AI's performance in the game, and the difficulty can also be reduced.”

“Alright, continue debugging it. Also, regarding the new AI technology, we can first incorporate it into special game modes for some trials,” Chen Xu said after some thought.

It certainly couldn't be added directly to the game. However, once the 'Dark Souls' prequel is developed, a completely new mode could be created based on this AI technology.

After all, Chen Xu had previously introduced a random mode in the predecessor. The new game shouldn't show favoritism, should it?

The random mode from the previous game would definitely still be included.

But later, a brand new 'Punishing Difficulty Mode!' could also be added.

In his previous life, Dark Souls 1 also had a version called the 'Prepare to Die Edition'.

However, that version was essentially just a Game of the Year edition.

The 'Prepare to Die Edition' was merely a name, adding some content and patch fixes.

Therefore, Chen Xu also planned to give players an even greater surprise.

High Lord Wolnir, having idled for too long, had become frail and was no match for the summoned skeleton mobs.

Artorias was corrupted by the Abyss, lost his Greatshield, and his arm rotted—how could that be allowed?

The legendary Lord Gwyn, after Linking the Fire once, was burned down to just a husk. With parrying learned, he was comparable to one of the weakest BOSSes, and he even forgot his signature Sunlight Spear. Does that seem right?

And many BOSSes, when players faced them, were far from their peak combat prowess.

How could this be acceptable?

If players couldn't defeat these powerful enemies in their prime, how much regret would they have?

Even though players now held a slight bias against his 'love'.

But as a conscientious designer who constantly cared about players' most perfect gaming experience, he absolutely could not tolerate players having such regrets.

Of course, if this new mode were to be released, it would also need to come out some time after the game's official launch.

………………

Returning from Galaxy Smart Tech, Chen Xu reviewed the development progress of 'Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame'.

With the combat system of the predecessor already perfected, other parts weren't particularly difficult.

Moreover, most of the scenes were almost complete.

Regarding the map, Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, and Yang Xin were all amazed.

It was a massive seamless map, yet the players' game progression was perfectly compartmentalized.

Maps of different scenes were interconnected, and players needed to explore to discover their ingenious design.

In the game, players still maintained the good experience of the predecessor, finding themselves saying: 'Hey, I'm back again!'

So, they tried another path, only to exclaim: 'Oh no! I'm back here again!'

After all, it's well-known that Undead cannot climb walls, open doors, or jump.

However, as ingenious as the map was, what truly sent shivers down Qin Yi's spine was the monster distribution after the map's completion.

“Mr. Chen, this Firelink Shrine still connects to late-game areas! Shouldn't we leave a message or put a lock on it?” Qin Yi said, feeling a chill run down his spine as he looked at the various monsters he had placed according to Chen Xu's instructions.

Forget about the high-level maps next to Firelink Shrine; even the Undead Settlement outside the newbie village was hard to describe!

“No need. You say that as if players would listen to in-game messages. And locking it? How could we lock it?”

“Not to mention, the game's plot is arranged this way. And if we lock it, what does that signify? It means teaching players how to play the game! Stripping them of their freedom of choice!”

“As a designer with a great conscience and sense of responsibility, how could I possibly do such a thing?”

Chen Xu spoke righteously, watching Qin Yi from his chair while sipping tea.

Qin Yi silently glanced at the development content on the monitor, and after a long while, couldn't utter a single word.

Because, it actually made so much sense!

First two chapters, then two more before evening. The rest will continue tonight.
