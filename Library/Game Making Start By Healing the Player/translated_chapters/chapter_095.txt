### Chapter 95: If Players Can't Have an Immersive Experience, Is He Still Human?

For now, let's set aside the story background.

From a gameplay perspective alone, whether it's numerical attribute allocation, equipment, or combat system elements like rolling, parrying, and backstabs, these are generally not new concepts in other ACT and RPG games. However, the biggest characteristic of Dark Souls is its perfect fusion of these existing elements with map level design and boss creation, forming a distinct level-driven game. Everything serves to drive players to advance through levels, defeat powerful enemies, and gain a sense of accomplishment and pride.

Combined with the Memory Capsule, the entire concept draft took Chen Xu over a full day. And it wasn't even a complete concept draft. It only briefly touched upon the game's core elements, with no mention of broader content, including detailed plot. After all, it was just a preliminary draft, and some detailed content needed to be refined before proceeding.

Everyone in the meeting room had arrived early, discussing softly in their seats. However, as Chen Xu pushed the door open and entered, everyone immediately quieted down.

"I believe everyone generally has a guess about today's meeting content. That's right, it's about a new game." "Without further ado, let me first introduce the game project. The theme is a Western fantasy story." "In terms of art style, it's quite different from the games we've made so far." "The overall aesthetic is based on deep, dark, realistic art, with the initial impression of the entire game rooted in Western European architecture. The game will also feature different areas like Farron Keep, Undead Burg, Irithyll of the Boreal Valley, etc., encompassing various cultural elements such as Baroque-style architecture and Romanesque cathedrals."

Chen Xu's hands were pressed on the table, while the projection screen behind him displayed various concept art pieces he had hand-drawn. If the story of Dark Souls was the skeleton and the gameplay the soul, then the game's art presentation was clearly its skin. This was also the first thing players would encounter, which is why Chen Xu made the CGI so exquisite and released it at the exhibition.

Classic Western European architecture, coupled with a darker art style, and medieval-like melee weapon armor and weapon designs. Clearly, the art style revealed by Dark Souls at the exhibition had already struck a chord with players.

Next, Chen Xu described some of the systems in Dark Souls. For example, the combat system. Aside from invincible rolling, parrying, backstabs, and durability, these settings are already present in most ACT games. Everyone was not unfamiliar with them; they basically had a concept in their minds, and only minor adjustments and changes to the actions would be needed later.

In addition, there will be some special settings. For example, various different weapons will have their unique weapon arts.

At the same time, unlike his previous life, the technological capabilities of the Parallel World would allow Chen Xu to make the game's visual expressiveness even better. Of course, this wasn't the main core, but rather an experience in details.

"Furthermore, our main work in the early stage will focus on the output of art assets. And for you, Qin Yi, I need to make the game's actions more outstanding." Chen Xu said, looking at Qin Yi.

Hearing Chen Xu's words, Qin Yi and the others nodded. Although Dark Souls is not an ACT type game, but rather a level-driven game, this doesn't mean that action elements are unimportant in the game. On the contrary, action elements are also a core point in the Dark Souls experience.

Or rather, any game involving action has very stringent requirements for its effects. To be more direct about action feedback, it refers to the so-called sense of impact and fluidity.

For instance, in his previous life, the famous Elder Scrolls V, its sense of impact was basically equivalent to swinging at air. As an ARPG game, while it didn't hinder its excellence, in terms of combat experience, it really wasn't great, even becoming a deterrent for some players.

The most common way to create a sense of impact, besides sound effects, is the so-called freeze-frame impact. To put it simply, if a weapon takes 60 frames from its attack to its recovery when hitting a monster, then upon impact, it will pause for a few frames, creating the sensation of a blade sinking into flesh. This is the so-called sense of impact.

For example, Monster Hunter, God of War, and Street Fighter from his previous life were among the best in this regard. But for Dark Souls, creating an appropriate sense of impact, rather than just swinging at air, would require debugging various parameters.

Freeze-frame impact isn't suitable for all games. For example, the fluid rhythm of Ninja Gaiden cutting tofu from his previous life, and the combo sequences of the Devil May Cry series, are basically not suited for the application of freeze-frame impact. These all require continuous modification by the team; if Chen Xu had to do everything himself, it would be a bit unrealistic. And he certainly wouldn't say he wouldn't develop action-oriented games in the future. So, the team still needed to constantly try to optimize. Chen Xu already had this intention when developing Outlast. At the same time, during the two months of developing Fall Guys and Sanguosha, Qin Yi and his team's main work was also continuously optimizing action feedback. The results so far could be considered acceptable, but there's still considerable room for improvement.

As for other game content, it would be relatively straightforward, mainly producing art assets through outsourcing. For example, in terms of map level design, the various areas of Dark Souls are interconnected, which is quite complex. This is because it's a standard interconnected design.

For instance, a player in Area A goes to Area B, then discovers a small path in Area B that leads back to Area A. Finally, after going to Area C, they find another small path that also leads back to Area A. This is actually a standard Metroidvania-style map design technique. However, in Dark Souls, it transforms from a 2D side-scroller into a true 3D mode. It includes some puzzle-solving and exploration content, which is a unique feature of Dark Souls.

In his previous life, Dark Souls 3 displeased many veteran players who had played Dark Souls 1, believing that DS3 was not as good as DS1, mainly due to the changes in map design. As for new players, this design could be considered a kindness.

Even so, listening to Chen Xu explain the detailed game content, Ruan Ningxue, who was in charge of map levels, still looked bewildered. "The game won't have a mini-map design?" Ruan Ningxue asked, bewildered, noticing a core point Chen Xu mentioned.

"Exactly. This way, players can truly feel the charm of the in-game maps. Why do more and more games minimize their UI, or even strive to eliminate UI from the game?" "It's all to increase players' sense of immersion. Think about the background of Dark Souls; it's a world of despair. The absence of a mini-map design is intended to intensify this sense of immersion for players, and the interconnected map design also allows players to feel the surprise of discovery," Chen Xu explained with a smile.

Without mini-map guidance, this is also a major characteristic of Souls-like games. Even though the later Elden Ring has a map system, players still have to manually collect map fragments, just like in Hollow Knight. It can be said to be a quite classic design.

As for getting lost? Die a few times, run back and forth, and you'll get to know it, won't you? This is all for the players! If players spend money on a game, and you don't think about how to make them feel more immersive, is he still human?
