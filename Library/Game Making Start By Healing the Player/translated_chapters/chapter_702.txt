Chapter 701: Hesitation Is Defeat (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

It was still that same field of white reeds.

Isshin Ashina was dead, and Ashina Country was under full invasion.

General Gyoubu, who guarded the gate; the Red Ogre, who used Regenerative Water to block enemies; the Blazing Bull, deployed to ravage the battlefield; and the Tengu and Lone Shadow members – most had already been dismantled by the 'Wolf', known as the Sword Saint.

In this final desperation, Genichiro would stop at nothing to protect Ashina Country.

The Iai Swordsman of the Ashina style below Ashina Castle, when he went again during the full invasion of the Interior Ministry, had already used the Red Gourd to become a Red-Eyed Iai Swordsman.

But even after committing everything, there was still no way to resist the powerful enemy.

At this moment, Genichiro Ashina had only one path left: to rely on the Power of the Dragon's Heritage.

By the time Wolf arrived, Kuro was already severely wounded.

‘It’s been a while... Shinobi.’

‘Look, the other Mortal Blade.’

Genichiro, holding a Mortal Blade, spoke to Wolf.

This was his last resort to save Ashina, to use the Mortal Blade to obtain Kuro’s Dragon’s Heritage power.

Zhang Yi wasn’t too surprised by Genichiro’s words.

Because in the previous game’s story, he had already received a lot of information.

There were two Mortal Blades in total: one named Mortal Blade: Gates, the blade for the sacrificial ritual.

The other named Mortal Blade: Severance, the blade for the ritual of taking the Sakura Dragon’s Tear.

And according to the notes of Takeru and Tomoe, it was known that Takeru and Tomoe had not obtained Mortal Blade: Severance back then; what they likely acquired was only Mortal Blade: Gates.

As for the beautiful witch seen when heading to the Sakura Dragon's former location, many players believed that person was Tomoe.

Because judging from the situation in the Dilapidated Temple, Tomoe might not have truly died back then, and Emma’s dialogue also confirmed this.

Coupled with Isshin’s earlier statement that Tomoe was a woman who fascinated him, this led many to subconsciously believe it.

However, Zhang Yi had a different view. Initially, he thought so too, but later, out of idleness, he explored further and found a prompt appearing upon interaction, stating that it was merely a sleeping witch.

“Sleeping” could mean either death or literal slumber, but Zhang Yi felt it should be the literal meaning.

Because he thought this witch was very likely the true empress of the Fountainhead Palace and the only person in the game to achieve eternal life.

And the price for eternal life was to forever guard the Sakura Dragon’s abode.

The prototype could reference Empress Kōgyoku/Saimei of the Asuka period, who once played the role of a witch to pray for rain, corresponding to the theocratic rule where the empress held power, combining spiritual and political authority.

This would also align with the lack of clues about a ruler in the Fountainhead Palace.

Of course, this was just a small conjecture of his, as there were many other uncertain points in the game besides these.

And this was the biggest feature of Souls-like games: their implicit/suggestive storytelling and worldview, making players feel that every point was possible, with no completely accurate answer.

However, these were issues for Souls scholars to discuss; at the moment, Zhang Yi had no inclination to delve into them.

Because at this very moment, his gaze was entirely fixed on Genichiro Ashina, his formidable opponent.

Right from the start, it was Genichiro Ashina (Way of Tomoe style), in his third phase.

Although earlier on Ashina Castle, the third phase Genichiro (Way of Tomoe style) was ridiculously easy to defeat when using his 'free lightning' (easy to reverse lightning attack).

But it had to be admitted, the offensive speed of the third phase Genichiro (Way of Tomoe style) was indeed much faster.

At the same time, the sweeping slash no longer had the ‘Perilous Attack’ kanji warning. If one wasn't careful and failed to notice, it was very easy to die suddenly.

Moreover, in the reed field, Zhang Yi discovered that Genichiro had also learned brand new moves.

Two consecutive slashes, followed by a circle of what seemed like sword aura, hit him for half his health if he didn't react quickly enough.

Fortunately, the rest of his techniques were largely no different from the Genichiro Ashina encountered previously in Ashina Castle.

“It’s just a pity, the current me is no longer the me from back then!”

Looking at his long health bar, and then at Genichiro (Way of Tomoe style) with only one health bar in front of him.

Zhang Yi revealed a highly confident smile.

Same scene, same characters.

But the difference was the growth in personal skill.

Sword clashes, parries, Mikiri Counters.

Two minutes later, relying on three gourds, Zhang Yi successfully filled Genichiro Ashina's posture bar.

“Die!” Zhang Yi shouted.

Wolf and Genichiro in the game crossed paths, blood dripping from Wolf’s body, but Genichiro Ashina paid it no mind, merely gazing at the distant Ashina Country burning in war, his face full of loneliness.

‘…In the end, I was still powerless.’

‘But... the Dragon’s Heritage can ensure this nation’s survival.’

Looking at the black Mortal Blade: Gates in his hand, Genichiro Ashina slowly raised the blade.

‘Thus... Ashina’s long night is about to break.’

The Mortal Blade rested on his shoulder, and with both hands, he forcefully cut his own neck, blood spurting from the wound.

Then, from the wound, a shriveled hand reached out, firmly gripping the Mortal Blade in Genichiro’s hand.

‘This is my poor grandson’s final wish... I must drag Ashina back from the Underworld.’

The Mortal Blade: one, Mortal Blade: Severance, takes the Sakura Dragon’s Tear; the other, Mortal Blade: Gates, sacrifices the Dragon’s Heritage and life to summon the deceased back from the Underworld.

Isshin Ashina, covered in blood, emerged from Genichiro's body.

‘Therefore... Wolf, I will kill you.’

‘Go, Wolf!’

The Sword Saint Isshin Ashina, once renowned across the land, had returned from the Underworld.

Looking at the Sword Saint before him, Zhang Yi felt a surge of excitement.

The final BOSS battles in Souls-like games, no matter which title, were always exhilarating.

The moonlight battle with Gehrman, the First Hunter in Bloodborne, the great war against the past Incarnations of the Lords of Cinder in Dark Souls, and the epic clash with Lord Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight, were all incredibly exciting.

And now in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, the opponent in the final battle was Isshin Ashina, who had made a name for himself in the Usurpation War of old.

Even when he was alive and extremely weak, he could still deter the Interior Ministry, who only dared to launch a full invasion after his death, demonstrating Isshin Ashina's immense power.

Now he could finally cross swords with this legendary Sword Saint.

He knew it would be tough, but Zhang Yi never imagined it would be *this* tough.

Unlike the previous Genichiro Ashina, the Sword Saint Isshin Ashina before him was undoubtedly the most powerful BOSS he had ever fought.

He felt the only one who could possibly stand against him was perhaps the Orphan of Kos from Bloodborne.

In Phase 1, the Sword Saint's movements were already incredibly swift; after creating distance, he would instantly close it with a brisk stride.

And in terms of moves, the Sword Saint's attacks were as refined as the wind and as swift as a rainbow.

Each move was simple and concise, with no unnecessary actions; dare to get greedy for a single hit, and you would definitely be cut down.

At the same time, compared to the previous Genichiro, the current Isshin Ashina had many subtle movements; after two consecutive slashes, he would sometimes quickly follow up with a thrust attack.

After creating distance, he would even use the Ashina style’s ultimate technique, the Ashina Cross, which was faster than the Red-Eyed Iai Swordsman in Ashina Castle, and could quickly close the distance, making it impossible to guard against.

Throughout the normal combat, although it was still the constant clang of steel, he spent 70% of the time defending, and his gourds were almost empty.

“This is just too damn strong, isn’t it?”

In the reed field, Zhang Yi controlled Wolf, constantly dodging, while Isshin Ashina, like a ghost, relentlessly pursued.

Before he could finish his sentence, a blade flashed.

Reeds scattered through the air under the blade's attack.

Wolf in the game collapsed weakly.

【DEATH!】

Having already died once, Zhang Yi looked at the red text before him, frustrated.

‘Hesitation will lead to defeat!’

At the same time, as if to remind him.

Isshin Ashina looked at Wolf’s corpse on the ground, lightly flicked his blade, and turned towards the burning Ashina Castle.
