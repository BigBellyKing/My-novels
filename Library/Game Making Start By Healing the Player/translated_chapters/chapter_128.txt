# Chapter 128: Should Be Abused, Still Gets Abused

Designers in the online gaming industry noticed a very strange phenomenon.

That is, the popularity of Dark Souls was growing steadily.

Discussions in player forums and communities, various videos on video platforms, and more and more streamers on live streaming platforms all had the words 'You Died' on their covers.

Innumerable new players entering the Dark Souls world also experienced the same mindset as veteran players.

Even those who watched Chen Xu's strategy videos were not spared from being thrashed.

Originally, after watching Chen Xu's videos, these players entered the game with a skeptical attitude.

But after giving it a try, they found, oh boy!

This shield-holding playstyle might be a bit cowardly, but it's really effective!

However, once they passed the Cemetery of Ash, Firelink Shrine, and High Wall of Lothric shown in the videos, and arrived at the unfamiliar Undead Settlement and Road of Sacrifices, they discovered that the experience was completely different!

In the High Wall of Lothric, where monsters were relatively dense, it was basically only the stretch of road under the Fire Dragon Bridge.

But as long as you lured the monsters onto the Fire Dragon Bridge, the still-alive Elder Dragon would breathe fire and help you take down those monsters indiscriminately.

The Lothric Knights in front of the Ice Dog's room could also be pulled one by one and dealt with.

The remaining numerous enemies were mostly ordinary Hollows.

But in the Undead Settlement, it was different.

New types of monsters appeared. Although you'd still only fight one or two at a time, the distance between them was very small. If you ran around carelessly, you'd quickly experience the 'hospitality' of the villagers.

In addition, there were still many hair-raising traps in the Undead Settlement.

When a player saw a collectible item glowing with a white light ahead.

They happily ran forward, ready to pick it up.

But little did they know, a monster carrying a large jar had been ambushed on a high platform for a long time.

Just as the player reached the item, a large jar suddenly dropped from the sky, instantly blacking out the player's screen.

It also gave players a refresher on how to spell 'You Died'.

Hidden on the rafters was an ambush attacker with a dagger, and in the dark corners were enemies with throwing knives providing ranged damage output.

Even the iron fences you thought were just holding corpses could be living monsters.

There was also the enthusiastic Fat Auntie, who would leave a deep impression on players who didn't want to work hard.

All these factors made players who hadn't suffered much in the High Wall of Lothric complain incessantly.

The treatment was completely different now!

"Damn it, this map design is too malicious! It's just like those Mimics before; there's actually someone ambushing next to it!"

"What the heck is this? Fat Auntie, get away! I'm still young, I want to strive!"

"Jar Guy, let's talk this out, put the jar down, okay, okay... Holy cow, where did you pull that Large Saw from!?"

"What's the deal with the rats in this sewer? Am I playing Outlast or Dark Souls?! And where did all these skeletons come from!"

"Positioning, rolling, little brother! I'm not panicking at all... Holy cow! What's happening? Where did that javelin come from?! It's like a damn missile!"

Numerous players who had passed the High Wall of Lothric using their shield-holding expertise and entered the Undead Settlement suddenly found the door to a new world wide open for them.

Their unfamiliarity with the monsters' attack patterns in the Undead Settlement, combined with their lack of knowledge about the various traps.

Instantly led them to experience that cruel death again.

Many players relied on the two unique skills of shield-holding and playing it safe to defeat Gundyr the Ash and take down the Ice Dog.

But after being led to the Undead Settlement with the token given by the old woman, the cold reality hit them like a large hammer.

And it was a large hammer made of metal, covered in spikes and scorched by flames.

The only comforting thing for players was that in the Undead Settlement, they were finally not alone.

Here, they experienced the joy of fighting alongside others for the first time.

A knight dressed in plump armor, resembling an Onion Knight.

After solving the elevator puzzle, they could talk to this adorable Onion Knight in the middle of the elevator shaft, and with his help, they defeated a seemingly terrifying Fire Demon.

With the Onion Knight drawing aggro, this battle was arguably the easiest many players had experienced.

The only pity was that, judging by its health bar, it was just an elite monster, not a BOSS.

After winning the battle, they learned the Onion Knight's name and received a cup of wine from him. They drank together with a shout of 'Praise the Sun!' and gained a new gesture.

But it stopped there.

The Onion Knight continued to sleep soundly where he was, while the players had to press on and suffer.

And as players progressed through the map, they discovered that each map was more malicious than the last!

The large crabs in the puddles of the Road of Sacrifices, and a Black Knight beneath a dilapidated temple.

Left countless players battered and bruised.

They originally thought this was the limit, but after passing through the Road of Sacrifices, they arrived at the deepest malice.

That was the renowned Farron Keep, and there, countless players truly broke down.

How to describe it?

It could only be said that it was the most memorable map for players.

A poison swamp like a cesspit, where movement was extremely slow, forcing players to use rolling instead.

And various grotesque monsters: giant-like creatures wielding large clubs, Head-Washing Guys that jumped on your head as if washing your hair, and Curse Frogs with wide eyes that made your SAN value drop rapidly—it was as disgusting as possible.

The most terrifying thing was that here, players also needed to extinguish bonfires to be able to fight the Lords of Cinder.

Many had endured Gundyr the Ash, survived the High Wall of Lothric, and gotten through the Undead Settlement and the Road of Sacrifices.

But in the malice of Farron Keep, they finally collapsed one after another.

"I can't take it anymore. Can any Big Bro help a kid out? I'm about to break down!"

"+1, can any master give me a map of the Farron Cesspit? I've already circled twice and I'm still missing one flame extinguishing point! Save me, please!"

"Ah! I feel like I'm about to die. This cesspit poison swamp is too disgusting, and the mobs are so strong!"

"+1 The Head-Washing Guys are too strong, they keep washing my head!"

"Don't even talk about it! That monster on the wall, like a giant holding a tree root, pinned me down like feces with a Plunger. I cried!"

"And the Curse Frogs, even if they're not strong, isn't their appearance just too disgusting?!"

Numerous players complained incessantly, of course, there were also those gloating over others' misfortune.

"Haha, you guys can suffer slowly! I have one last flame to extinguish, and then I can go fight the Lords of Cinder! I'm leaving this cesspit soon!"

"Reporting back to all Undead: I have successfully met the Lord of Cinder in Farron Keep, the Farron Undead Legion from the promotional video; his greatsword with sparks, fighting like he's street dancing, is so handsome and dashing. I've been captivated by his charm, so I've decided to spend more time with him."

"Damn, if you can't beat him, you can't beat him. Why say it so tactfully!"
