Chapter 120: Chopping Melons and Vegetables

Inside the entire Firelink Shrine, Zhang Yi currently only saw three people. A mysterious blindfolded girl by an extinguished bonfire in the shrine. A small old man sitting on a throne, and a man with a sword and shield on his back, squatting on a stone step nearby.

Naturally, Zhang Yi immediately went to talk to the girl in the middle first. It wasn't because she was a female NPC, nor was it because she had an excellent figure that one could imagine even with the blindfold. It was simply because this NPC had appeared in the promotional trailer, nothing more!

‘Welcome to the bonfire, Ashen One. I am the Fire Keeper, dedicated to tending this bonfire and serving you. If you require assistance in finding the kings who have abandoned their thrones, please command me freely.’

Her words were quite alluring, but after seeing the interface once the dialogue ended, Zhang Yi basically understood. This thing was just a stat-boosting NPC that allowed players to level up and allocate points.

After a simple conversation, killing Gundyr the Ash earlier had given him a total of 3000 souls, adding to the souls he obtained from killing mobs along the way. He could level up three times. Zhang Yi thought for a moment and put all the points into health. Although the stamina bar was also very important, he felt that health was still very crucial in the early game, at least to provide a bit more room for error.

After browsing around the Firelink Shrine for a bit, Zhang Yi's attention was drawn to the small old man sitting on the throne. After conversing with him, he learned that his name was Ludleth, and he was, surprisingly, a Lord of Cinder. The empty thrones beside him were all the former Lords of Cinder's thrones. Furthermore, through the dialogue, he also discovered an important clue: for the flame to persist, the Lords of Cinder must burn themselves.

“No wonder the other four thrones are empty; these Lords of Cinder really do burn themselves as kindling!” Zhang Yi couldn't help but exclaim.

At the same time, he also had a rough understanding of the game’s main storyline. According to the keywords given in the previous promotional trailer, the protagonist was an unburnable trash – no, an Ashen One! The world was nearing its end, plunging into darkness. To continue, the flame needed to be kindled, and the Lords of Cinder had to serve as kindling; that was their destiny. But clearly, no one wanted to be kindling, so the Lords of Cinder all fled. Only Ludleth, the small old man, was sitting there, burning for some unknown reason. The protagonist's mission was to drag the remaining four pieces of kindling back here to continue the burning. This was the Dark Souls plot that Zhang Yi understood so far. As for any twists later on, Zhang Yi was currently unaware.

Next, at a turn in the staircase, he spoke to the man with a sword and armor on his back, sitting there with his head down. ‘…Oh, you’re one of those who can’t die, too?’ ‘You and I are the same kind, Ashen One. Good for nothing, and even too incompetent to die.’ ‘…How laughable, a bunch of undying nobodies trying to find the Lords of Cinder, and even wanting to drag them back to their dusty thrones?’ ‘Those people are esteemed heroes who Link the Fire! How could failures like us ever achieve that?’ ‘You think so too, don’t you?’

[Gesture: Dejection] After the conversation, Zhang Yi also learned a new gesture of dejection. But what was with all this negative energy? Was the purpose of this NPC to spread disheartening negative messages?

He walked around the shrine a few more times, finding a blacksmith for forging and an old woman selling items. The blacksmith could reinforce weapons and attune Estus Flasks. Zhang Yi directly swapped the Focus-enhancing charges (which fill the FP bar) for health-restoring Fruit Pulp Orange Juice, turning his original three bottles of Fruit Pulp Orange Juice into four.

As for weapons, two Titanite Shards were required, but Zhang Yi currently only had one, so he couldn't reinforce anything yet. There seemed to be a path on the rooftop, but unfortunately, the door was locked, and he didn't have the key.

However, outside the shrine, besides the motionless Hollows sitting on the ground, Zhang Yi also discovered a small path. But at the entrance, there was a ragged NPC holding an Uchigatana.

“What a cool Uchigatana! I wonder if killing this monster will drop its weapon? Is this one of those monsters that gives you weapons? After all, it's not like the game would make you conquer the world with just this Knight's Sword, right?” Wang Han reminded him from beside.

Although he had picked up a broken straight sword on a small path in the shrine earlier, its stats made it even worse than the Small Club held by the Deprived.

“You know what, that's highly possible!” Zhang Yi wasn't just tempted; he acted. In most ARPG games, the starting equipment players carry is usually replaced by items obtained after defeating a BOSS once they leave the newbie village. Killing Gundyr the Ash earlier gave him a Coiled Sword, but that was an item, essentially a warp point. This Uchigatana Guy, tucked away in the corner, was clearly an NPC that might drop equipment. Or perhaps the small room he guarded contained new equipment for players.

Looking at the Uchigatana Guy in front of him, Zhang Yi bravely charged forward.

‘Ugh!’ A painful wail from the game character ‘aaa’ came through his headphones. Under an Iai three-hit combo, his health bar was like tofu. One-shot kill!

“How is this guy even stronger than Gundyr the Ash!” Zhang Yi was utterly stunned. He was a Knight now, for crying out loud! He was wearing armor! Although Gundyr also took three or four hits to cut him down, Gundyr's movements were relatively sluggish. Even if he kept rolling, he would at most take one hit. But this Uchigatana Guy in front of him unleashed an Iai combo slash that cleared his health bar before he could even react.

Watching his character revive at the newly lit bonfire in Firelink Shrine, Zhang Yi remained silent.

After a brief silence, Wang Han said, “Let’s just push through the story. This monster might be an elite monster like the Crystal Lizard, the kind that’s very hard to beat. The main storyline later on might be chopping melons and vegetables.”

Is that really the case? If he hadn't been ‘schooled’ by the Crystal Lizard and the Uchigatana Guy, Zhang Yi would certainly have been confident and full of belief. But now? He was somewhat half-believing, half-doubting.

Through the bonfire at Firelink Shrine, Zhang Yi teleported to the next story area: High Wall of Lothric.

Pushing open the grand doors, the sight of Lothric made Zhang Yi and Wang Han, who sat beside him, sigh with emotion. They had already seen the concept art and the previous promotional conference. But actually controlling the character and witnessing it firsthand was a completely different experience.

In the distant, hazy gray mist, the magnificent capital city was faintly visible. It was incredibly grand. However, after a brief moment of awe, Zhang Yi's heart began to pound a little. Because, up until now, he hadn't found any so-called map. Could it be that this game simply had no map system?

Lighting the bonfire at the entrance with some trepidation, Zhang Yi began to explore the High Wall of Lothric.
