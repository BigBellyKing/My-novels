Chapter 703: Not of the Same Family, Don't Enter the Same Door! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

“Is it that everyone in Ashina likes to pull this kind of stunt?!”

Zhang Yi felt his mentality was crumbling a bit. He originally thought he had fully embraced being a despicable ninja in the game. When he first started playing, he would douse enemies with oil and set them on fire, or scare them with firecrackers – it was all done in one go. He would cheese any fight he could. But now, he had to admit defeat. He never expected the legendary Sword Saint Isshin Ashina to have a move where he pulled out a submachine gun.

Looking at the familiar blood-red 'Death' character on the screen, Zhang Yi was speechless.

“Hesitation is defeat? Who hesitated? I just genuinely couldn't react in time, my hand speed couldn't keep up! And seriously, you're using a flintlock? Is that reasonable? Is that reasonable for someone called a Sword Saint?”

During his charge, after Isshin Ashina's greatscythe swept horizontally, he directly pulled out a flintlock from his pocket. That rapid fire attack utterly shredded Zhang Yi.

Moreover, this action was incredibly subtle. The battlefield was surrounded by waist-high white reeds. Coupled with Isshin Ashina's attire and his greatscythe – which was bigger than two people and Zhang Yi seriously suspected came over from Monster Hunter for a cameo – all these factors combined meant that on a first encounter, Isshin Ashina's subtle moves were extremely hidden. By the time you noticed them, it was already too late to react.

Now he understood where Genichiro learned his backflip rapid fire 'hair wash' from.

And judging by Isshin Ashina's performance in the promotional video, this renowned Sword Saint actually had a history of 'dirty' tricks. When he fought against enemy generals, he would stab his sword into their insteps, emphasizing deviousness.

Now, at his peak, Isshin Ashina had perfected this to its ultimate degree.

At this moment, Zhang Yi also thought of Genichiro Ashina's nickname among players, Scumichiro. Honestly, it's not the players' fault. Look at your grandfather, Isshin Ashina. How old is he, and he's still keeping up with the times, using firearms, with moves so hidden and swift.

And you, Genichiro Ashina? No wonder you're adopted and not his biological offspring. Even at this point, you, Genichiro Ashina, are still clinging to past glories, using a bow and arrow. And using a melee weapon is one thing, but you also do a backflip rapid fire, as if afraid others wouldn't know you're shooting arrows. Your moves are flashier and gaudier one after another.

Then there's Owl, the mastermind behind the scenes. Though his brilliance was completely overshadowed by Isshin Ashina – which also became one of the main reasons for Owl's later rebellion – his tactics in old age were still extraordinary. Poison, gunpowder, hidden weapons, smoke bombs – he played dirtier than anyone, and his moves were even more subtle. One careless mistake and you could fall into his trap. On the surface, he'd be joking around with you, but secretly, shurikens would already be in his hand. In his second phase, the Elder Father could even bring himself to beg for mercy on his knees from Wolf, trying to break Wolf's vigilance.

But what about you, Genichiro Ashina? You were just busy showing off. In the reed field back then, you ambushed Wolf even after you were beaten. And after the sneak attack, you still had to show off by saying not to blame you for being despicable.

Now, compared to these Ashina old veterans, you, Genichiro, are indeed just a pushover. Not only is your technology several streets behind, but you can't even see the taillights of these Ashina veterans in terms of tactics. How can you possibly protect Ashina Castle?

No wonder Isshin Ashina let Tomoe teach you the Way of Tomoe instead of Ashina's secret techniques, while he took Emma as a disciple and taught her the Ashina style.

While grumbling, Zhang Yi once again started a new round of his normal routine.

First, he would utterly defeat Tomoe's Genichiro, and then be violently abused by his grandfather, Isshin Ashina.

He finally managed to get the Sword Saint into his second form, but his Healing Gourds were almost depleted. With five consecutive gunshots and a Dragon Flash from the greatscythe, Zhang Yi died once more.

That familiar 'Hesitation is defeat' echoed in his ears.

“I feel like the hardest part of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is that you can't call upon friends for help,” Zhang Yi finally sighed with emotion.

This was, in fact, a common sentiment among many players. When playing Dark Souls and Bloodborne, you could play online. The junk that veteran players didn't need was practically a speedrunning artifact for new players in their first playthrough. And even without a veteran to guide them, grinding for more Blood Echoes and souls, or looking up strategy guides to find some explosively damaging weapons for a first playthrough, made it quite easy to play with various strategies.

But it was different in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. From beginning to end, you used Kusabimaru. Even though you learned a ton of flashy ninjutsu and various Prosthetic Tools, in actual combat, besides being useful against specific enemies, later on, it mostly came down to one Kusabimaru and a sake gourd.

As for Prayer Beads and Combat Memory, those were forms of growth you could only obtain after defeating a BOSS.

Combining these reasons, many players felt that Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice was more difficult than Bloodborne and Dark Souls.

Many players, like Zhang Yi, defeated the Guardian Ape, Owl, and the Corrupted Monk, but then hit a wall directly at the Sword Saint.

If the earlier Genichiro Ashina was a midterm exam designed to cure cheese-playing, making players realize that cheesing had no future – for every class you skipped, you'd fail that many subjects – then the Sword Saint was the final exam. Everything you had learned would face its ultimate test.

Mikiri Counter, dodge steps, evades, plus Isshin Ashina's flexible moves. Towards the end, players had to rely not just on reaction, but more importantly, on muscle memory.

However, despite suffering greatly, by this point, players had basically fully adapted to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. The battle with the Sword Saint, despite the suffering, became even more passionate and exciting, especially when the Sword Saint entered his second phase.

Holding a Jumonji Yari in his left hand and the Mortal Blade 'opening' in his right, he was like a demon of the battlefield. His storm-like offensive, combined with Isshin Ashina's dialogue during the fight, allowed players to fully feel the charisma of this man, Isshin Ashina.

Though he verbally called Isshin utterly devious, Zhang Yi could clearly sense Isshin Ashina's heart of a martial arts fanatic. This was a man who, single-mindedly seeking to become stronger, fought ceaselessly, giving his all with every slash.

Time and again he died, time and again he challenged. There was no sense of frustration, only a high fighting spirit. With increasingly practiced parries, Mikiri Counters, and dodge steps, his Kusabimaru finally pierced Isshin's body.

Phase three began!

But with Isshin's loud shout, after he entered the third phase, Zhang Yi blinked.

Because what did he see?

Golden lightning struck the white reeds from the sky. Coupled with the stirring background music, the atmosphere was absolutely explosive.

But the crucial point was: why were you, Isshin, also using Free Lightning now!?

Is it true that birds of a feather flock together? Your grandson, Genichiro, turned into Free Genichiro in his third phase, and now it's your turn to become Free Isshin?

While the essence of the Ashina style is to learn anything if it leads to victory, why did you have to learn Free Lightning of all things? Just think about the colossal Divine Dragon; every BOSS in this game involving Tomoe's Lightning is just Free Lightning!
