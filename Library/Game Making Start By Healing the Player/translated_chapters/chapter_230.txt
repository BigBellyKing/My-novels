Chapter 229: First Episode: Major Historical Events of Minecraft (Seventh Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

It wasn't just gaming industry designers who were shocked by the sales of Minecraft online.

Players were equally surprised. Unbeknownst to them, tens of millions worldwide were now playing Minecraft?

However, this was quickly replaced by a sense of pride. How wonderful it was that so many people were playing their favorite game!

Of course, this feeling was fleeting. After all, for players, more players are just more players; a moment of excitement and pride is enough. What else could you want from them?

Compared to how many copies the game sold, players were clearly more concerned with the actual content of the game.

Initially, the videos with the highest like rates online were mostly of incredible structures built by Master Builders.

While initially awe-inspiring, with exclamations of 'Others' World,' players eventually got used to the feeling of being overwhelmed. Anyway, they'd just watch these creations, then head to the Workshop to download one and experience the thrill for themselves.

But soon, the creations of some Redstone Masters left many players utterly baffled. All sorts of Redstone music, and Redstone mechanisms. Some masters even used sticky pistons and other mechanism components to build a fully functional mech. Instantly, many players were stunned. At least they could understand the previous builds, but this Redstone stuff was completely incomprehensible!

But that was precisely the point – not understanding it. If they understood it, it wouldn't feel so awesome!

And so, on this day, as many players were preparing to check the official Weibo account or video platforms for new content.

An official Weibo post quickly went viral, and a video was instantly propelled to the top of the view count charts across major video platforms.

The video's title was simple: 'First Episode: Major Historical Events of Minecraft'.

Many players were taken aback upon seeing this video, but when they realized the publisher was Nebula Games' official Weibo account, they instantly became excited.

Clicking on the video, the progress bar stretched for nearly an hour.

The visuals weren't particularly special; it was basically in-game footage from Minecraft, and unrendered at that.

But what truly captivated players was the content revealed within the game.

> "January 3rd: Minecraft launched its Early Access mode online. On that day, 969,231 players entered this peculiar block world."

> "Among them, a player with the ID `ewwqr` was the first to break a block!"

> "Night fell, and dangerous creatures like zombies and skeletons appeared one after another. How would the defenseless Steve resolve the immediate crisis? A player with the ID `Master Builder` became the first to perform the 'dig-three-fill-one' technique."

> "After spending a difficult night in a warm bed, a player with the ID `Nǐ Shuō Má Ne (What are you saying?)` became the first player to spend the night in a bed instead of a cave."



> "………………"

> "February 1st: Minecraft officially launched. On that day, the player count surpassed 3 million. As of now, over 37 million players have entered Minecraft."

> "The average number of blocks destroyed per player is 418,941, and the average number of blocks built per player is 231,236. The player ID who destroyed the most blocks is `Explosion Is Art`, with a total of 2,820,910 blocks, while the player ID who built the most blocks is `Sandwich Candy`, with a total of 892,031 blocks."

> "Redstone technology, a unique and magically powerful system in Minecraft. A player with the ID `Dad, I Want To Be A Scientist` became the first to complete a minecart with rails using Redstone technology, and also the first to compose Redstone music using music boxes."

> "February 5th: The first player-made MOD, `duplex villa`, was uploaded to the Workshop. Its creator's ID is `Construction Master`."

> "February 19th: The first player-made mini-game MOD, `Tank Battle Against Evil Monsters`, was uploaded to the Workshop, achieving 2 million downloads on the same day. Its creator's ID is `Do You Believe In Light?`"



> "………………"

> "Next, we present memorable moments from various servers."

> "War has never ceased from ancient times to modern days; where there are people, there is conflict. The first server to spark PVP war was Server No. 17."

> "To date, over 6 million players have participated in battles, and buildings in the game have been destroyed a staggering 31 million times."

> "Among them, players on Server No. 1611 are the most fervent warmongers. To date, the average death count for players on this server is 121, temporarily ranking the highest, and currently, the player factions on this server are in a state of 'Three Kingdoms' rivalry."

> "Players on Server No. 1211 are also a group of warmongers; countless players have been engaged in chaotic battles since the server launched. However, unlike Server No. 1611, Server No. 1211 is currently in a 'Warring States' period, with various guilds fighting independently."

> "On Server No. 2147, war also exists, but a portion of players remain outside the conflict. They established the `Merchant Alliance` to farm, raise livestock, and construct buildings for major factions, trading resources like gold, Redstone, diamonds, and coal."

> "Also on Server No. 2147, while the warring guilds were completely unaware, the `Merchant Alliance`'s technology developed rapidly with their resource supply. While the major warring guilds were still fighting with iron swords, iron armor, and bows and arrows, the `Merchant Alliance` had successfully developed the game's first firearm weapon. Still amidst the chaos of the warring guilds, the `Merchant Alliance` fired the first shot in online mode, simultaneously declaring to the other factions on Server 2147: 'My lords, times have changed!'"

> "Players on Server No. 111, although not a peaceful server, deeply love peace. They also have the lowest average death count among all servers, with each player dying only 7 times on average. It is reported that they aim to build the first city in the sky on this server. We sincerely wish them success in this grand endeavor."

> "Players on Server No. 3511 are also a group who love peace. The largest guild on this server is `Cave Dwellers`. Unlike players on Server No. 111, they seem intent on building an underground city deep beneath the surface, and over 3,000 players on this server have already become victims, burned to death by lava."

This hour-long video specifically showcased various pioneering feats in Minecraft, also making countless players fully understand one statement: You never know how players will truly play a game.

Just like when seeing a female character, many might wonder if she's attractive.

But who would have thought that many players, upon seeing a female character, would deliberately adjust their camera perspective to see if they could spot something 'special'?

It's the same with Minecraft. Although there were already quite a number of videos showcasing Minecraft's unique gameplay, with the release of Chen Xu's video, countless players were still left dumbfounded.
