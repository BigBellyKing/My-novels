Chapter 641: Can This Game Even Be Played? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

The naked fat BOSS looked mighty. But in reality, this gatekeeper BOSS wasn't too difficult. The damage from the two Defias Sentinel minions nearby wasn't high either. Song Ren felt relieved as soon as he saw the damage he was taking after pulling the aggro. Based on the BOSS's attacks, it couldn't pose a life threat to him; the Priest just needed to keep an eye on mana and the timing of heals.

“Let's clear these two mobs first, then we’ll take on the BOSS. That'll be safer.” After finalizing the tactics, Song Ren immediately used the skill he believed best showcased a Warrior's might to initiate the fight. The Warrior in the game let out a roar and charged towards Lakzo. Midway, Song Ren switched to Defensive Stance—this was the Warrior's Charge. What a skill, embodying the Warrior's directness! Arriving before Lakzo, Song Ren continued to use Demoralizing Shout, applying an attack-reducing DEBUFF to both the BOSS and the mobs, then began kiting them. Since the BOSS’s two minions could shoot with bows from a distance, he needed to body-pull them to gather them together.

“Wang Han, Old Zhang, you two deal damage together first. When Joey runs out of mana, then heal me,” Song Ren instructed. He applied Sunder Armor to the BOSS and followed up with a Heroic Strike to better build aggro. “No problem!” Wang Han was excited. She unleashed a flurry of attacks on the BOSS. Able to heal, deal damage, and tank—this was the Alliance's great class: the Paladin! Of course, it sounded perfect, but their damage couldn't compare to Rogues or Mages, their heals couldn't match Priests, and their tanking couldn't rival Protection Warriors. Most people would find Paladins quite mediocre, and Wang Han initially thought the same, finding leveling up in the wilderness utterly exhausting. But now, she had a new perspective. This was precisely the Paladin's unique characteristic. She could fill any role the team needed, ensuring the team never had a weakness. When viewed this way, wasn't this the Paladin's greatest purpose? The spiritual symbol of the Alliance!

As for Wang Yifan and Zhang Yi, they were quite relaxed. They just needed to manage aggro and deal damage to their heart's content. It was no different from fighting regular mobs. Aside from having a bit more health than typical elite monsters, this BOSS wasn't much of a threat. Its only skill was Slam, which dealt a small amount of damage to enemies in melee range. The only slightly troublesome aspect was that it was a stun skill, capable of stunning the tank for three seconds. However, with a healer, as long as the health bar was kept healthy, there was generally not much danger. With a bit of effort, Song Ren and his team slowly whittled down the BOSS.

Seeing the BOSS fall to the ground, everyone grew excited. If there was one thing that brought the most joy in playing MMORPGs, it was naturally defeating a BOSS and then looting its corpse.

“Who's looting the corpse?” Wang Han asked, looking at Lakzo on the ground. “Cough cough… cough cough!!!” Song Ren, standing motionless beside the BOSS, didn't speak but coughed loudly in voice chat. “Alright, alright, stop coughing, you're going to cough out your lungs. You loot it, you loot it,” Zhang Yi said, speechless. “Ugh, let's go. With a renowned big chief looting, don't expect anything from this BOSS,” Zhang Yi said, feigning a sigh. “Old Zhang, I'm not happy about that! I think my luck is pretty good!” Song Ren protested. “Heh heh,” Zhang Yi simply replied. “If I don't get anything good! I won't loot the later BOSSes! I refuse to believe that the first dungeon BOSS our five-person squad takes down won't drop any loot!” Song Ren declared confidently as he walked over to the corpse, then reached out with an excited hand.

Then, a giant hammer, sparkling with light, appeared on the ground. It was a bit different from World of Warcraft in his previous life. After looting the corpse, dropped items would scatter directly onto the ground from the BOSS, emitting a lootable glow. After being picked up, they would be distributed according to the team's distribution mode. However, a key difference was that in World of Warcraft in his previous life, some dungeon gear was bind-on-pickup and couldn't be traded. This was quite an unfriendly setting, as players who accidentally picked up gear needed by others sometimes had to contact game customer service to transfer the gear to another player's account, which was very troublesome. Therefore, Chen Xu also added a setting where dungeon gear could be traded among teammates within a certain time frame. At the same time, considering that familiar players might exploit the loot trading system to grief unfamiliar players in dungeons, there were also dedicated reporting channels, including allowing players with high enough reputation to participate in reviews.

“See that? That’s a Lucky King right there! The BOSS's weapon dropped directly!” “From now on, leave the BOSSes to me. This is what a Lucky Hand looks like! This is it!” Song Ren exclaimed, his face filled with excitement as he looked at the gleaming hammer. What was this? This was a chosen one!

With an excited heart, Song Ren picked it up, and his expression froze. The hammer was indeed the BOSS's hammer, called Lakzo's Hammer. But why the heck was it a white-tier item? Even if you were a weak BOSS, you shouldn't just drop a white-tier item, right? You're a BOSS, at least, yet you use a white-tier weapon? Worse off than even him, a Warrior!? You deserved to be slaughtered!

“Do you even have any BOSS dignity?! You’re only wearing underpants; I thought all your assets were invested in your weapon.” “Turns out your hammer is white-tier? You're really an idiot!” Song Ren completely collapsed. He checked it two or three times, confirming that this thing only dropped one hammer. Was he truly an Unlucky Hand?

“Ahem, Old Song, have you considered another possibility?” Joey spoke up from the side. “Hm?” Song Ren glanced sideways. “It’s very likely that this BOSS is a Warrior, and the reason he isn’t wearing any clothes or pants and only has a white-tier hammer isn't because he invested his entire fortune into his weapon, but because he's so poor he only has one weapon left. After all, you still need a weapon for leveling up,” Joey said, chuckling.

Pfft... It felt like an arrow had pierced his heart. “Old Song, don’t be modest, this hammer is truly destined for you.” “Sigh, are Warriors really that poor?” “Old Song, just put the hammer away. Take it back to the capital city and sell it to a vendor, lest you can’t even afford to learn your skills later.” His teammates sighed, then decided to give up on trying to console Song Ren.

At this moment, he seriously doubted his path as a Warrior. One could say that Warcraft was a very fair game, yet also not entirely fair. Because the gear and items dropped by BOSSes, and items in pick-up groups that everyone 'needed' or 'greeded' for, were obtained through rolling dice, it all came down to luck. If he was an Unlucky Streak, his game experience would surely be abysmal. Warriors were already broke as a church mouse; if he had to add the label of an Unlucky Streak to that, could this game even be played?
