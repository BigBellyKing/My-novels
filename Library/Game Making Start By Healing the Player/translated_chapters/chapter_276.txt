Chapter 275: Trial Version Goes Live (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)

After watching the CGI animation released by Chen Xu, both players and game industry designers were bewildered.

Ordinary players didn't feel much, simply marveling at how well an RTS game's CGI promotional video could be made!

Compared to previous games like Monster Hunter: World and Dark Souls, it was significantly stronger.

A visible improvement!

But for industry insiders, what did this minute-plus video mean to them?

It was a stack of burning cash!

"I'm uncultured, but 'holy cow' is universally understood—this CGI is too awesome!"

"Yeah! If Chen Xu hadn't said before that Warcraft was an RTS game, I absolutely wouldn't have believed it!"

"At that point, surely Warcraft's story won't all be made with this level of CGI, right?"

"Probably not, right? How much money would that cost?"

"Didn't Chen Xu say so?"

"Holy cow, if that's really the case, does that mean all that huge sum of money was invested in CGI animation?"

"No way? Nebula Games is a game company, not an animation company. Is an RTS game really worth such a huge investment?"

"I don't think it's possible for other companies, but this is Nebula Games! Look at the Nebula Games Platform, could you have imagined someone doing this before?"

"Then that's truly awesome!"

"Now I'm more curious about the expressions of the designers at Hero Entertainment. Previously, Human Wars had a graphics reset and a major new version update, which was clearly aimed at Warcraft. Now, at the very least, this CGI has definitely blown Human Wars out of the water, to who knows where."

Many designers and players in the industry discussed the CGI promotional video released by Chen Xu.

Meanwhile, at Hero Entertainment, Zhou Qi looked as if he'd been hit by a truck.

Because the CGI's performance was simply top-notch.

This was completely smashed out with money!

Could their Hero Entertainment do it?

Of course they could!

After all, this kind of thing relied on money.

But he was certain that a proposal for a graphics remaster could be approved.

However, wanting to create CGI of this caliber was basically an impossible task.

Could Chen Xu really have poured 700 million Yuan into an RTS game?

And most of it invested in CGI production?

Originally, he had completely disbelieved Nebula Games' boasts of "redefining RTS" and "700 million Yuan cost."

After all, who couldn't boast in their promotions?

He remembered when Human Wars launched, he almost declared it the strongest RTS game in the galaxy, bar none.

Just like those movies that claimed a production cost of 200 million Yuan, but was it really that much?

No, it wasn't!

But he had to admit, having money was really nice.

Watching the video on Chen Xu's official Weibo account, Zhou Qi felt a tinge of bitterness in his heart.

Of course, these thoughts lasted only a moment, and Zhou Qi quickly calmed down.

After all, what good was it if the CGI was amazing?

This was a game, not a movie or an animation.

As an RTS game, it still depended on its gameplay!

Your CGI is awesome, your graphics are awesome, but is any of that useful for an RTS?

Moreover, Chen Xu had never touched the RTS field before; he didn't believe this Warcraft could shock him speechless!

Many designers and players shared Zhou Qi's opinion.

However, they soon shifted their attention to the game's content.

In various RTS communities and forums, many players who enjoyed this genre were also discussing it.

"Have you guys been following the news about Warcraft?"

"Definitely! The CGI was absolutely incredible, I just wonder what the actual game quality will be like."

"I have a feeling it won't be bad. After all, Monster Hunter: World, Minecraft, and Dark Souls were all made by Chen Xu."

"But RTS is different!"

"Yeah, RTS is different from other game genres. Graphics and CGI are just icing on the cake; the main thing is gameplay and balance."

"Who cares? Anyway, there'll be a free trial, right? Won't we know for ourselves if we just try it?"

"That's true."

Amidst various discussions from players and industry designers, time slowly moved to November 11th.

The trial version of Warcraft had already opened its download channel early, allowing players to pre-download it and then enter the game to play as soon as it unlocked.

As for the trial content, it was similar to the previous Monster Hunter: World.

This was because Chen Xu had directly combined the Reign of Chaos and The Frozen Throne from his previous life into a single version.

Therefore, in terms of story, players could fully experience the content of the first chapter, aside from the prologue.

Which was the story of the disaster in the Kingdom of Lordaeron.

However, the online versus mode was temporarily locked.

Besides this, during this period, Chen Xu also successively announced some new information about Warcraft.

First was the official launch date, which, unlike Monster Hunter: World, was different this time.

It was quite a bit earlier, with the official version launching on November 15th.

As for the price, the domestic price was 198 Yuan, while the overseas price was 39.9 USD.

Just like before, there was a Steelbook Collector's Edition, priced at 899 Yuan domestically and 159.9 USD overseas. Compared to the standard digital version, the Collector's Edition included a Blu-ray DVD collecting all CGI scenes, a Collector's Edition Frostmourne collectible figure, an art book album, and related descriptions of races, characters, and the worldview background. It could be said that the content was quite substantial.

However, simply speaking about the pricing of the digital version, it was relatively low compared to some traditional action, RPG, and FPS blockbusters, but in the RTS genre, it was considered a rather high price point.

"This price is a bit expensive!"

"Not expensive. Look at Chen Xu's previous games; the pricing generally favored domestic players, and the quality was beyond reproach. This time, Warcraft's pricing is quite a bit higher than similar RTS games, which actually makes me more excited!"

"Exactly, exactly. Before, Chen Xu's games were cheaper than similar types and their quality was strong. This time, Nebula Games surprisingly gave such a high price, I think it must be worth it!"

"One digital version, one Collector's Edition, no explanation needed!"

"Awesome, bro, but I'll still download the free trial first to see what the quality is like before deciding."

"Right, anyway, there are still 4 days until the official launch from the trial period. If it's to my liking, I'll just buy it then."

Because it adopted the same strategy of first launching a free trial version, many players had no reservations and eagerly downloaded it, preparing to see what the game, which had previously released such amazing CGI, was actually like.
