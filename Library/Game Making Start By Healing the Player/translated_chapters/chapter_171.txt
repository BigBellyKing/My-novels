Chapter 170: Chen Xu, the Big Swindler! (Fifth update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

‘In the ancient era, the world was undifferentiated, shrouded in a great fog, with grey rocks, towering trees… and the Everlasting Dragons everywhere.’

The video screen was filled with white mist, barren rocks, and towering trees. Simultaneously, a massive dragon-shaped shadow flashed by within the white mist.

‘But one day, the First Flame ignited, and all differences were born from it!’

‘Cold and hot’

‘Light and dark’

‘Life and death’

The camera switched rapidly. Specks of fire appeared in the darkness, eventually forming a burning flame.

This burning flame was so scorching, so massive.

Compared to the small cluster of flames burning in the final Link the Fire ending of the previous Dark Souls, this flame before them was like the sun.

‘Then, several species born from the darkness.’

‘They were drawn to the flame and found the Lord Souls around the fire.’

Before the flame, countless shadows crawled up from the ground, facing the fire.

‘Nito, the First of the Dead’

In the endless darkness, a massive skeletal figure appeared, rising with a flame held in its hand.

‘The Witch of Izalith and her Daughters of Chaos’

A woman, whose face was unclear and wearing a sorcerer's hood, gazed down at the flame in her hands.

‘Lord Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight, and his Knight Legion’

Gwyn, wearing a crown, also held a flame in his hands, but compared to the flames of the Witch and Nito, the flame before Gwyn appeared even hotter. Behind him stood an countless army of knights, awaiting orders.

‘And the Furtive Pygmy, who was seen by no one’

In the deserted place where the fire began, a figure, only visible as a shadow, stood up holding a ball of flame.

And that flame appeared so small, as if it would be extinguished with a single gust of wind.

‘They acquired the power of the Lord Souls and challenged the Everlasting Dragons.’

‘Gwyn's Lightning Spear pierced the rock-hard scales of the Everlasting Dragons.’

‘The Witch's Flame formed a storm, burning the great trees to ashes.’

‘Nito unleashed a Miasma of Death.’

‘And Seath the Scaleless betrayed the Everlasting Dragons, leading to their defeat.’

The scenes switched continuously.

Gwyn's Lightning Spear, the Witch's Flame, Nito's Miasma of Death, continuously attacked the Everlasting Dragons in the sky.

Finally, Seath the Scaleless let out a howl atop mountains of dragon corpses.

‘Thus began the Age of Fire, but fire too shall fade, leaving only darkness.’

A massive capital city appeared on screen, but it flashed by, replaced by endless darkness.

After a moment, a glimmer of fire appeared in the darkness, and a pair of hands suddenly emerged, grasping that last glimmer.

‘Now, the fire is about to fade, light can no longer illuminate the world, and night continues endlessly.’

Before a desolate valley tomb, a woman knelt, her figure immediately recognizable to any Dark Souls player.

This woman was the Fire Keeper.

‘The accursed Dark Sign began to appear among the populace.’

A hand was placed on a Hollowed knight, and as the camera zoomed out, the Dark Sign became visible on screen.

Then the scene switched to a prison cell.

Innumerable Hollows were imprisoned within the cells.

‘Yes, the Dark Sign signifies being afflicted by the Undead Curse.’

‘All Undead will be arrested, sent North, and locked in cells until the end of the world.’

‘This… is also your destiny.’

Finally, the video's camera moved to the innermost cell.

There stood an Undead clad in armor, whose unique appearance set him apart from the others.

Then he looked up. The skylight opened, and a corpse was dropped down from above.

A knight, with a shield on his back and an unclear face, gazed at the Undead in the cell.

Subsequently, the screen plunged into darkness.

The large characters “Dark Souls” appeared in the middle of the screen, with a subtitle below: Age of the First Flame.

………………

With the release of this promotional video, all the players at the exhibition instantly became excited.

Yes, this was the content they craved!

Although the video was not long, lasting only about three minutes, it had revealed enough.

First and foremost was the background of the Dark Souls world.

In previous Dark Souls games, players could only gather information through fragments of dialogue.

But in this promotional video, players finally learned what the world of Dark Souls was like in its nascent state.

They also understood the meaning of the First Flame, and could infer from some in-game scenes.

Namely, that the timeline between the two games must be extremely long, evident from the manifestation of the flame.

The First Flame in the promotional trailer was like a colossal sun.

However, in the previous Dark Souls' final Link the Fire ending, there was only a small flame, seemingly ready to be extinguished by a single gust of wind.

Combining this with the content of the promotional video, many fervent Dark Souls players had some more detailed inferences.

That the entire world, in the beginning, existed in souls, but it was disordered.

Because the promotional trailer spoke of the differences and inclinations brought by the First Flame.

This likely bestowed upon souls the ability to be distinguished according to different natures, allowing originally disordered souls to converge and manifest in certain forms.

Those were the Lord Souls. And the beings who obtained Lord Souls from the First Flame were what later generations called the Ancient Gods.

They were the first beings to receive the baptism of fire, gaining ordered souls. They changed their appearance and existence due to the souls they received, evolving into new forms.

Next, these first beings with soul power launched a war against the disordered Everlasting Dragons, for survival, for ambition, or for other reasons.

In any case, the war between order and disorder began. With the help of Seath the Scaleless, the representatives of fire won, order replaced disorder, and thus ushered in the Age of Fire.

From these characters, players could also clearly discern shadows of related settings.

For example, Seath the Scaleless, closely related to magic; Lord Gwyn and the Ancient Gods, closely related to the faith of clerics; and the Witch, related to pyromancy power.

As for the Dwarf mentioned, it also sparked eager discussion among many players.

Because the promotional video made no mention of the Dwarf who found the Dark Soul participating in the Dragon War. Moreover, despite Dark Souls being a fantasy theme, it didn't really have settings like dwarves or elves.

What kind of existence was this so-called Dwarf? And what was the connection between the Dark Sigil brought by Londor in the previous game and the Dark Sign mentioned in the promotional trailer (referring to the curse)?

These all became questions for many Dark Souls players.

But regardless, most players expressed one sentiment: give me the game, take my wallet, I'm buying it all!

As the promotional video finished playing, countless players, unable to suppress their excitement, discussed animatedly.

Players interested in the plot discussed the fragments of information revealed in the trailer.

And players solely interested in hacking at bosses were even more excited.

Look at what the game mentioned?

Lord Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight, the Witch of Izalith and her Daughters of Chaos, Nito, the First of the Dead—all famous existences.

Fighting Lords of Cinder in the previous game, and now directly fighting Ancient Gods—how exciting!

With excited hearts, players watched Chen Xu return to the stage.

“Just as everyone has seen, Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame will bring the battlefield back to the distant ancient era. Players will then experience an even more exciting and captivating Dark Souls.”

“At the same time, I can also reveal some more crucial information to everyone here: the launch date for Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame is tentatively set for early July!”

As Chen Xu made the announcement, a line of dates suddenly appeared on the large screen behind him.

This time, Chen Xu wasn't being a swindler.

Because according to the current progress, it was entirely sufficient.

After all, it wasn't being developed from scratch; the framework of the previous work was there. The main time-consuming and laborious part was the art assets.

Upon hearing Chen Xu's words, the players present once again erupted in cheers.

Clearly, getting a release date filled them with excitement.

Then, under the expectant gazes of all the players, Chen Xu, after giving some conventional remarks for the exhibition, left the stage, replaced by the event host.

Hold on, Mr. Chen, did you forget to announce something?

What about the demo session for Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame!?

Many players stared bewildered at Chen Xu as he left the stage, then looked at the host who was introducing subsequent activities and content.

This time, Nebula Games, on Chen Xu's behalf, didn't just bring a trailer for a Dark Souls sequel.

There was still some content, such as a new version of Sanguosha with a new National War Mode, and a new version of Fall Guys with various themed maps.

Of course, there were also some events specifically for players, such as co-op play of It Takes Two to win simple collectible figures and souvenirs.

There was also a Dark Souls challenge competition, where players could challenge different BOSSes and monsters. Whether they succeeded or failed, they would still receive corresponding souvenir toys.

As the players watched the showgirls and cosers perform on stage, they finally confirmed a fact.

That the supposed Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame demo did not exist at all!

“Speechless! Chen Xu is such a big swindler!”

“Yeah, I thought there'd be a demo at the exhibition, but it's just a trailer!”

“While this trailer revealed a lot, and Chen Xu directly announced the launch date, which did excite me, what about the promised demo?!”

“Exactly! Exactly! Isn't that not keeping your word?!”

“Ahem, hold on, bros, don't get too agitated. If you check Chen Xu's previous official Weibo account, he didn't mention anything about a demo at all!”

“Damn, you're right!”

However, although the absence of a demo session disappointed many players, it wasn't a big deal. After all, it wasn't uncommon for exhibitions each year to only show trailers without demos.

Moreover, Chen Xu had straightforwardly announced the launch date for Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame!

At least it gave them something to look forward to.

Besides, the activities here were quite lively, and although the prizes weren't expensive, they were exquisite, making many players feel that Nebula Games valued them.

At the same time, for both Sanguosha and Fall Guys, players could directly download the test versions released at the exhibition to experience the new content.

The absence of queueing, just like last year, also earned Nebula Games goodwill from many players, dispelling some of the disappointment from not getting to play the Dark Souls sequel demo.

In addition, the Dark Souls challenge event and the It Takes Two chemistry event were also surrounded by many players.

“Old Song, aren’t you queuing?” Zhang Yi and Wang Han, queuing up, looked at Song Ren, who was walking towards another area, with some curiosity.

“It’s nothing, I want to check out other games.” Song Ren looked at Zhang Yi and Wang Han, holding hands, then glanced at the It Takes Two experience area ahead, forcing a smile.

Queuing?

Did they think he didn't want to play!?

The main thing was, he couldn't play it alone!

This game had been out for so long, and he still hadn't played it beyond watching videos!

Especially looking at all the couples holding hands around him, Song Ren took a deep breath.

Can't look anymore, can't look anymore, his blood pressure was rising.

Maybe play some blood-pressure-lowering games.

Looking at the Dark Souls experience area next to him, Song Ren quietly averted his gaze, and then he noticed a peculiar place.

In a small corner of the Nebula Games exhibition area, there were four wall-mounted monitors. In front of the monitors were four large water tanks, with inflatable hammers stuck inside them.

He had noticed it before, but at that time, he thought it was Nebula Games' work area. But now it seemed it wasn't!

Driven by curiosity, Song Ren walked over.

Could it be, something new from Nebula Games?
