Chapter 793: The Lusty Argonian Maid

After arriving in Whiterun, Song Ren didn't rush to Dragonsreach to find the Jarl. Instead, he wandered around the streets for a while.

Compared to the previous Riverwood, Whiterun naturally had many more NPCs.

Talking to the NPCs along the way, Song Ren discovered that their dialogue was all completely unique.

He hadn't felt much in Riverwood.

But after arriving in Whiterun, Song Ren had only one feeling:

That it was vibrant.

In terms of scale, Whiterun wasn't actually very large.

It was about half the size of Saint Denis in *Red Dead Redemption*.

Yet, the entire city gave Song Ren a remarkably lively feeling.

Khajiit and Tiger-folk engaged in trade came and went, and all the houses in the city could be freely entered and exited.

Every NPC could be spoken to, and all would provide players with some information.

These dialogues were not repetitive.

At the same time, Song Ren noticed that the furnishings inside these accessible houses were also different.

“It’s like that feeling I had when I first played *Red Dead Redemption* and *Breath of the Wild*!”

Song Ren had no intention of going to Dragonsreach to find the Jarl; instead, he wandered around the houses in Whiterun.

The only thing that left Song Ren a little dissatisfied was the absence of conventional RPG fun in *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim*.

What is the most common fun in an RPG?

It's, of course, turning the protagonist into an old rogue, rummaging through everything and anything.

But in *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim*, Song Ren found that while many items could be acquired, they were labeled 'Stolen'.

Moreover, if seen by an NPC, it would increase his crime value and lead to being hunted by guards.

However, putting that aside, the game's content once again gave Song Ren the same sense of exploration he felt when playing *Zelda*.

Especially when picking locks with a tension wrench, each successful lockpick filled him with anticipation.

“This homeowner must really love studying, huh? A bard? Why are there so many books? Can’t they hide an artifact or a god-tier item in their house?”

Although getting caught stealing by an NPC would increase bounties and crime value, what if he wasn't seen?

Sneaking around, waiting for all the nearby NPCs to leave, Song Ren picked a lock and entered a small house, beginning to rummage for items.

The only thing that left Song Ren a little depressed was that this house was full of books. Forget good stuff, there wasn't even a single gold coin.

“Honestly, though, I wonder how many books are actually in this game. The variety is truly immense.”

Song Ren sighed as he looked at the books he had just scavenged.

In such fantasy games, the game's background is basically presented to players through snippets of NPC dialogue and in-game books.

For example, Nebula Games' previous titles, *Red Dead Redemption* and *The Witcher: Wild Hunt*.

Aside from the main story, much of the content and world-building require players to read the in-game books themselves.

Otherwise, relying solely on the main questline makes it difficult to understand the overall context of the game's background.

For instance, the newspapers in *Red Dead Redemption*, and the books detailing the background and affairs of various kingdoms in *The Witcher: Wild Hunt*.

Clearly, *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim* also contains numerous books used to introduce players to the game's background.

While sighing, Song Ren also looked at the books in his inventory.

He wasn't particularly interested in these, to be honest.

After all, there were simply too many, making it hard to read them all. But sometimes he would flip through them to see what they were about.

This time, however, was different. Among the newly acquired books, Song Ren found one with a very strange title.

“The Lusty Argonian Maid? What kind of book is this? Why does the title sound so anime-style?”

Intrigued by the title, Song Ren was curious.

Compared to the other books, this one stood out like a firefly in the dark.

Filled with curiosity, Song Ren opened the book in the game and read:

‘The Lusty Argonian Maid, Volume 2’

By Crassius Curio

Scene Seven, Act Two.

Wags-Her-Tail: My goodness, that's a large breadstick! But how do I get it into the oven?

Crantius Colto: That breadstick is not yet ready to be baked, my sweet! It has not yet risen.

Wags-Her-Tail: But how am I to make it rise?

Crantius Colto: Oh, my little foolish maid, you must use your hands, of course!

Wags-Her-Tail: You want me to make this bread rise now? Here?

Crantius Colto: Of course.

Wags-Her-Tail: But what if the Mistress sees? This bread is for her breakfast!

Crantius Colto: Worry not, the Mistress will have food later.

Wags-Her-Tail: Oh, good! But I fear the oven isn’t hot enough, this will take hours!

Crantius Colto: There is plenty of time, my dear! Plenty of time.

End of Scene Seven, Act Two.

Looking at the book in his inventory, Song Ren went from confusion to bewilderment.

What the heck, this was erotic literature!

'The Lusty Argonian Maid,' seriously, is this book even decent?

It wasn't just Song Ren who was speechless.

Some players who were also exploring *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim* and had discovered this rather special book were completely dumbfounded.

In the game, there were a total of ten such books, scattered at different locations.

Their content was all very, very explicit.

And as is well known, content that resonates with players and sparks widespread discussion often includes such suggestive material.

After the first player posted the contents of this book on the Tieba forums, the discussion among players quickly shifted from the plump chicken in Riverwood to Argonian Maids.

‘I’m completely stunned. As a pure-minded individual, I didn’t even react at first!’

‘Ahem, brother, don’t pretend to be pure. You understood it, so what purity are you talking about?’

‘23333333, I wonder how many of these books there are in the game.’

‘Indeed, the ancients didn’t lie to me: in books, there is a golden house; in books, there are beauties. No more talk, why be a Dragonborn? I’m going to read all the books in Skyrim.’

‘Speaking of which, *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim* shouldn't turn into a pile driver like *The Witcher: Wild Hunt*, right?’

‘It shouldn’t. I feel this game is quite proper.’

‘To be fair, if you just read the text, the atmosphere is quite enchanting. But haven’t you seen what Argonians look like? I can only say that if that works, then you’re truly a warrior!’

‘+1, Argonians are too terrifying! I don’t think I can get myself to do it!’
