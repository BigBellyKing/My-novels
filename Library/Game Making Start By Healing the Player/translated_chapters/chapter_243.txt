Chapter 242: The difficulty is just right, perfectly balanced! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Time passed day by day. During this period, many games launched their promotions.

The Channel Alliance also began promoting several games.

However, this had little impact on Nebula Games.

After all, Chen Xu had just announced a lot of news regarding "Monster Hunter: World."

Moreover, at this stage, both the so-called Channel Alliance and Nebula Games knew it was a tug-of-war.

No clear winner would emerge quickly; it relied on each game continuously increasing player attention, spending, and stickiness to the platform.

While players online discussed the recently popular games,

inside Nebula Games' office,

Chen Xu was finalizing some of the subsequent content for "Monster Hunter: World" with Qin Yi and his team.

The game's development was very smooth. With the experience from developing "Dark Souls," many aspects were not as difficult.

Furthermore, compared to before, with the transformation of the Nebula Games Platform, the team's size had also increased.

Moreover, the employees who could directly join Chen Xu's team at Nebula Games were essentially industry elites.

Under Chen Xu's leadership, the speed of game development was naturally unparalleled.

The entire game framework was essentially complete, including the acceptance of a large amount of art assets.

What remained primarily were the action performances and feedback corresponding to different weapons and BOSSes, as well as numerical design and details.

"The appearance of third-party creatures shouldn't be too frequent. It's one of the game's selling points, but not its core feature."

Sitting at his workstation, Chen Xu was looking at the screen.

While battling a Diablos, he was suddenly interrupted by a rogue Barroth.

Although the Barroth was directly crushed – if the Diablos weren't a herbivore, there probably wouldn't be any bones left.

However, in ten tests, the Barroth appeared five times, almost a fifty percent chance.

Such a high probability was simply too much.

The entire game world was a continuous open world, with distinct zones separated by terrains such as narrow tunnels, rushing rivers, and steep cliffs. Simultaneously, the ecological environment within the game's food chain would be dynamic.

But too high a chance wasn't a good thing.

"Appearing occasionally brings a surprise to players, but constant appearances won't be a surprise; they'll just be annoying. The probability should be lowered; you can refer to the easter egg setting of the Murlocs and Pigman war in 'Don't Starve'." Chen Xu said to the surrounding employees, pointing out some shortcomings in the game.

"Hmm... Bazelgeuse is an exception, though. After all, the Bazelgeuse's ecological habit is to roam around the New World, searching for prey." Chen Xu added.

"So, Mr. Chen, do we need to adjust the difficulty later?" Qin Yi tentatively asked.

Having already worked on the monster action design in the game, they were very clear about its difficulty.

This game might look simple, but it was actually very hardcore.

Especially when players first encountered a monster like the Diablos.

Frequent Dragon Charges, tough scales, incredibly high attack power, and various dizzying roars.

It was incredibly tough to deal with.

Not to mention the weapons in the game; each one looked extremely cool.

But in reality, to play well, one truly needed to hone their skills.

If new players didn't know anything upon starting, the most likely outcome would be Great Sword's three-charge swings at air, Charge Blade's Super Amped Element Discharge chopping the ground, Long Sword's Foresight Slash never connecting, and Hammers hitting the head merely scraping calluses.

No, wait, players who just started would most likely not even know how to Super Amped Element Discharge; they'd just wildly slash.

So, ultimately, hunters' daily routines would devolve into three consecutive cartings back to camp.

"Adjust what? The game's difficulty is perfectly suitable, just right! Look how easy the Great Jagras is to deal with, and the Kulu-Ya-Ku can be beaten effortlessly. Compared to 'Dark Souls,' it's much more user-friendly, progressing from simple to difficult step-by-step; isn't that normal?" Chen Xu said with a chuckle.

Hearing Chen Xu's words, Qin Yi was momentarily speechless.

Chen Xu couldn't help but smile.

In reality, the difficulty of "Monster Hunter: World" had indeed been significantly lowered.

It's important to know that the original Monster Hunter series was genuinely very difficult.

However, the difficulty of "Monster Hunter: World" could be said to be just right.

Because if players followed the main quest and occasionally farmed for equipment, they would generally only gain the ability to instantly kill (monsters) by the time they reached Nergigante.

In this process, with Healing Smoke Bombs, mantles, traps, and Palicos as assistance, the difficulty genuinely decreased significantly.

The game even offered many "cheese" methods.

Of course, this required players to get acquainted with the game and understand some of "Monster Hunter: World"'s system designs.

If they didn't understand...

Great Sword's charged slashes were a man's romance; Charge Blade's Super Amped Element Discharge guaranteed damage as long as it was executed; and Long Swords were cool enough, Palicos cute enough, and that was that.

"If all else fails, isn't there a team-up system? Players can just team up to hunt monsters." Chen Xu said with a smile.

Looking at the smiling Chen Xu, Qin Yi and the others beside him were utterly speechless.

"Seriously, they believed him!"

"Team up to hunt monsters!?"

As a cooperative hunting game, "Monster Hunter: World" could certainly showcase a different kind of charm.

In most games, teaming up would significantly reduce the difficulty.

But "Monster Hunter: World" was different. For rookie players, multiplayer hunting actually *increased* the difficulty!

Although there was no friendly fire, hitting teammates in the game would cause them to flinch.

When facing a Dragon Charge, a Dual Blades teammate next to you would unleash a Demon Dance.

Stuck in a flinch, you would despairingly watch the Dragon Charge turn into a carting.

Your Long Sword, in its Spirit Gauge state, would execute a Rising Slash to cut the tail, and the image of the Elder Dragon struggling and wailing would already be forming in your mind, when the next moment, a three-charge Hammer would unexpectedly smash into your face.

In cooperative hunting, the most dangerous element wasn't the BOSS, but the teammates beside you.

Dual Blades users, scraping calluses and scrubbing backs, would only see white damage numbers, spinning, jumping, and riding the cart.

Protect the Elder Dragon in front, savagely attack the teammates beside you.

This was the daily routine of hunters in team hunts!

................

Time passed day by day.

Many games gradually began their warm-up promotions.

Within the industry, many designers were also discussing the recent wave of gaming hype.

"Has everyone been following the recent games? Their popularity seems quite good."

"Of course, it's good. Although NetDragon, TengHua, and the Channel Alliance haven't explicitly stated it, it's clearly a joint collaboration."

"Are they targeting Chen Xu? Preparing to ambush 'Monster Hunter: World'?"

"Not necessarily; I'd say it's more of a test. The main reason is that these games are decent in quality, but they don't have much unique character."

"But 'Monster Hunter: World' is a hunting game, which is a relatively niche genre!"

"So it's a test, right? If 'Monster Hunter: World' performs poorly, the Channel Alliance will definitely jump out. But if 'Monster Hunter: World' does well, they'll just play dead."

"By the way, Chen Xu hasn't seemed to react much recently, has he? There's no news about 'Monster Hunter: World' either; it feels a bit low-key."

"It's been in development for quite a while, probably nearing its final stages. But honestly, I really hope Chen Xu succeeds. After all, the Nebula Games Platform truly rewrote the landscape dominated by domestic channels."

Many industry designers were discussing these topics.

As for the players, they were getting a bit agitated.

Why?

Before this, there used to be "Monster Hunter: World" leaks every now and then.

But what about now?

Other games had all started their various promotions.

Why was Nebula Games still silent?

They couldn't have just made a folder, could they?

And as players tagged Chen Xu's official Weibo account daily and frequented major forums and communities to discuss "Monster Hunter: World"'s progress,

finally, Chen Xu and Nebula Games' official Weibo account released the latest news about "Monster Hunter: World."

And they had just announced content that excited many players.
