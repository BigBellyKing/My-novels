Chapter 583: Ethan, The True Man (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Song Ren, controlling Ethan in the game, could clearly feel Ethan's weakness at this moment.

His movements were no longer as agile as before, and he gasped heavily with every stretch of road he walked.

Along the way, there were also many werewolf-like monsters, spewed out from the mold, attempting to obstruct Ethan's path.

However, even without Chris's luxurious gear, for Ethan, these monsters couldn't stop him from rescuing his daughter.

But by the time Ethan navigated through numerous perils and reached the altar, the ritual seemed to have already been completed.

Miranda stared intently at the thick black liquid on the stone platform in the center of the altar. Her eyes were filled with anticipation as it pulsed as if boiling.

'Ah! Little Eva, my sweet daughter, come to me! Eva… is that you, Eva? Ah! I've missed you so much.'

Saying this, Miranda plunged her hands into the viscous black liquid.

A plump, sleeping infant was brought out.

However, the moment Miranda picked up the infant, her previously ecstatic expression froze.

'What? My power… is disappearing?'

Miranda looked incredulous. An indescribable power, endlessly flowing from the infant, was steadily draining Miranda's own strength.

As this power was extracted, Miranda's body began to collapse, her eye sockets taking on the black, moldy state. Clearly, Rose's power was far stronger than Miranda had imagined.

Or perhaps, the Mold entity had chosen Rose, not Miranda.

In any case, Miranda's ritual had clearly failed. The resurrected being was not her daughter Eva, but still Ethan's daughter, Rose.

'Rose! Miranda! Give Rose back to me!'

Watching Miranda holding Rose, Ethan aimed his gun at her but didn't fire.

Because she was still holding Rose in her hands.

'Interesting, your body isn't simple.' Miranda looked at the arriving Ethan with some surprise, but didn't appear flustered. Even though a good portion of her power had been absorbed by Rose in her arms, in Miranda's view, the gap between her and Ethan was still immense.

It was like throwing an axe into the sky; the sky was so high and vast, no matter how high the axe was thrown, it couldn't even scratch the sky's surface.

It was like pouring ink into the ocean; the ocean was so wide and grand, no matter how much ink was poured, it couldn't pollute the ocean's color.

It was like lighting a lamp under the sun; the sunlight was so brilliant and dazzling, no matter how brightly the lamp burned, it couldn't overshadow the sun's radiance.

'You must understand, once I truly kill you, everything…' Miranda wasn't in a hurry to act, looking at Ethan, ready to utter some harsh words.

Bang!

But before Miranda could finish, a gunshot suddenly rang out, and a burst of blood splattered from Miranda's head.

At the same time, from the mold-covered area above the statue, Chris's roar echoed: “Save Rose! Hurry!”

Decisively, Ethan immediately rushed to Miranda's side, preparing to snatch his daughter Rose back.

Accompanied by Miranda's roar, the mold began to rage, forming a barrier that blocked Chris's squad and everyone else outside.

At the same time, Rose was hidden by Miranda within the mold.

This was a war between Miranda and Ethan.

'You have completed your mission, Mr. Winters. You dealt with all my false children and awakened the glorious Mold entity. Now, please don't worry about little Rose; I promise to make her truly happy. Therefore, you can now die in peace… forever! You understand a parent's feelings, don't you? So why deny me?'

'Crazy woman, why don't you understand! Rose is my child! Not yours!'

'Don't interfere! The Mold entity saved me from the abyss of despair! Bestowing immense power upon me!'

'Yes, the Mold entity merely drove you mad!'

Ethan had completely entered a state of fury.

Because of this crazy woman, his fate had been altered.

Including Eveline three years ago!

Originally, he could have lived a stable life as a programmer, quietly with Mia, watching his daughter Rose grow up day by day.

But now, not only had he become a Fungal Beast, but this lunatic seemed intent on continuing to harm his daughter, using her as a vessel to resurrect the Mold entity and her daughter Eva?

How could this not enrage Ethan?

The large-caliber Magnum revolver made Miranda sway left and right, and grenade shells exploded on her body.

Shotguns, sniper rifles…

Using all his weapons, Ethan fought a desperate battle with Miranda within the barrier.

Under the massive firepower, Miranda, who had already lost some of her power, couldn't endure and let out a painful scream.

Ethan wasn't faring well either; his body was gradually collapsing. Although he could still cleanse himself to treat his injuries, he was slowly undergoing calcification.

Black, asphalt-like mold liquid spread, instantly piercing Ethan's calf and suspending him.

Miranda cackled maniacally, her sharp claws piercing Ethan's body.

But Ethan completely ignored his wounds, merely gripping his firearm and continuously shooting Miranda in the face.

A bloody melee ensued, with blood and black mold liquid splashing everywhere.

The sole thought sustaining Ethan's fight was to save Rose!

'Your time is up! Ethan Winters, I will have the Mold entity devour you, making you disappear forever!'

Miranda's sharp blade once again pierced Ethan's heart.

'You're the one who deserves to die!'

The last shotgun round was aimed at Miranda's chest, a single shot to her soul!

The powerful bullet directly blew Miranda's chest to smithereens.

'My daughter… my Eva!'

A shriek was squeezed from Miranda's mouth.

Crack, crack…

Subsequently, Miranda's body rapidly calcified, then shattered into fragments scattered across the ground. With Miranda's death, the encompassing barrier also began to calcify and crumble.

Just then, an infant's cry awakened the already blurry-conscious Ethan.

Amidst the crystalline remains of Miranda's death, a pink-cheeked infant was crying.

'Rose!' Even though he was struggling to move, his body on the verge of collapse, Ethan still dragged his broken body to Rose's side immediately, holding her tightly in his arms.

'Rose… it's okay… it's all over.'

But as he spoke, Ethan's right hand rapidly calcified. With a gentle breeze, it turned to dust and dissipated into the air.

At this point, Ethan could no longer hold on, and he knelt to the ground with a thud.

Yet, even then, the arm holding Rose remained as steady as a mountain, without the slightest tremor.

This final decisive battle didn't feel particularly difficult to Song Ren.

Of course, this was also because he was playing on the easiest difficulty.

But his focus wasn't on the combat at all; it was on Ethan's performance.

He hadn't played too many horror games. The original Outlast and the previous Resident Evil game hadn't left him with a particularly deep impression of the characters; he even forgot the reporter's name in Outlast.

But without a doubt, Ethan's performance in this installment, Resident Evil Village, truly moved him.

Ethan Winters, a true father and a true man.
