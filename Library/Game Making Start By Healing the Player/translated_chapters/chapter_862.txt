Chapter 861: Barrier to Entry and Content Depth

"This is a completely different fighting game, one that boasts an extremely high skill ceiling while also having a very low barrier to entry, allowing even players with little knowledge of fighting games to find enjoyment."

Chen Xu looked at everyone and spoke. Hearing this, Qin Yi and the others in the meeting room showed surprised expressions.

After all, the statement sounded quite contradictory. Possessing an extremely high skill ceiling indicated that it was a very hardcore game. So, under this premise, how could it also have a very low barrier to entry?

"Super Smash Bros. is the subtitle of this new work, and it represents its two core aspects," Chen Xu said with a smile, as some concept art, already prepared, appeared on the large screen.

Firstly, there's the 'Stars' aspect: every character who can join either possesses a massive fanbase or has left a significant mark in gaming history. Secondly, there's the 'Brawl' aspect: the game's ultra-low barrier to entry.

Traditional fighting games typically follow a fixed template. In terms of health representation, it's the so-called percentage health, where victory or defeat is determined when health drops to zero. However, Super Smash Bros. changes this rule of fighting games. First, the health bar is still a percentage, but it doesn't decrease from high to low; instead, it increases from low to high. The higher the percentage, the greater the distance and probability a player is launched when hit. Centered around this element, and unlike the goal of depleting an opponent's health bar to zero in traditional fighting games, the objective in Super Smash Bros. becomes launching the opponent off the screen. Therefore, as long as the character doesn't fly off the boundary, they won't lose the match, even if they take a lot of damage. Additionally, this launch mechanic allows for the introduction of concepts like weight for different characters.

Furthermore, another bold design choice is the clean and decisive removal of the most crucial input command system in fighting games. Of course, there are exceptions, such as fighting characters like Terry in Fatal Fury, who still retain input commands. However, skills that *only* require input commands are limited to two powerful special moves usable only when health reaches a certain threshold. All characters' normal attacks, special moves, and super special moves only require a single corresponding button. Skills that traditionally require input commands can now be executed simply by combining the four directional keys (up, down, left, right) with a dedicated function button. Every character in the game adheres to this button design. When players encounter a new character, they don't need to memorize a move list like in traditional fighting games; they only need to understand the characteristics of the skills. This can be said to have directly eliminated what newcomers to fighting games fear most, significantly reducing the learning curve. Even a clumsy player wouldn't be unable to execute special or super special moves in Super Smash Bros. because the entire game only uses five buttons: attack, jump, special, block, and grab. The game's controls are highly focused and highly simplified.

And these aren't the only successful characteristics of Super Smash Bros. In traditional fighting games, players' characters are always firmly rooted to the ground; jumping in traditional fighting games often means giving the opponent an opportunity for a brutal attack. However, it's completely different in Super Smash Bros., because the core combat mechanic is to launch people off the stage, and those launched also get a chance to return to the stage.

So, in Super Smash Bros., aerial combat is a very unique aspect. If used well, you can dominate others; if not, you will naturally be dominated by them.

Additionally, Super Smash Bros. features a unique item battle setting, with items ranging from swords and magic to futuristic cannons, covering everything imaginable. If traditional fighting games completely strip away elements of luck, Super Smash Bros. does the opposite, adding a significant element of chance in its Brawl mode. Obtaining a good item, such as a black hole, an invincible star, a slow-motion device, or a rocket launcher, can even lead to a direct comeback. Furthermore, there are various diverse maps, combined with the special edition's feature of up to eight-player brawls, which maximizes the game's entertainment value.

Moreover, the special edition of Smash Bros.'s single-player content, 'World of Light,' is the greatest in the series. Many Super Smash Bros. players who have followed the series since DX, X, and the original title/game have sincerely praised it, saying there might never be another game quite like this miracle. This is because it's not as simple as merely taking an IP and directly using it; from the actions, details, and even the appearance order, to the various in-game items, maps, and the so-called Spirits, everything brings a knowing smile to those familiar with these IPs. Just as a famous game developer from the previous life once said, this is a game that connects many different characters, complex music, numerous staff, and all players with different interests, using Super Smash Bros. as the link.

The reason this game possesses such charm is also related to a legendary game producer from his previous life: Masahiro Sakurai. Unlike other well-known game producers in the industry, such as Hideo Kojima, Hidetaka Miyazaki, and others, Masahiro Sakurai's fame isn't as widespread. However, if one were to choose the producer in the industry who understands players and games the most, Masahiro Sakurai would undoubtedly be the first choice. Especially his taking charge of X under critical circumstances, much like Liu Bei entrusting his son at Baidi City. When the ailing Satoru Iwata entrusted Masahiro Sakurai with the project, and the release date for Super Smash Bros. was set for the day after Iwata's birthday at E3, Sakurai's words, 'Ah, it's finally announced. Well then, it's probably okay to cry a little today, isn't it?' added even more legendary color to this game.

"Brawling, items, and a fighting game without 100% health or input commands!" Hearing Chen Xu's words, Qin Yi and the others all exclaimed in astonishment. This completely subverted their understanding of fighting games.

However, another question quickly arose in their minds. "But Mr. Chen, with this design, while the lower skill floor is reduced, won't the game lack depth?" Qin Yi and the others were somewhat concerned.

It's true that a game needs a simple barrier to entry; fighting games lost market share precisely because their barrier to entry was too high. Consider a game, especially one with competitive elements, where if your skills aren't up to par, you'll be constantly beaten, receiving no positive feedback whatsoever. At the same time, the learning curve is steep, with over a dozen or even twenty characters, each requiring you to memorize various input commands for every skill, from minor to ultimate. In the early days, with fewer game choices, you might actively learn how to play such a game, but with plenty of other games available, would you still choose it? This is why more and more games are starting to simplify. However, simplification doesn't automatically mean good, because if a game lacks depth, it will become a casual game. And as a fighting game, without these traditional mechanics, wouldn't it lose its depth?

Just like in God of War, players no longer need to manually execute combos; instead, they are given a one-button combo function. For an action-oriented game like God of War, what would be left to play? Merely watching the story unfold? Or grinding for high-stat equipment to overpower enemies?
