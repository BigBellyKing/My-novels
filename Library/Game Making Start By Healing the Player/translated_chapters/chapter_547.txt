# Chapter 546: Giving Players a Good Meal Before They Depart (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

It wasn't just Song Ren alone; thanks to the previous popularity of `Human: Fall Flat`, coupled with the trust in Nebula Games and Chen Xu.

And from the preview screens, compared to the goofy noodle-limbed figures of before, these fluffy little animals were clearly more appealing to many players.

Especially some casual female players, who, upon seeing these adorable little animals, could be said to have no resistance whatsoever. Many tough guys were the same.

However, adorable as it was, `Party Animals`'s game operation mode, including its physics engine effects, adopted the exaggerated, goofy style of `Human: Fall Flat`.

At the same time, unlike `Human: Fall Flat`, which leaned towards puzzles, `Party Animals` is primarily a PVP game. Therefore, in terms of action complexity and difficulty, it was even harder than `Human: Fall Flat`.

The new player tutorial at the beginning of the game instantly became a nightmare for many players.

Especially the fences in the second level, whose placement was full of malice. When players freely operated into the second room at the start, they would basically instinctively rush forward recklessly.

And that was falling right into the trap!

Some players were directly stuck by ropes in the second level and then trapped, watching their adorable corgi in the game with its dog's head caught by two red ropes, struggling repeatedly but unable to break free, forcing them to desperately restart a new game.

Some made it to the second-to-last level, only to have their corgi's head bashed swollen by the thick spinning dog-beating stick, unable to roll past it.

Of course, most faced the final level, where a little crocodile with sunglasses and a medal resembling a gold chain around its neck, acting like a gang boss, was the nightmare of many rookie players. After headbutts and grabbing legs, they would watch their corgi get thrown out.

However, it was just a new player tutorial after all, and Chen Xu actually included dynamic difficulty adjustment for the little crocodile.

As the number of times players were thrown out increased, the crocodile's AI, already quite silly, became even sillier.

If players kept dying, the little crocodile in the game would even perform a small run and flying kick, actively sending itself out of bounds.

After all, this was just a new player tutorial; it couldn't keep players trapped there forever.

However, unless it was intentional, it was unlikely any player would trigger this last mechanism.

After entering the official game, players quickly discovered a fun point.

Although the game had PVP gameplay, it was quite joyful.

Firstly, there were the maps in the game. For example, the Martial Arts Arena was a huge arena where up to eight players competed. Besides that, there were also submarines and planes.

However, just like the Warzone mode in `Call of Duty: Modern Warfare`, as time progressed, the players' activity area would continuously shrink.

The Martial Arts Arena would release greenish poisonous gas, the plane's fuselage would ice over, causing players to slip, and the submarine would slowly submerge underwater.

At the same time, there would be various items in the game. While these items had great power when used against others, they could also pose a significant threat to oneself.

On live streaming platforms, different streamers even played the game with different unique characteristics.

………………

There were players watching the fire from across the bank.

In `Party Animals`, players could climb to a very high position.

And unlike `Human: Fall Flat`, climbing walls in `Party Animals` didn't require much skill; you just needed protrusions to grab onto.

"Look, everyone, my position is excellent! I'm lying on top of this big rock; no one has found me at all."

"Another one died. When the time comes, we can go down and harvest them! Let them know what a divine descent feels like!"

"Here they come, here they come! This crocodile is a bit fierce! A headbutt just sent that gray rabbit flying down!"

"Oh no! That otter is incredibly aggressive too; a mid-air flying kick sent the orange cat soaring!"

"Ugh! What's happening! Why am I dead! Why is my screen black!"

As a qualified field reporter, this player, who was excitedly narrating the live match, stared bewildered as his screen went black, then watched his corgi fall from the stone pillar in the game.

It wasn't until he saw the bullet comments in the live stream room that he understood what was going on.

"Damn it, the poisonous gas is coming from the left, right, and top! I was climbing at the very top and was actually constantly taking poison damage!"

………………

There were players playing dead.

In the game, as long as you weren't continuously knocked down, you wouldn't be killed.

Instead, you would just fall into an unconscious state. But at this time, just like `Human: Fall Flat`, as long as you didn't operate yourself, you could just lie on the ground and play dead.

A player on the plane map, knocked out by a small crocodile swinging a shovel, didn't get up. Instead, he had a look of smug satisfaction.

"Did you see that, everyone? In such a chaotic situation, we just lie flat and play dead."

"Who would bother to notice a motionless corgi corpse, right?"

"We'll wait until they've almost finished fighting, then we'll go in and clean up the mess."

This player was very pleased with himself. What was this called? The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind!

But the next moment, a dark, grubby battery flew from somewhere and landed on him.

Then he saw his little corgi let out a miserable 'ugh-ah', and then began twitching all over due to the electric current, twitching until it fell off the plane.

What happened? Where did this electricity come from?

This player also looked bewildered.

………………

There were also players who painfully lost a good situation due to misusing weapons.

"Invincible, invincible! With this nunchaku, who can stop me!"

Also on the plane level, this player held a nunchaku in his hand, constantly brandishing it.

Everyone who approached him was flung away with a single strike.

Watching the majestic little crocodile in the game, this player was full of confidence.

But the next moment, something that took him aback happened.

He saw the nunchaku in the game, swinging around, hit himself on the forehead, and then the little crocodile immediately fainted.

At this point, other players nearby saw this scene, rushed over, and picked up his crocodile.

"Off you go!"

Watching his little crocodile being thrown off the plane, he mentally pictured a line of dialogue.

………………

Soon, `Party Animals`'s sales and reviews on the Nebula Games Platform began to surge.

And they were uniformly positive reviews.

Furthermore, under the influence of `Human: Fall Flat` and `Party Animals`, these two truly joyful casual game types,

Although they were just two small games, they attracted many users who were not previously part of the Nebula Games Platform.

After all, besides the more core player base, there are still many casual player bases in the world.

They might have heard of some products and IPs under Nebula Games, but they didn't know what Nebula Games was or what the Nebula Games Platform was.

And every time a game manages to break out of its niche and cause a phenomenal performance, it attracts these light-level blue ocean users.

As for the core fan players, especially some of Chen Xu's old fans, they all sighed with emotion.

"This time, Chen Xu has really changed!"

"When he says fun, it's fun, and with such efficient two consecutive releases!"

"Just thinking about the feeling of playing `Human: Fall Flat` and `Party Animals`, it was truly so happy!"

Meanwhile, within Nebula Games, looking at the internet full of players' enthusiastic laughter, Meng Zuo, who was responsible for the new Mario title on Switch and the subsequent `Resident Evil`, couldn't help but sigh, feeling a growing worry for the players deep down.

How should he put it?

"Condemned prisoners in ancient times were given a good meal before their execution in autumn."
