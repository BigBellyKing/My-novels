Chapter 144: Players Will Eventually Understand Their True Feelings (Seventh Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

After completing the `It Takes Two` concept draft explanation, the entire team began operating efficiently.

Art assets such as characters and related actions had already been produced before the New Year.

The team's main work now is focused on scene levels and story presentation.

Their own warehouse, the big tree in the courtyard, the corroded garden, the first love's snow globe, a medieval castle built with Lego toys...

Chen Xu explained the characteristics of each themed scene in the game to Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue.

These themed scenes in the game are not just simple backgrounds; they also symbolize the different emotional journeys and changes of the two protagonists, Xiaomei and Cody.

“The Cuckoo Clock level needs to have a sharp metallic feel. At the same time, the special item functions in this level are all time-based, hinting that Cody and Xiaomei can start over.”

“The Snow Globe here is a metaphor for Cody and Xiaomei's relationship. Their feelings were once as hot as fire, but now they are completely frozen, just like the scene inside the snow globe.”

“But the melting ice at the end of the Snow Globe level is also a metaphor, indicating that the layer of ice that froze Xiaomei and Cody's relationship now has hope of breaking.”

“Similarly, the Magnets in this level show that Cody and Xiaomei's relationship, from being initially repulsive to now attractive, is getting closer and closer.”

Chen Xu explained each scene in great detail, ensuring that Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue understood the effect he wanted.

After fully presenting the requirements for the scenes and the deeper meaning of the plot.

They wouldn't need to rack their brains thinking too much; they could just follow the existing requirements and make some detailed modifications based on Chen Xu's simple draft.

There was no need for second or third versions, or to restart previous work.

Even though it wasn't their first time experiencing this, having already deeply felt it during the development of `Dark Souls`, the employees in the art team were still greatly moved.

Such a work experience, not to mention Nebula Games' generous benefits, even if they were slightly below average, would still leave no reason for anyone to leave.

As `It Takes Two` development progressed, after the New Year, many players on major gaming forums and communities felt a bit lost, falling into a `game drought`.

Although some game companies released new titles during this period, the `Dark Souls` from before the New Year, and TengHua and NetDragon's two VR blockbusters, had already spoiled their appetites.

“Boring! Any new game recommendations, everyone?”

“None. The few that launched recently don't look very good!”

“No choice. Although TengHua and NetDragon have some studios with new games, I don't think the quality is that great.”

“Yeah, at least we had `Overcooked` around this time last year. This year, there's nothing.”

“Don't even mention `Overcooked`. Because of `Overcooked`, I've been washing dishes for a whole year!”

“Speaking of which, it's already after the New Year. Why hasn't Chen Xu made any moves yet?”

“Yeah, all the developers at the Game of the Year event had new game announcements, but Chen Xu hasn't done anything. Besides the new `Dark Souls` mode before, he hasn't even let out a fart since then.”

“I bet he's waiting for a big move; a `Dark Souls` sequel might just be around the corner!”

“`Dark Souls` is too hard. I'd rather play some family-friendly games, like `Fall Guys`.”

Not only were players discussing it in major communities, but Chen Xu's official Weibo account also had people @-mentioning him daily, asking about follow-up project news from Nebula Games.

Many players were particularly looking forward to a `Dark Souls` sequel.

Seeing all the players @-mentioning him, Chen Xu thought about it and decided to reveal some news.

He immediately sent out an official Weibo post with the following content.

‘A new game is already in development: a couple's co-op game that will let you experience a warm and friendly game. There will be the latest news on Valentine's Day. Stay tuned.’

Chen Xu also included an image: a clay doll and a wooden doll holding a dandelion, floating in the air.

This official Weibo post exploded the moment it was released, attracting countless replies from players following Chen Xu's activities.

‘Holy crap, look what I refreshed! A new game is coming!?’

‘Wait! Couple's co-op? Valentine's Day! WTF! Chen Xu, do you know I just got a girlfriend and you're eager to make me single!?’

‘From the image, the cartoon style looks very friendly, but the blood and tears of `Overcooked` tell us this is a huge trap!’

‘Once a year, it's Valentine's Day again this year, isn't it!’

‘It's that time of year again to bring up old memes. Everyone, fill in the blank: Chen Xu's nickname is ____?’

‘Last year's `Overcooked` made me do all the dishes at home. This year, you want me to do all the laundry, don't you?’

Players erupted, as a game with similar rhetoric at this time last year had left too deep an impression on them.

However, despite the talk, discussions about ‘Chen Xu's’ new game continued to rise on gaming media websites.

And in the gaming industry, the news also spread.

‘Heard about it? Chen Xu's new game is another two-player co-op type.’

‘Not a `Dark Souls` sequel?’

‘It's probably a transitional mini-game, like `Overcooked` last year, right?’

‘I wonder if Chen Xu's game, still nameless this year, can break new ground?’

‘What are you thinking? Two-player co-op, it's just `Overcooked` from last year with a different theme and mode. What new tricks could it possibly play?’

Discussions about Chen Xu's new game were ongoing both within the industry and among players, but the main impression still revolved around last year's `Overcooked`.

After all, with the timing and the rhetoric, it was hard not to think that way.

However, Chen Xu remained unaffected. Once the game officially launched, all the ‘grievances’ would be cleared, and players would ultimately understand his true intentions, knowing why he was called: the `Warrior of Love`!

***

Amidst the players' eager discussions, time quickly arrived at February 14th, Valentine's Day.

At noon that day, Chen Xu and Nebula Games' official Weibo accounts simultaneously released a post.

The message was very simple: `Trailer`.

Three words, followed by a video.

After clicking, a brief black screen was followed by a wooden door appearing in the frame.

As the wooden door opened, a book with facial features appeared before the camera.

At its top, it read ‘book of love’.

‘This is a story about a magical kingdom.’

The Book of Love extended its hands, seemingly welcoming the players watching the video, and at the same time, the camera quickly pulled back.

Lighthouses, bell towers, and a cartoon art style made the entire scene appear dreamlike.

‘Among them are many wizards and warriors.’

The camera moved into a room where two doll figures, one of clay and one of wood, each dressed in wizard robes and armor, held burning greatswords and battled a cartoon monster in what looked like a gladiatorial arena.

‘This epic legend takes place on the high seas.’

Small sailboats, shaped like building blocks, sailed on the ocean, dodging wide-mouthed sharks and colossal, tentacled octopus monsters.

‘And it's also a time-traveling journey.’

Roads made of countless gears seemed to be inside a grandfather clock.

‘Biubiubiu! It even includes a winter dream, like going on a sled ride.’

On an icy and snowy racetrack, a sled moved forward at high speed.

The next moment, countless fragmented scenes flashed by: railway tracks through a tunnel, dodging spiders in a forest, facing bats on platforms.

‘Wait... did I mention there would also be a big explosion?’

A platform seemingly built from brass pipes, with a rumble, saw massive flames erupt, pushing two doll figures away with a powerful shockwave.

‘Hold on, look at these dolls... I almost forgot they used to be human.’

The camera froze on the two blown-away dolls, and at the same time, a photograph appeared.

A man and a woman, dressed in a wedding dress and suit, stood smiling in front of a cake.

But the photograph was split in half, separating them.

‘Alright, alright... do you want to know what the theme of this story truly is?’

‘This is Cody and Xiaomei's story.’

The camera showed the two panicking dolls.

‘Want to change back? Then you'll first have to fix your relationship...’

‘This is a story about passion...’

‘This is a story about attraction...’

‘This is a story about cooperation...’

Following a series of game screens flashing by, Nebula Games' LOGO finally appeared.

The game title was revealed: `It Takes Two`.

20,000+ words, no broken promises~ Releasing a massive update upon launch doesn't count as a burst update; daily burst updates are the real deal~ Striving to continue tomorrow, please turn your short into long!
