Chapter 19: Shock

As a game editor, even though Wu Tian hadn't been on the job for long.

Still, when it came to games, Wu Tian had played many.

From the current content of Undertale, Wu Tian could clearly perceive some of its characteristics.

First was the game's quality, which, of course, wasn't about the content but purely the external quality, such as graphics and operational experience.

Undertale, in his opinion, was only passable, not much different from a typical Independent Game.

But regarding content, Wu Tian could only say that Undertale, as it currently felt to him, wasn't great.

The puzzle content, though only for the tutorial level, was quite dull and uninteresting.

It was just pushing rocks and pressing levers.

As for the combat phase, the game offered some dialogue options, such as "Mercy."

Players didn't have to defeat the monsters.

Based on Wu Tian's gaming experience, this was nothing more than a honor value system.

High honor value meant a good ending preference, while low honor value meant a bad ending.

There were no special settings, and the game's plot itself felt like a generic dungeon crawling template.

After eliminating some small monsters blocking his way and seeing the post-combat prompts, Wu Tian continued his journey without overthinking it.

As a game editor, his approach was to first complete a playthrough to experience the entire process.

Although a relatively peaceful solution was possible, Wu Tian still chose the simplest method: combat.

After all, in an RPG, isn't fighting monsters to level up perfectly normal?

As he progressed, Toriel frequently appeared in the game, asking the protagonist what they liked to eat and what they were allergic to.

As he explored further, Wu Tian lightly sighed and shook his head.

He had a feeling that the appearance of Mirror (Game) was simply an accident.

After all, the current Undertale felt like a chicken rib to him – playable, but nothing that truly captivated him.

There were no unknown areas left to explore in the entire castle, no surprising puzzles, no captivating plotlines.

He simply found the door leading to the underworld.

After triggering this plot point, Toriel, who had previously saved the protagonist, stated that the outside world was very dangerous, and if they insisted on leaving, they would have to prove their ability to protect themselves.

Upon agreeing, the game entered the combat phase.

The mother goat Toriel, who had previously saved the protagonist, stopped her from leaving, stating that if she insisted on going, she would have to prove her ability to protect herself.

Just like previous battles, combat against Toriel also offered the "Mercy" option.

Unlike ordinary monsters, Wu Tian quite liked Toriel.

So he didn't attack, but he soon found that the "Mercy" option was useless.

After clicking it several times, Toriel continued to attack relentlessly.

So, could he only fight back?

Or would it be a plot-kill scenario, where he'd empty Toriel's health bar to trigger a cutscene?

Wu Tian speculated internally, while simultaneously attempting to attack Toriel.

The first strike depleted about one-tenth of her health.

The second strike depleted a small portion of her health again.

With the third strike, something that stunned him occurred.

Because with that one strike, Toriel's health bar was instantly emptied.

The defeated Toriel knelt on one knee, still caring for the protagonist, and urged him to leave quickly.

She then disintegrated into fragments and vanished into thin air.

“What's going on? How did she die? Isn't this supposed to be a preferred way to play? Or do I need to keep choosing Mercy?”

Although the game gave no hints, as an expert gamer, Wu Tian quickly considered the possible game mechanics.

Therefore, to prove his theory, Wu Tian loaded his previous save.

Following the previous pattern, he started the battle again.

This time, Wu Tian no longer attacked proactively, but instead continuously clicked "Mercy."

As the rounds progressed, Toriel's attacks became increasingly fierce, and Wu Tian accidentally ran into one of her attacks.

His health was reduced to a mere sliver.

But the following scene confirmed Wu Tian's theory.

That was, in the game, Toriel's attacks would actively avoid the heart symbol representing the protagonist.

Even when Wu Tian tried to deliberately move into her attacks, she would dodge.

“So that's how it is! Players have to wait a certain number of turns, but Toriel won't kill the player.”

“Compared to the previous scenario where Toriel was killed, this has some ironic implications, especially coupled with the setting that Toriel's attacks will avoid the player. This aspect is somewhat similar to the plot in Mirror (Game), exploring good versus evil and human morality.”

As a game editor, Wu Tian also critiqued the game from some deeper perspectives.

After avoiding Toriel's attacks and clicking "Mercy" 14 times consecutively.

Listening to the cheerful in-game music and watching the post-battle cutscene, Wu Tian shook his head again.

In the game, Toriel finally stopped blocking the determined protagonist, instead gently embracing them and actively escorting them out of the castle.

“After all, he's a new Game Designer. This plot trigger setting is still too crude. It actually requires clicking 'Mercy' so many times. Although it's meant to prevent players from noticing, still...” Wu Tian shook his head.

“Moreover, if the intention is for players not to notice, then the design where the bullet hell actively dodges actually exposes it, telling players it's a plot-kill. It's like 'taking off your pants to fart'.”

Reflecting on Toriel's battle mechanics, Wu Tian also criticized this aspect.

In his view, if only one of these designs had been implemented, it would have been acceptable.

Employing both, however, was counterproductive.

But the next scene immediately froze him in his chair.

Because the scene before him completely overturned his judgment!

Flowey, who had previously tried to kill the protagonist, reappeared.

What shocked Wu Tian wasn't the character Flowey, but the lines it spoke.

“Smart! Ve~ry~ smart!!”

“You really think you're so clever, don't you?”

“In this world, it's kill or be killed!”

“That's why you can do whatever you want.”

“You're very happy, aren't you?”

“Because you just spared a life?”

“Hehehe, but don't act so self-important!”

“Because... I know everything, I know what you've done!”

“You've already killed her!”

“But you regretted it, so you went back in time, wanting to try again.”

“Hahahaha... you're truly a naive fool. Do you think you're the only being with this power?”

“This power to reshape the world... comes entirely from your own determination, the ability to play God, the ability to SAVE.”

“I thought I was the only one with that power, but... I can't SAVE anymore.”

“Clearly your desire for this world surpasses mine.”

“Alright, alright, enjoy this power while you still have it.”

“I'll be watching you!”

“Hehehehehe...”
