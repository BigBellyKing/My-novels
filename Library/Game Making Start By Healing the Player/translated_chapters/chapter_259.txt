Chapter 258: Diablos, I Will Be Back! (Fifth update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)

'Speaking of the Fire Dragon and the Horned Dragon, they must be the Rathalos and Diablos, right?'

'The only path we can take is to hunt those two monsters and stand at the apex of the ecosystem...!'

Standing beside the bun-haired receptionist, Song Ren accepted the Diablos quest from these two missions.

"Could you please stop using 'we'? From start to finish, you haven't contributed a single bit to fighting the dragon; you've just been a drag the whole time. That old lady who fought the Odogaron before, she saved you once, and you cried and promised never to mess around again. I've saved your damn ass so many times, and you still do whatever you want!" Song Ren looked at the bun-haired receptionist's words and finally couldn't help but complain.

He had initially thought this receptionist would be a great helper, but she turned out to be completely useless!

Whenever he saw her, all she was doing was eating.

Sometimes when he occasionally returned from the wild, he'd even see her rummaging through his item box, and she'd always be chewing on something; he didn't need to be a genius to know she was sneaking food.

At that moment, Song Ren recalled that when "Monster Hunter: World" was being promoted, Chen Xu's official Weibo account had published introductions to various dragon species.

Among them, he remembered a monster called the 'Gluttonous Tyrant,' whose attribute was gluttony; it seemed to be called Deviljho.

This bun-haired receptionist of yours is practically a Deviljho cub! Eating all day, every day!

Of course, if it were just eating, that would be one thing, but the key is she's also an expert monster attractor.

Small Jagras, Great Jagras, Legiana, Odogaron—go on, open up Deviljho next time, I dare you!

After accepting the quest, finishing his Felyne Canteen meal, and arriving at the Wildspire Waste where the Diablos resided, Song Ren couldn't help but sigh deeply as he looked at the bun-haired receptionist beside him.

What a good-for-nothing!

When would he finally encounter a truly capable NPC Hunter teammate?

"Forget it, just stay put in the base, and I'll be satisfied if you don't cause me any trouble." Song Ren looked at the bun-haired receptionist and couldn't help but sigh with exasperation at her lack of ambition.

Fully stocked with Antidotes and Potions, Song Ren set off to track down the Diablos.

After a brief detour around the Wildspire Waste, Song Ren soon triggered a cutscene.

A dragon, walking on the sand, its entire body covered in armor, approached him.

However, it wasn't the Diablos, but the Barroth, which he'd encountered before, thick-skinned and mud-slinging.

Just then, the entire Wildspire Waste began to tremble violently.

Some of the surrounding Hatebirds were startled and flew into the air.

The Barroth ahead also seemed to sense something; a look of terror on its face, it glanced around before attempting to flee.

But the next moment, the ground beneath the Barroth suddenly shattered.

A massive monster burst out from underground!

Amidst rolling dust, the monster's colossal figure was faintly visible.

This was the largest monster Song Ren had seen so far, second only to the Zorah Magdaros; even the Nergigante and Rathalos he'd faced before weren't as big as it was.

Song Ren had originally thought the Barroth was quite massive, but compared to the monster before him, it was still just a younger brother.

It possessed a colossal body with two extremely thick, long horns, and its armor appeared as hard as rock.

Its tail was bifurcated, resembling a hammer, and looked incredibly formidable.

While Song Ren was still marveling, the Barroth was directly pinned to the ground and dragged by this colossal creature that had burst from underground.

Although the Barroth struggled continuously, it was no match for this behemoth.

Then, the Diablos's claws continuously scraped the ground, and amidst swirling dust, both the Barroth and Diablos vanished before Song Ren.

However, the sandy ground ahead also began to collapse, and the Hunter in the game desperately tried to climb out.

But the quicksand kept flowing into the hole, and eventually, the Hunter fell heavily into the underground cavern.

Rising from the yellow sand, the Hunter coughed while surveying the situation in the cavern.

Yellow sand still rustled down from the entrance, like a waterfall of sand encircling the Hunter.

Through the yellow sand, he could vaguely make out the Barroth lying motionless not far away.

Besides that, there were many white bones, though it was unclear what creatures they belonged to.

At this point, the quicksand stopped.

In the underground cavern, the Diablos, having just dealt with the Barroth, clearly noticed an uninvited guest.

The Diablos turned its head, glaring at Song Ren with hostile eyes, and simultaneously let out a massive Dragon Roar.

Under the immense Dragon Roar, the Hunter in the game covered his ears and shook his head, and the yellow sand above him rustled down again, vibrated by the sound waves.

"Oh my god! Isn't this Diablos a vegetarian? Why is it so fierce?!"

Looking at the enormous Diablos before him, Song Ren felt completely numb; he finally understood one thing now.

That is, the Diablos is indeed a vegetarian, but being a vegetarian doesn't mean it doesn't kill!

The Barroth was just minding its own business, walking along; who did it provoke?

You, Diablos, suddenly burst from the ground and took out the Barroth.

If you were going to eat it, that would be one thing, but why are you, a cactus-eating herbivore, so ferocious!

The world is so wonderful, wouldn't it be better if we had a little more love?

Song Ren looked at the Diablos before him, completely bewildered.

Isn't this Diablos a bit too massive?!

He strongly suspected that the Odogaron, which had given him some trouble before, would be flattened into a meat patty with a single slap if it stood before the Diablos.

"Don't panic! Song Ren, you can do this!"

"The vegetarian Diablos only looks a little fierce! Large in body, vulnerable from behind; hairy, weak to fire. This Diablos must be very clumsy, and when facing a huge monster, you're sure to win as long as you attack its vitals!"

Song Ren cheered himself on, thinking of the usual strategies for facing BOSSes in "Dark Souls."

Just then, the Diablos before him let out a Dragon Roar, then charged straight over, intent on eliminating the uninvited guest who had brazenly entered its nest.

Accompanied by the Diablos's roar, although the distance was considerable, the Hunter in the game instinctively covered his ears and fell into a stun lock.

The roaring Diablos paused for a second, then grunting, charged towards Song Ren.

"Oh my god, a Dragon Charge right off the bat! And the damage!" A mistake prevented him from dodging, and seeing the Hunter sent flying, Song Ren was utterly shocked.

The so-called Dragon Charges he'd encountered from other dragons before actually didn't have much killing power.

For example, with the Barroth that the Diablos had taken down earlier, its so-called Dragon Charge was all bark and no bite.

But the Diablos's Dragon Charge before him was entirely different.

It truly made Song Ren understand what brutality felt like.

One hit, and half his health was gone!

Fortunately, his Palico companion triggered a skill and, in a friendly and thoughtful manner, somehow produced a Vigorwasp for healing.

Quickly getting up from the ground, Song Ren stepped forward, pressed the interact button, pulled out a dagger from his pocket, cut the Vigorwasp open, and refilled his health.

At the same time, the Diablos in the distance began pawing the ground with both feet again, charging fiercely.

However, this time Song Ren was already experienced.

With a nimble roll, he dodged the Diablos's Dragon Charge, simultaneously drawing his Long Sword from his back and brutally slashing at the Diablos's tail.

Since his sharpness was at its highest, and with a bit of luck, this strike didn't bounce, but the single-digit damage clearly showed just how thick the monster's hide was.

With the second strike, Song Ren heard a crisp 'ding' sound; his weapon had bounced.

But the next moment, the Diablos's thick tail swung, sweeping him away.

This health bar once again gave him the feeling he had when playing Dark Souls.

With continuous attacks, Song Ren still managed to find the Hitzone on the Diablos's body that his Long Sword could damage.

But the crucial thing was that this Diablos—Song Ren wasn't sure if it was Nebula Games' AI performance or if the monster was designed this way—

Song Ren only felt that this Diablos could attack with every part of its body.

There was simply no way to get close.

Tail swings, hind leg kicks, plus a Dragon Charge—it was impossible to even get started.

As soon as he was a little further away, Song Ren found that the Diablos immediately unleashed a Dragon Charge.

A slight brush or hit, and half his health disappeared.

At the same time, this Diablos had another special move: it could burrow underground, then charge and attack from below.

This move was incredibly difficult to dodge.

Even rolling wasn't foolproof.

If he wasn't careful, he'd be sent flying into the sky, and the damage was just as high, not inferior to a Dragon Charge, instantly taking half his health bar.

Occasionally, when he managed to get into the Diablos's blind spot, his Long Sword strikes didn't hit a weak point or a normal damage spot.

Instead, they hit the hard armor, not only triggering the weapon bounce mechanism but also dealing white, single-digit damage.

The 'ding-ding-ding' sound was quite pleasant to listen to, but the key was he didn't *want* to hear it!

After fighting for over ten minutes, the Diablos was still full of vigor.

Song Ren estimated that the damage he had dealt to the Diablos was, at most, six to seven hundred points.

And most of that damage was probably inflicted by his Palico companion.

His entire time was spent dodging Dragon Charges and creating distance to drink potions.

At the same time, this Diablos also had a move called: Dragon Roar.

Compared to the Anjanath's roar from before, this Diablos's roar was incredibly powerful.

Looking at the fierce Diablos before him, Song Ren took a deep breath.

He had to admit, he was in trouble again; this was the strongest opponent he had ever encountered.

High health, high attack, high defense, very aggressive, and a very large attack range.

From every aspect, the Diablos before him was simply too powerful.

"Alright, Diablos, you big brute, I've seen through all your moves!"

"You just wait right there, don't run! I'll be back with teammates to settle this score!"

"If you've got guts, then stay here and don't run!"

"Diablos! I will be back!"

Looking at the Diablos before him, Song Ren spoke with the fiercest tone.

Simultaneously, four large characters appeared on the screen.

**[EXHAUSTED AND COLLAPSED!]**

The remaining two updates will be a bit later~
