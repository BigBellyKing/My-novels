Chapter 56: The Importance of Breaking Out of Its Niche for Sales

Inside Nebula Games' office, everyone was also quite concerned about the situation of Outlast.

After all, this time, Outlast could be said to be the team's initial attempt.

Moreover, the investment cost was not small; the research and development costs, along with its popularity promotion costs, amounted to 7 million Yuan.

Among first and second-tier game developers, it wouldn't be considered a huge investment.

However, it had already exceeded the scope of an Independent Game.

Therefore, everyone was very attentive to Outlast's performance.

“Mr. Chen, what's the situation with Outlast?!”

“Yeah, it's already been two days since its launch.”

In the office, during lunch break, Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, Qin Yi, and others asked Chen Xu, who was leaning back in a massage chair.

Although online player reviews and Outlast's popularity were both very high.

However, for a game, Sales Volume are far more important.

If it only earns praise but doesn't sell well, or if the entire project ends up losing money, then the game can't continue.

Just like 'Bayonetta (game series)' in his previous life, it was hailed as the only game capable of competing after the three major ACTs: Ninja Gaiden, God of War, and Devil May Cry.

Yet, its IP changed hands multiple times, and the third sequel has been anticipated for countless years without a trace.

The main reason, naturally, was that it earned praise but didn't sell well, with meager sales.

Witch Time and Bayonetta, both were considered classics by players, yet not many copies were sold.

The first and second generations, even including the HD remastered 1+2 collection, had lower total sales than Devil May Cry V alone.

It can be said that the gaming industry is sometimes that unreasonable.

“It's pretty good. Excluding player refunds, current sales have already reached 130,000 copies. Recovering the costs within three days shouldn't be a problem,” Chen Xu said with a smile.

Compared to other games, Outlast's refund rate is notably high.

However, this was also within Chen Xu's expectations.

After all, it's a horror game, and a very scary one at that. It's perfectly normal for players to be too scared to play it.

Chen Xu had already considered this aspect before development.

“But our own Nebula Games platform only sold a little over 2,000 copies,” Yang Xin said with a hint of regret.

Although Chen Xu hadn't explicitly said it, from the current allocation of resources within Nebula Games towards the Nebula Games platform,

some farsighted team members internally could more or less guess what was happening.

“The discounts aren't enough, nor is the fame, and Outlast isn't quite attractive enough. This needs to be a gradual process,” Chen Xu said, not feeling much disappointment.

Building a game platform isn't achieved in a day, especially since the Parallel World had long entered the internet age.

In his previous life, Microsoft and Sony's battle in the console gaming market saw each side win and lose in the first three eras.

Although Microsoft was always teased by Sony fans, saying they 'won in the future',

they still achieved certain advantages. However, the key was that Microsoft lost to Sony in the most crucial generation.

That was the internet era when the PS4 arrived.

During this period, the internet developed rapidly, digital games became increasingly convenient, and player social features emerged. In this era, Sony winning the console war could be said to have laid a solid foundation for itself.

Even if Microsoft, with its deep pockets, acquired major game companies and launched subscription services in the next generation, it was still overshadowed by Sony.

Similarly, on the PC platform, Epic, relying on Fortnite and paving the way with money, gained a large number of users, but the platform itself was still operating at a loss.

One reason was the lack of exclusive games appealing enough to players, and the other was Steam's immense advantage accumulated during the internet era.

This includes how Tencent in his previous life was able to surpass veterans like Shanda and NetEase in the gaming industry; it can be said that the foundation of instant messaging accounts for at least 70% of its success.

Therefore, Chen Xu was very clear that becoming an industry giant in the platform sector couldn't be achieved with just one or two games; it required a gradual, step-by-step approach.

Although he had a clear understanding of future plans, Chen Xu didn't dwell on it too much at the moment. Instead, he changed the subject: “Currently, Outlast's potential hasn't been fully tapped. Next, Outlast will usher in a period of sales explosion.”

“Eh?!” Hearing Chen Xu's words, Ruan Ningxue and the others were curious.

“The surge in live streaming and video platforms will drive more player curiosity,” Chen Xu said with a smile.

For a horror game, if you want to boost its sales, it must break out of its niche.

Of course, 'breaking out of its niche' here doesn't mean leaving the general gaming circle, but rather leaving the circle of horror enthusiast players.

If a horror game is confined to horror game enthusiasts, it's destined not to achieve significant sales.

Just like successful horror games in his previous life, Resident Evil — with Leon, Ada, and later the Hand Sanitizer Warrior, Lady Dimitrescu, and the Fly Swatter MOD memes — all contributed to its high popularity.

Secondly, games like Five Nights at Freddy's even achieved the top spot for weekly views on YouTube.

Even more familiar titles for ordinary players like Silent Hill and Outlast largely benefited from movies, live streams, and videos to break out of their niche, reaching audiences beyond just horror enthusiasts.

As for equally excellent titles like the Fatal Frame series, Siren, Clock Tower, and The Evil Within, beyond true horror game enthusiasts, many ordinary players might not have even heard of them.

Breaking out of the horror game enthusiasts' circle is a prerequisite for a horror game to be a big seller, and the same can be applied to horror movies.

Because many players and viewers are not pure horror game or movie enthusiasts.

They are simply curious as to why a game or a movie can make people so scared.

If you watch a movie, you can't get a refund for the ticket. While games can be refunded after purchase, there are also quite a few players who, even if they don't want to play, won't bother with a refund.

After all, if they bought the game, why should they spend time playing it?

This is also why the completion rate for horror games is generally very low.

And now, with 130,000 sales in two days, it can be said to be very good.

Moreover, Chen Xu was well aware that this was just the beginning.

It's foreseeable that as time progresses, its sales growth will become increasingly higher.

Because, as of now, the popularity on live streaming platforms and video platforms has not yet fully fermented.

This also means that Outlast's potential has not yet reached its peak.

………………

Just as Chen Xu said, Outlast's popularity did not immediately spread widely among the general player base.

However, on live streaming platforms, many players who loved to watch drama began to frequent various live streams.

Some streamers who were in a game drought and had no good games to stream were recommended this newly released game.

“Streamer, go play Outlast! It's the new work by the designer of To the Moon, a very heartwarming game!”

“Streamer, do you want to try Outlast? It's a very hot game recently!”

“Yeah, yeah, and Outlast has great entertainment value. Someone in the neighboring section streamed it, and their popularity broke 3 million, plus they had twice as many VIPs as usual.”

Many streamers who didn't pay much attention to the gaming scene were also attracted for various reasons.

Some were drawn by the fact that it was a new game from the designer of To the Moon, while others saw other streamers playing Outlast and thought the effect was quite good.

Of course, whatever the reason, these streamers all jumped into the big pit of Outlast.

And live streaming platforms also kicked up a storm.
