Chapter 849: Counter-Terrorist Game?

Nebula Games' efficiency could be said to be the highest in the gaming industry.

Although `Payday` wasn't considered a huge project, merely a PVE game primarily focused on multiplayer online co-op, with levels typically based on single maps like `Rainbow Six`. Yet, a considerable number of people were involved. Unlike previous projects, Chen Xu didn't personally lead this one. He had other, more important matters to attend to: leveraging his influence, like using a 'Face-Face Fruit', on domestic and international game developers such as FOW and Atari.

Moreover, in the early stages, `Payday` didn't require much of his personal work; it was more about conceptual content. This wasn't a conventional FPS game; one could say it was an RPG game cloaked in an FPS skin. In the game, as players acquire money and experience, they can develop different playstyles across various character classes, featuring evasion, temporary invincibility, vampirism… it's definitely not a serious game. However, according to Chen Xu, on the surface, this game should not appear farcical; instead, it must be an extremely hardcore experience.

During this period, Nebula Games' overseas branch conducted on-site inspections and visits, uploading relevant information to the database. The countries visited were a bit... sensitive. With the security team ensuring their safety, the group traveled to places like Brazil, Mexico, Belgium, Chile, as well as areas notorious for looting like Michigan and Detroit. They engaged in discussions with local police, learning about various small and large-scale robberies that had occurred, and gaining an in-depth understanding of the criminals' methods and the police's response. Most local police forces were quite cooperative; on one hand, Nebula Games' reputation preceded them, and on the other, these inquiries weren't made for free. Things like police cars and heaters were discreetly exchanged, or else, how could they have been so cooperative? The results were quite gratifying; through studying these materials, the theoretical knowledge of Nebula Games' core development team members, such as Qin Yi, Yang Xin, and Ruan Ningxue, rapidly increased.

………………

Nebula Games' actions overseas quickly caught the attention of relevant media. After all, many industry media outlets continue to follow Nebula Games, and this series of actions was quite significant. As soon as the news broke, it instantly triggered speculation in the gaming community.

'What's going on with Nebula Games? Is Mr. Chen's travel bug acting up again?'

'Why even ask? He's definitely preparing for a new game! It's not like Mr. Chen hasn't done this before.'

'But `Elden Ring` just launched less than two months ago!'

'What's the big deal? Mr. Chen is a quick shooter!'

'So, `Assassin's Creed` is coming?! Or maybe something like `Uncharted`?'

'Bro upstairs, don't overthink it. Don't you guys read the news? This time Mr. Chen didn't even go; it was an operation by Nebula Games' overseas branch!'

'Exactly, exactly. And look at the places they went: Brazil, Mexico, and some Michigan State. They're all places and countries with poor public safety. How could that be `Assassin's Creed` or `Uncharted`?'

'Holy cow! Is Mr. Chen thinking making games is too slow, so he wants to do something big?'

'Can we please not talk about such dangerous topics? Also, I solemnly declare that I am completely unacquainted with the person above and have no knowledge of any remarks they may have made!'

'Speaking of which, does anyone else feel like this mode is familiar?'

'I think so. `Rainbow Six Siege`?'

'It doesn't feel impossible! Is a `Rainbow Six` sequel coming?'

Players online discussed animatedly, with all sorts of guesses. However, only three directions held significant credibility among the player base:

Firstly, Nebula Games was definitely planning a new project, though it was unknown if Chen Xu would lead it.

Secondly, the game would likely be an FPS-centric title.

Lastly, there was a high probability that this unknown game would be a counter-terrorism game, similar to `Rainbow Six` or `Call of Duty`.

Indeed, these speculations were well-founded. After all, aside from a few hardcore veteran players, `Rainbow Six` nowadays had little new blood, which is completely normal for a game. Just as a group of players debated whether this new game would be like `Call of Duty` or `Rainbow Six`, Nebula Games' official Weibo account finally released its first video.

But its content left countless players bewildered.

Because it was completely different from what they had imagined.

………………

In a dark room, a person whose face was obscured typed on a keyboard, with several monitors displaying data and surveillance footage.

'My contractors call me Bain. I operate an underground organization called crime.net. I find top-tier thieves, thugs, and tricksters, provide them with contracts, and prepare them for robberies.'

'They think they're working for themselves, but in reality, they can't see the bigger picture.'

'Although this is just a simple bank robbery, that's just the surface. The pladay gang did a lot of other things to pass my test.'

'They probably don't know that I'm training them to carry out the most unprecedented heist in the world.'

The next second, the scene shifted to a highway in Washington. A Jeep was driving, and a group of people inside the vehicle were laughing and chatting.

'Nice wig, Wolf! What made you decide to wear it?'

'Because I have a cool but highly recognizable bald head.'

'Chains, you take the lead; Wolf, stay alert; Dallas will handle the cameras for us, understood?'

'Of course.'

'Alright, let's get to work! Awooo!'

'Step on the gas, we need to hurry.'

From the dialogue, it wasn't clear what they were planning, but the visuals stunned countless players. As the three spoke, each person was checking their firearms. Good heavens, this was a group of professional robbers!

Why were they professional robbers? Because they all wore gloves that left no fingerprints, and they had meticulously checked their hair and other body hair, wearing special clothing to ensure nothing was left behind. From their preparations alone, it was clear they were not ordinary petty thieves.

As the car arrived at the First Bank in Washington, although the security was at its strongest that day, the key was that the bank would be verifying the cash reserves in the vault. They were waiting for the opportune moment when the vault door would open, a detail they had already obtained from an inside informant. With the surveillance suddenly losing control, the car stopped at the entrance of the First Bank. The already prepared robbers stormed into the bank from the vehicle. Their carefully planned operation, combined with knowledge of security positions seen through surveillance, allowed them to control the bank almost instantly, including the personnel transporting cash. These personnel clearly understood that the money they were transporting was insured, but their lives were not.

'Get down! All of you, *damn it*, get down!'

'Don't stall, hurry up!'

'Don't make any sudden moves! Ladies and gentlemen, we are only robbing the bank, not you. So calm down. Cooperate and you live; resist and you meet your God!'

Meanwhile, the SWAT team, having received the alarm, had rushed to the First Bank immediately and infiltrated from the rooftop. Just around a floor corner, the robbers and SWAT were about to meet.

And at that very moment, something happened that left countless players dumbfounded. The progress bar didn't hold up!

That was… it!
