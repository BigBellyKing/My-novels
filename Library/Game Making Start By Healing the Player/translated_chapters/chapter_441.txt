Chapter 440: Nathan Drake and Elena Fisher (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Song Ren was still immersed in the recent demolition... no, rather, it should be called an escape journey.

It was simply too thrilling.

However, Song Ren soon realized that the scenes he had found extremely perilous before were only just the beginning.

After escaping from the underground grand hall and boarding Sully's plane, Nathan Drake and Sam Drake arrived in Madagascar to search for new clues.

In terms of scenery, Madagascar could be considered one of the most beautiful landscapes in the game.

Distant volcanoes, blue skies with white clouds, and forests displayed the grandeur and beauty of the wilderness to players through exaggerated colors and clever filters, truly a breathtaking beauty.

There were also African towns, with bustling crowds and various vendors in the markets.

Old cars, pickup trucks, and some bicycles.

All of this closely resembled the scenes in many towns and cities across African countries.

Building complexes filled with African charm, lush trees, distant mountain peaks, and boats at the estuary.

With photo mode activated, almost every screenshot could be used as a wallpaper or poster, no matter the angle.

It can be said that, in terms of scene art and artistic achievement, the Madagascar segment was perfectly impeccable.

Besides the visual presentation, what left the deepest impression on players was undoubtedly the car chase level, iconic enough to be one of the most classic in the Uncharted series.

After Nathan Drake's "demolition" of the local bell tower and investigating several historically renowned pirates.

A chase battle began, first escaping from the town market under pursuit by armored vehicles.

Then they got into a Jeep and began a grand escape.

From the market, across the Cross-river Bridge, and into the wilderness.

Jumping from a speeding pickup truck onto Sam's motorcycle, they staged a scene where the older brother raced while the younger brother used a submachine gun to attack a tank. The entire sequence could only be described as breathtaking.

Especially at the very end, the moment Sam and Nathan, on their motorcycle, narrowly slipped under a truck, made one's heart pound wildly and all the hair on their body stand on end.

Many players who experienced this segment of the story were incredibly excited.

There were already many screenshots and videos of Uncharted circulating online.

Although it wasn't as good as the experience in VR immersive mode, just watching it could still make one feel a thrilling sensation.

“Holy cow, this Madagascar is so beautiful! I suddenly want to buy a Huanyu VR so I can travel in games!”

“The art is amazing, and that car chase sequence, there's absolutely no dull moment in the entire thing!”

“+1, I actually had to pee at the time, but I forcibly held it in for ten minutes because I just didn't want to stop!”

“Tough guy!”

The internet was filled with all sorts of player comments about Uncharted.

All of them were discussing the many intense and thrilling scenes in Uncharted.

And this was indeed the core element that immediately attracted players.

But Uncharted was absolutely more than just this.

In the beginning, many players were captivated by the beautiful scenery and the thrilling, grand scenes in the game.

But as the exploration continued and the plot deepened, many players gradually shifted their attention to the game's story, or rather, to Nathan Drake and Elena.

The main storyline's theme wasn't overly profound, but it successfully brought the characters to life.

Nathan Drake, in particular, made many players fall in love with his character as they played.

He was cynical and glib-tongued, seeming to tell endless lies when facing his wife, but in reality, he valued loyalty and righteousness, as his lies were built upon his concern for his loved ones.

He lied to keep Elena Fisher from worrying about him, and also to save his brother Sam.

He yearned for a thrilling treasure-hunting life, yet he would also restrain that desire for the sake of his family, for Elena.

As for Elena, as Nathan's wife, she understood her husband's personality well, even actively encouraging Nathan to take part in salvage work in more distant places.

Because she understood Nathan, when he lied to her, this meticulous woman immediately noticed something was amiss.

She even followed various clues and traces, arriving in Madagascar and finding Nathan.

Facing Elena, who had come looking for him, Nathan tried to explain with excuses.

However, Elena had already discerned everything. She wasn't angry that Nathan was again looking for treasure; she was angry that Nathan had used lies to deceive her, his wife.

So, a disappointed and heartbroken Elena left, leaving Nathan torn between his brother and the pirate treasure he yearned for, and his wife.

Ultimately, Nathan decided to continue the adventure with Sam, asking Sully to help look after Elena.

Sully, as the provider of the plane, Jeep, and a series of equipment, seemed like an old man.

But from their dialogue and interactions, it was clear he had a mentor-father relationship with Nathan, and when Nathan called him, he unreservedly offered his help.

“So Elena shouldn't end up separating from Nathan, right? Or maybe one of them got written out of the story?”

Watching this part of the story, Song Ren was still a little worried. After all, the game's developer was Chen Xu!

Don't let his jovial exterior fool you; he might stab a knife straight into your heart at any moment, leaving you breathless with pain.

“But Elena's tracking skills are simply unbelievable; she actually managed to find Nathan like that.”

“Living a normal life, Nathan definitely wouldn't be able to hide any private stash of money.”

“By the way, where should I hide my private stash of money in the future?”

Song Ren thought to himself, but he overlooked one thing at that moment: forget marriage.

He didn't even have a girlfriend.

After Madagascar, Uncharted's game narrative fully got on track. Treasure hunting, character relationships, and the Shoreline antagonists with Rafe made the pace incredibly tight.

The new game scene shifted to the high seas.

An isolated island and the endless sea once again captivated all players with their scenery.

It made one sigh with emotion that just looking at the scenery was worth it!

At the same time, the game's puzzle content also became slightly more complex here.

On the high seas, Nathan and his companions also encountered Shoreline Mercenaries, which was the very first scene of the demo content.

Nathan, having fallen from the ship, drifted to an isolated island, temporarily separated from Sam.

Starving and freezing, Nathan endured the stormy weather and found a cave where he could rest.

After a period of exploration in the jungle, Nathan finally reunited with Sam.

Here, Nathan and Sam had a brief argument.

Nathan, having survived the shipwreck and nearly died, felt that perhaps they should abandon this damned treasure and find another ship to return, maybe there would be other ways to save Sam.

But Sam showed an obsession with the treasure. However, amidst their argument, new clues were discovered.

The mark of the great pirate Henry Every.

New treasure clues, and the craving for treasure hunting deep in his bones—this made Nathan no longer mention abandoning the treasure. Instead, he eagerly continued hand-in-hand with Sam to seek it.

Finally, through a secret passage, Nathan and Sam found their target.

The legendary long-lost pirate utopia: Libertalia.

Green vegetation and crumbling buildings intertwined, and a sense of historical gravitas swept over them.

“Oh my God!”

Looking at Libertalia before him, Song Ren was once again shocked.

The lost city, sealed for hundreds of years, saw the light of day again through Nathan and Sam's discovery.

However, the subsequent plot brought an unexpected twist.

“Sam lied to Nathan?”

“There was no prison break at all; Sam had actually been out of prison for years, and he'd been with Rafe all this time, silently searching for the treasure!?”

Watching Nathan and Sam being driven to a dead end on a cliff by Rafe and the mercenaries in Libertalia, and then Rafe revealing the truth, Song Ren was utterly stunned.

What was going on!?

Why did Sam lie to Nathan? Why was Sam so obsessed with the treasure?

These questions lingered in Song Ren's mind, but before he could figure them out.

Rafe decided to kill Nathan, even though Sam blocked the fatal shot for Nathan.

But it also caused Nathan to fall off the cliff. Although a pool of lake water below saved Nathan's life, preventing his immediate death.

Yet, by the time he climbed up, he was already covered in wounds and immediately fainted.

And just then, an unexpected person appeared.

‘Nathan!’ A concerned voice reached his ears.
