Chapter 199: Arson Leads to Lifelong Imprisonment (Fifth Update, Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)

Looking at the game achievement that popped up, Wang Han felt utterly helpless. Her first playthrough hadn't even lasted five minutes before it ended?

Wasn't that a bit too quick?!

"It seems beehives aren't something I can mess with in the early game." Wang Han silently made a mental note of this, then started a new game.

This time, Wang Han noticed that besides Wilson, there were other characters to choose from in the game. Each character seemed to have their own unique traits. Of course, currently, she had only unlocked Wilson. The other characters either required specific conditions to be met or a certain number of days to be survived in the game.

Starting a new game, Wang Han quickly discovered something different.

"Huh! My spawn location changed?! Is the map randomly generated in the game, or do I just randomly appear at different places on the map?" Wang Han exclaimed, a look of surprise on her face.

Previously, her spawn point was mostly surrounded by trees and close to the sea. But now, her location had turned into something resembling a desert, and there were quite a few ores that she hadn't found before.

Just like her previous start, Wang Han began by 'picking up junk': berries, grass, twigs, and stones from the ground.

Then, methodically, Wang Han crafted an axe and a pickaxe. After chopping down two trees, she began mining the ores on the ground with her pickaxe.

Soon, materials like stone and flint were scattered everywhere. It was then that Wilson in the game spoke up again.

‘Some of these ores seem a bit different from ordinary ones. Maybe they contain something good.’

Seeing Wilson's dialogue in the game, Wang Han in front of the computer clearly noticed it too.

"Different from ordinary ores? Hey, there's an ore here with a lightning symbol!" Wang Han quickly spotted the difference.

The ores she had mined before were basically just large rocks with no patterns on their surface. But next to them was a slightly smaller large rock with a pattern resembling lightning.

Seeing this, Wang Han controlled Wilson to walk over with the pickaxe and started wildly banging on it. With a crisp sound, the rock cracked open, scattering materials like stone and flint, but among them was a piece of gold.

"So that's it! Ores with a lightning icon drop gold nuggets when mined!" Seeing this, Wang Han instantly understood some of the game's mechanics. She just didn't know if it was a guaranteed drop or just a chance.

As if she had discovered a new continent, Wang Han, pickaxe in hand, began searching for ores with lightning symbols. She ran towards the top of the map, collecting all sorts of resources she encountered along the way.

It was then that Wang Han discovered something new. While wandering in the forest, she encountered a spider egg. Just as she got close, the spider egg cracked open, and a ferocious-looking spider emerged, chasing her relentlessly for a long time.

Looking at the axe in her hand, Wang Han really wanted to engage in a fierce duel with this spider. However, considering her previous death by bee sting and that the first day hadn't even ended yet, she restrained herself.

Along the way in the forest, she also encountered a building called a Pig House, but didn't see any actual pigs. She couldn't figure out what the Pig House was for.

Temporarily ignoring it, Wang Han continued to wander the map. Just then, the sky began to darken, and Wilson in the game started to remind himself aloud.

‘It's getting dark, I should probably make a fire.’

The game's time wheel had three distinct segments: daytime, dusk, and nighttime. It was currently dusk, clearly a period designed for players to transition.

"Nighttime, so now I need to craft a bonfire and a torch?"

Wang Han glanced at her status bar, ate two berries, and slightly increased her hunger level.

"But in the dark, what happens in the game? Will I die?" Looking at the gradually darkening sky in the game, Wang Han really wanted to try and see what would happen after nightfall.

However, as night fell and the game world became pitch black, Wang Han still built a bonfire.

Because with the arrival of night, the sound of wind and some strange noises coming through her headphones made her feel a bit unnerved.

"But this fire is too small, isn't it? It can only illuminate such a tiny area?"

She glanced at the time in the top right corner; it was still a while until dawn, and this bonfire could only illuminate a very short distance.

Standing in front of the bonfire, Wang Han grew a little restless, so she slowly edged away from it.

As she moved, Wang Han quickly noticed something: as she distanced herself from the bonfire, her sanity in the top right corner was rapidly decreasing.

At the same time, a special effect resembling ice freezing suddenly appeared on the screen. Wilson in the game also became flustered.

‘Who’s there?’

‘What is that thing!’

Along with Wilson's dialogue, Wang Han also got goosebumps.

Because in the darkness, she saw eerie pairs of eyes suddenly appear, and the sounds in her headphones became even stranger. Footsteps constantly approached her from the darkness, scaring her into immediately running back to the bonfire's location.

"Monsters appear at night!" Wang Han exclaimed, her heart still pounding with fear.

Back at the bonfire, Wang Han opened her inventory, intending to build another bonfire, but she didn't have enough materials and could only craft a torch.

After some thought, she decided to craft the torch. Equipping the newly made torch, its durability in the bottom right corner continuously decreased.

However, compared to the entire screen, the torch's illumination range was still too small.

But Wang Han soon noticed something: the torch in her hand could actually set other things on fire. For instance, berry bushes, trees, and tall grass.

"This makes it much brighter!"

Wang Han tried moving her mouse over the surrounding trees and berry bushes, and instantly, a huge fire ignited.

At first, Wang Han simply wanted to burn the surrounding trees a bit to make the screen brighter. But as the nearby trees caught fire, Wang Han suddenly felt that setting fires was quite fun.

After all, playing with fire in real life is a very dangerous activity with significant safety hazards, as the saying goes, 'arson leads to lifelong imprisonment.' When she was little, she even used matches and lighters to light napkins and play with fire, and her parents often tricked her by saying she'd wet the bed if she played with fire at night.

But in the game, there were clearly no such concerns. So, while her torch still had durability, Wang Han ran and set fires along the way.

Moreover, since the surrounding forest was connected, all the trees on the entire screen instantly ignited, turning into a sea of fire.

The night wasn't too long; soon, game time turned to day, and an auto-save icon appeared.

At the same time, the torch in her hand was completely depleted. Looking at the still burning trees, Wang Han felt a little regretful; she hadn't had enough fun yet!

Although she could still light fires during the day, the atmosphere just wouldn't be the same.

More to come later.
