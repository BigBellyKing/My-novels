Chapter 313: Giving Them a Huge Surprise! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

The Valkyrie, who had been observing information using cameras, watched Song Ren and his teammates at the entrance and excitedly called out: "They're here, they're here! The same team composition as the previous round, all five of them are still back here!"

Song Ren, who had only shot down the camera on the street lamp, completely failed to notice a pitch-black prototype object hidden at the corner of the stairs. This position was quite inconspicuous, completely unnoticeable if you didn't pay attention. And because she knew that scanning enemies would reveal their position, the defenders' Valkyrie didn't use a scan, not even a normal ping, but instead used voice to describe the position.

The Valkyrie felt she was about to make a huge contribution this round! Valkyrie's skill was to throw deployable cameras that could be rotated freely. She had previously thrown one near the Central Kitchen stairs. Then, she threw another near the stairs behind the warehouse. She suddenly had the idea to clear the door, but at first, it showed a red invisible wall, and she wasted one for nothing, even having to shoot it down herself. But once the game officially started, she found she could throw the camera out, and then re-barricaded the door. She felt it was seamless, and judging by the opponent's reaction, they really hadn't noticed anything amiss!

Meanwhile, Song Ren and his teammates were still acting very carefully and cautiously, as they didn't know if the opponents had heard them breaching the door. At the same time, his IQ had put away her scanner, because when using the scanner, IQ could only use her pistol. Among the entire team, only Sledge and he had long-range weapons, so they were important firepower output points in the game.

"The door is barricaded? Joey, it's up to you! Everyone get into position. After Sledge finishes breaching, Montagne and Blitz rush out instantly, then Blitz activates his flash."

"Swift, fast! Show our Rainbow Counter-Terrorism Squad's professionalism!" Song Ren quickly emphasized, then Sledge breached the door. With a crash, the wooden barricade was instantly smashed open, just as planned. Montagne charged out first, but right at that moment, a dark Remote Charge landed at the entrance for everyone. With a boom!

Wang Yifan, holding his Montagne shield, was fine, as the Montagne shield was very sturdy after all. But Wang Han, who came out second with her Blitz shield, was directly blown away. Before Song Ren and the others behind them could react, two more dark Remote Charges flew over. Then, with a boom! Although one of them, due to a mistake by the defenders, resulted in only a single explosion instead of two, and even accidentally killed a teammate, in the narrow space, coupled with Zhang Yi and the others charging in recklessly, by the time they realized what was happening, it was completely too late to stop.

Accompanied by booming sounds, Zhang Yi, Song Ren, and Joey, who were following, were directly blown into the air. Only Wang Yifan, dumbfounded and still holding up his shield, retreated to the corner, trembling.

However, at this moment, the opposing Recruit chuckled, pulled out a dark block from seemingly nowhere, and threw it towards Wang Yifan's head. The Remote Charge landed exactly on the ground, and with the press of a button, it detonated. With another boom. The shield was very sturdy, but the person behind it was much more fragile.

"What the heck! Why are there so many bombs!" Song Ren was completely numb. "Damn it! This counter-terrorism game is too realistic, damn it!" Zhang Yi was also stunned. "This train formation tactic is underperforming!" Wang Han said, a little depressed.

The ordinary players watching outside the internet cafe were all amused. They even felt it was more interesting than watching those streamers. It truly made for great entertainment.

"Haha, I'm impressed! This game can be played like this? Choosing five Operators all equipped with Remote Charges!?" "Honestly, this is what a real counter-terrorism game should be, right? Terrorist Personnel are insane and depraved. Isn't it realistic logic for such individuals to each carry a Remote Charge?" "But I feel that information and understanding of the map are really crucial in this game. Those guys using the 'train formation' could have used a drone to scout behind the door first, and only proceed when it's truly safe."

"Exactly, the defenders, through their Valkyrie, already knew their position and had prepared a trap, just waiting for them to step into it." "This game really feels like instant death upon encountering an enemy. Marksmanship might be useful, but compared to other FPS games where marksmanship is supreme, this game allows you to completely lock down a position through information gathering and understanding of the map!"

"That's right! And the different Operators' skills are also very important. In this round, if they hadn't seen them gathering in advance through Valkyrie's camera, they might have ambushed one, but it would have been hard to say what would happen later when they rushed into the Training Grounds with a larger area of activity."

Compared to Song Ren and his teammates who were in the game, the players in the internet cafe who couldn't play and could only spectate, through the God's-eye view, also more deeply felt the unique core of Rainbow Six Siege.

"Cough, cough, it was just an an accident. Next up is a defense map, and I think defending should be relatively simpler," Song Ren coughed.

Although they had lost two consecutive rounds and were now at match point, it wasn't entirely without hope.

"I strongly express my doubt!" Zhang Yi voiced his opinion.

"Concurred!" Wang Han followed closely, standing on a united front with Zhang Yi.

"We've switched positions this round!" Song Ren quickly changed the subject.

The map was still Chicago Mansion, but the previous bomb site was in the basement garage room area. Now the bomb site had moved to the Kids' Bedroom on the second floor and the Workshop opposite it.

"Which Operator should we pick?" Zhang Yi sighed, asking. After all, they were already trailing by two points. From beginning to end, he had only taken out one with his "thump-thump-thump" at the start, with Song Ren finishing off another. As for the previous round, even though the opponents lost one, it was a team kill from their own side. That red triangle was still lit up.

"Let's just do our own thing!" After the train formation tactic failed two consecutive times, Song Ren was also feeling a bit confused.

Entering the game, the few of them also noticed the differences between defending and attacking. Many doorways could be directly barricaded with wooden planks, and some plaster walls could even be reinforced with steel plates.

"This feels a bit like renovating! We defenders are the industrious renovators, and the attackers are the demolition team," Joey chuckled as something came to mind.

"Enough talk, hurry up and renovate! But the opponents seem to be lost too! They haven't even found the bomb after all this time." Zhang Yi reinforced all the walls in the Kids' Bedroom that could be reinforced with steel plates. He also replaced the three wooden windows with Castle's reinforced panels.

"Damn it! This Kids' Bedroom feels invincible!" It was only then that Song Ren noticed the unique aspects of this Kids' Bedroom. All the walls were reinforced with steel plates, and the windows were covered with bulletproof reinforced panels, making it an absolute ironclad fortress. Not to mention people, not even a fly could get in.

"Of course! I reinforced it, so it has to be amazing!" Zhang Yi smiled.

"I have a bold idea! What if all five of us just stay in here?" Song Ren made a suggestion.

"All crouch inside? Not defend the other site?" Zhang Yi raised a question.

"How about we just let this round go? Let's take the wind out of their sails, the last round was so infuriating!" Wang Han also made a suggestion; the previous round had made her furious.

"Let's give the opponents a surprise, five guns pointing at them after they open the door!" Wang Yifan also chuckled.

"I've already placed cameras in the room, and Sister Han... look what I'm holding!" Joey, who had chosen Valkyrie this round, pulled a dark Remote Charge from his pocket.

"It's decided then! Let's be professional about this. Wang Han and Joey, you two lie down in front, and the three of us will crouch behind. Strike a pose and give them a big surprise!"
