Chapter 760: The Water is Getting Hot!

For this kind of mode, Zhang Yi declared that he had seen through everything. He understood too well.

Starting with a bait for players, making them feel it was so easy to find a fragment, and that finding a few more to meet the conditions would be just as simple? If one truly thought that, they would fall right into Mr. Chen's trap. Could passively received fragments be the same as those actively sought out?

From the beginning until now, no monsters had even appeared yet, and it was already this terrifying. The dead silent environment, combined with the oppressive atmosphere, made one constantly on edge. And then, to search for fragments, delving into every corner of the Silent Hill town – wasn't that a death wish? Intelligent as he was, he had already seen through it all. But then, after checking the elapsed time, Zhang Yi felt like he was starting to sweat again.

From the start of the game until now, almost half an hour had passed? Counting what he had done in the game so far? It seemed he had only triggered an internal monologue from James coming to Silent Hill and a background introduction, and incidentally learned about Silent Hill's peculiarities and directions from that black-haired woman. Besides that, it was purely about traversing the map!

But it was also mainly because he was too slow. Although the game had a running function, Zhang Yi himself basically just walked instead of running. Because in this dead silent environment, the sound of his leather shoes running and his gasps for breath, combined with the faint background melody, made him feel unbearably oppressed. Walking was slower, but it wasn't unacceptable.

Following the map, advancing little by little, he arrived at a crossroads-like area, and Zhang Yi's footsteps suddenly halted. “Holy cow, blood! So much blood!” On the path ahead were pools of fresh blood, congealed into a dark red, spreading deeper into the street past the corner. From the shape of the bloodstains, it was as if some creature had bled to death and then been dragged away.

Before Zhang Yi could speculate further, the previous monster's roar echoed in his ears again. Zhang Yi looked in the direction of the sound, and saw a distorted figure appear in the white mist, then vanish again. He silently swallowed a mouthful of saliva, the fleeting shadow of the monster still in his mind. It looked like a humanoid creature, but its walking posture and physique were completely unlike one. It could be said to be incredibly eerie. “What the heck is that thing!” Zhang Yi's heart thumped wildly. Even though he had been saying things like 'a monster appearing would be good'. But when the monster actually appeared, the feeling was completely different.

“So, next I have to follow the bloodstains, and go in the direction where that monster disappeared?” Judging from the map and the bloodstains on the ground, this was clearly a hint. A normal game progression would certainly lead towards the direction the monster vanished. But Zhang Yi's heart was now utterly timid, much like Ye Gong Hao Long. He'd said he wanted monsters to appear quickly, but when they actually did, he was scared to death. After hesitating for a long time, Zhang Yi slowly fumbled his way forward into the white mist. The blood on the ground was like a road sign, guiding Zhang Yi through a corner intersection.

At this moment, a burst of static entered his ears. ‘Zzzzzzzt…’ Like the sound of electricity, the noise came from a construction area. On both sides were barbed wire fences, and directly in front was a wooden barrier, but there was a large hole just big enough for an adult to crawl through. Crawling through the hole, Zhang Yi discovered that the source of the sound was a radio.

The environment had been dead silent before, and Zhang Yi had hoped for some sound, some monsters to appear. And now, everything he had wished for had appeared. A series of footsteps and the sound of breaking glass rang out. Looking towards the shadows deeper inside, Zhang Yi shivered. Beyond the white mist, a monster with an incredibly twisted posture slowly walked towards him. Outwardly, the monster was humanoid, but eerily, it had no facial features, its upper body covered by a rubber-like material, and it constantly twisted as it moved. It also had no arms, or rather, its arms were bound within the rubber-like substance. This monster was the shadow that had vanished into the mist earlier; Zhang Yi recognized it instantly.

Watching the appearing monster, James in the game kept retreating until he hit the wooden barrier, where he casually pulled off a wooden stick with iron nails. Next, the interface entered Zhang Yi's control. “It can be killed!” Zhang Yi's voice even had a joyous, almost tearful tone. The monster in front of him moved very slowly, comparable to the zombies in Resident Evil, and it didn't have the zombies' formidable vitality either. Two hits with the stick and the monster was dead, which made Zhang Yi let out a sigh of relief.

As is well known, fear stems from insufficient firepower, and with this monster being so easy to kill, for a moment Zhang Yi felt like he could do anything again. At the same time, the radio beside him no longer emitted its sizzling static. Instead, a series of sounds, seemingly Mary's voice, came through, but it was intermittent and unclear what was being said. After exploring for a bit and finding nothing, Zhang Yi continued forward, taking the radio with him.

When he passed through the mist and reached an intersection, the radio once again emitted its sizzling static. Simultaneously, the previous monster reappeared in the white mist, and there was more than one. In the previously dead silent town, so many monsters had suddenly appeared. “This... the water temperature seems to be... gradually getting hotter.” Seeing the monsters around him that had spotted him, Zhang Yi's big toe tensed slightly.

However, Zhang Yi also keenly noticed a characteristic: whenever he encountered a monster, the radio he carried would emit a sizzling static sound. This made Zhang Yi both panicked and curious. Because usually, aren't horror games supposed to suddenly startle players? But wasn't this radio directly alerting players that there were monsters nearby, telling them to mentally prepare?

However, Zhang Yi soon discovered that while he had mental preparation, it was ultimately useless. Especially after getting this warning radio, his sense of fear didn't alleviate; instead, it intensified. It wasn't a sudden fright, but a sense of oppression, a feeling of paranoia. Before this, walking in this dead silent world, with boundless white fog ahead and only the protagonist's gasps and footsteps in his ears. In that situation, Zhang Yi's concern was the fear of a monster suddenly appearing and startling him. And now, even though he had the radio, as long as there was a monster, the radio would emit static, alerting the player to prepare. But the same paranoid feeling persisted, because Zhang Yi always felt that there might be a scenario where the radio wouldn't make a sound, and then a ghost would pop out and give him a huge scare. Initially, Zhang Yi didn't feel it, but after playing for a while, that indescribable sense of oppression made Zhang Yi's heart pound rapidly.

Cautiously exploring the Silent Hill town, Zhang Yi found an apartment key on a corpse located in a corner. Carrying oppression and fear, he wandered the streets for a long time, finally finding the apartment's entrance. However, after entering the apartment, Zhang Yi instantly realized that saying women are fickle wasn't entirely accurate, because men could be fickle too. Earlier, when facing the eerie mist in Silent Hill town, he thought it was too oppressive; if it were a dark environment like Outlast, it would be a bit more bearable. As a result, upon reaching the apartment, wasn't it indeed a dark environment!

After fumbling around in the lobby for a long time, he found a map and barely managed to confirm his location. And in Room 205 on the second floor, he found a flashlight. But what made Zhang Yi panic was that when he found the flashlight, the radio he carried also emitted a sizzling static sound. Then, on the ground, a monster made of two legs spliced together both top and bottom wobbled and stood up. Under the flashlight's beam, the connecting parts looked bloody and mangled, but the rest resembled mannequin legs. Although, like the previous monster, a few hits with the stick killed it, its extremely eerie appearance still made Zhang Yi's scalp tingle.

“But at least I don't have to look for batteries like in Outlast. A nuclear-powered flashlight is something you deserve!” After confirming the flashlight didn't require batteries, Zhang Yi slightly relaxed. With the flashlight, Zhang Yi continued exploring various rooms, and he also discovered that the human mannequin-like monsters were particularly sensitive to light; a flashlight beam immediately brought them back to life. In other rooms of the apartment, Zhang Yi found a pistol, and in one room, he saw a man dead beside a TV and a strange grandfather clock.

Upon reaching the third floor, the path ahead was blocked by an iron gate, and on the ground was a gleaming key. Without much thought, Zhang Yi controlled his character to crouch down and reach his hand through the gate to pick up the key. But the next moment, a small girl suddenly rushed out of the room and kicked the key away. Running deeper into the apartment, she glanced back at James, a mischievous smile on her innocent face, making a playful expression: “Haha...” ‘Gulp.’ Watching the little girl disappear into the darkness, Zhang Yi swallowed hard. If it were any other game and he encountered a brat, he would definitely curse, as in-game brats were too annoying. The brat in New God of War was Kratos's own son, so he wouldn't mention it for now, but even today he remembered the money-stealing brats he encountered when he first went to Saint Denis in Red Dead Redemption. But the crucial point was, this game was Silent Hill! Although from the outside, she was just a mischievous little girl. But with the corpse in the second-floor room, the human mannequin monsters, and this dark environment, could a brat appearing here be a normal person?!

The dark scene, the still dead silent environment, the eerie monsters, and the little girl. Although it was in a game, Zhang Yi even felt he could hear his own heartbeat. In that instant, he truly wanted to turn off the game, then open the curtains and look at the sun outside. But thinking about Old Song's surprised expression if he gave him this CD key on his birthday, Zhang Yi felt he had the motivation to keep playing.
