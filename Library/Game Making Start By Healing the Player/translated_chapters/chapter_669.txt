Chapter 668: Hoping for a Beautiful Ending (Please subscribe for monthly passes)

It wasn't just Zhang Yi; Booker in the game was also filled with anger.

Immediately, Booker ran from the bridge towards Comstock's Estate.

But soon, something strange happened.

"What's going on? Why is it snowing?"

Zhang Yi looked at the swirling snow, his face full of astonishment.

Because the game's timeline was clearly summer, yet suddenly heavy snow began to fall on the bridge.

What's more, after pushing open the door, Zhang Yi was completely stunned.

What met his eyes was a statue of Elizabeth after she had become a religious leader.

The entire estate looked dilapidated, as if many years had passed, and inside the house, spatial rifts were everywhere, with Elizabeth's screams constantly emanating from them.

'Where is this place? What are you going to do to me?'

'Please... please! No, no, no! No~~~!'

Elizabeth's voice from within the spatial rifts was filled with panic and helplessness.

Hearing this, Zhang Yi was burning with anxiety, but ahead lay countless monsters, lunatics wearing Founding Father masks, and Silent Boys who had undergone bodily modification.

The whole process was incredibly eerie and sinister.

But at this moment, Zhang Yi didn't pay too much attention to the surrounding environment.

Just like Booker in the game.

Zhang Yi's heart was also filled only with rage and concern for Elizabeth.

This scene's plot gave Zhang Yi a feeling of re-experiencing Joel's rescue of Ellie at the end of The Last of Us.

Similarly, Ellie's fate was unknown, and players had to control Joel, racing against time to save her.

Every second delayed meant another layer of danger for Ellie.

And it was the same now.

Every second delayed meant another layer of danger for Elizabeth.

It's fair to say that in the adventures with Elizabeth up to this point, the young girl's actions had already made Zhang Yi fond of her character.

From the beginning, Elizabeth, yearning for the outside world, presented players with an innocent beauty.

On the airship, when she learned that Booker actually intended to abduct her to New York to pay off his debts.

Elizabeth pretended to cry, then hit Booker with a wrench, showing players her intelligence and resourcefulness.

Not to mention, Elizabeth repeatedly saved players' lives in the game, which made it even harder for players to let go of their feelings for her.

Of course, there was another very important point: Elizabeth was truly beautiful.

This was quite realistic.

Just like in Wuxia novels, the methods of repayment for a life-saving grace differ based on the savior's appearance.

For a beautiful savior, it's a life-saving debt that can only be repaid by offering oneself in marriage.

For an unattractive one, it means being reborn as an ox or horse in the next life to repay the great kindness.

Elizabeth was clearly the beautiful kind, especially with her changed appearance after her first kill in a mission, which made players' hearts flutter even more.

It can be said that this long adventure in Columbia Sky City had already forged an emotional connection between the player and Elizabeth.

Although Booker and Elizabeth were more like father and daughter in the story, he was Zhang Yi, not Booker.

So, was there a problem with Elizabeth being his "wife"?

Of course, Wang Han definitely couldn't know about this.

Although this part of the scene was creepy, for Zhang Yi on normal difficulty, being cautious wasn't particularly difficult.

After fighting hard all the way, Zhang Yi finally reached the depths of the Prophet's Estate.

And what happened next stunned all players who reached this point in the game.

Because here, Booker encountered a familiar person.

Elizabeth... but this Elizabeth was an older Elizabeth.

She told Booker that it was she who had led him there.

And this had consumed all her strength.

Then she pulled Booker into the future.

Amidst the chaos of war, Booker saw New York under siege.

"'The Prophet's child shall sit on the throne, upheld by all people. Say what you will about Comstock, he was practically a fortune teller.'"

"'What defeated me was not torture, nor indoctrination, but time.'"

"'Time erodes everything, even hope!'"

This future Elizabeth was Elizabeth decades later; she had inherited Comstock's legacy and waged war on the surface world.

She told Booker that over the years, every one of his rescue attempts had been thwarted by Songbird, and she herself had lost hope over time.

After years of torture and brainwashing, Elizabeth finally gave up her self, molded into what Comstock had desired: a fanatical religious leader and destroyer of worlds.

Now, old and frail, she watched as Comstock's desired utopia was slowly realized, but her heart held only emptiness and regret.

So she used her last vestiges of strength to twist space and time, bringing the Booker of the past before her eyes.

The elderly Elizabeth gave Booker the method to control Songbird, imploring him to prevent this future from happening, and then sent him back to the real world.

"Holy cow, I'm shocked! This is Elizabeth decades later? So in this timeline, Booker failed his rescue attempts?"

Looking at everything Booker had experienced in the game, and after a brief summary, Zhang Yi was utterly astonished.

However, there wasn't much time for him to think, as Elizabeth was still waiting for him to save her.

At the same time, Zhang Yi felt a slight fear in his heart.

"I hope Mr. Chen can be a decent human being and give us a beautiful ending," Zhang Yi thought to himself.

Initially, he had been very optimistic about BioShock Infinite.

He had even discussed it at length with Song Ren, but having played up to this point, Zhang Yi genuinely felt a little insecure.

Although BioShock Infinite had a cartoon rendering art style.

Only after truly experiencing it did he realize that this game was absolutely no fairy tale.

Although Columbia Sky City looked magnificent and beautiful, it was filled with sharp satire and conflict.

The first combat scene in the game, and later the various specters and eerie mental patients that appeared after Elizabeth was taken by Songbird, as well as the Parallel World setting, all told him that this game was not as simple as he had imagined.

Of course, there was an even more crucial point: the game's developer, Chen Xu, was a top designer with a record.

And he was an industry-renowned figure.

Zhang Yi was very worried that Chen Xu might kill Elizabeth later on, or that Booker would ultimately sacrifice himself for Elizabeth.

After all, too many games had set such precedents.

Although it seemed that now he had obtained the method to control Songbird and everything was moving in a good direction, who knew what the future plot held?

At this moment, Zhang Yi's only hope was that Elizabeth and Booker could have a relatively good ending, defeating Comstock, the big BOSS, without a scratch.
