Chapter 465: Ezio's Life (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

After delivering the message, Ezio put down his equipment and turned to leave Altaïr's library.

But Song Ren had not yet recovered from the game's storyline.

The entire story arc was extremely long, no shorter than the previous *Red Dead Redemption*.

Even though Song Ren didn't pay much attention to side content, or the gameplay of clearing stronghold fortresses and ancient tombs.

The main quest alone had already taken nearly forty hours to advance to this point.

From a prodigal son to a legendary Assassin Master.

Ezio's life was truly legendary and magnificent.

He revitalized the Roman Assassin's organization, established the Brotherhood, and summarized and planned the inheritance of Assassin techniques.

Finally, in his old age, in pursuit of truth and understanding, Ezio bravely and unhesitatingly journeyed to the Assassin's sacred land, seeking the secrets Altaïr had left behind.

And ultimately, in the library, he fulfilled his mission, engaging in a dialogue with Desmond that spanned a thousand years.

Instead of immediately quitting the game, Song Ren quietly waited for the game's credits to finish playing.

He was anticipating the subsequent easter egg content in the game.

This was also a common practice in the gaming industry, placing epilogue-like elements at the very end of the credits.

For example, in *Red Dead Redemption*, Mary visited Arthur's grave, and Agent Ross found John Marston's ranch; in *Uncharted*, Drake, Elena, and their daughter were shown as a family at the end.

Listening to the pure instrumental piece named 'Ezio's Family', after about ten minutes, a scene appeared in the game.

Ezio, with white hair and looking quite aged, sat alone on a bench in the square where his father and brothers were executed forty-five years ago in Florence, silently gazing into the distance.

“You should be home,” Sofia said, looking at Ezio with concern, accompanied by their daughter.

“This *is* my home,” Ezio smiled.

The family chatted for a while, and Sofia took their daughter to a nearby shop for groceries.

At this moment, a young man walked over and sat beside Ezio, complaining about the women of Florence and expressing his desire to go to Rome.

Ezio replied wearily that it wasn't Florence's problem, then began to cough violently.

The young man took Ezio's hand, encouraged him to be brave, smiled with concern, and told Ezio to rest well before turning to leave.

Ezio was still breathing heavily, but when he looked at Sofia in the distance, he slowly calmed down.

Meanwhile, Ezio's monologue began:

‘When I was a young man...

I had freedom, but I did not see it;

I had time, but I did not know it;

I had love, but I did not feel it;

After decades of trials, I finally understood the true meaning of the three.

I am now old and frail, and this understanding has gradually become a contentment.

Love, freedom, and time, once squandered by me, now serve as my motivation.

And I dedicate my most special love to you, my dearest, and to our children, and to the brothers and sisters of the Assassin's Alliance.

And to this magnificent and wonderful world that gave us life, inspiring infinite imagination.

This love is eternal, my dearest Sofia — Ezio Auditore.’

Finally, Ezio leaned back in the lounge chair in front of the Florence Cathedral, peacefully closing his eyes.

………………

Emerging from the gaming pod, Song Ren felt as if a lifetime had passed, filled with emotion.

The protagonists died again!

He now knew how Altaïr and Ezio died. Although Desmond was still left, Song Ren felt that if there were future sequels, Desmond wouldn't fare much better given this trend.

The only thing that satisfied Song Ren was that Altaïr's and Ezio's final deaths in the game were relatively good.

Among all the male protagonists who died in Nebula Games' titles, Ezio's ending could be considered the best, and Altaïr's should rank second.

Three different Assassins from three different eras.

Each left an incredibly deep impression on Song Ren.

As for the most impressive, it was naturally Ezio.

In fact, not just among the three Assassins in Assassin's Creed, Song Ren felt that Ezio was absolutely one of the most memorable characters in Nebula Games, and even among all the games he had played.

The reason?

Because it was simply too complete.

Youth, middle age, old age, and finally Ezio's peaceful death – the entire game, spanning dozens of hours, perfectly showcased Ezio's life.

From his rebellious youth to his family's tragic demise, losing his sanity due to revenge, then growing into a mature and wise Assassin Master, and finally dying peacefully.

Although in the game, his role was merely that of a messenger, his life could only be described as magnificent.

Altaïr was similar; his story arc was part of the additional DLC content.

But it perfectly demonstrated Altaïr's journey from confusion to becoming an Assassin Mentor.

Initially arrogant and self-centered, he later understood the mission of the Assassins. His actions even changed later Assassins, including Ezio's uncle Mario and other Assassins, who were deeply influenced by Altaïr. He also improved the Hidden Blade, saving subsequent Assassins from the suffering of losing a finger.

As for Desmond, although he was the Assassin with the least presence in the game, the progression of the story still made players remember his character.

Initially, he was unwilling to accept being an Assassin. Even after joining Lucy and others, he still didn't truly believe he was an Assassin or how important he was.

It wasn't until he was controlled by Juno from Those Who Came Before and personally killed Lucy in shock, that sadness and regret consumed Desmond's heart.

Trapped in the Animus, he reflected on his life, family, and how he had spent most of his time escaping the role of an Assassin. Finally, through the memories and experiences of Ezio and Altaïr, he achieved enlightenment.

He realized that his comfortable life was over, and he had to face the reality of being an Assassin. He decided to stop running and to seek the Grand Temple, to find a way to prevent the world's destruction.

……………………

While players were still deeply immersed and emotional due to the gameplay and story of *Assassin's Creed*.

In the Nebula Games lounge.

“Oh, by the way, Mr. Chen, the *Uncharted* DLC trilogy has completed testing,” Meng Zuo said to Chen Xu, remembering something.

After the *Assassin's Creed* content was finished, they focused their main efforts on the development of the *Uncharted* DLC.

After such a long time, the development of this trilogy was basically completed and tested.

“Hmm, release it to players next week,” Chen Xu nodded slightly, saying. After all, *Assassin's Creed* had only been released recently, and players' wallets were likely empty. Releasing it now would negatively impact *Assassin's Creed*'s sales.

As for why the release date was set for next week?

Because by then, it would be past the 20th, which is generally when many companies start paying salaries. Players would have money in their pockets then.

“Then, Mr. Chen, what are our next plans? *Assassin's Creed* DLC content?” Yang Xin also looked at Chen Xu curiously.

Although *Assassin's Creed* had just been released, there was basically no further development content needed, mainly just bug fixes for subsequent updates.

In addition, various arrangements were also being made for *Assassin's Creed* merchandise.

For Nebula Games, games were currently one of its main revenue sources, but over the years, the income from merchandise had also become considerable.

“For the future, I'll need a team. We'll put together a game for a Halloween and Double Eleven event for the players,” Chen Xu thought for a moment before speaking.

“Halloween and Double Eleven event!?” Meng Zuo, Qin Yi, and Yang Xin all put down their controllers and turned to look at Chen Xu with bewildered expressions.

“Nebula Games Platform has always had Spring Sales and New Year Sales, which players are probably tired of. And why should Double Eleven only be for e-commerce? Can't we game companies do it too?”

“Furthermore, for the past two years, our main focus has been on Huanyu VR and Switch. PC players have been eating a lot of reheated dishes, so this time, the event will include PC players, giving them a huge surprise,” Chen Xu explained with a smile to everyone.

Looking at Chen Xu's expression, everyone hesitated to speak.

Surprise, really a surprise?

Connected to Halloween, could it truly be a surprise?
