Chapter 294: How Can 60 Population Lose to 50 Population? (Sixth update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)

Chen Xu's Wisps placed at the opponent's neutral creep camp, but they didn't scout the Blademaster who was leveling up.

Arriving at the neutral shop in the center of the map, Chen Xu saw the Blademaster who had already arrived at the neutral shop.

The Blademaster had already sold his Town Portal scroll and had a Circlet of Nobility, as well as a stack of Dust of Appearance.

It was clear that his opponent was going for an armed build Blademaster this round.

Chen Xu had originally planned to buy the Circlet of Nobility himself, but since his opponent had already bought it, he could only retreat for now.

Chen Xu chose to bypass the Blademaster and head straight for the Orc base. At the same time, Guadian had also scouted Chen Xu's base with his Grunt.

The one-line blockade completely prevented entry, so he turned to attack a group of Sea Turtles and their two sons below.

"I don't know what you're playing, but I'm just going for a default build. Harass my base and prevent me from leveling?" Guadian, who was farming neutral creeps, watched as the Demon Hunter ran into his base and wildly attacked the shop, basically understanding his opponent's intentions.

After attacking the opponent's shop for a while and seeing only Peons coming to repair it, with no sign of the Blademaster, Chen Xu knew that his opponent probably wasn't going to bother with him.

He immediately stopped wasting time. Instead, he led the Demon Hunter to the neutral shop and bought a Staff of Teleportation, an item that allows teleportation to an allied unit.

At the same time, he pulled his Archers out of his base to start leveling up, while his base directly began upgrading to Tier 2.

The audience and commentators were astonished.

"What's going on!? An Archer is going straight for Tier 2 tech?"

"This is too aggressive!"

On the commentary desk, Huang Donglai was also a bit confused: "Is Mr. Chen planning to rush Tier 3 and use Mountain Giants? But that doesn't seem right! In that case, he wouldn't be able to stop a Tier 2 Orc Wolf Rider all-in push!"

"Exactly! And what's the Staff of Teleportation for?" Seeing Chen Xu control his Demon Hunter to return home and drink from the Moon Well to replenish energy, Sun Yixie on the commentary desk was also puzzled.

The moment Tier 2 was completed, the neutral tavern immediately spawned a Beastmaster. At the same time, the Beastmaster summoned Quillbeasts and ran into the Orc's base. Concurrently, Chen Xu's Demon Hunter purchased a Staff of Preservation (which teleports the hero back to the main base) from the Ancient of Wonders in his base.

By this point, the Beastmaster and Quillbeasts had already reached the Orc's base. The Beastmaster was attacking the outer Burrows, while the Quillbeasts directly went deeper to attack a Barracks that was currently under construction. His opponent clearly intended to go for a two Barracks mass production strategy.

At this moment, a teleportation circle appeared above the Quillbeasts, and then the Demon Hunter was teleported over. The Staff of Teleportation purchased earlier had found its use.

The buildings under construction were very fragile and exploded after two rounds of attacks. At the same time, Chen Xu continued to control the Level 2 Demon Hunter, Quillbeasts, and Beastmaster to attack the surrounding Burrows.

"Aren't you leveling up? Do you want to harass me to death?" Guadian, who was currently leveling, couldn't help but speak when he saw this scene.

Before, a single Demon Hunter could be ignored.

But now, a Beastmaster, Quillbeasts, and a Level 2 Demon Hunter – ignoring them would definitely lead to trouble.

He was quite far away, and he had already sold his Town Portal scroll at the neutral shop, so he could only bring his Blademaster and Shaman back home.

By the time he arrived, one Burrow had already been destroyed.

The Demon Hunter, whose health was already low from attacking the Burrows, was still assisting the Quillbeasts in attacking the Peons chopping wood nearby. However, the moment he saw the Shaman, Chen Xu immediately used the Staff of Preservation to teleport himself back home.

But Chen Xu deliberately delayed the Beastmaster nearby, who was immediately Hexed by the Shaman and surrounded by three Orc Grunts. The Blademaster directly activated Wind Walk, rushed over, and cleaved at the Beastmaster's head. After a barrage of attacks, the Beastmaster regrettably fell.

"Did you see that! This is GOD! This is a god, this is the Almighty! The strongest Orc right now, no, the strongest Warcraft player! That cross-shaped encirclement was too beautiful!" On the commentary desk, Huang Donglai, although feeling that commentators shouldn't favor one player, couldn't help but lose control when remembering the three players he had previously backed, all of whom had suffered crushing defeats.

"Indeed, that was impressive. Chen Xu is in trouble this time!" This time, Sun Yixie also agreed, as it concerned his own hair (a playful reference to losing hair from stress over game outcomes).

However, Chen Xu didn't show much change in his mindset. He continued to play very relaxed, and he found that his state was getting better and better, and his controls became much smoother.

He resurrected the Beastmaster as planned, then continued with the same old routine.

Beastmaster, Quillbeasts, and Demon Hunter, focusing on your Burrows.

What the heck!? Guadian was utterly speechless. What kind of playstyle was this?

Harass him to death?

The Beastmaster already died once, and he's still coming?

And aren't you going to level up?

Guadian was utterly annoyed by the harassment, but at this moment, he really had no good way to deal with the Beastmaster and Demon Hunter.

If the Demon Hunter was in danger, he would immediately use the Staff of Preservation to return home. As for the Beastmaster, since he died once, Chen Xu obviously wouldn't make the same mistake again.

There wasn't much significant impact, it was just incredibly annoying to be constantly harassed.

While Guadian was leveling up and resisting harassment, Chen Xu had already upgraded to Tier 3, built two Ancients of Wind, and capped his population at 50, as this was the point where maintenance fees wouldn't be triggered.

Then, he immediately started producing master-level Raptor Druids.

And the Demon Hunter and Beastmaster had already bought all the Potions of Invulnerability on the map early on.

Soon,

"What's going on? Mr. Chen is making Raptor Druids and capping at 50 population to avoid maintenance fees!"

"Looking at the skills, it seems Mr. Chen is preparing to use Cyclone to limit the Blademaster."

"That actually might work!"

"Isn't that a bit too idealistic?"

"Yeah, and Guadian's Wolf Rider army is already quite substantial, and his Blademaster is almost Level 5!"

"Exactly, Mr. Chen has 50 population, while Guadian has 60. How can he win this?!"

Some viewers in the bullet comments had already guessed Chen Xu's intentions.

On the commentary desk, Huang Donglai and Sun Yixie also realized it.

"Like the Ice Armor Spiders before, Guadian might be in for some trouble!" Sun Yixie said.

Raptor Druids are cheap and don't take up much population. Night Elf forces form very quickly, and Chen Xu soon assembled a 50-population army and headed towards the Orc base.

"Oh, don't worry, just look at the Raptor Druids' health. They're too fragile; a few hits and they're dead. Although magic attacks do high damage to heavy armor, and Wolf Riders' damage to units is generally average, the health advantage is here, and how can 60 population lose to 50 population?"

"How can he lose with a god-tier Blademaster?"

"A Level 1 Beastmaster, a Level 1 Goblin, how can they fight? Just A-move and you'll win!"

"They're about to engage! Charge, charge, charge! Let them see what it means to have Wolf Riders right in their face!"

Guadian, who was leveling up and returning home, preparing to buy two more great potions to level his Blademaster to Level 5, now noticed Chen Xu's army.

He was immediately startled.

A Level 3 Demon Hunter, two Level 1 Goblins and a Beastmaster, followed by two Quillbeasts, and a group of colorful Raptor Druids.

The moment they met, the Goblin Tinker immediately threw down a Shed. At the same time, the Demon Hunter used Mana Burn on the nearby Shaman, and Faerie Fire was cast on the Blademaster's head.

The Beastmaster, Goblin Tinker, Demon Hunter, and other units in front wildly hacked at the Wolf Riders.

The Blademaster, affected by Faerie Fire, found his Wind Walk useless on landing and was immediately Cycloned into the air again.

The Wolf Riders who charged into the formation were also Cycloned one after another.

And the Orc Grunts, despite looking tough, were quickly reduced to low health after being hit by Faerie Fire (reducing armor) and then being attacked by the magic damage of the Raptor Druids in a volley.

Instantly, Guadian felt that something was wrong with the situation.

Because at this stage, he seemed completely unable to defeat his opponent.

His main combat power was concentrated on the Blademaster.

Once the fight started, his main Blademaster and Wolf Riders were all flying in the air.

How could he fight with a god-tier Blademaster constantly flying in the air?

The Raptor Druids kept Cycloning their heroes into the air, while the Beastmaster and Goblin Tinker's summoned units were like a tide.

Furthermore, the heroes had Potions of Invulnerability, Staff of Preservation, and Staff of Teleportation, allowing them to go home to drink water and then teleport back to fight. It was like having two lives. How could he fight this?!

His army was routed like an avalanche.

Meanwhile, on the commentary desk, the two commentators who had made bold predictions were utterly stunned.

"What's going on?! Are Raptor Druids really that powerful? Guadian lost too!?"

As Guadian typed "GG," all the players erupted in excitement.

Qin Yi and others watching in the lounge at Nebula Games also let out exclamations.

Chen Xu stretched lazily.

From the moment the Blademaster was Cycloned into the air, the outcome of this battle was essentially sealed.

To effectively counter a Cyclone strategy, the best approach is to start with a Far Seer, then a Tauren Chieftain and Spirit Walkers, and then quickly acquire Mass Healing and Potions of Invulnerability.

With powerful AOE, the fragile Raptor Druids could be swiftly eliminated.

In this match, the opponent started with a Blademaster, and the second hero was a Shaman, not even a Tauren Chieftain. He adopted a versatile playstyle, and since he was unfamiliar with this particular strategy and didn't produce many Spirit Walkers, Chen Xu had a significant advantage.

Chen Xu chose this strategy for another very important reason.

That is, the Cyclone strategy can severely limit the opponent's actions.

When units are constantly flying in the air, how can you execute precise positioning, or extreme low-health kiting?

Dream on!

Without Spirit Walkers, the Orc race has virtually no room for advanced maneuvers against the Cyclone strategy, relying solely on the opponent's mistakes.

Because the Night Elf Cyclone strategy is at its strongest in the 50-population phase.

At 50 population, relying on Raptor Druids, they can contend with an Orc army of 60 population.

But once this phase passes, every minute that drags on reduces their chances of winning.

In the live stream, the screen was flooded with comments.

"Holy cow, Night Elves can fight Orcs like this?"

"I'm impressed. Are you a designer or a pro player?"

"Seriously, if anyone ever says Orcs are too strong in 'Warcraft' again, Mr. Chen, I'll help you chop them alive!"

"I have to say! Orcs ARE too strong! Didn't you see that out of the four games Mr. Chen won, two of them involved summoning the Beastmaster!?"

"Give a proper burial to the 'friendly' upstairs; my Italian cannon has already fired!"
