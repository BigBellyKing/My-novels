Chapter 230: A Breath of Fresh Air in the MC Player Community (Eighth Update, Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)

With the release of this unique video by Chen Xu.

It quickly became a hotly discussed topic among Minecraft players, and also attracted the attention of many who had heard of the game but hadn't played it yet.

Moreover, compared to the various dazzling technical showcase videos that had previously shocked players.

This video, in contrast, made players feel a strong sense of familiarity.

After all, those incredibly impressive, shocking videos were indeed amazing.

But for most players, it was more about watching the spectacle, then waiting for the masters to upload these creations to the Workshop, and then downloading them to play around with.

However, if they were truly asked to do it themselves.

Then, sorry, they'd rather not bother!

And this time, Chen Xu's video about the history of major events in Minecraft showcased many things players had actually experienced.

For example, not knowing how to build a house, they would simply dig a hole, then pull out torches and a bed, and make do for the night.

And on the first night, when chased by various monsters, many players used the ultimate move of "dig-three-fill-one."

Of course, there were also some unlucky souls who dug holes in unknown locations, directly digging three blocks and falling into a large mine, needlessly sacrificing their first life.

And players who personally participated in various major events across different servers felt even more energized.

"Haha, I'm from Server 111! We've already started rebuilding the city in the sky, planning to make the entire city's ground out of glass! But many unlucky people, because they couldn't see the transparent glass clearly, fell off while building."

"What's that? Our Server 3511 is truly awesome! We were digging, and then lava appeared, setting us on fire, you know?! And we have a new decision: to artificially create a lava river! Our underground city will be called Lava City!"

"Haha, I'm a player from Server 2147! Everyone was fighting with iron weapons, but then the farmers and pig breeders brought out guns, directly declaring that the times had changed, haha! So funny!"

"Bro upstairs, that's too strong! Who came up with the idea for your [Merchant Alliance]?"

"How should I know? I wasn't there when the Merchant Alliance was formed; I was the one who got shot to death!"

"Actually, that's nothing. To get on the next major event video, our bros on Server 188 have already signed a ceasefire agreement and unanimously decided to complete city construction in the game, and elect a respected leader to guide us to grow stronger and create glory together!"

"Holy cow, awesome! Mark it, bro, if there's any new development, remember to tell me, I'm curious!"

"Eh, mark what?! Everyone wants to be the boss, but people's spirits are scattered now! Originally, we planned to go with a tripartite presidential system, but now it has split into a tribal mode."

Besides the diverse world trajectories within various servers in the online multiplayer mode, which players found very interesting.

Many players also started playing in various ways within the game.

Some were still in Single-Player Creative Mode, immersed in their own worlds, building what they considered beautiful and good houses.

Other players also arranged to experience server gameplay in the online multiplayer mode.

The appearance of the video also spurred players to delve deeper into the game.

For example, the game's technology content, the Redstone system, and some players had even discovered the existence of the Nether.

Some masters began researching the game's complex Redstone system, seeing if they could create even more amazing things.

At the same time, some even more impressive players had started creating various MODs.

Not just MODs for Redstone mechanisms and building complexes like before.

But MODs with unique gameplay.

Many other players, while not creating MODs, set up custom servers to establish corresponding rules for players, engaging in various interesting mini-games.

For instance, downloading the "Along the River During the Qingming Festival" themed map, creating ancient costume skins specifically for players, and simultaneously hiding player IDs in the game.

In one round, 20 ordinary players would be in the "Along the River During the Qingming Festival" themed map. A specific area would be designated, and two players would act as assassins, possessing offensive weapons.

The remaining players would blend in with NPCs or hide in a corner, enduring until the time limit.

Each incorrect attack by an assassin would result in the loss of one health point.

Custom mini-game rooms like these also began to proliferate.

There were also some puzzle games, where a complete building would be disassembled, then divided into two groups to see which side could reassemble it faster.

Although there were no similar official rules yet, players relied on their own unwritten agreements and the rules established within the servers.

One by one, unique gameplays were born within Minecraft.

And this perfectly aligned with the title of the game, Minecraft.

Everyone has a world of their own.

Everyone has their own way of playing.

By this point, the charm of Minecraft could be said to have been fully demonstrated.

Although, due to the large player base, it was inevitable to see some less likable "Entitled New Players" and some veteran players who enjoyed bullying newcomers.

But compared to the overall environment, thanks to Minecraft's game rules, its slightly cartoonish art style, and Nebula Games' excellent community operation for this game.

All of these factors made Minecraft stand out from other games, becoming a breath of fresh air in an internet era often filled with hostility.

At the same time, this healthy environment continuously solidified Minecraft's popularity, attracting even more players to join.

The sales miracle created by Minecraft left the entire gaming industry somewhat dumbfounded.

Many game designers felt they had already held Minecraft in very high regard.

But as days passed, it became clear that they had still underestimated this game.

By mid-March, a full month and a half after Minecraft's launch, many other games had also been released during this period.

Yet, they were still affected by Minecraft, with no game able to surpass its popularity.

The designers who launched their respective games during this period were practically lamenting everywhere.

............

Chen Xu clearly wasn't paying much attention to the plight of his peers.

In Nebula Games' office, Chen Xu emerged from the gaming pod and took the phone from Qin Yi.

"Mr. Chen, the mainstream mobile platforms have all been tested, and optimization is pretty much at its limit," Qin Yi explained to Chen Xu.

The porting of the mobile and VR versions was essentially complete.

It wasn't a huge undertaking, especially for the mobile version, which simply required good optimization and some content trimming.

The main work for the VR version focused on modeling materials and the associated VR operation experience.

However, it wasn't Chen Xu's first time developing for VR; he had already gained understanding of VR movements and related adaptations when working on Silent Hill PT for the Game Department, so it wasn't particularly difficult.

"That's pretty much it. Notify the Marketing and Operations Department to prepare for release," Chen Xu said, nodding slightly after briefly playing with it.
