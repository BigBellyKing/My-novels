Chapter 910: Youth and Memories

Witnessing each familiar world, countless players couldn't hide their excitement.

Although there was the so-called Nebula World before, it was essentially a single scenario. Players could only travel to various game worlds through portals. Moreover, and more importantly, players could only play online with friends they knew within the Nebula World. However, the current celebration event hosted by Nebula Games brought together players from around the globe, allowing them to personally witness the emergence of these familiar worlds, creating a completely different sense of awe.

“Look, these worlds are getting closer!” someone in the crowd suddenly exclaimed, having noticed something.

Looking towards the many starry worlds around them, they saw fragments representing individual game worlds, being drawn by rays of light, steadily moving closer to the broken continent beneath their feet.

As familiar worlds continuously merged, all the players standing in place immediately rushed towards the already merged worlds closest to them.

Zhang Yi and Song Ren also desperately pushed towards the area closest to their direction.

“But our spot here has pretty bad feng shui!”

Zhang Yi said, looking frustrated.

“Just ‘a little bad’? This is utterly terrible!” Song Ren echoed.

“I suspect it’s because we have an Unlucky King among us!” Wang Han also added.

After each fragment approached, the land, once shattered by stars, reconnected. However, it was no longer the desolate desert-like world from before. Instead, it was replaced by game worlds incredibly familiar to players: Azeroth, the Lands Between, the Nine Realms, Hyrule...

The grandeur, majesty, coupled with all those past gaming memories, instantly struck the most tender part of the players' hearts.

Especially for players who had been experiencing Nebula Games since its earliest days, the feeling was profoundly deep. For them, these scenes weren't a display of skill, but rather memories, their youth. From schooling to entering society and then establishing families, it could be said that for some players, Nebula Games represented their youth. How could these familiar scenes not stir their emotions, not move them?

Of course, it wasn't like this for everyone; some were exceptions.

Zhang Yi and Song Ren’s emotions were quite complex at the moment.

There was both emotion and speechless frustration.

Just look at what kind of game scenarios their area had merged with!

Mount Massive Asylum, Yharnam, Raccoon City, Village, Silent Hill...

Gazing at the grim and eerie scene, Zhang Yi and all the players in that area immediately fell silent.

They had strong reason to suspect Mr. Chen was practicing discrimination!

What the heck, is this a place for humans?!

It was absolutely detestable!

Although different from the incredibly grim experience within the actual games, this place merely had a slightly oppressive visual atmosphere.

But they couldn't stop their minds from filling in the blanks!

All the SAN points they’d lost and the scares they’d endured in games suddenly resurfaced.

Mr. Chen, give them back their previous emotional moments!

Within the Nebula World, game scenarios continuously merged with the continent where players stood, and players were immersed in a carnival atmosphere.

Meanwhile, on major live streaming platforms online, dedicated official channels had also been set up to broadcast this 10th-anniversary event.

Players in the game were still marveling at the scenes of various distinct game worlds merging, but in the next moment, countless players let out exclamations of surprise.

‘Upon the black sea of ignorance, I am the shining lighthouse of knowledge!’

As an incredibly pretentious voice emerged, Invoker Carl, adorned with three orbs, descended from the sky.

But the moment his words faded, an even louder cheer erupted from the players.

‘Orcs... will never be slaves!’

Accompanied by a powerful roar, Horde leaders like Grom Hellscream, Thrall, and Cairne Bloodhoof appeared in the players' vision.

All players who had played World of Warcraft and belonged to the Horde faction also cheered loudly in response.

But the next second, players from the Alliance also became excited.

‘May the Holy Light be with you!’

A brilliant Holy Light appeared, and a host of Alliance leaders including Tirion Fordring, Varian Wrynn, and Muradin Bronzebeard emerged from a magic portal.

And this was only the beginning.

A colossal dark shadow appeared above the players—it was the World Serpent from God of War. Then, another dark shadow fell from the World Serpent's head.

Kratos and his son, Atreus.

However, before players could even cry out in surprise, space in a certain spot suddenly underwent a bizarre transformation, then was directly torn open, creating a massive rift.

Elizabeth, wearing a blue dress and holding her little sister's hand, walked out with a surprised expression, followed by a Big Daddy in a diving suit.

Then, from afar, came the neighing of horses, as John and Arthur, wearing cowboy hats, galloped to the scene.

Mario, wearing his red cap, and Bowser chased Princess Peach, who was riding a balloon, hand in hand. Zelda and Link, also hand in hand, descended with the Four Champions from a gigantic Divine Beast in the sky.

From all directions, countless characters familiar to players rushed to the scene one by one, making it so dazzling that they didn't know whom to look at.

Zhang Yi and Song Ren were no longer complaining about being Unlucky Kings or about the detestable scenarios.

Although the scene was indeed a bit grim, the NPCs on their side were quite formidable!

Ada Wong, Chris, Claire, and Leon arrived together in a sports car. Although it carried two ‘killers’ like Leon and Chris, in this particular setting today, their passive talents of ‘teammate killer’ and ‘vehicle killer’ were clearly sealed.

On the other side, Ethan, Mia, and their daughter Rose, the family of three, happily arrived at the store.

Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower pushed Gehrman's wheelchair, while behind her, the Doll Sister slowly walked, cradling a squid.

James and Lara, emerging from the shadows of Silent Hill, also arrived hand in hand.

“Damn it! Why are they all in pairs!? Showing off to us single folks?” Song Ren couldn't help but grumble.

In terms of combat prowess, they certainly couldn't compare to others, but when it came to charisma and attractiveness, their section was absolutely top-notch. The only thing that displeased Song Ren was that, damn it, everyone was in pairs!

Either couples or families!

Every single one of them maxed out!

Siblings, father and daughter, or lovers, and even a family of three. What's even more outrageous is, what's with the Doll Sister holding a squid?

“Ahem... Old Song, please mind your words. You're the only single one here; please don't add the 's' to make it plural.” Zhang Yi and Wang Han, holding hands nearby, lightly coughed, and even intentionally raised their clasped hands for Song Ren to see.
