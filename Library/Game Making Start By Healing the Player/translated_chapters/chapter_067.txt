Chapter 67: First Game Experience

The third day of the Lunar New Year, in a certain game enthusiast group chat.

“Any good games to recommend, everyone?”

“Overcooked! It launched today! I'd been keeping an eye on it, and Nebula Games Platform has a buy-one-get-one-free deal. I'm looking for playmates, anyone in? I'll provide the game, you provide the person!”

“Isn't that a couple's game?”

“Who says couple's games must be played by couples? Can't two big guys play it?”

“Good point.”

“How much is this game?”

“55 Yuan, not expensive, and Chen Xu's Nebula Games Platform even has a buy-one-get-one-free offer.”

“Oh, where's Old Zhang? Let's play together!”

A group of game enthusiasts in the chat were discussing what games were fun to play recently.

At this moment, the person called Old Zhang spoke up in the group chat: “Hmm... while I'd really like to play with everyone, but... I'm sorry, I have a partner.”

A flurry of ellipsis symbols appeared in the chat, followed by all sorts of memes.

Ignoring the discussion in the group chat, Old Zhang got up from the sofa, stretched his limbs, and then sat down in front of the computer.

Old Zhang's name was Zhang Yi. Although his group members called him Old Zhang, he wasn't actually old, just twenty-five.

Looking at the group discussing Overcooked.

Zhang Yi, in front of his computer, also grew curious: “Let me see, this game seems pretty good! Wait... it's made by the same designer as Outlast? This is quite a switch, suddenly from the underworld to the human world!”

Looking at Overcooked's very Q-style cute and adorable store interface, Zhang Yi showed a look of surprise.

A huge poster displayed the game's title, Overcooked, pieced together from various ingredients.

Below it was a giant food truck.

On top of the food truck stood a group of cartoon characters wearing chef hats.

A small crocodile, a little squirrel, a doggo, and cartoon versions of a boy and a girl.

These cartoon characters held cleavers, rolling pins, and frying pans, looking incredibly adorable.

Seeing the game's cover poster for Overcooked, Zhang Yi couldn't help but exclaim.

With its cartoon art style, it's safe to say that every character in Overcooked is exceptionally cute.

“What game is this? It's so cute!”

As Zhang Yi was looking at the Overcooked interface, his girlfriend, Wang Han, who had just come out of the room, also noticed what he was looking at and asked curiously.

She often played games in her daily life, though certainly not to the extent of an avid game enthusiast.

However, the art style of the game on the monitor did indeed capture her attention.

The Q-style cute cartoon characters looked like something out of a fairytale, giving a particularly warm feeling.

“Overcooked is the new game by the designer of Outlast, and it was specifically released on Valentine's Day,” Zhang Yi said.

They had played Outlast together before.

Of course, like most ordinary players, they didn't pay much attention to game designers.

It was only when he noticed Overcooked that he discovered this designer named Chen Xu had actually developed quite a few games, and he had even played them all.

“This is made by the Outlast designer?” Just like Zhang Yi before her, Wang Han was also surprised.

“Yeah, and this designer also made To the Moon and Undertale. Quite a different feel, right?” Zhang Yi smiled.

“To the Moon and Undertale were also made by him?” Wang Han was astonished.

“Then why don't we buy it and play it? This game seems quite interesting,” Wang Han suggested.

“Hehe, that's exactly what I was thinking.” Zhang Yi chuckled, then searched for the Nebula Games Platform in his browser, downloaded it, registered two accounts, added each other as friends, scanned the QR code to pay, and then sent the gifted copy of the game to the other account.

Unlike some players, he wasn't too particular about platforms.

For the same game, as long as the content wasn't censored.

For him, it simply meant he'd buy the game from whichever platform offered it cheaper.

He had also purchased Outlast from the Nebula Games Platform previously.

Now, with the buy-one-get-one-free offer, there was no reason not to go with the Nebula Games Platform.

Although this game could be played on a single computer with split-screen.

However, since the two lived together and both enjoyed playing games, there were two computers in the room.

They downloaded and logged in; the game wasn't large, so both installed it quickly.

Entering the game, the Nebula Games company logo skipped, and a line of subtitles appeared on the black screen: “The following content is based on real events, only names, locations, and vegetables have been altered...”

Next, a cutscene appeared: thunder rumbled in the night sky over a castle, and large raindrops fell from above.

[After Teatime...]

'Finally, I've waited for this moment for so long! To win the Gourmet Grand Prize, how many challenges have we overcome!'

'Watch this, Kevin! The legendary Delicious Necronomicon!'

Accompanied by the Onion King's soliloquy, he began his research into the necro-culinary art.

Horrific cooking spells created a multitude of zombie bread, and these zombie bread were now swarming towards the castle!

To fend off the zombie bread, players had to cook enough food to satisfy these monsters.

“As expected, the story isn't the main point in this kind of game!” Zhang Yi exclaimed.

“The Onion King perfectly demonstrated the saying, 'No zuo no die!'” Wang Han, beside him, chimed in.

The two exchanged playful jabs, then smiled at each other.

Following the simple plot, the game entered its initial tutorial level.

It was very simple: WASD for movement, Space for interaction, and Ctrl for chopping vegetables.

These were common keybinds for most games, and both Wang Han and Zhang Yi, though not gaming experts.

Had played enough games to immediately grasp the controls.

They understood the specific operations of the game.

Simply put, it was about cooking: selecting ingredients, chopping, some ingredients might need frying or boiling, then plating, and finally serving.

For some dishes, different ingredients needed to be combined.

As for the game's victory conditions, they were also very simple.

In campaign mode, the highest perfect score was three stars.

Within the time limit, serving each dish earned a certain amount of tips, and once the income reached a target, a corresponding rating would be awarded.

The rules were extremely simple and easy to understand.

Of course, if all levels were completed with a three-star rating, the game would unlock a hidden four-star rating, though this was beyond the reach of most ordinary players.

“Got it! So simple!”

“This feels really good!”

“If only cooking in real life were this convenient.”

“I feel like multiplayer might be more fun. Let's clear the campaign levels first, and then we can try online matches to challenge other players!”

Zhang Yi and Wang Han, one in charge of serving and plating, the other of chopping vegetables, easily passed the game's first tutorial level.

Looking at the three-star perfect score they achieved, both wore expressions of joy and satisfaction.

Before playing, due to Outlast and the initial zombie bread storyline, it indeed felt a bit like something from the underworld.

But after a quick play, it actually turned out to be quite fun!

Especially cooking and serving dishes together.

It felt much like playing house as children.

Combined with this beautification of childhood memories, the entire game experience became even warmer and more enjoyable!

Looking at the game completion rating screen, both Zhang Yi and Wang Han were beaming with happy smiles.
