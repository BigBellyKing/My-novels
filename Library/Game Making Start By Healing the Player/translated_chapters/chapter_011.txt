Chapter 11: Who Can Empathize With Such a Person!

A residential community in Modu.

"Xiaoxue, are you really not considering making games with me?" Yang Xin sat on the sofa, her legs propped on the coffee table in front of her, and said to Ruan Ningxue, who was sitting next to her coloring a manuscript.

"Sister Xin, your little boat is holed and leaking, almost sinking." Ruan Ningxue put down her paintbrush and rolled her eyes.

"Ahem, it's just a temporary difficulty, and I still have three employees! And look at your studio, Xiaoxue. How can you call this a studio? Have you ever seen a studio with only one person?" Yang Xin immediately retorted.

"Well, at least I can make a profit! And Sister Xin, didn't you have eight employees three months ago?" Ruan Ningxue suddenly realized something and said.

"Everyone has their own ambitions. My employees are pursuing their dreams; I can't just stop them, can I? By the way, Xiaoxue, how is your Junior Brother's game doing?" Yang Xin asked Ruan Ningxue, slightly embarrassed, changing the subject.

"I haven't been following it. The results probably aren't too good," Ruan Ningxue gently shook her head after hearing Yang Xin's words.

"Then your studio is about to become two people?" Yang Xin said, somewhat curious, as she thought of something, apparently aware of their agreement.

"Probably, but Chen Xu is probably in a very bad mood right now," Ruan Ningxue sighed and said.

She hadn't actively contacted Chen Xu during this period.

After all, after their previous session, she had consulted Yang Xin, and Yang Xin wasn't optimistic at all.

Although her sister had made three games in a row, and her funds were almost depleted.

She was, after all, a professional in the gaming industry.

Plus, having developed three games, she must have accumulated some experience with failure, right?

During the month she spent developing the game with Chen Xu, Ruan Ningxue could clearly feel Chen Xu's enthusiasm.

She could also feel the unique enjoyment the game brought, especially being able to personally operate it and push the game's content forward little by little.

That feeling was indeed wonderful. At that time, she also understood why Chen Xu would say he wanted to develop games.

So, during this period, she hadn't inquired about the game's performance, especially since Chen Xu had previously said he would pay her for her work as soon as the game successfully secured funding.

Even though she didn't care about the money herself, she couldn't tell Chen Xu to just forget about it.

After all, it wasn't just about money, nor was it solely her own business.

Furthermore, she was quite busy with her comics, so she hadn't paid much attention to the game aspect.

She was also planning to use this time to let Chen Xu calm down and adjust properly, then go talk to him later.

*For this Junior Brother, I've worried myself sick!* Yang Xin mused inwardly.

"There's nothing to be done about it. Many newcomers think 18R games are simple, but it's just that the risk is relatively low; in reality, game development isn't that simple. Oh right, Xiaoxue, what's your Junior Brother's game called? Let me take a look."

Yang Xin said with a sigh, using the tone of someone with experience.

This reminded her of her three previous failed experiences.

Although she had never met Ruan Ningxue's Junior Brother, Yang Xin inexplicably had a strange feeling.

That was, she could understand his feelings at this very moment.

Especially since Ruan Ningxue had mentioned that he had burned his bridges and invested all his funds into it.

This further confirmed to her that he must be someone who loves games, just like herself.

Thinking back to the sense of frustration she felt when her first game failed after its launch, Yang Xin felt a pang of sympathy for Chen Xu at that moment.

If she hadn't lost so much money that her company's funds were almost unable to circulate, Yang Xin would have wanted Ruan Ningxue to introduce him to her company right now.

Such a talented person who loves games is exactly the kind of employee she wanted!

"Don't worry, Xiaoxue, I'll be a negative example for your Junior Brother then. I'll use my own situation to comfort him," Yang Xin patted Ruan Ningxue's shoulder.

They were all unfortunate souls adrift in the world; she could understand the pain of failure.

"Thank you, Sister Xin. Oh, the game's name is *Mirror (Game)*, but the platform it launched on seems to be an overseas version," Ruan Ningxue said to Yang Xin.

Although she hadn't asked Chen Xu about the game's launch, she had secretly paid attention to it herself. However, when she looked at it then, the ratings and such hadn't been released yet, so she wasn't sure how it performed.

"*Mirror (Game)*, why does that game name sound a little familiar?"

"I feel like I've heard it somewhere before?"

"Wait... this game!"

Having gotten the game's name from Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin muttered to herself as she opened the Official Game Platform and started searching.

She didn't know why, but she always felt that this game sounded a little familiar.

She opened the overseas version platform, typed in the name, and searched.

Then Yang Xin fell silent, turning her head to stare intently at Ruan Ningxue.

"Holy crap, Xiaoxue, this is what you call 'not too good results'! This is the Junior Brother you said didn't understand anything about making games for the first time?"

"Are you kidding me!?"

*So that's why it sounded so familiar!* 

Before, when she was browsing game forums, she had seen people mention this game.

Then she looked at the game's product page.

Rating: 9.6, Number of Raters: 1724

Yang Xin couldn't stay calm.

Sympathy, empathy?

Who the hell can empathize with this kind of person!

Who the hell would sympathize with this kind of person!

A 9.6 rating, and that number of raters!

It's only been how many days, and it already has over 1700?

She had never experienced this kind of feeling!

"So Chen Xu's game was actually successful?" Ruan Ningxue asked Yang Xin.

"It's not just a success, it's a huge success! You know this is an 18R game! And it's only been how many days, with such a high rating and so many reviews, I estimate its subsequent sales volume will be higher than the highest-selling of my three previous games!"

Yang Xin said to Ruan Ningxue with an envious expression.

Looking at the number of reviews below the game store interface, she felt utterly terrible.

Especially when she remembered what she had just said to Ruan Ningxue about using herself as a negative example to comfort him.

Well, I'll be, she really had become a negative example now!

However, this awkward emotion was quickly cast aside. Yang Xin stood up and grabbed Ruan Ningxue's arm.

"Xiaoxue, please! You absolutely must introduce this master to me!"

"Let me learn from his experience!"

As the saying goes, "The pavilion near the water enjoys the moonlight first."

Hmm, although it's a bit strange, as long as the meaning is conveyed, it's fine.

When you can't be an influential figure yourself, and you find someone who might be one, why not latch onto them?
