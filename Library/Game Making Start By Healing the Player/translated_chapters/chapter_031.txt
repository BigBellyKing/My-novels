Chapter 31: First Experience with To the Moon

Days passed, and the deadline for the Sci-Fi Game Design Competition was approaching.

Major Game Producers and game companies all uploaded their participating games to the Official Game Platform.

Both mobile games and PC games were included, the vast majority were Single-player games, though there were also some online games.

Clearly, some were aiming for awards, but others were just there to join the fun.

After all, there were already corresponding projects, so if they could conveniently enter a competition, they did.

What if they won an award?

After these works were uploaded, the next step was a preliminary review.

Eliminating works with problematic content and shoddy productions.

Of course, this part of the process was not open to the public, but the eliminated games would still be launched on the game platform.

Although such a rule existed, very few games were actually eliminated each year.

After all, the condition for participation was being a qualified Game Designer.

They generally had some foundation.

This time, however, it attracted a lot of attention from the industry and players.

Specifically, whether Chen Xu, who developed a game for the competition in just over ten days, had his work eliminated.

‘Here it comes, here it comes! I scanned the main list, not a single game was eliminated!’

‘Holy cow! So the Game Department recognized Chen Xu’s game as eligible?’

‘If that’s the case, at least it’s definitely a playable game, right?’

‘Found it, found it! Chen Xu’s new work is called To the Moon!’

‘Judging by the name, it looks legitimate, does it involve the universe?’

‘The price is so cheap! Only 15 Yuan?’

‘It seems to be dual-platform, two different versions.’

‘What, two different versions? Even Undertale didn’t get that treatment!’

‘I’m going to see for myself what kind of game Chen Xu developed in just over ten days!’

With the release of the participating works, countless interested players quickly found their favorite games and downloaded them to experience.

Among them, To the Moon, developed by Chen Xu, was naturally the first to be targeted.

………………

The game section of the Shark TV live streaming platform.

Many streamers also started testing games for this Sci-Fi Game Design Competition.

This was considered Shark TV’s official cooperation in organizing publicity; after all, this Sci-Fi Game Design Competition was initiated and hosted by the Game Department, so it had a certain official nature, even though Shark TV wasn't directly approached.

But when it was time to curry favor, as a platform, they would definitely not be stingy with their efforts.

Whether they were approached or not, those with high awareness were always proactive.

As a streamer on Shark TV, Dong Zhen also knew about this platform event.

So he started streaming early in the morning, the title of his room was: “Experiencing Sci-Fi Game Design Competition Entries.”

‘Meowning!’

‘What’s up, bro? You’re actually streaming this early today?’

‘Good heavens, which zoo’s monkey escaped?’

‘Little Dong’s here so early?’

As soon as Dong Zhen started streaming, he saw the screen full of various teasing bullet comments.

Looking at these bullet comments, Dong Zhen chuckled.

“Ahem!!!”

“Alright, alright, good morning everyone, today we’re going to play some of the entries from this Sci-Fi Game Design Competition, it’s a heavy task!”

Dong Zhen said, while adjusting his streaming equipment and entering his account password to log into the Official Game Platform.

“For the first game, let’s play the new game from the author of Undertale first.”

“To be honest, I’ve been looking forward to it for a long time.”

“Why the anticipation? Don’t I have to mention the previous Undertale? It was really well-made.”

“But this To the Moon, I heard it was made in just over ten days, and the crucial thing is it wasn't eliminated by the Game Department. I'm really curious what kind of game this is!”

As he spoke, Dong Zhen opened the Official Game Platform and searched for To the Moon.

“Changing memories, an old man’s dying wish is to go to the moon. Good heavens, this is playing pretty wild!”

“Today, I, a respectable seven-foot man, will see what mystery this game holds.”

The game wasn’t very large, and his broadband network downloaded it quickly.

Seeing the screen flooded with various question marks in the live stream, Dong Zhen decisively ignored them and chose to open the game.

One meter sixty is impossible, he’s always been a tall guy at one meter ninety-two!

The game was installed quickly.

The game icon was simple: two children sitting on a log, looking at the distant moon.

Opening the game, the Nebula Games company logo was skipped.

A full moon and a lighthouse appeared on the screen, the sky was dotted with stars, and a few dark clouds slowly drifted by.

The game’s title, To the Moon, was carved onto the moon.

At the same time, the camera slowly moved downwards.

A warm piano concerto began playing as the background music.

As serene as moonlight.

A lighthouse, a grassy field, and a large mansion situated on the cliff edge by the lighthouse.

The camera slowly moved into the mansion’s interior; a girl was sitting at a piano playing, with a little boy beside her.

At this point, the background music changed; a simple piano piece began to play. Listening with closed eyes, it was as if one was in a forest, with a flowing stream in front.

‘Setting aside other things for now, this music is really nice!’

‘That’s right, Chen Xu’s works, without saying much else, the music truly feels top-notch!’

‘Yes, indeed, these two piano pieces are really beautiful.’

‘And Undertale, the music also added a lot to its score!’

‘Not just Undertale, the music in Mirror (Game) was also excellent!’

‘Catch a Gentleman’s Gamer!’

Looking at the bullet comments in the live stream, Dong Zhen secretly nodded.

The game hadn’t even started yet, he didn’t know if it was fun or not, but the music alone was truly excellent.

As everyone was immersed in the beautiful piano music, suddenly, the sound of a car engine was heard, followed by a crash.

With the sound of the crash, the game screen also appropriately shook.

The camera moved outside the house; a black sedan had crashed into a tree.

‘Where were you looking when you were driving, Neil!’

‘Uh, sorry, I was bravely trying to avoid that squirrel that suddenly darted out.’

‘…But either way, you still ran over it and crashed into the tree.’

‘See, there’s nothing to worry about, it’s the company car.’

‘Are you kidding? The boss will kill us!’

‘Hmm… Let’s just say I saved a puppy, he likes dogs, right?’

‘He likes cats more.’

‘Why does the world have to be so complicated? Oh well, whatever he likes, crisis averted!’

Thank you ‘Qianqiu VV’ for the 100 tip
