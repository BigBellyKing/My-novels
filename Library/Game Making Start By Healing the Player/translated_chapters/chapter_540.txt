Chapter 539: Silly Games (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

E… Ethan! 

The familiar name entered their ears, and Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue immediately turned their gaze to Chen Xu.

“That’s right, it’s Ethan’s story.” Chen Xu smiled.

The people in the office instantly fell into a brief silence.

Is this an FPS blockbuster?

While there were indeed shooting elements in the game, how on earth was this related to joy?

“Joyful? That’s a little gift for the players later. It’s what will be announced at the carnival, I didn’t say anything about it yet.” Hearing their words, Chen Xu lightly coughed and said.

“But Mr. Chen, what kind of new exclusive Switch title is that?” Ruan Ningxue asked curiously, remembering that Chen Xu had mentioned the Switch earlier.

Everyone looked at Chen Xu, their hearts also filled with considerable curiosity.

“It will be a very joyful game, like Mario in *Super Mario Odyssey*, it will be a game featuring Mario as the main character. The main focus will be on PVE and PVP coexistence, a platform-jumping game, but the levels in the game will be created by players themselves.” Chen Xu said with a smile.

“Alright, everyone, let me first talk about the upcoming plan.” Chen Xu clapped his hands: “Next, first is the development of ‘Hearts of Stone’ and ‘Blood and Wine’, but there’s no need to rush; it can be out before the New Year.”

“As for the sequel to *Resident Evil*, I’ve codenamed it ‘Village’. Unlike the previous installment, the monster designs in the new game will be more in line with players’ aesthetics, after all, Nebula Games is also a company that listens to player feedback.” Chen Xu said.

Everyone present was speechless; what the heck *in line with players’ aesthetics*! 

No matter how aesthetically pleasing, it’s still *Resident Evil*!

“In terms of gameplay, it will adopt a sandbox-style approach. Collection elements will occupy the core in this installment. At the same time, the game will also feature a special new setting: a mysterious merchant named Duke who can sell players bullets and weapon upgrades.” Chen Xu explained some of the settings for *Resident Evil Village* to everyone.

It could be said that this installment of *Resident Evil* was considered a magnum opus in his previous life, combining the traditional box-garden exploration and resource management of the *Resident Evil* series, as well as the oppressive horror of death-chase puzzles, and the combat system from *Resident Evil 4* and later.

“Of course, there’s no need to rush the development progress of *Resident Evil Village* for now. It’ll be fine if we can get the promotional CG ready for the carnival. During this period, our main energy will be focused on the new Switch title.” Chen Xu briefly outlined their main tasks to everyone.

………………

Meanwhile, at Nebula Games, as Chen Xu arranged the corresponding tasks.

The players online were buzzing with discussion due to the news Chen Xu had announced.

On one hand, it was because Nebula Games was holding its first offline carnival event of this kind.

On the other hand, the focus was on the new game news Chen Xu mentioned.

However, the main point of interest for everyone wasn't the new title for the carnival day, as that was still some time away, and players couldn't just go if they wanted to; they needed a bit of luck.

More players were interested in the new cooperative, joyful mini-game that Chen Xu had mentioned.

‘I wonder what kind of joyful mini-game Chen Xu is talking about!?’

‘Something like *It Takes Two* or *Overcooked*?’

‘Don’t be silly, how could that be called joyful?’

‘Why isn’t it joyful? If you want to break up with your girlfriend but don’t know how to say it, just play *Overcooked* with her, then break up directly. I ask you, isn’t that joyful?’

‘There’s such a move? Learned it! But where do I pick up a girlfriend?’

‘Mr. Chen is a game designer who never lies, it’s just that sometimes Mr. Chen’s meaning always has a slight discrepancy with what we imagine. Now I just hope this is genuinely joyful, not a horror game, okay!’

The players online discussed animatedly, but they didn't have to wait long.

Less than a week later, while players were still discussing the Nebula Games Carnival, the theme park, and *The Witcher: Wild Hunt*, whose popularity hadn't faded yet.

Many Nebula Games players discovered that they had received a free game in their Nebula Games Platform accounts from the system.

It was available on mobile, Switch, and PC platforms, but not on VR. 

However, many players weren't too surprised by this, as Chen Xu had clearly stated it was a mini-game earlier.

In the Nebula Games store’s promotional interface, there was a video about the new title.

Unlike *Bloodborne* and *The Witcher: Wild Hunt* with their slightly oppressive background music and atmosphere.

This mini-game was full of joyful vibes, with a touch of comical silliness in its cheerful atmosphere.

They saw a white, noodle-like little figure falling from the sky onto a slightly rough garden platform.

It landed with a splat, but then the little figure wobbled and stood up as if nothing had happened.

It staggered two steps for every one it took, looking like a drunken man, which, combined with its rubbery, noodle-like body, was utterly comical.

Watching the demo video for this new game, many people were amused just by looking at it.

‘Holy cow, what kind of ghost game is this? It looks so silly!’

‘This little character looks like he’s drunk!’

‘Hahaha, it’s like Fall Guys again, feels like a rubber man, no bones or anything?’

‘233333, this art style is too comical, isn’t it?’

‘The way it walks is simply unbelievable.’

‘I believe Mr. Chen has truly made a joyful game this time!’

Many players were immediately delighted upon seeing this game.

And the gift Chen Xu gave to players was a very famous comical and joyful game from his previous life: *Human: Fall Flat*.

Of course, it also had another translated name, *Human: Fall Dream*.

From a gameplay perspective, it was just a regular puzzle-platformer.

But the game’s most outstanding feature was its comical silliness.

The unique physics engine, combined with the boneless rubber-man design, allowed players in the game to perform many funny and interesting actions.

Of course, this unique physics engine wasn’t original to this game, but it was this game that sparked the wave of silly games.

After the game launched on the store, many players who saw the video for *Human: Fall Flat* immediately thought of a game called Fall Guys.

But the difference was that Fall Guys had PVP elements, while *Human: Fall Flat* was purely PVE.

Combined with its puzzle-solving and level-clearing tags, a scene instantly flashed in many players’ minds.

How much fun would it be to play this seemingly silly game with two or three friends?
