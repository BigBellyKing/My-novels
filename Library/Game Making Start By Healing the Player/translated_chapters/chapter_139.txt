Chapter 138: Feedback on the Random Mode (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Topics about the brand new random mode quickly surged in various Dark Souls-related forum communities.

“This mode is incredibly unfriendly to the African Chieftains! I have a friend, and everything he gets is either an ephemeral soul or a dung pie; as for weapons, they’re all whips!”

“What? There are whip weapons in this game?!”

“I have an uncertain guess: that friend you mentioned, it wouldn't happen to be yourself, would it?”

“Seriously, the first BOSS at the start was the Dancer of the Boreal Valley, I’m so fed up!”

“What’s that even compared to? On the way through the Cemetery of Ash, I encountered Black Knights, Corvians, and Snake-Men – not a single one was missed!”

The brand new random mode reignited the urge for many players, who had previously grown somewhat tired of Dark Souls, to open the game once more.

While the random mode’s balance sometimes meant luck outweighed skill.

For instance, some destined Lucky Kings, like Liu Xiu, could often pick up various powerful top-tier weapons and the souls of Lords of Cinder right at the start, thus elevating their game experience to a simple hack-and-slash difficulty.

Conversely, some unlucky players with the 'Chieftain' fate might painstakingly find an item, only to pick it up and discover it’s an embarrassing dung pie, thus escalating their game experience to a 'hack-and-slash' difficulty of a different kind: hellish.

This mode also awakened a new trait in many players, after their 'M' attribute: obsessive-compulsive disorder!

In the original version, many players wouldn’t even bother looking at collectible items.

Because most likely, they were just souls or weapon items they felt were useless, offering little help to the game experience and seemingly just for satisfying a player’s collecting obsession.

But in random mode, it was different; the item you overlooked could be the soul of the Nameless King, or a Black Knight Shield.

So naturally, for players, not a single item could be overlooked.

What if the next item was something super awesome!?

Furthermore, there was another point, which was the greatest appeal of the random gameplay.

Players would never know if the next item they opened would be a dung pie or a treasure.

This thrill of drawing a prize was quite enticing.

Combining these factors, some ordinary players who had originally finished their first playthrough and then watched a wave of Souls scholars analyze Dark Souls’ background and plot on video platforms.

At this point, they reopened Dark Souls and embarked on another Firelinking journey.

After all, Dark Souls’ original multiple playthroughs were mostly just repetitive gameplay. Although monsters and BOSSes would become stronger in subsequent playthroughs, and some items would only appear then.

But for some ordinary players, this was clearly not enough to make them replay the game.

The random mode, however, was different.

Its entertainment value was stronger, and each time the game was restarted, it was like a brand new journey.

Players would never guess what kind of items they would pick up next, or what kind of BOSSes and mobs they would encounter.

After the random mode was released, Dark Souls’ popularity not only saw a resurgence, but its sales even experienced a small bump.

This was because the random mode’s entertainment and watchability, as showcased on major live streaming and video platforms, were very appealing.

Of course, whether these players, attracted by the random mode, could truly awaken a special constitution and remain in the world of Souls when they truly embarked on the Firelinking path, would depend on their tolerance.

For players, Dark Souls’ original content was already enough to keep them busy for a while, and the appearance of this random mode allowed them to 'offer up a few more livers' (i.e., dedicate even more time and effort).

However, besides these points.

There was another question that greatly concerned players.

That was: when exactly did Chen Xu plan to develop a sequel to Dark Souls?

………………

Inside Nebula Games’ office.

After the development of Dark Souls was completed, the new mode was also launched.

Currently, the entire team was relatively free.

Apart from the Customer Service and Operations Department for the Nebula Games Platform and its forum communities, and the audit department for the Workshop.

Over in the Game Department, the busiest departments were Sanguosha, Fall Guys, and Overcooked – the three requiring continuous operation.

Unlike a single-player game like Dark Souls, these three games relied on multiplayer mode as their selling point.

Therefore, they all required continuous operation.

Aside from Sanguosha, which maintained very high user stickiness, the other two games, though no longer at their peak, still had many active players.

Chen Xu, naturally, wouldn't simply let them be, but his own energy was no longer focused on this area.

Chen Xu stretched, then looked at some information his assistant, Lin Rou, had gathered for him.

Because his main energy was focused on game development, he sometimes missed important information from the gaming industry at first glance.

Lin Rou, on the other hand, collected all sorts of important news for him.

He scanned it quickly; there was no major news recently.

The gaming industry’s main focus was on TengHua and NetDragon’s two new VR titles.

However, the information he had previously asked Lin Rou to collect about AI technology companies caught Chen Xu’s eye for a moment longer.

Naturally, there was no need to mention top-tier AI companies; they involved facial and iris recognition, medical, security, and military applications, a plate too large to handle, and this area was clearly not the type Chen Xu paid attention to.

Moreover, large AI companies were basically not integrated entities that had developed everything themselves; they mostly relied on a 'money tactics' of 'buy, buy, buy'.

And thus forged their own moat of massive data.

As for general AI companies, their scale was nowhere near as large.

By reviewing the information collected by Lin Rou, Chen Xu noticed that several AI technology companies met the prerequisites for using item cards.

He pulled out the files for these companies, placed them in a separate folder, then stretched and got up to leave his office.

It was noon break, and in the entertainment area, Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, Qin Yi, and a group of other employees were either dozing with headphones on in lounge chairs or playing games together.

Currently, if you included the cleaning aunties, Nebula Games had reached 85 active employees.

It couldn't quite be called a medium-sized game company, but it wasn't a small studio either.

Chen Xu walked towards them, and several employees greeted him as they saw him.

On the only sofa, Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue were connected with controllers, experiencing the new Dark Souls mode on the big screen.

“Xiaoxue, your luck is terrible! What is this junk, the Irithyll Straight Sword! Watch me pull a Dragonslayer Greataxe for you later!” Yang Xin complained, looking at what Ruan Ningxue had gotten.

“And this is your luck, Sister Xin? A Firebomb?” Ruan Ningxue retorted.

“Tsk, tsk, your luck!” Chen Xu said, opening a can of cola he had taken from the fridge earlier.

“Mr. Chen, why don’t you give it a try?” Ruan Ningxue said, about to hand the controller to Chen Xu.

“I’ll pass, you guys play,” Chen Xu waved his hand. Mainly, he wasn’t very confident in his own luck. After all, he had always won system gachas by sheer volume, and so far, he had only drawn two special items, God knows how many 'pities' he had accumulated.

Ruan Ningxue continued playing, and Yang Xin, remembering something, said, “Oh, Mr. Chen, when are we going to develop the Dark Souls sequel? I’ve seen many players urging us in the forum communities and on the official Weibo account!”

Qin Yi, who had just arrived, immediately chimed in, “Yeah, Mr. Chen, when are we developing the sequel? From the current story and worldview, the sequel should be about the past, right? I feel a prequel would be more fitting!”

The other employees, hearing the commotion, also perked up their ears and looked at Chen Xu with expectant eyes.

They were clearer about whether there would be a sequel than ordinary players.

Because during the game’s production, there were deliberate plot hooks, clearly preparing for a sequel.

Their only shared sentiment with the players was that they, too, particularly wanted to know the complete worldview and story of Dark Souls.

Looking at the expectant faces, Chen Xu shook his head: “You’re right, it is indeed a prequel. But there’s no plan for it yet, and Dark Souls has only been online for less than two months. It’s too early to talk about a sequel now.”

“At least let the players take a breather. Of course, if you have no objections, I can now create a folder named ‘Dark Souls: Prequel’. Also, if all goes as expected, the company has another big move coming up.”

“A big move!?” Hearing Chen Xu’s words, everyone grew even more curious.

“You’ll know when the time comes.” Chen Xu smiled and offered no further explanation, then stood up and returned to his office.

I’m continuing to write 20,000 words today. Although I don’t have any stored manuscripts, it’s no longer the new book period, so I can finally indulge myself. With a large and satisfying amount, you won’t be able to say the word ‘short’ again.
