Chapter 131: This Game Has Side Quests Too?! (Please Subscribe)

Regarding randomized items and enemies, actually, previous life's Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 3 both had similar MODs.

It's just that there were quite a few bugs.

For instance, due to topographical constraints, specific BOSSes like High Lord Wolnir, who are limited by terrain, would be difficult to appear elsewhere.

In contrast, the random item setting is much easier to implement.

Only specific quest items remain unchanged, ensuring that the player's quest progression and main story flow can proceed smoothly.

As for the rest?

Just let fate decide.

It can be said that this kind of randomization has no specific balance; it's purely based on luck.

If you're lucky, you might start with all sorts of divine artifacts.

If you're unlucky, you might not even be able to leave Firelink Shrine.

However, Chen Xu did not intend for this unique mode to be the core gameplay of Dark Souls.

It was more of a small gift and a little bit of fun for players.

To give players some new avenues for entertainment.

Of course, it certainly won't be officially launched yet; at the very least, they'd have to wait until a batch of players successfully complete the Dark Souls story.

Although he had an idea in mind, Chen Xu didn't immediately bring it up to Qin Yi and the others.

The main reason was that even if they developed this new mode later, it wouldn't take much effort.

After all, everything would be built upon the existing content of the Dark Souls game itself.

Moreover, developing Dark Souls during this period involved a considerable workload, with constant overtime to meet deadlines.

So, Chen Xu also arranged compensatory leave for the development team members.

............

In Nebula Games' office, Chen Xu once again received the representative from Target Software.

Both parties sat down to discuss matters related to publishing.

An hour later, Chen Xu, with a smile, shook hands with the other party's representative: "A pleasant cooperation."

"A pleasant cooperation, Mr. Chen."

Regarding the few requests Chen Xu made two days prior, Target Software had fully agreed after internal discussions upon their return.

Chen Xu would still be in charge of the game's direction, while they would only be responsible for publishing.

This included the final product of an overseas game, which would also require Chen Xu's input.

The commission for distribution remained unchanged.

However, Target Software also put forward a new request: under similar future publishing conditions, Target Software would have priority to sign Nebula Games' next three major titles.

In addition, Target Software also proposed to co-publish some of the independent games previously released by Nebula Games to overseas markets.

As for the terms, they would still refer to the publishing contract for Dark Souls.

Chen Xu agreed to this.

After all, if Nebula Games were to handle everything, there would still be quite a few troubles.

............

For several days, Chen Xu was quite busy.

His main focus was signing the relevant publishing contracts with Target Software, but of course, the primary work remained on Dark Souls.

This included channel promotion for overseas markets and game content translation, for which Chen Xu also formed a special team to liaise with Target Software.

Meanwhile, online over the past few days, the first batch of players who got their hands on Dark Souls, aside from clumsy players, had mostly progressed to the late stages of the story.

Sitting in front of his computer, Zhang Yi had reached the final area, the Kiln of the First Flame in the game.

Beside him, his girlfriend Wang Han sat watching.

This save file became exclusively his after the first day of the game.

Mainly because the previous 'one death per person' rule was a bit too troublesome.

His seat wasn't even warm yet, and it was already time to switch.

Recalling his journey through Dark Souls, Zhang Yi felt a mix of emotions.

It really wasn't easy.

From dying like a dog against Gundyr the Ash at the very beginning, he was now finally about to accomplish the great feat of Linking the Fire.

He stepped onto the map known as the Kiln of the First Flame.

And here, he would face his final enemy.

At the end of a distant, empty rift, the sky was covered in dark clouds, and a blood-red setting sun, seemingly about to dip below the horizon, dyed everything crimson.

But most of that sun had already been enveloped by darkness, with only a tiny sliver of afterglow still radiating.

Looking out, he saw the collapsed capital, twisted great trees, and countless disparate buildings, as if from different eras, with various weapons still scattered on the ground.

And, of course, the ground was covered in bloodstains.

Zhang Yi had grown accustomed to this.

After all, in Dark Souls, it would be strange if there was a map without players' blood and tears.

Even within the seemingly safe Firelink Shrine, countless players had left their blood and tears after provoking the Crestfallen Warrior.

Slowly moving forward, Zhang Yi finally saw the final BOSS.

Armor almost burned to cinders, and a fiercely burning Coiled Sword in hand, was the epitome of every Firelinker.

Nothing more to say, he directly engaged in battle.

The Soul of Cinder's skills were incredibly cool, and he was the Firelinker itself, yet possessed the skills of various classes.

Moreover, the weapon in its hand would transform into various types, such as a Greatsword or Straight Sword, depending on the situation.

Although throughout the game until now, Zhang Yi had never intentionally level-locked; he upgraded whenever he had enough souls.

Yet, facing the Soul of Cinder, this final BOSS, he still died numerous times.

However, having endured nearly a hundred hours of Dark Souls' grueling experience, he had completely grown accustomed to it.

In fact, now he felt that if he didn't die a couple of times a day playing Dark Souls, something felt wrong.

"NICE! Finally cleared it!"

After depleting the final BOSS's health bar, even though many veteran players and hardcore players online had already cleared it.

Zhang Yi was still a little excited at this moment.

In the game, Zhang Yi's character stood beside the First Flame, igniting it to let the fire spread across his body, then slowly sat down next to the First Flame. The camera slowly zoomed towards the distant sun, seemingly about to be completely swallowed by darkness.

The next moment, the screen went black, and the Dark Souls game title appeared in the center of the screen.

Thus, the game's first playthrough concluded.

"This game, seriously, at first it made my scalp tingle from the abuse, but later it just got more and more satisfying the more I played!" Looking at the UI returning to the main game interface, Zhang Yi, still not entirely satisfied, said to Wang Han beside him.

He wasn't showing off; these were his genuine thoughts.

When he first started playing Dark Souls, he truly hadn't imagined there could be such a brutal game.

But as he kept dying, he suddenly realized that this game was actually quite interesting.

And the more he played, the more he felt an irresistible pull from the game.

It seemed like the various classes didn't differ much; in the early stages, it was mostly about hacking and slashing.

But he felt there was a lot of room to explore the different playstyles offered by various weapons and stat allocations.

Especially the excitement and sense of accomplishment after defeating a BOSS – that was something he had only experienced in Dark Souls.

"The only regret I have is that I didn't quite grasp what the story of this game was about; all I knew was Linking the Fire," Zhang Yi said, scratching his head.

Dark Souls' biggest characteristic was its fragmented storytelling.

At the same time, Chen Xu prioritized the story of the third generation, and although he dug many holes and implicitly left many hints about the first generation's story in the game.

This allowed players to understand the past glory of the Souls world.

However, for most players who simply hacked and slashed and Linked the Fire without delving deep, not even knowing the trigger conditions for other endings, there were clearly many questions about the plot.

For instance, how did the First Flame originate? Who was Lord Gwyn, the original Lord of Cinder? Who was the Nameless King atop Archdragon Peak? What was Pontiff Sulyvahn's true background? What was the Age of Fire's pinnacle like?

Before completing the first playthrough, players focused on the hacking and slashing; but after clearing it, players became somewhat interested in the story, yet most were completely baffled, only understanding the surface.

Such as why Link the Fire, and why the Lords of Cinder didn't want to Link the Fire.

But the vast lore of the Souls world remained largely unknown to them.

Seeing Zhang Yi looking puzzled, Wang Han scoffed beside him: "Who told you to just hack and slash BOSSes and not pay attention to the story?"

"Then you tell me the story," Zhang Yi said.

"Haven't I not cleared it yet? But what's currently circulating online is that besides the Link the Fire ending, there's also an End of Fire ending, and it's quite possible that Dark Souls will have a sequel," Wang Han coughed lightly.

Most players were still quite unclear about what the Dark Souls story actually was.

Whether it was difficulty, gameplay mechanics, or plot, Dark Souls was not a game that could be judged using previous ARPG experiences.

The only thing players could confirm was that through various items, gadgets, and lingering legends, they knew it was the end of an era.

But what was the world like at the dawn of that era?

Clearly, Chen Xu probably hadn't even created a folder for that yet!

"So you don't even know after all that, and you're lecturing me!" Zhang Yi pouted, listening to Wang Han's words.

At least he had cleared the game!

"That's because Dark Souls' story and world-building are too vast!" Wang Han argued. "And you just know how to hack and slash and clear the game. Do you know Patches' ending? Do you know Siegward of Catarina's side quest story? And those side quests for the Crestfallen Warrior and the Saintess, I bet you haven't done any of them!"

Listening to Wang Han, Zhang Yi scratched his head: "What! This game has side quests?"

Of course, this was just a joke. As one of the first players to experience Dark Souls, Zhang Yi didn't truly not know about side quests.

However, while he knew about them, Zhang Yi genuinely hadn't completed a single side quest during his playthrough.

And this was the experience of most players.

Because in Dark Souls, unlike other ARPGs that practically force you to complete side quests before allowing you to proceed with the main story.

In Dark Souls, all quests, including the main quest, have no explicit prompts.

Everything must be discovered by the players themselves.

If the main quest isn't figured out, the game cannot progress.

But side quests are truly missed if you miss them.

As a result, many players completed their first playthrough without ever knowing what side quests the game actually had.

But when players delve into the stories behind these side quests, they gain a whole new understanding of Dark Souls.
