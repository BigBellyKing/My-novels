Chapter 93: The Arrangement of Dark Souls

Choosing *Dark Souls*, or rather, the third installment which serves as the final chapter of the Dark Souls series, was something Chen Xu had carefully considered.

In his previous life, *Dark Souls* was a quite massive series.

From the first installment to the third, which depicted the final era of Linking the Fire.

It told players a magnificent, epic story about the Age of Fire.

Among them, the first and third installments left a deeper impression on players.

This was mainly because the second installment was not personally handled by Hidetaka Miyazaki, and it became a point of criticism for many players.

Specifically, *Dark Souls 2* had many areas that adopted a 'mob-piling' style of difficulty.

This is also why the second installment didn't achieve the same level of renown as the first and third.

As for Chen Xu's decision to proceed with the development of *Dark Souls 3*.

The reason was very simple.

It was because, by the third installment, the core concepts of the Souls games had already matured.

For example, *Demon's Souls*, the original Souls-like game, many players found it harder than *Dark Souls 3*, while others found it simpler.

However, the difficulty in that game wasn't primarily in the boss battles; it was more about its rather user-unfriendly design and maliciously crafted maps.

But *Dark Souls* was different; it could be called a standard level-driven game, or even a 'memorization game'.

Compared to the first installment, many players found the third a bit easier, which is perfectly valid.

Because the third installment is indeed the most suitable for beginners to get into Souls-like games.

If one were to rank Hidetaka Miyazaki's Souls-like games, temporarily setting aside *Dark Souls 2* (which he didn't personally produce) and *Demon's Souls* (his first attempt at a Souls-like game where various concepts were still immature).

Then, *Dark Souls 3* could be said to be the easiest compared to *Dark Souls 1*, *Sekiro*, *Bloodborne*, and *Elden Ring*. (Don't argue with me; if you want to argue, argue with Hidetaka Miyazaki, because the old geezer himself said this during a Famitsu interview about *Elden Ring*).

Unlike *Dark Souls 1*, which immediately let players run around aimlessly in the center of Firelink Shrine, often stumbling into high-level areas.

*Dark Souls 3* was very thoughtfully arranged in terms of its game pace, roughly following a 'learn-test-graduate-learn-test' model, which could be described as progressive.

Precisely because of this, *Dark Souls 3* is also the highest-selling Souls game to date.

Of course, the difficulty of *Dark Souls 1* was also quite close to that of *Demon's Souls*, as it was an early title in the Souls series after all.

However, it differed somewhat from *Demon's Souls*' map design; limited by development funds and content at the time, *Dark Souls 1* adopted a very clever approach.

It referenced and drew inspiration from *Metroid* and *Castlevania: Symphony of the Night* for map structure design, adopting a Mobius strip model.

This, in turn, became a major highlight of the Souls series and has been preserved ever since.

One could say that when it comes to Hidetaka Miyazaki's Souls-like games, if you were to ask about groundbreaking achievements...

Like *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time* establishing the standards for 3D games – well, there isn't really anything like that in Souls-like games.

Because all the mechanics were already established.

Rolling, parrying, backstabs, grappling hooks, blocking, including map design and fragmented storytelling – none of these were pioneered by Souls games.

However, its greatest feature was combining these existing mechanics to create a game with a unique style.

The so-called 'difficulty' was merely a superficial label.

If one truly believes that Souls-like games equal difficulty, then one could only say they are looking in the completely wrong direction.

It was precisely for these reasons, and considering the tolerance levels of players in the Parallel World.

That Chen Xu chose *Dark Souls 3* as the next new title to develop.

Another reason, of course, was that from a development capability standpoint, a level-driven game is somewhat simpler to create than a typical game.

Furthermore, as a project to establish the reputation and brand of the Nebula Games platform, its widespread appeal had to be taken into account.

Souls-like games, with their unique charm, were clearly a rather suitable option.

After all, the live streaming industry in the Parallel World was also very well-developed compared to his previous life, and games like *Dark Souls* could achieve a widespread boost in popularity through live streaming platforms.

In his previous life, *Dark Souls 3* and *Sekiro* enjoyed extremely high popularity domestically, which was inseparable from the development of the live streaming and video industries.

As for the story, that was not an issue at all, because for Souls-like games, level design is more important than the narrative itself.

Of course, fragmented storytelling remains a major characteristic of Souls-like games.

Unless you, as a player, are a rare genius, it's basically impossible to fully understand the complete story of a Souls-like game in just one playthrough.

After completing the first playthrough, you'd at most only grasp a general idea.

Many plot points aren't directly told to you during gameplay, but are hidden in various places, requiring players to piece them together.

This also led to the unique charm of the Souls series: a thousand players have a thousand opinions.

Everyone has a unique understanding of the story of *Dark Souls*.

Because a great deal of content related to the plot and world-building is scattered throughout the game in fragmented form.

Typically, it requires deep digging to roughly understand the direction of the story.

Thus, the story of *Dark Souls* was continuously dug into and studied by players, even giving rise to memes like 'Souls scholars'.

As the story of the end of the Age of Fire, *Dark Souls 3* could entirely utilize a flashback technique to present it to players.

All that was needed was to handle some in-game homages and easter egg elements as foreshadowing for subsequent prequels.

………………

Inside the Nebula Games office, Chen Xu leaned back in his chair, eyes closed, contemplating the future direction of *Dark Souls*.

As for the gameplay design concept drafts and such, Chen Xu wasn't in a hurry for now.

Because even if he were to 'grind them out' now, project development still required a preparation period.

Before that, the points accumulated from *Overcooked* before the New Year could be used for a big 'gacha pull' to improve his abilities in various aspects, and at the same time, see if he could draw some good items.

As for *Sanguosha* and *Fall Guys*, they hadn't provided many points yet.

Because these two games had only officially launched after the gameplay Expo concluded.

So they hadn't provided many points.

After mentally reviewing the future direction of *Dark Souls*, Chen Xu opened his browser and the Nebula Games platform's backend to check on the performance of *Fall Guys* and *Sanguosha*.

*Dark Souls*, as Nebula Games' first AAA-tier game, was considered a long-term project.

Although players expressed high anticipation, he could only tell them that "it's being made".

*Sanguosha* and *Fall Guys* would be the cornerstones of Nebula Games for the foreseeable future.

And it wasn't just Chen Xu himself.

Many Game Designers in the industry had also been keeping an eye on *Sanguosha* and *Fall Guys*.

After all, during the gameplay Expo, these two games had truly stood out.

Many Game Designers and developers were also paying close attention to the relevant data after these two games officially launched.

A game isn't considered successful just by being popular; gross revenue and sales volume are the core determinants of a game's success or failure.

(Daily request for recommendation tickets and monthly passes. Before *Dark Souls*, I'm also planning to write a small-scale, low-cost game to bridge the timeline. Keywords: three men, one woman, one dog. What is it, guess?)
