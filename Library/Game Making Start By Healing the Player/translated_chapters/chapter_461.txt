Chapter 460: Tourism Simulator (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Just like Song Ren and Zhang Yi, many players, upon truly entering the game, immediately went to experience the assassination mission that was cliff-hanged in the previous demo.

As for the methods of assassination, each displayed their unique abilities.

Some chose to sneak in and assassinate, just like Song Ren, and naturally, the sneaking methods varied. You could blend in with the crowd to pass undetected, or you could pay the fallen women nearby to distract the guards at the entrance, allowing Ezio to slip in secretly.

Of course, you could also climb from the rooftops to find an undiscovered path to sneak in.

Then there were players who simply couldn't be bothered to stealth, or who attempted stealth but were discovered, forcing them to openly fight their way in.

However, for those who openly fought their way in, some players successfully assassinated the target and eliminated all mission objectives, completing what could be called a 'perfect' assassination tutorial.

But others were treated to a 'desynchronization'.

In the game, Chen Xu did not force players to use a specific method to complete the mission. However, if one chose to directly assassinate or was discovered at the main entrance, the difficulty would increase significantly.

Although Chen Xu had made more improvements to the original action system in the game, making it simpler and the actions smoother, Ezio at this point only had the appearance of an assassin, but none of the actual assassin's strength.

The only skill he possessed was the Hidden Blade parry. As for chain kill techniques, aerial assassination techniques, or other actions, Ezio had none of them. So, when facing multiple enemies, especially in open areas, players needed to rely on their skill and positioning. One wrong move, and you'd only get to admire what the 'desynchronization' screen looked like.

Of course, besides these, what also attracted players was the game's portrayal of Florence during the Renaissance era.

Players didn't even need to follow the story or understand the combat mechanics; just gazing at the unique scenery of the Renaissance was enough to excite them.

The box garden design made the visual presentation of the entire *Assassin's Creed* second only to *Uncharted*, but the more free controls and detailed NPCs added a touch of life to the entire game.

Places like Florence, Venice, and the Apennine Mountains, although not open-world in gameplay, still had some collectible elements. Combined with the unique characteristics of the Renaissance period, just looking at them was enough to fill players with emotion.

With the official launch of *Assassin's Creed*, the internet was quickly flooded with feedback from players who had experienced it.

'I've been to Italy too, but the architecture style is different from the game. So this is what Renaissance architecture looked like!'

'The bro upstairs is talking nonsense, how many years has it been! And actually, the Renaissance isn't that far from modern times. The biggest feature was abandoning the Gothic architectural style of the Middle Ages and re-adopting the column composition elements of ancient Greek and Roman periods in religious and secular buildings.'

'Speaking of the Florence Cathedral in Florence, I searched for it and it's perfectly recreated!'

'And the city of Florence is incredibly accurate! Climbing to a viewpoint at night is absolutely breathtaking!'

'And Leonardo da Vinci, he's actually good friends with the protagonist, and the assassin's equipment is just repaired by him!'

'But I'm more curious about Altaïr mentioned inside. He should be the second assassin from the previous promotional trailer, right? I wonder if there will be a story about this Master Assassin later.'

'Comparatively, I'm more looking forward to Ezio's growth, from a hooligan to an Assassin Master due to his family's tragedy!'

'So, will the future Ezio and Altaïr cross paths?'

'Probably not, Altaïr has been dead for who knows how many years.'

'The combat gameplay of the entire game is also very rich. The most interesting part is stealth, but I always fail and am forced to eliminate all witnesses.'

'No problem, eliminating all witnesses means it was a perfect stealth operation!'

'But the most impressive thing has to be the game's incredible portrayal of the cultural atmosphere of that historical period, with all sorts of details. Especially the Italian voice acting, where the mouth movements are even different. And did anyone notice that Ezio can even speak French? I wonder why Ezio learned French. It couldn't be just to chase girls, right?'

'LOL, you never know! But did you notice the details? Everyone in the streets and alleys has their own life; it truly made me feel like I was back in the Renaissance era!'

'Yeah, it even feels like you don't need to do the main quest or fight; just sightseeing can take a long time!'

'Haha, I took a few screenshots with VR and posted them on WeChat Moments, and some people actually asked if I went on a trip to Italy!'

'Honestly, with this realistic art style, if you don't photograph the NPCs, it really feels like the real thing!'

'So, this isn't *Assassin's Creed*? It's a Tourism Simulator?'

The players who had played online were discussing every aspect of the game.

At the same time, the meme about it being a 'Tourism Simulator' also spread among the player base.

This isn't to say that the scenery in other games isn't beautiful.

Because if we're talking about scenery, *Uncharted*'s graphics might even be more exquisite.

But it's rare for a game to present players with such a strong sense of historical era as *Assassin's Creed*.

It perfectly combined the entire game's setting with a real historical backdrop.

The humanities and environment of the Renaissance period were perfectly presented by *Assassin's Creed*.

Coupled with a slightly fantastical setting, it can be said to be truly unique.

A fusion of reality and illusion.

Making *Assassin's Creed* radiate an indescribable charm.

One could say that after experiencing the content of *Assassin's Creed*, players were left with only one feeling: if you want to experience this period of Renaissance history, then the best choice to date is *Assassin's Creed*.

In fact, many players, after entering the game and completing the short tutorial-like levels, completely ignored the main objectives and genuinely played it as a Tourism Simulator.

Wandering the streets of Florence, standing at the top of the Florence Cathedral at night to gaze at the night view.

Admiring the unique architectural style of the Renaissance, and in the church corridors, seeing the art exhibitions of historical artists.

It felt as if they had truly traveled back to the Apennine Peninsula during the Renaissance, experiencing the unique charm of that period centuries ago.

Of course, more players still, while enjoying Italy of the Renaissance era centuries ago, gradually grew alongside the young Ezio to become a wise Assassin Master.
