Chapter 620: Mr. Chen is Bluffing You (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Although many players felt that _Detroit: Become Human_ would have many endings during their playthrough,

After completing their first playthrough, when players went online to search for related guides, wanting to see what other endings there were and how to achieve them, many players were stunned.

Because there were simply too many endings and branching paths, different choices, including actions similar to QTEs, would determine the final outcome for each character.

Of course, most of them didn't seem very good.

For example, in one route, considered by many players to be the true ending, Marcus sacrifices his life during the demonstration.

It was precisely because of Marcus's sacrifice that Connor was also influenced later, becoming a deviant android and inheriting Marcus's last wish, leading the androids to continue their struggle.

There were many memorable moments for players in this storyline, such as Connor's grief as he watched the peace-loving young man sacrifice himself in the Jericho ship's hold.

And his spontaneous words when helping Kara leave:

“I used to hunt you, but back then I was a machine, I didn't understand! Now I understand everything!”

This also reminded many players of the game's title, _Detroit: Become Human_. From being a cold-blooded machine investigating deviant androids at the very beginning, Connor slowly and genuinely transformed into a human.

And this gave players an even deeper sense of empathy.

After all, both Marcus and Kara had directly become deviant androids early on.

But only with Connor did players personally experience how he transformed from a robot that only knew how to follow orders into a deviant android.

Especially the ending where, after the final struggle, he stands on the podium giving a speech in place of Marcus, which left countless players deeply shocked.

In this storyline, Connor still uncovered CyberLife's conspiracy.

They orchestrated the android revolution and anticipated that Connor could become the subsequent leader.

Now, this company intended to control Connor, the leader, to maintain control over the newly freed androids.

So, while still possessing control over his body on the podium, Connor pulled out his pistol.

Because he understood that he could still struggle now, but one day he would be controlled by CyberLife.

Therefore, to prevent the androids from returning to their past, Connor once again took out that pistol and aimed it at his chin.

One bullet crossed the boundary between life and death.

As an android, every time he died before, he would reappear refreshed in front of his partner Hank a few days later, startling him.

But this time was different; he would never come back.

Various route guides and strategies were continuously dug up and summarized by players.

In truth, the game itself didn't have any officially designated ending.

Regardless of the final outcome, all endings were closely related to the player's choices and could be logically explained.

However, for players, they clearly still had their own preferred endings.

Among them, the ending where most characters survived was called the perfect ending by many players.

As for the ending that leaned more towards tragedy, where Marcus sacrifices himself and Connor takes his own life with a pistol.

While many players considered this the true ending, an equal number disliked it, as it was a great tragedy.

And while the story of _Detroit: Become Human_ was highly praised,

Correspondingly, a background element in the game also sparked much discussion among players.

As an interactive movie game, _Detroit: Become Human_ not only told a compelling story and showcased new brainwave technology,

But the game's background and corresponding social relationships also became points of interest for many players. After all, the so-called artificial intelligence, with the development of society, has continually entered various industries.

Transportation, healthcare, gaming, and so on, all have the shadow of so-called artificial intelligence.

However, the androids in the game were obviously many levels more advanced than real-world AI.

Furthermore, the game itself didn't immerse players from a human perspective but from an android's point of view.

This gave players a sense of displacement, and many discussed the story online.

“It would be great to have androids in real life! I wouldn't abuse them like the people in the game!”

“But thinking about it, it's actually quite unreasonable. The androids in the game are very low-end products, the kind that can be mass-produced. You can see from magazines that androids like Kara only cost 899 dollars. That's not even as expensive as a mobile phone!”

“To be fair, it's probably because they're so cheap that abuse happens, right? Think about how you treat your phone. When you first buy it, you handle it with care, put on screen protectors and cases, and even charge it carefully. But after a while, you just toss it onto the bed, charge it without caring if it harms the device, plug it in when it's dead, and pull it out when you want to use it.”

“F*ck, who are you? Did you install a monitor on me?”

“23333333, that's too real!”

“But honestly, I really want an android like North.”

“????????? Do you want an android? I don't even bother to say what you really want!”

“No lewding allowed!”

“By the way, many scenes in the game are very profound, did you notice?”

“Exactly! The park and square in Marcus's initial route are really clearly divided. One side is warm-toned, the other cool-toned, truly feeling like heaven and hell!”

Many players online discussed topics related to _Detroit: Become Human_.

And these discussions expanded more and more, even including some universities and social magazines.

As these topics spread, in Nebula Games' office, Chen Xu was being interviewed by a media outlet.

Media interviews were nothing surprising for Nebula Games anymore.

However, this time the interview was not with an economic or gaming media outlet.

Instead, it was a domestic media platform focused on science and society, which had considerable popularity.

Of course, it wasn't truly professional; it still had some entertainment aspects.

This was also why Chen Xu accepted the invitation.

After all, it was a first, quite novel.

Inside the office, a young female reporter held a voice recorder, interviewing Chen Xu.

“Mr. Chen, what are your thoughts on the future development of artificial intelligence? Do you envision the future to be like that in _Detroit: Become Human_?”

Hearing her words, Chen Xu smiled and shook his head: “Naturally not. In fact, many people have a misconception. Although _Detroit: Become Human_ is set in a future world, it's not a prediction of the future, but rather a reflection and exploration of modern society and the past.”

“If you think about it, the background of _Detroit: Become Human_ itself doesn't stand up to scrutiny. It's like some commercial sci-fi movies where, despite advanced alien technology, humanity ultimately defeats an alien invasion with their physical bodies and outdated weapons. This is inherently unreasonable.”

“Similarly, it's the same in _Detroit: Become Human_. Why is it that in the game's future world, androids like Luther, designed for heavy lifting, are forced to adopt human form instead of a mechanical form better suited for moving objects?”

Chen Xu said slowly with a smile to the reporter.

And listening to Chen Xu's words, the reporter sitting on the sofa looked bewildered.

The topic, it seemed, wasn't following the anticipated path!

Of course, this was also because it was her first time interacting with Chen Xu. If it had been a media outlet like Game Starry Sky or other gaming industry contacts who had close interactions with Chen Xu, they would have understood one thing immediately: Mr. Chen is pulling your leg.
