Chapter 13: Celebration

A hotpot restaurant in MixC, Modu.

Chen Xu, Ruan Ningxue, and Yang Xin were having hotpot together.

Beef, beef tripe, beef omasum, beef rolls...

How could it be called hotpot without beef?

"You're amazing, Master! The gaming circle has exploded, and players are giving it rave reviews!" Yang Xin, who had already gotten to know Chen Xu, looked at the news on her phone with excitement.

"Sister Xin, please don't call me Master. I'm not really a master right now; just call me by my name," Chen Xu waved his hand.

Though she exaggerated, Chen Xu clearly knew that the so-called sensation was more like an explosion within the niche circle of Gentleman's Game developers.

As for the entire gaming circle?

At most, it made a small splash in the Independent Game circle, and even then, it was a ripple without much impact.

Chen Xu had a very clear understanding of this.

"I feel like I shouldn't have said 50,000 sales back then," Ruan Ningxue said from beside him, a smile on her face.

Hearing this, Chen Xu put down his chopsticks and smiled at Ruan Ningxue, saying, "There's nothing to be done about that. You set the goal yourself, Senior Sister."

"Ah, I was thinking of inviting you, Chen Xu, to my company before, but it seems I was overthinking things now!" Yang Xin said, a little dejected.

"You'd better save it and not corrupt my Junior Brother. All three of your games have sold worse than the last!" Ruan Ningxue mercilessly stabbed her in the back.

"Even though my three games failed, there were reasons for it, alright? I was only responsible for the text and plot structure; other parts were outsourced, and players' feedback showed that the story text was well-received!" Yang Xin expressed her disagreement.

"Oh, right, Chen Xu, could you help me figure out what went wrong with the three games our company developed?" Yang Xin asked Chen Xu earnestly.

"Positioning and bloated systems," Chen Xu said, searching on his phone. A quick look at some online videos was enough for him to understand.

"Hmm...?" Yang Xin was a little confused.

"Simply put, Sister Xin, your games try to add a bit of everything, but what you're making are small-budget Independent Games, not AAA-level games. Even AAA-level games typically use many system settings to enrich the experience, not as the main course," Chen Xu explained to Yang Xin.

Listening to Chen Xu, Yang Xin's face showed a sudden realization, understanding a little but not entirely.

Although still a bit confused, Yang Xin felt it wasn't appropriate to keep asking at the dinner table, so she changed the subject.

"By the way, what are you planning to do next, Chen Xu?"

"Next, I plan to start my own small Game Company," Chen Xu said with a smile, as it wasn't much of a secret.

"Start your own company?" Yang Xin was a little surprised.

"Yes," Chen Xu nodded. This was already part of his plan.

Yang Xin sat for a moment, thought for a bit, then made a decision and said, "Then, Chen Xu, what do you think of me? Can I come work with you to develop games?"

For making games, she was still very passionate.

However, three consecutive failed projects had left her somewhat disheartened.

But now she understood.

Is it a problem if she can't be a Game Designer or make successful games?

No, it's not!

She just hadn't found the method for success yet. Leaning on a strong partner, that's also a secret to success!

She had thoroughly researched the game Mirror (Game) before coming.

She then came to a conclusion: the success of this game was definitely not a fluke.

And just now, listening to Chen Xu's comments on her three games, she understood a little but not completely.

But one thing she could be sure of was that this Junior Brother, whom her best friend said was making a game for the first time, definitely had the potential to become a Master artist!

Some Game Designers might develop an excellent quality game due to a momentary burst of inspiration, only to fade into obscurity later.

But there are also Game Designers who have a very clear understanding of the game they intend to develop.

Chen Xu, right before her, was clearly such a person.

The failure of three consecutive games had given Yang Xin a clear understanding of herself.

Listening to Yang Xin's words, Chen Xu, sitting in his seat, also fell into thought.

Chen Xu had briefly looked at the three games Yang Xin mentioned.

As Yang Xin said, the plot was indeed a highlight.

Most of the game's negative reviews stemmed from its gameplay mechanics, while most positive reviews were due to the story.

And this wasn't just for one game; all three games were like this.

Clearly, this was the achievement of the content planner.

If he were to make games himself in the future, he definitely couldn't rely solely on himself. He could be responsible for some of the main storylines and various plotlines of the games.

But what about the complete story arrangement?

Relying on himself alone, even with a system, would be unrealistic.

One must know that a game of the caliber of Red Dead Redemption 2 in his previous life had over 2000 pages of main story text alone, and if you counted the entire game's text, the script pages, each the size of an A4 paper, stacked up to a height of 2.4 meters.

For a game like Mirror (Game), he could be fully responsible, but for developing games with larger and more extensive text in the future, it would clearly be impossible for him to cover everything.

"Of course, no problem. Sister Xin, if you're serious, once I get the company set up, we can talk then," Chen Xu told Yang Xin.

"No problem, then I'll wait for your news, Chen Xu!" Yang Xin said.

"Alright, alright, if you two don't eat, I'm going to finish all the beef," Ruan Ningxue interjected from the side.

"I say, Ningxue, why don't you join us too? With our combined strength, we could definitely achieve great things!" Yang Xin said, smiling at Ruan Ningxue.

Ruan Ningxue picked up the Want Want Milk on the table, took a sip, and glanced at Yang Xin without replying.

"But I wonder how popular Mirror (Game) will become. Over a million sales per month?" Yang Xin speculated.

"Half of that might be hopeful; anything higher is basically impossible," Chen Xu said with a smile.

He had a pretty clear understanding of this; after all, it was an 18R Rating game, which came with significant limitations.

The group ate and drank in the restaurant. Around nine o'clock, Chen Xu dropped the two off at their respective Garden Communities, then took a taxi home.
