Chapter 75 Game Expo

"Come in."

After receiving a response, the office door was pushed open. Lin Rou, the recently recruited assistant, approached Chen Xu with a document in her hand.

"Mr. Chen, the gameplay Expo has invited us to participate in this year's event. This is the exhibition area division for the gameplay Expo." Lin Rou handed Chen Xu a venue map.

Chen Xu took the document from Lin Rou's hand and looked at it.

It was a simple schematic drawing of the venue.

From the data, the expo covered a total area of 50,000 square meters, divided into 7 exhibition zones.

Nebula Games was invited to Zone Six, which was designated as the Independent Game Exhibition Zone.

And Nebula Games would have approximately 500 square meters of booth space.

It was quite large, already considered top-tier within the independent game exhibition hall.

To be honest, Chen Xu in this Parallel World hadn't paid special attention to expos like this.

Without immediately replying to Lin Rou, Chen Xu searched online.

He quickly gained a rough understanding.

In this Parallel World, just like in his previous life, there were all sorts of expos.

However, this gameplay Expo was a little different from ordinary expos.

Namely, this expo was not purely commercial in nature.

The sponsors of this expo, besides industry giants like NetDragon and TengHua Games, included a rather special entity: the Game Department.

Simply put, this expo had a somewhat official character, with the slogan and direction being 'to promote the prosperous development of the domestic gaming industry.'

The venue for the annual expo was not fixed; this year, it had come to Modu.

It was scheduled for early May.

That left about two months until its opening.

The expo would last for 5 days.

As for why there was no prior notice, it was mainly because this expo was entirely non-commercial.

Simply put, they invited the first batch of game developers more than two months in advance.

If you wanted to participate, you signed up.

If not, other game developers would fill in.

As for what "hot news" you might reveal at the expo, whether you brought news of a new game to players, or simply showed your face to them, that was up to each game developer.

In any case, the expo stage was set for you; the rest was up to you.

"I understand now. Reply to the organizer that we will participate. Also, tell Zhang Yida to prepare a plan for this expo," Chen Xu said to Lin Rou.

"Understood, Mr. Chen," Lin Rou nodded.

After asking Lin Rou to find Zhang Yida, Chen Xu picked up the documents on his desk and reviewed the relevant exhibition zones and other details, gaining a general idea.

The exhibition area was large, offering a lot of room for maneuver.

However, there were two games Chen Xu did not plan to bring to this expo.

"Mirror (Game)", a very harmonious and lovely game, and currently the highest-rated game among Chen Xu's players, still couldn't be shown at the expo.

Additionally, Chen Xu did not plan to bring "Outlast" to the expo.

There was no way around it; the theme and background were just too gloomy.

He couldn't possibly decorate the "Outlast" exhibition area to look like an asylum, could he?

More importantly, it was broad daylight, and with so many people, it wouldn't scare the players anyway.

If it couldn't scare players, wouldn't that betray its horror game genre?

However, merely showcasing "Undertale," "To the Moon," and "Overcooked" would be a bit monotonous.

Just then, Chen Xu had been pondering what kind of games to develop next, and now he had some ideas.

Two months was too short to complete medium-sized or larger games.

However, during this period, he could make two smaller-scale games.

This would align perfectly with the direction of the Nebula Games Platform.

Time was a bit tight, but compared to before the New Year, Nebula Games' team had expanded further.

If they rushed, they could still make it.

Besides these two games, Chen Xu was also preparing to bring a surprise to players at this game expo.

With little time, Chen Xu began writing design documents once he made his decision.

Of these two games, one would have a relatively simple structure, only requiring art assets and voice acting to be completed.

The other would be slightly more complex, requiring team collaboration.

However, the workload was not huge.

Finally, he also decided to bring a surprise to players at this expo.

But given the time constraint, even a DEMO might not be possible, let alone a full game.

But Chen Xu wasn't worried.

After all, there was something called a promotional trailer; he could start by painting this delicious "big pie" for the players.

If asked, the answer would always be: "It's almost done."

………………

While he was drafting the design concept, the official staff of the game expo also contacted Chen Xu.

After all, Nebula Games needed to provide a plan for the booth layout.

Furthermore, if there was a need for performances like cosers, the expo could help arrange the contact.

Of course, contacting the relevant talent agencies himself was also fine.

Since the event itself was held in Modu, Chen Xu took some time off to visit the venue and assess the actual situation before making a decision.

After all, since he had decided to participate in this expo, he definitely wanted to do his best.

Moreover, the gameplay Expo had a very high popularity in the country, making it an excellent opportunity for exposure and promotion.

"Zones Five and Seven next to Zone Six are TengHua Games' and NetDragon's exhibition areas?"

At the expo site, many staff members were busy.

They were arranging various posters and installing relevant equipment.

"Not entirely, it's just that both companies have many games participating and many studios under their wing," the staff member accompanying Chen Xu explained with a smile.

Chen Xu nodded, indicating he understood.

Game developers of TengHua Games' and NetDragon's caliber naturally wouldn't have just one studio.

Their acquired game studios, when participating in the expo, also represented them.

"I have a good grasp of the specific situation now. I'll provide you with a detailed plan by Wednesday," Chen Xu said.

"Alright. Also, Mr. Chen, do you have any coser requirements? Do you need us to help connect and select them, or will you find a talent agency yourselves?" the staff member responded.

"Please help us connect with them through the expo; it saves some trouble," Chen Xu said after some thought.

"In that case, Mr. Chen, do you have any strict requirements for the cosers?" the staff member inquired.

After all, cosers definitely needed to match the game's character image.

For example, if a character was a loli, you couldn't possibly ask an older, mature woman to cosplay her.

"Hmm... I don't really have strict requirements. Gender is not limited, but there's one thing: they need to have a bit more stamina, not be too weak," Chen Xu pondered and said.

Listening to Chen Xu's words, the enthusiastic staff member looked completely bewildered.

Wha... what the heck!

Did he mishear?

Gender not limited, but good stamina?

Demanding girls, then asking for them to be fairer, bigger, taller—these requirements were all understandable.

But "good stamina," what on earth was that about?

Are you looking for cosers to stand at a booth, or people to help you move house?
