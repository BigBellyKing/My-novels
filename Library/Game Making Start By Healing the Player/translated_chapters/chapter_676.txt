As Song Ren's gameplay progressed, the story of Rapture and the questions that had previously puzzled him were answered.

For example, why Rapture had become this way, and what the Little Sisters and Big Daddies were.

Rapture was initially built by a wealthy tycoon named Andrew Ryan, the same person who first promoted Rapture via a submersible.

Andrew Ryan had always advocated for completely free capitalism, believing that capable individuals should enjoy the fruits of their labor.

He also believed that human morality hindered technological and social progress. Thus, Rapture's system prioritized a market economy, which blurred moral boundaries significantly.

Thanks to vast capital, Rapture quickly became an incredibly developed city, attracting countless elites and wealthy individuals to reside there.

However, this society soon revealed its drawbacks.

In Rapture, completely dominated by a market economy, all public services became privatized, and everything required payment.

Public institutions ceased to exist entirely; even calling the police required payment. If you wanted to rest on a park bench, you had to pay, and you even had to pay for every breath you took.

This was Rapture: the gap between rich and poor was endlessly widened.

A more crucial point was that once you arrived in Rapture, you could never leave.

Consequently, conflicts in Rapture began to intensify.

However, at this point, a genius female scientist named Tennen discovered a mysterious sea slug and extracted a substance called Adam from it.

Adam could rewrite human genes, and Fontaine, Rapture's gang leader, immediately recognized its potential, fully funding Tennen's research.

As a result, Rapture's biotechnology soared. After the discovery of Adam, aging, illness, and disability seemed to vanish from Rapture, changing countless human lives and temporarily easing social tensions.

But Adam was highly addictive; the more it was ingested, the more unstable cells became. The only cure was to continue consuming Adam.

At this point, those who couldn't afford Adam began to rob and kill indiscriminately, and social unrest in Rapture became increasingly severe.

Under these circumstances, the Little Sisters emerged.

Through hypnotic implantation of Adam extracted from sea slugs, Little Sisters were dispatched throughout Rapture to scavenge Adam from the dead.

This created a recycling loop: those who died from excessive Adam use would have their Adam retrieved by the Little Sisters, making the substance's cost and price cheaper, which is why players could buy it on the streets of Rapture.

To prevent the Little Sisters from being robbed or attacked while recycling Adam, Big Daddies were bred to become their bodyguards.

After grinding for a day, Song Ren finally had a preliminary understanding of Rapture.

However, despite understanding these points, he still had many doubts.

Specifically, why Elizabeth was so fixated on saving Sally.

As for the person Elizabeth was dealing with, Song Ren also understood through their conversation.

It was Fontaine, the gang leader who wanted to overthrow Andrew Ryan.

Yet, in Jack's storyline, he learned through conversation that Fontaine was already dead.

So, what about Elizabeth?

And what was the trump card that Fontaine coerced Elizabeth into retrieving at the end?

The dual-narrative structure primarily focused on Jack's perspective, with Elizabeth's as secondary.

However, it also allowed Song Ren to understand things well, and through Elizabeth's hidden storyline, Song Ren learned even more about the previous work, Infinite.

It was that Daisy, the resistance leader who had previously tried to kill Booker and Elizabeth, was actually a good person.

What she wanted was to lure Elizabeth into killing her, thereby causing a change in personality, because only this way could Comstock's fate and rule be altered.

This was the decision Daisy made in Parallel World No. 3, because she couldn't possess the ability to open spatial rifts like Elizabeth.

So Daisy chose to sacrifice herself, orchestrating a play from the source to allow Elizabeth's spirit to transform.

Next, Song Ren's game perspective returned to Jack. The 'wife and children' of Atlas, his constant guide, had all been killed by Andrew Ryan.

So, the other party wanted Jack to help him get revenge. Through an absurd circus performance, Song Ren was finally about to meet the ultimate mastermind, Andrew Ryan.

However, at this moment, Song Ren had a very ominous premonition.

Based on the final plot twist in BioShock Infinite, Song Ren was well aware that Rapture's ultimate storyline would likely surprise him just as much.

However, what Song Ren hadn't anticipated was that, despite his best efforts to imagine it, the truth still exceeded his expectations.

As Jack proceeded through a secret passage, wrench in hand, to assassinate Rapture's founder.

In a small room within the passage.

An expression of surprise appeared on Song Ren's face.

The room was plastered with pictures of Rapture's important characters.

Fontaine, Dr. Yi, Andrew, Tennen.

But the most crucial thing was that Jack was also among them. Seeing this, Song Ren suddenly felt goosebumps all over his body. Wasn't he an outsider?!

And on the wall, there was a phrase.

'would you kindly' (Would you kindly!)

What did this phrase mean?

In that instant, Song Ren thought of Atlas, who had been guiding him.

Wasn't that a phrase Atlas frequently used?

Could Atlas be Andrew Ryan, the founder of Rapture?

In an instant, Song Ren's mind was filled with mysteries.

Controlling Jack, he left the room.

Like Jack in the game, Song Ren also felt that something was amiss.

In the dark hall, Andrew Ryan's voice resounded.

In the passage ahead, which resembled a stage, Andrew Ryan stood quietly.

'The assassin has breached my final defense. Now he comes to kill me.'

'What is the difference between a man and a slave in the end?'

'Money? Power?'

'No! Man chooses, a slave obeys.'

Andrew Ryan, golf club in hand, smirked contemptuously as he watched Jack approach.

'You think you truly have memories?'

'A farm, a family, a plane, a crash?'

'Ultimately arriving at this place, but do you truly have a family? Was that plane crash an accident or a deliberate hijacking? Was it actually an existence that couldn't even be called human that force-landed the plane?'

Listening to Andrew Ryan's words in the game, both Jack in the game and Song Ren, who was playing, felt a sudden tremor in their hearts.

“No way?!”

“Could it be...”

Combining the preceding game content with Andrew Ryan's words, Song Ren already had a guess about the truth.

A desperate guess.

'This entity has lived its entire life within a dream.'

'Waiting for its kind master to awaken it with a simple command.'

'So, is the one sent to kill me a man, or a slave?'

'Man chooses, a slave obeys!'

'Would you kindly? Enter!'

As Andrew Ryan spoke, Song Ren's scalp tingled all over.

Because after that sentence was uttered, he found that Jack in the game began to move uncontrollably.

And he hadn't made any inputs at all; brainwave control, or a simple controller, was completely unable to manipulate Jack in the game.

'Would you kindly stop? Would you kindly! How marvelous that phrase is!'

'Sounds familiar, doesn't it? Would you kindly sit down, would you kindly stand up.'

'Would you kindly run, would you kindly stop, would you kindly turn around!'

'Man chooses, a slave obeys.'

'So kill me with this.'

'Man chooses, a slave obeys.'

'Would you kindly obey!'

With Andrew Ryan's words, Song Ren was completely unable to control any of Jack's movements in the game.

Just like a puppet on strings.

Whatever the other party said, Jack did.

He watched helplessly as Jack used the golf club in his hand to smash Andrew Ryan's head.

Song Ren, who had regained his freedom, merely swallowed hard.

This truth was simply too astonishing.
