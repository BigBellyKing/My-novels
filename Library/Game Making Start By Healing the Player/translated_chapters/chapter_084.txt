Chapter 84: Game Trial

Hearing Chen Xu's words, the players present immediately erupted.

After all, the content revealed in just a few short sentences was truly astonishing.

Two games would have mobile versions, available for direct download and trial during the exhibition.

Besides that, there was also a grand finale.

To be honest, most players didn't pay much attention to the grand finale.

After all, it was just empty talk, and although Nebula Games had made a few popular games,

they weren't big titles, so people couldn't get too excited.

The key point was, did this mean they could experience the games without queuing?

Suddenly, everyone noticed that the large screen at Nebula Games' booth had begun playing promotional videos of the games.

At the same time, a huge QR code was displayed on it, clearly for players to scan and download.

Players gathered in front of the Nebula Games booth at the venue all took out their phones and started scanning the QR code to download.

After all, didn't everyone come to the game exhibition to try out new games from various companies?

Now, with a game that could be directly experienced by just scanning and downloading, without having to queue, everyone naturally rushed to try it.

Among them, most male players prioritized scanning and downloading `Sanguosha`.

After all, compared to the overly Q-style cute `Fall Guys` on the other side, `Sanguosha`'s art style was clearly more appealing to them.

Moreover, the Three Kingdoms itself is a household name IP, inherently possessing a certain appeal.

As for many female players, it was the opposite; the adorable `Fall Guys` clearly interested them more.

Of course, it wasn't universally so; there were also male players with a maiden's heart who chose to play `Fall Guys` first, or female players who preferred to try `Sanguosha`.

Besides, some players still queued up specifically to experience the difference with the PC version.

At the same time, some players chose not to play on their phones, but instead played with physical cards offline.

After all, playing board games face-to-face feels more engaging.

Because they arrived relatively early, Zhang Yi and his group secured a spot in the first batch of players.

All five of them queued for `Sanguosha`, having noticed from some introductions that it was playable with five people, which was their exact group size.

`Sanguosha` could be played by five people together, which was their exact number.

As for `Fall Guys`, it could accommodate up to four people in a team, and non-team matches would scatter them, so they decided to try `Sanguosha` first.

Another point was that they had a bit of psychological trauma.

After all, they had previously experienced what Chen Xu described as "easy, pleasant, harmonious, and loving."

Although from the art style, the game indeed gave off that impression.

But Zhang Yi always had a premonition that the actual experience might be completely the opposite.

The few of them didn't choose to play with physical cards, but opted to try the PC version.

After all, it was much more convenient, and according to the staff's introduction.

With physical cards, they could only read the text rules themselves, while the digital game version had a new player tutorial mode, allowing them to better understand the game.

After a simple opening CG, they entered the game screen.

For `Sanguosha`'s opening CG, Chen Xu didn't create anything overly flashy or animated.

It was just a simple comic strip, showcasing the generals in `Sanguosha`.

After all, this was a board game.

After entering the game, the opening was an endgame battle.

The player played as the Lord, and the general was Liu Bei.

"The voice acting is great! And the visual representation isn't bad either!"

Zhang Yi exclaimed in a low voice.

He had never touched card games.

Well, if `Dou Dizhu` counted, then he had played one.

But in `Sanguosha`, some details could still be felt.

For example, when an "Attack" card successfully hit in the game, accompanied by the deduction of red hearts representing the health bar, and a dynamic feedback of blade flashes hitting the general's portrait, it all felt very impactful.

Moreover, the in-game sound effects and feedback were also very well done.

When health was deducted, the general's portrait would also be stained with blood, and when health became low, the general's portrait would even show wounds.

Clearly, the card portraits in the game were not just a single image.

Intact, injured; according to different states, there were corresponding visual representations.

And different Equipment cards also had different special effects.

This made a regular card game feel exceptionally engaging.

The game continued.

With the simple tutorial mode, players basically just followed the system prompts.

The main purpose was to let players understand the game's basic operations and related card functions.

After all, `Sanguosha`'s main gameplay revolved around its card battle rules.

If the system guidance in this area wasn't well-executed, players would find it difficult to understand where the fun of the game lay.

Similarly, the large screen in the `Sanguosha` area of the exhibition booth was also displaying Zhang Yi and his group's gameplay experience.

This allowed players waiting in line to understand the game, and everyone was whispering and discussing `Sanguosha`'s performance.

"It's a bit like `Dou Dizhu`!"

"This is much more complex than `Dou Dizhu`!"

"Yeah, and I feel like playing as the Spy is so hard; others have two people, but he's just one."

"You can't say that. Think about it, whether it's the Lord or the Rebel, whoever you help gains an advantage. Isn't that exciting?"

"What if both factions attack you?"

"Then whoever attacks me first, I'll help the other side take them out!"

"It feels like the Spy's main role is to control the field. Whether eliminating the Loyalist or the Rebel, the other player must cooperate with the Spy, or they'll lose directly."

"The Spy's victory reward should be better then."

"Exactly, one versus four!"

"Look, the Lord has an extra skill! And an extra health point!"

Although they could also download and play themselves, some players still chose not to experience it personally, but instead watched the game's performance on the large screen.

The overall rules of `Sanguosha` were not difficult to understand; this new player tutorial was simply to let players know the basic content.

For example, factions, and basic operations like "Attack", "Dodge", "Peach", Equipment cards, and attack range provided by horses.

As for more advanced operations, such as generals' skills and synergies, "Cross the River and Demolish the Bridge" and "Take a Goat in Passing," and taking away an opponent's unjudged "Indulge in Pleasure and Forget Home" and "Lightning" cards, these were placed in subsequent side tutorials.

For the exhibition experience, these contents didn't need to be released.

After the official version launched, players could obtain generals and a permanent skin as rewards by completing these side tutorials.

This could be considered the "three-pronged approach" of online multiplayer games.

Giving rewards to attract players to complete quests, letting players understand the game through quests, and receiving rewards to keep players in the game.

This routine was practically overused by mobile games in his previous life.

Things like "100 free pulls at launch", "60 free pulls at launch", "give away orange cards, gold cards at launch" — these were all basically this model.

And it even spawned an industry chain named "starter accounts."

There were specialized studios that created a bunch of accounts, relying on these free pulls, and then sold the accounts based on luck.

However, it must be said that this method was indeed very effective.

At least in the early stages of a game, it held a very strong appeal for players.
