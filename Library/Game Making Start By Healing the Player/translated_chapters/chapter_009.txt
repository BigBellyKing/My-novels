Chapter 9: Woman, Go Away, Don't Disturb My Match-3 Game (Please Recommend)

In the next story.

A young lord from the Warring States period.

Her mission and duty were to protect her family from destruction.

Once, she found a magical bronze mirror that transported her to an incredible place.

Here, there was no war, and everyone lived freely and happily. The bustling scenery dazzled her, and without realizing it, she met him: an Otaku who wasn't entirely useless.

Their first encounter was very unpleasant; the two even got into a fight.

She lost, and by the rules of her world, he was henceforth her husband.

When she was hungry, the Otaku took her out for a meal.

A pork cutlet rice bowl, which surprised her greatly: 'So much meat, that must cost a lot of money, right?'

Because in her world, commoners couldn't afford meat.

Here, she also tasted an alcoholic drink called beer for the first time.

'What is this? It's so good to drink.' She said happily, hugging the beer bottle, a little tipsy.

This was probably her most relaxed moment.

She woke up after a hangover and picked up the bronze mirror that brought her to this world.

She brought the Otaku back to her own world with her.

However, this didn't bring about much change.

In her world, everything remained as before.

The Ketsuno family was still the Ketsuno family on the verge of collapse, with dangerous enemies coveting their downfall.

The only change, perhaps, was this 'husband' who didn't seem particularly capable.

He became the captain of her personal guard, but that was all.

Even with his arrival, the Ketsuno family's demise could not be averted in the end.

Two months later, she sat on the city wall, covered in bloodstains, as the continuous warfare and blood stained the land red.

Outside the city, corpses piled up like mountains, and the cries of slaughter shook the heavens.

Those were the enemies about to breach the city.

Watching the approaching enemies outside the city, she knew that in the end, she had failed to ensure the Ketsuno family's survival in this chaotic era.

'It seems the Ketsuno family's three hundred years of glory are about to be shattered.'

The Otaku was still desperately urging her to escape, but she merely shook her head gently.

'Makoto, I am different from you. From the day Father draped the battle robe over me, I swore... to protect the Ketsuno family's honor with my life.'

The Otaku brought up a pile of examples and reasons, trying to persuade her: 'The world's general trend is that what has been divided for a long time will unite, and what has been united for a long time will divide. You are not the only Ketsuno family to be annihilated.'

'Makoto, you won't understand. Here lies the dreams and efforts of generations of our Ketsuno family. Take this bronze mirror and leave quickly.'

She confessed everything to him.

After hearing it, he insisted that she leave with him.

But she had her convictions; how could she agree?

If she had been willing to abandon those convictions, why would she have returned in the first place?

She closed her eyes, feeling that his voice was no longer around, only the sounds of the enemy about to breach the city.

'Makoto, have you left? You really... left, huh... Actually, I really wanted to go with you too.'

'I also wanted to drink beer with you again... That beer was really good... It was really good!'

Tears welled up uncontrollably in the corners of her eyes.

Memories of that time resurfaced, and a character illustration holding a beer glass appeared in the center of the screen.

'Husband, this wine is truly delicious! How about two more glasses? Look, I've drunk it all up, you should have two glasses too, come on, cheers!'

And in this daze, she seemed to vaguely hear his voice.

'KILL!!!! I am Ketsuno Anna's personal guard captain! Those who block me shall be slain without mercy!!'

Looking at the game that had returned to the main interface, Jiang Ping couldn't help but sniffle, then closed his somewhat sore eyes.

It was a while before he opened them again.

'Are you crazy?!'

'Your game is crazy! It's a Gentleman's Game, why are the character illustrations so good, the voice actors so good, and the Match-3 combat system so well done? Is it free of charge or something!?'

'I just wanted to play a Gentleman's Game, why did you make it so emotional!'

While 'complaining' verbally, Jiang Ping's hands showed no hesitation.

Of course, he wasn't pulling out tissues; he was exiting the game's main interface, then decisively entering the store to leave a positive review.

Although it wasn't yet refund time, clicking on a game review directly would make it impossible to get a refund.

But this wasn't important at all, and he wouldn't even mention the subsequent content.

Just for this, Jiang Ping felt it was worth it.

He even thought that selling it for 10 yuan, the creator was truly an idiot!

……………………

It wasn't just Jiang Ping; through an unknown overseas forum, many LSP players discovered this game and clicked on it out of curiosity.

And when they exited, everyone was filled with emotion.

Some were for the game's story.

The story of elves and demons made them ponder the good and evil of human nature.

Humans were willingly degrading themselves, while an elf from another race helped them, only to be repaid with enmity in the end.

The story of the Otaku and the female general moved them deeply.

He seemed like a useless Otaku, but when it was time to leave, he burst forth with unimaginable courage and responsibility.

The story of the Dragon Maid and the Knight was a long and wonderful journey.

Whose achievements surpassed those of ancient emperors Yao and Shun? Who could stand with me?

Because of us, evil behemoths dare not harm the four directions; because of us, greedy authorities dare not oppress the common people.

And the story of Caiyun and Mingyue made many LSPs burst into tears.

Even if you are Mingyue's reincarnation, Qingfeng is still Qingfeng.

Two hundred years of waiting, two hundred years of reincarnation; the story of Mingyue and Caiyun should have ended two hundred years ago.

It was clearly a game beloved by LSPs.

Why did it always feel so heavy and sad after playing?

These players understood what the content of those previous posts truly meant.

At this moment, they truly empathized.

Of course, there were also many eager gentlemen who, being bad at Match-3 games, were directly shut out.

'Caiyun Junior Sister, please stop sucking my blood, open the door for me! I am your Mingyue Senior Brother, let me take a look at you!'

These players repeatedly studied the game's Match-3 combat system, constantly grinding for points and money to upgrade and purchase items.

Ultimately, these players evolved.

They no longer paid any attention to the gentlemanly content in the game; instead, they became obsessed with the Match-3 game within it.

Simple and clear, yet full of fun.

For a Gentleman's Game, it was simply incredible.

It's just that the girl next to me is really annoying, blocking me from playing my Match-3 game!

'Woman, get out of here! Move aside quickly, don't disturb my Match-3 game!'

'This time, with my wisdom, I will definitely break my previous score record!'
