Chapter 549: Excited Players (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

The Nebula Games Carnival is fast approaching.

Besides Nebula Games, several domestic and international developers have also joined in the promotional efforts.

For example, NetDragon domestically; although it's the Nebula Games theme park and carnival, NetDragon also has a stake. Their 'Dance Dance Revolution' on the Switch is selling very well.

Not only did NetDragon profit, but Nebula Games also attracted many blue ocean users in this area.

Next up is 'Rainbow Six Siege'. Although the game's popularity is no longer what it was immediately after launch.

But as a relatively hardcore game, its biggest feature is player stickiness.

Players who like this type of game generally won't be lost to other games, which is why various competitions have been thriving in the past two years.

Many players online are also discussing the upcoming Nebula Games Carnival.

Some lucky foreign players, due to geographical reasons, arrived in China early and can also enjoy local tourism.

Some of these players even specifically visited the current Nebula Games office building to 'check in'.

"Damn, I'm jealous! Those who didn't win tickets can only watch the online live stream!"

"Heh heh, I'm not jealous at all. It's just a theme park, right? Won't it open to the public later anyway? As for the competitions, concerts, and direct presentations, the 8K live stream clarity is even better than being there in person!"

"Bro upstairs, can you put away your lemon? It's too sour!"

"Sigh, I really wonder what explosive news Mr. Chen will bring this time."

"Hard to say, but didn't Mr. Chen reveal some things before? Two major projects will be announced next, one of which is a Switch exclusive new title."

"Could it be a sequel to Breath of the Wild?!"

The players were discussing heatedly. Although everything would be revealed during the direct presentation, they were still impatient!

Just as players online were making all sorts of guesses, Nebula Games' official account suddenly released a piece of news.

Two exquisitely produced images.

One image showed a book, with heavy grey-white fallen leaves resting on it. The black cover page was outlined with gilded floral patterns, but the book's title was obscured by a leaf. However, a line of small text below faintly showed the words 'Fairy Tale'.

The other image was much simpler and clearer: a red cap with a large capital letter 'M' in red on a white background on its brim.

It's here!

Although there were only two simple images, all the players erupted in excitement.

Undoubtedly, this was the news Nebula Games would announce at the carnival.

Even though it was still a Riddler-like act, it revealed quite a bit.

Instantly, players were thrilled.

"Holy cow, Mr. Chen actually released a preview ahead of time!"

"That Switch exclusive game must be a Mario IP, so could it be a sequel to Odyssey?!"

"I'm more interested in the other one, is this a new IP?!"

"Haha, Mr. Chen has really changed! Is he truly going to uphold the title of Warrior of Love?"

"'Human: Fall Flat', 'Party Animals', and now a Mario sequel, plus this new IP looks like a fairy tale book. Does this imply the new game will also be like a fairy tale?"

"This reminds me of 'It Takes Two'!"

"Even though some information has been released, I'm even more excited!"

"You're definitely not alone!"

Online, players were discussing these two images.

They guessed what type the new game would be while waiting to see if any more news would follow.

And they waited for half a month.

The day before the carnival, Chen Xu, Yang Xin, and the rest of the team arrived at the venue.

Located within the Nebula Games theme park, covering an area of 168 hectares.

The outermost area of the park primarily featured all-ages themed content.

For example, Steve from 'Minecraft', various small animals from 'Overcooked', as well as Mario and Bowser from 'It Takes Two' and 'Super Mario Odyssey', and other all-ages cartoon characters. Aside from these, there were other family-friendly cartoon characters.

The attractions were also designed for parents and children to enjoy together.

In the 'Minecraft' zone, there was a track cart ride, but it wasn't a roller coaster; it was a more gentle kind. Players sat in the track carts, and with specially designed holographic projection tunnels and dedicated glasses, they could experience various scenes of different styles.

'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' from 'Minecraft', the 'Snowglobe' from 'It Takes Two', the 'Snow Kingdom' from 'Super Mario Odyssey'...

This part of the area was geared towards younger children, with most of the entertainment facilities being passive experiences, or 'watching-only' types of attractions.

After passing through this outermost layer and reaching the central area, there was even more content.

Games like 'Monster Hunter: World', 'Assassin's Creed', 'Dark Souls', and others would be showcased here.

Of course, besides this area, to provide a special experience for some specific players.

The asylum from 'Outlast' and the Baker family's farm from 'Resident Evil' were perfectly replicated. At that time, dedicated staff would play the role of pursuers to give players the most authentic experience, but this part of the scene experience was only open to adults.

Led by the staff, Chen Xu, Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, as well as Meng Zuo, Qin Yi, and other core team members, enthusiastically toured the entire park. Although they couldn't try out the attractions themselves, they were still amazed.

It wasn't until they saw the eerie asylum and the Baker family's farm that everyone fell silent.

"Mr. Chen, was it really necessary to recreate this?" Ruan Ningxue looked speechless.

"Yes, yes!" Yang Xin nodded repeatedly. It wasn't a sunny day but overcast. At this moment, with the sun hidden by dark clouds, even though it was afternoon, there was a gloomy feeling, and coupled with the gusts of wind, it was simply too 'flavorful'!

Although only a portion of the scenes was selected in terms of scale, it was certainly impossible to make it exactly like in the game, as each game's area occupied a strictly planned space. Moreover, a large empty plot outside the park was also purchased by Nebula Games, though it hadn't been planned yet. But looking at these buildings now, combined with the memories from playing the games, the feeling immediately hit them!

"How can that be? 'Outlast' and 'Resident Evil' are also important IPs under our belt. How disappointed would players be if they couldn't see these two IPs when they come? And now, when players arrive and find they can even personally role-play as Ethan, how excited will they be?" Chen Xu said with a smile.

Listening to Chen Xu's words, everyone was silent for a moment, looking at the houses in front of them, a doubt arose in their hearts.

Would players truly be excited when they saw this?
