Chapter 186: A Thousand Undead, A Thousand Dark Souls Stories (Sixth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Just like the original Dark Souls, after the release of this prequel, Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame, many players were complaining and griping online. The main complaint was primarily about bonfires not allowing teleportation.

"Ah, I'm disgusted! Why can't bonfires teleport in this game? I'm trapped in Blighttown!"

"Me too! I'm lost, I can't find my way back to Firelink Shrine at all!"

"Exactly, exactly, +1 to being lost! So why remove bonfires?!"

"Ahem, I need to clarify something here. Bonfires haven't been removed. Once you reach Anor Londo, meet the Sunlight Princess, and get the Lordvessel, you can unlock teleportation."

"I saw that strategy guide too. Gotta say, the Sunlight Princess is really... big!"

"Oh, 'big,' that has a bit of a special something to it, eh!"

"Hehe, just a little, not much at all."

"But seriously, when fighting Chaos Witch Quelaag, that cutscene was incredibly exhilarating. I almost couldn't control myself!"

"Damn! Good taste, brother. You can't control yourself even with a spider body below?!"

"You Lewd People, don't derail the conversation! Aren't we discussing the bonfire issue?"

"To be honest, I wasn't used to the lack of bonfires at first, but then I realized that the map design in Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame is absolutely brilliant, with all sorts of interconnected routes."

"+1, Firelink Shrine connects to Undead Burg, New Londo Ruins, Catacombs, and other places. It's incredibly rich!"

"Yeah, rookies can check out the maps and guides from the masters online. Even without teleportation, there are various shortcuts, so traveling isn't too difficult."

"Exactly! Don't listen to those who say playing without a guide for a 'pure' experience is the best. Dark Souls isn't a story-driven game. Your first playthrough is when your enthusiasm is highest, so look at some guides to avoid detours and don't leave any regrets for your first Firelinking journey!"

"+1, only by reading a guide did I save Solaire from going hollow!"

"Master-made maps and guides, what's the point! The masters are already wrestling with named BOSSes like Nito, the Witch, and Artorias, while I'm still suffering in Blighttown!"

As a sequel, many players already understood the nature of Dark Souls. So while there were quite a few players complaining, even more players defended it. Moreover, as they experienced it, many players discovered the ingenuity of the game's maps, and the number of praising players grew.

At the same time, on game community platforms and major live streaming platforms, Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame, this prequel title, achieved various screen-dominating feats. After all, its core identity as a hardcore, masochistic game made for quite an explosive streaming effect. Coupled with the reputation of its predecessor, even though Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame was more difficult than the previous game, its sales performance was quite good, with 2.4 million copies sold domestically and 3.1 million copies overseas in its first week. Furthermore, the related topic's popularity was absolutely explosive, far exceeding its sales figures. Chen Xu was not surprised by this. After all, Dark Souls was inherently a more hardcore game. This also meant that most players would choose to watch rather than play it themselves.

Even if the game's difficulty curve was reasonable, most players could clear it if they persevered. However, perseverance itself was a difficult thing. But for players who genuinely loved Dark Souls, especially those interested in the lore, it was a celebration. This was because Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame provided a better supplement to the Dark Souls worldview. It also answered many players' questions. Of course, due to the game's inherent characteristics, there weren't any definitive answers. Players mostly relied on the various narrative gaps in the game to fill in the blanks themselves. One could say that every player had their own Dark Souls in their mind, with different people having different interpretations.

Should one Link the Fire or extinguish it in the game? This question permeated the entire game. It was a dilemma in every player's mind. From the game's content, players could actually feel that the extinguishing of the Flame would be the ultimate end. In Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame, if a player chose to Link the Fire, they would see the First Flame like a gigantic furnace-sun. However, in the previous game, if the player chose to Link the Fire, there was only a small flicker of flame left. This showed that if the path of Linking the Fire continued, the Flame would eventually die out one day.

Similarly, many players had different views on whether Linking the Fire was a deception. Aside from simply believing it was Gwyn's deception or not, some players put forward a bold hypothesis. In the opening cinematic, four characters were introduced who acquired Lord Souls: Lord Gwyn, the Witch of Izalith, and Nito, the First of the Dead – three well-known gods – plus an unheralded dwarf. Based on speculation, this dwarf was very likely the ancestor of humanity. Gwyn and the other two acquired Lord Souls, so could it be that the kindling the dwarf obtained was the Dark Soul, which was later distributed among many humans? This was also one of the reasons why the dwarf did not participate in the war. In Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame, the introduction to Humanity states: "If the soul is the source of all life, then what is Humanity, possessed only by humans?" This hints that Humanity is the Dark Soul. So, what exactly is the power of the Dark Soul? Here, one can boldly hypothesize that the Dark Soul is inextricably linked to the Abyss.

Through the description of Dark Sorceries in the game, it's known that they are mixed with intense human emotions. Anger, sorrow, love, jealousy, greed—it is these strong emotions that enhance the originally pure soul energy. This might be the true power of the Dark Soul: intense emotion, or rather, desire. From the description of Manus's soul, one can also infer a thing or two: Manus was once an unyielding individual, but now his soul is saturated with Humanity, viscous like a Humanity polymer. It can be speculated that the power the Dark Soul bestows upon humans originates from the deeply desired power within the human heart. It is precisely for this reason that fragments of the Dark Soul are called Humanity. Both the gods and the dwarves feared the Dark Soul going out of control and giving rise to the Abyss. Thus, they used the First Flame to establish the Fire Seal, spreading the power of the First Flame throughout the world and simultaneously dispersing the Fire Seal onto every human. This cycle, like a curse, eternally binds humans bearing the Dark Soul. But the First Flame would eventually extinguish one day, so the various Lords began to seek solutions.

Gwyn, King of the Gods, was the first to Link the Fire by example, sacrificing himself to maintain the Age of Fire and the Fire Seal, precisely to suppress the rampage of the Dark Soul. The Witch attempted to create a First Flame but was consumed by Chaos, becoming the origin of demons. However, just as ancient times saw the overthrow of corrupt dynasties to establish new ones, and with the passage of time, the original dragon-slayers became dragons themselves, countless years later, the gods used the Undead to Link the Fire. Yet, their intention was not to curb the rampaging Dark Soul and the emergence of the Abyss, but merely to preserve the eternal existence of their own race.

Of course, after some players put forward these ideas, new skeptics emerged. And they could always find information to support their arguments. Souls scholars delved into various game forums, scrutinizing every word and punctuation mark in the game's lore to prove their perspective and ending were correct. As for ordinary players, they simply watched the spectacle; what kind of story was truly orthodox? A thousand Undead, a thousand stories about the Dark Souls world. What the story truly was, each player had their own understanding. Moreover, compared to the game's main storyline, it was the various characters appearing in the prequel that truly moved players and immersed them in the game.

The first character to assist the player in the game was Solaire, the Sunlight Knight. Like the player, Solaire also sought the Undead's mission; he praised and worshiped the sun, hoping to shine brightly like it. However, unlike the player, in one of the bad endings, if certain conditions weren't met, after Solaire goes hollow and is defeated, one learns that his equipment is just ordinary gear with no divine power, and the sun on it is merely painted. He advanced solely through his tenacious will. If, however, favorable conditions were met – by unlocking the shortcut to Lost Izalith early and eliminating all Sunlight Maggots beforehand – Solaire could be saved. After this, though Solaire appeared dejected and became the Crestfallen Warrior, it is eventually revealed that he rallied again, completing the Undead's mission alongside the player to finally challenge Gwyn. His gesture of praising the sun could be said to be the most dazzling presence in Lordran.

Furthermore, there was Artorias, who, to save Oolacile and the entire world from being consumed by the Abyss, formed a covenant with the Abyss's demons to gain the ability to walk freely within the Abyss, confronting it single-handedly. There was the Golden-armored knight who murdered the Fire Keeper, and the Crestfallen Warrior who, inspired by the protagonist, regained his fighting spirit but later turned Hollow in New Londo Ruins. The White Spider Maiden, Quelaag, Siegward of Catarina, Gwyndolin... It could be said that every NPC and BOSS had their own deeply moving story behind them.

This is my personal interpretation, merely an opinion~ Please forgive me~
