Chapter 279: Redefining RTS (Fifth Update, Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)

Looking at the screen, Zhang Yi, sitting in front of his computer, had only one feeling.

That was a stifled frustration.

This feeling was like having a delicious large meat bun placed right in front of you.

Its aroma wafted over, making your mouth water.

Then you picked up this still-warm large meat bun.

You took a big, hearty bite.

First, you tasted the fluffy texture of the ordinary white dough, and the juices from the meat filling inside had permeated the wrapper.

Your tongue had even touched the white dough soaked with meat broth.

But at that moment, someone suddenly took the bun away from you, not letting you eat it.

Even worse, after taking away the bun, where you were about to bite into the meat filling and the juice-soaked wrapper, he didn't hide this plump white bun.

Instead, he brought it close to your nose, letting you smell it, but just wouldn't let you eat it.

Wouldn't you say that's too much?!

It's absolutely damn outrageous!

It wasn't just Zhang Yi; all players who had experienced the Warcraft demo immediately pre-ordered and then flocked to the official Weibo account to vent their frustration and 'anger'.

A hot search trending topic named 'Death to Cliffhanger Authors' unknowingly surged to the top of the rankings.

However, although the players' reactions this time were as aggressive as they were for the Monster Hunter: World demo,

even more players were also marveling at the game's performance.

After all, the Warcraft trial version had truly left them stunned.

Every player who had tried it was discussing the game's performance in related game communities.

"It's... it's damn! Awesome! Every CG animation feels so impactful!"

"How could it not be impactful?! Now I understand why this game had a 700 million Yuan development cost!"

"As expected, the previous plot felt a bit off, and Arthas really did fall!"

"The Prince of Lordaeron has become Lordaeron's Dutiful Son, sigh..."

"Holy crap, Lordaeron's Dutiful Son!"

"I feel like Uther is just like that tattletale classmate from school."

"+1! It's like Uther is telling Arthas, 'You can't do that, or I'll tell the teacher!'"

"I wonder what kind of fate awaits Arthas later, and what exactly is the origin of Frostmourne!"

As players discussed, Warcraft's popularity soared.

Although it was only a trial version, it already offered them more than enough.

Whether in terms of graphics, gameplay, or content, Warcraft clearly brought too many surprises to players.

In terms of plot, although it was just a trial version,

it was clear that Warcraft possessed a world with a vast worldview, and the current stories only revealed the tip of the iceberg of the game's entire content.

Especially the first chapter of the trial version, The Fall of Lordaeron, fully showcased its high standards.

As for the gameplay content, although it was only a campaign mode, the basic gameplay elements were already fully demonstrated.

The innovation in unit types and hero designs within the game made it entirely appropriate to say it was redefining RTS.

For most RTS players, Warcraft delivered a profound shock.

Firstly, there was innovation in the game mechanisms, offering a more refined RTS control.

For instance, features like patrol, unit grouping, attacking, and pausing in the game were all perfectly implemented in Warcraft.

In addition, the entirely new hero concept made countless RTS players' eyes light up.

Although the performance of the multiplayer mode was still unknown, based on the current content, as long as the balance was decent, it would definitely be an excellent game.

Not to mention the vast, profound epic story and perfectly crafted quests.

Just a demo version already contained so much content.

Each of the four major races had its own story campaign: the Orc story began with Thrall, the Human story with Arthas, and the Night Elf and Undead stories were yet to be played by most players, so they weren't clear yet.

Furthermore, these campaign storylines were not separate but closely interconnected.

For example, Thrall of the Orcs led Orc warriors to rescue Hellscream, showcasing their hostile stance towards humans.

Later, in the Royal Capital of Lordaeron, the discussions among the ministers also indicated they were engaged in full-scale war with the Orcs.

And the so-called plague was linked to the Undead.

Even Arthas's fall seemed inextricably linked to the Undead Scourge.

The plot attracted some players who were not typically interested in RTS games to purchase it.

The unique, novel, and seemingly perfect RTS element designs also attracted many RTS players to purchase it.

For countless players, the one point they truly cared about was how Warcraft would perform when it launched on November 15th.

………………

At Hero Entertainment, Zhou Qi looked at the Warcraft game screen on his computer, completely bewildered.

He had considered many possibilities before this.

But this particular situation, he truly hadn't anticipated.

What he thought was just bragging turned out to be entirely true!

The hero designs in Warcraft, along with the related RTS elements, made Zhou Qi feel they were outstanding, at least in terms of gameplay elements.

If the balance adjustments could be properly handled, this would absolutely be a top-tier RTS masterpiece.

Moreover, its inherent quality completely exceeded Zhou Qi's expectations.

He had previously thought the alleged 700 million Yuan development cost was just Nebula Games bragging.

But playing the game, he knew he was wrong.

This wasn't bragging; Nebula Games was truly an honest person!

What was the point of making such exquisite modeling for an RTS game?

And these CG animations, were they free?!

You really reported 700 million in development costs because it *was* 700 million?

Having played the Warcraft trial version, Zhou Qi felt a little numb.

When it came to single-player story, let alone Human Wars, no RTS game, domestically or internationally, could compete with Nebula Games' Warcraft.

Some RPGs might not even be able to compete.

The game's gripping plot itself was remarkable, but the key was that Nebula Games was willing to invest so heavily.

So many CG animations, on one hand, introduced players to the background story.

On the other hand, they also served as invisible rewards for players clearing levels.

Which ordinary RTS game developer would dare to do this?

He had heard from the industry before that Chen Xu seemed to have drawn comics before making games.

Now it seemed he had found success in game development and was directly using games to make animated films.

Zhou Qi grumbled inwardly.

"We've lost half the battle, but not entirely. As long as the balance adjustments for Warcraft's multiplayer versus mode aren't well done, there's still a chance," Zhou Qi took a deep breath, beginning to self-hypnotize.

After all, Chen Xu was making an RTS game for the first time; it was far from certain he could manage the balance well.

Moreover, the introduction of heroes, while seemingly adding diverse gameplay to the game, was also a point that could destroy balance.

It could be a sharp blade for expanding territory, but this blade could sometimes injure oneself!
