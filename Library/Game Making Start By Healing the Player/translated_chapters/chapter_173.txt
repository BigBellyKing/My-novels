Chapter 172: There is True Love in the World, Everyone is So Good! (Seventh Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Backstage at the Nebula Games exhibition area, Chen Xu picked up a bottle of yogurt in his office, inserted a straw, and took a sip.

Then, he took out his phone from his pocket, opened the work group chat, @-mentioned the employees on duty, and instructed them to launch this simple game onto the Nebula Games Platform.

As for the game's name, Chen Xu didn't want anything too convoluted. He simply called it 'Hammer Swing Ascension', as it was very fitting for both the gameplay and the ending animation's theme.

Previously, some players online were also discussing and expressing envy that players at the exhibition could experience the new versions of *Sanguosha* and *Fall Guys*, and see the promotional trailer for *Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame* first, as Chen Xu hadn't uploaded it online yet.

But now, this mini-game, specifically made for the exhibition players to enjoy, could also be experienced by the eager players online.

There was nothing he could do; they were all dear players, and he couldn't play favorites.

Imagining the players' eager gazes, his heart... just couldn't harden.

Meanwhile, at the exhibition.

Song Ren, who had originally thought of finding some games to 'lower his blood pressure', now felt that his entire being was a bit unwell.

He had returned to the very beginning, to that same familiar high-altitude scene.

Then he fell once again, and the game's background music had changed yet again.

It was a song with catchy lyrics and a somewhat brainwashing melody.

'Go home often, see your family often...'

Listening to these very fitting lyrics, Song Ren profoundly felt the deep malice from a certain someone.

So, the 'feature' of this 30-minute game experience was to experience *this* kind of feature!?

This was clearly a heart-wrenching game that mercilessly traps players!

And it was completely different from *Dark Souls*. *Dark Souls* was the kind of torment that made you willingly concede, and had a logical reason behind its difficulty.

Because all the level designs, once you found the trick, could be easily dealt with.

But this game?

It was completely illogical; it just forced players to maintain muscle memory!

Because the force and angle of swinging the big hammer both required precision.

One careless move and he'd fall again!

Song Ren silently turned his head and glanced at the players beside him, who were at that very moment also sitting in 'water tank' game pods, playing the same game.

Behind them, a large crowd of players had gathered.

They had clearly been specifically drawn over.

At the same time, these onlookers were all laughing happily, still animatedly discussing their gaming experiences.

"Oh no, he fell again!"

"Huh, the background music changed this time! It's quite nice!"

"I prefer that one, 'See Success or Failure, Life is Bold and Free'; it feels more passionate."

"But actually, compared to the game's content, they all convey the same meaning!"

"Why isn't this guy moving anymore?"

"He probably can't take the blows anymore; this game is something else!"

Listening to the words of the onlookers behind him, Song Ren subconsciously nodded in agreement.

Yes, his fragile heart couldn't take it anymore.

This simple game even made him feel like he was experiencing *Silent Hill PT* again.

And looking at the guy who had just told him to keep a good mindset and play with a smile, now falling from the peak, he was indeed playing with screams.

It's just that the screams were a little loud.

Along with the fall, Song Ren saw that guy's face turn crimson.

'Gaia!'

The desperate shouts made it impossible to clearly hear what was being said.

"But is it that hard? It shouldn't be that difficult to control, right? Isn't it just swinging a big hammer and climbing a mountain?"

Some new players, who had just arrived and only understood the basic gameplay without knowing the specifics, were a bit confused.

After all, from outward appearances, it didn't seem that difficult.

As long as you controlled the distance well, wouldn't it be easy to complete?

With veins practically bursting on the hand gripping the inflatable big hammer, Song Ren suppressed the emotions in his heart, forced a kind and gentle smile, stood up from the 'water tank' game pod, and said to the player behind him who had claimed it was simple: "Friend, I've been playing for quite a while now, why don't you come and experience it?"

"Hey, I haven't even queued yet!" That player was stunned for a moment. He just wanted to join the fun, and while he did want to try it out, he hadn't queued yet.

Hearing his words, the surrounding players chimed in one after another: "Go ahead and play, don't worry."

"Exactly, exactly. Bro, this is probably your first time at Mr. Chen's game exhibition area, right?"

"We're all gamers, it's no big deal, you go ahead and play!"

"That's right. Bro, judging by your accent, you're not from Modu, right? It's not easy to come to a game exhibition from so far away, you go ahead and play!"

"Exactly, exactly. Brothers in front, please make way, let this brother experience the wonder of this game."

The surrounding players, one by one, were all smiling, acting very righteously.

The player felt warmth in his heart, thinking how enthusiastic the players in this exhibition area were. Feeling emotional, he said with a grateful expression: "Thank you all, I'll just play for a few minutes."

Finally, under the polite yielding of the crowd, this player couldn't resist.

"No, no need, brother, play as long as you want!"

"Yes, yes, exactly. Play until the exhibition closes, we'll just watch you play."

"Yes, yes, we just love watching other people play games."

Hearing this, the group of players behind them waved their hands repeatedly.

Similar situations also occurred with some other players who had just gathered around and didn't know what was happening.

Soon, the four 'water tank' game pods and 'hammer' operators in the experience area were replaced.

The batch of players, including Song Ren, although their experience time hadn't officially ended yet,

They all cleanly and efficiently vacated their spots, and very thoughtfully told the new players how to operate the game.

They even specifically restarted the game, allowing the new players to experience it authentically from the beginning.

This made the new players sitting in front of the computers feel very warm in their hearts.

"There is true love in the world." The players at Mr. Chen's exhibition area were indeed different from those at other exhibition areas.

With feelings of joy and gratitude, these players one after another began their 'big hammer' journey.

However, just ten minutes later, strange sounds began to emanate from this area.

Some let out a shrill scream: "Noooo!"

Some simply made sounds like elephants trumpeting: "Ah!!!!! Damn it!"

Seeing this scene, the players who had previously given up their spots, as well as the onlookers, laughed very happily.

Yes, they hadn't spoken a single lie.

They just liked watching other people play this game!

Look how much fun this is! It's much happier than playing it themselves!

Meanwhile, the continuous sounds, like pigs being slaughtered, attracted some nearby players.

This made them a bit curious.

"What the heck is going on!?"

Aren't they just playing games?

Why are they all howling like pigs being slaughtered?

Could they be playing a horror game?

Glancing at the game exhibition area, they wondered if Chen Xu had brought *Silent Hill PT* to the exhibition.

Driven by the idea of watching the fun, many players were drawn over.

Meanwhile, other game developers in the same Exhibition Hall 3 looked at the massive crowds around Nebula Games with bewildered expressions.

"What's going on, what's happening?"

They had inquired earlier, and hadn't they been told that Nebula Games didn't have any major highlights?

And there wasn't a demo for a new *Dark Souls* game either, was there?

So why were all these players running over there?
