## Chapter 685: Official Launch (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Following the surge of popularity from this Sekiro promotional video, more and more players began to notice the game.

Afterward, on the official website, Chen Xu and Nebula Games successively released some new information.

The game title and store page went live: *Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice*.

Players can use a wide variety of prosthetic tools to assist in combat, such as shuriken, axes, firecrackers, and more…

Additionally, the game's concept art was revealed, including Ashina Castle, Senpou Temple, Mibu Village, Fountainhead Palace, and other locations…

As more information was exposed, some of the game's mechanics, combined with the promotional video, became less secret, even though Mr. Chen hadn't explicitly stated them on the official website.

"Is this Mr. Chen's first action game? This looks so intense!"

"What do you mean 'first time'? Were *Monster Hunter: World*, Dark Souls, and Bloodborne just eaten?"

"*Monster Hunter* maybe, but Dark Souls and Bloodborne lean more towards exploration and RPG elements, don't they?"

"Speaking of which, does anyone else have a sense of déjà vu? I don't know if it's just me, but I feel like this game looks a bit like a Souls-like game?"

"You're overthinking it, the style looks completely different from Souls games, alright?"

"Exactly. From the promotional videos and information, *Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice* is clearly action-oriented, and the wolf in the game can jump on the spot. Can the Undead, Hunters, or Azure Star jump?"

"That makes so much sense!"

"That's how it is. Don't just assume it's a Souls-like game because you see some large monsters. And haven't you seen that the protagonist in the game can revive on the spot? This subtly lowers the difficulty. I think the gameplay should lean towards combo inputs."

"Right, right. Did you guys notice a detail? *Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice* doesn't support brainwave controllers."

"It's true!"

"But if it leans towards the combo-input experience of a fighting game, that's actually quite hardcore!"

"Indeed, pure action games are, in my opinion, actually the most hardcore."

"What's the big deal? Can't you just choose easy difficulty? Besides, for flashy moves, just watch videos of master players. Isn't it fine for us to just clear the levels with basic attacks?"

"You're right! I've pre-ordered *Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice* for the easiest difficulty anyway."

As the promotion for *Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice* gradually unfolded, the topics of discussion among players also increased.

Initially, many players indeed had doubts about the game, mainly because Mr. Chen had too many 'past offenses' (challenging games).

However, with the rational analysis of some 'big smarties' (know-it-alls), many players suddenly felt a sense of agreement: "That's right!"

The main reason for this was the unique nature of *Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice*.

If players could see the game's map design, such as the distribution of Sculptor's Idols and monsters, they would immediately understand that this game was absolutely not that simple.

But the crucial point was that only some combat content and sword clash-style fighting demonstrations were disclosed publicly.

This created a peculiar illusion for players: that this might be a pure action game.

Coupled with the fueling of many 'big smarties,' this led players to believe that *Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice* might be hardcore on high difficulty, but on low difficulty, it should be a hack-and-slash game.

While waiting for *Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice*, many players were both excited and looking for a similar game.

However, they all returned empty-handed. There really wasn't a game on the market that captured the 'clashing blades' feel demonstrated in the *Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice* promotional video.

But the interesting thing was that players who came back empty-handed ended up making some war-themed hack-and-slash games temporarily popular.

After all, if they couldn't 'clash blades,' they might as well go for some 'hack-and-slash' experience.

Many players felt that *Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice* was just a pure action game.

And for action games, high difficulty is hardcore, so isn't low difficulty just hack-and-slash?

So, on low difficulty, Sekiro must also be a game with intense sword clashes, parrying, and stylishly slaughtering monsters—no problem!

Innumerable players held this thought until the game's official release.

………………

"Old Song, it's time, it's time." Inside Nebula World, Zhang Yi quickly called Old Song through voice chat to remind him, seeing the time for *Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice*'s unlock approaching.

"You don't need to tell me, I've been waiting! But tell me, why is *Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice* so different from previous games, not supporting brainwave controllers this time?" Song Ren was a little puzzled.

When *Detroit: Become Human* first launched, he wasn't very accustomed to this new control device. But now, with many major game developers supporting brainwave control, he found it quite convenient and comfortable to use in conjunction with traditional controllers.

So, this time, *Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice* not supporting it struck him as very strange.

Clearly, this was intentional on Nebula Games' part, as Nebula Games, being the first in the industry to support this control mode, didn't have technical issues.

"Why ask? Didn't some expert on the internet analyze it before? Sekiro will be an action game, and for action games like that, it's difficult to pull off high-level moves using brainwave control." Zhang Yi didn't overthink it.

In fact, this was the main reason many players believed *Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice* would be an action game.

Because action games involve combo inputs and chains, and unlike traditional games, the level of detail in action games often has to be precise down to the frame as a unit of time, making them more suitable for traditional controllers.

"But I don't think it has much to do with us," Song Ren said, very self-aware.

"We're definitely starting on the lowest difficulty!" Zhang Yi responded cheerfully.

Challenge?

How can challenging be as satisfying as hack-and-slash?

First playthrough, hack and slash to experience the story, then in the second playthrough, explore different strategies for advanced challenges.

If it's too difficult, he'll just watch videos and achieve the accomplishments cerebrally.

Even if his hands couldn't perform elegant moves, couldn't his mind still conjure up spectacular ones?

Zhang Yi had it all planned out.

The two chatted happily for a bit, and soon the game unlocked.

First, the Nebula Games LOGO appeared.

*Rustle…*

Next, a sound of wind filled their ears.

The game screen gradually appeared, and at the same time, a husky male voice echoed from beside them.
