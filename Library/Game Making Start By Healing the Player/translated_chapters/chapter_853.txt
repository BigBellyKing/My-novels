Chapter 852: The First Score

During the preparation stage before entering the game, Song Ren turned off the AI auto-fill. What's the point of bringing AI?

Wouldn't bringing AI just be a hindrance? As for the difficulty setting, currently only the simplest contract difficulty was available.

In the game, the highest difficulty level has a total of six skulls. At high difficulty, not only do enemies shoot more accurately and deal more damage, but the attack timing and number of enemies also increase.

Of course, at high difficulty, players also receive double the experience and rewards.

"Old Zhang, how should we approach our First Score?" Song Ren handed the decision-making power to Zhang Yi.

"I think for our first run, it's better to go with a smart approach," Zhang Yi said after some thought.

Through various promotional materials for the game and the recent new player tutorial, the group had a pretty good idea of how 'Payday' worked.

Before the game started, the crew would begin a scouting phase. If there was an inside man, they would receive all sorts of intelligence about the heist location, and special tools would be placed in areas like the parking lot.

However, despite this scouting and tactical planning process, players could also opt for a brute-force robber style. Put on a mask, kick down the door with a gun, and just go for it.

But such a reckless robbery would have severe consequences. Nearby NPC civilians would call the police, reinforcements would arrive very quickly, and if players stalled without achieving their objective, the difficulty would escalate.

The first responders were usually regular police officers, followed by SWAT, and eventually, highly trained military personnel.

So, if they wanted to be master thieves who finished the job, took their leave, and hid their achievements, a direct, reckless approach was clearly not feasible.

"Exactly, let's go for a smart approach. Even if we're robbers, we can be like Robin Hood. Plus, rushing in recklessly could easily injure civilians. Even as thugs, we have our principles," Wang Han echoed, agreeing.

"Well said!"

Zhang Yi and Song Ren nodded in agreement. As they chatted, the contract officially began.

Their three spawn points were in a small alley. However, contrary to expectations, all three were dressed in suits and ties, looking like ordinary citizens.

"So, we're in the scouting phase now, no time limit."

Looking at the introductions, Zhang Yi roughly understood. The mission was called 'Four Stores'. As the name suggested, there were four shops on this street: a convenience store, a coffee shop, a computer store, and an antique shop.

Their crew's objective was to plunder all four stores, grab a certain amount of cash, and then slip away.

It was a very straightforward mission, one might say.

In the alley, Zhang Yi, acting as the overall commander for this operation, confirmed the robbery strategy.

"This being our first time 'getting supplies', we must adhere to three principles: fast, accurate, ruthless!"

"So, each of us will scout one store. Sirang, you're in charge of the antique shop. Dabiao, you take the computer store. I'll scout the convenience store and the coffee shop."

Zhang Yi spoke with great immersion.

"No problem."

"Alright, alright."

Both nodded repeatedly.

"OK, stay alert, don't expose your identities," Zhang Yi cautioned, and the three began to act.

The three were deeply engrossed in the game. It must be said that although this game wasn't a large-scale production and couldn't compare to so-called blockbusters,

Chen Xu had done an excellent job with the graphics and details.

Combined with the VR version and unique theme, the sense of immersion was truly overwhelming.

For instance, in the pre-game scouting mode, players could get a clear picture of the building's internal structure, employee locations, and whether there were cameras or one-touch alarms, allowing them to better plan their heist.

Of course, any unusual behavior, such as being caught in an unauthorized office or constantly circling a security guard, would trigger an alarm.

'Hey, hey, I've got a clear picture of the antique shop. There are two armed guards inside, and I also found a large safe.'

Soon, Song Ren's report came through.

'My computer store also has a guard. No safe found yet, probably in the office. The moment I tried to go in, the suspicion level of the nearby guard and clerk rose.'

Wang Han also reported. Meanwhile, Zhang Yi had finished scouting the convenience store and was heading to the coffee shop.

'The convenience store here has no security besides the cashier and customers. But there's an ATM. From its appearance, it looks like a four-cash box machine. A full cash box holds 200,000 Yuan, so four would be 800,000. Although it's unlikely to be completely full, I estimate at least 100,000 to 200,000 Yuan.' Zhang Yi explained his findings.

During the time he was anticipating 'Payday', he had watched many movies and TV shows of similar themes, and quite a few legal programs too. His professional knowledge was solid. Before, how would he have distinguished a four-cash box ATM?

"Let's do it! Just open the ATM! That'll be enough for this score!" Song Ren sounded excited in the voice channel.

"Ahem... but this ATM probably needs a cutting machine. Did any of you bring one? I certainly didn't," Zhang Yi added, clearing his throat.

"What the heck are you talking about? You have to buy a cutting machine!" Wang Han couldn't help but complain. She had actually thought they could rob the ATM.

"How about the antique shop then? Isn't there an electric drill? I saw a prompt for an electric drill on this safe; we can drill it open directly," Song Ren suggested.

"OK, then we'll see if there's a back door, sneak in quietly, knock out the two guards, then Wang Han, you take control of the civilian hostages. Let's make our First Score a clean one, striving for..." Zhang Yi was still discussing tactics.

But the next second, an incredibly exhilarating and frantic electronic music suddenly blared in his ears. At the same time, he involuntarily pulled out his mask and gun from his怀 (chest) in the game.

Sharp screams came from outside the street, accompanied by two gunshots.

Above, a line of yellow text appeared:

///POLICE ASSAULT IN PROGRESS///

Zhang Yi was stunned.

"Holy cow! What's going on?! I haven't even finished the tactics!"

At this moment, Song Ren's slightly embarrassed and unconfident voice came through: "My bad... I thought about putting on my mask at the shop entrance, but I didn't notice the civilians and cameras and got spotted directly. But it's no big deal, the antique shop is already under my control."

"I think we should stop trying to be smart robbers. Stealth my ass! Let's just go head-on!" Zhang Yi smacked his lips, somewhat helplessly, then pulled out his gun.

Ten minutes of tactical planning, and they were exposed before they even officially started. Stealth, my ass!

"This is a robbery! Everyone get down!" Holding his gun, Zhang Yi fired a few shots into the air and shouted.

The next second, people on the street let out sharp screams, but under Zhang Yi's gunfire, they quickly silenced themselves.

A group of people immediately trembled, clasped their hands over their heads, and lay on the ground.

However, some hostages further away were scared and turned to run. Simultaneously, sharp alarms blared in their ears, and the once peaceful street instantly turned into a dangerous crime scene.

"Not a single one of you move! Don't think about playing the hero! Anyone who dares to move now, I'll make sure they can never move again!"

Seeing two unruly hostages, Zhang Yi directly fired a burst of bullets at the nearby floor, speaking the robber's lines with great immersion. After seeing the hostages cower like startled quails, Zhang Yi was satisfied and walked towards the convenience store behind him.

"Squat in that corner over there, hands on your head, don't move! Haven't you seen a robbery before?" Looking at the terrified cashier, Zhang Yi pointed to the convenience store's corner, then roughly smashed open the cash register with the gun's buttstock, pulling out colorful banknotes and coins and stuffing them into his backpack.
