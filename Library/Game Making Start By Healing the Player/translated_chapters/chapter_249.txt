Chapter 248: This Game is So Easy! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

After passing through a forest path, Zhang Yi couldn't help but sigh with emotion.

In the distance, there was a beach, and the lush Ancient Forest. On the beach, there were also many Aptonoth.

These Aptonoth gathered in small groups, each with a long, hammer-like tail.

Ignoring the Squad Leader who was waving at him ahead, Zhang Yi ran directly towards an Aptonoth drinking water in the distance.

“I'll start by getting some practice with you!”

Looking at the Aptonoth before him, Zhang Yi was still a little excited.

After all, this was his first real hunt; all his previous moves were practiced on wooden dummies.

As Zhang Yi approached, the Aptonoth drinking water in front of him seemed unaware of the impending danger.

And through previous introductions to Monster Hunter: World, Zhang Yi also knew that these Aptonoth would not actively attack; they were docile creatures.

Clearly, the purpose of these creatures was for players to practice.

Looking at the Aptonoth in front of him, Zhang Yi swung his Great Sword down, then charged it. As a damage number flew out, the Aptonoth let out a cry of pain, counterattacked with its tail hammer, and tried to flee.

The other Aptonoth not far away immediately fled in terror.

Although hit by the Aptonoth's tail, the Great Sword's charged attack hyper armor kept the hunter from flinching, and the damage was negligible.

Next, with a second strong charged swing, the Aptonoth let out another wail and was immediately defeated.

“Indeed, the Great Sword is truly divine! I haven't even tried hard, and you're already down!”

Zhang Yi was filled with excitement and exhilaration.

The Aptonoth in front of him, judging by its size, was as stout as two oxen.

But he never expected it to be so fragile; the Great Sword's damage was simply explosive!

Even though he knew this monster was meant for players to test their weapons on, the kind that won't fight back or talk back when insulted.

But Zhang Yi still felt a rush of excitement.

Especially the Great Sword in his hand; its damage far exceeded his expectations.

After two or three swings, the Aptonoth in front of him was down.

With every swing, the in-game sound effects and action feedback felt as if the Great Sword had truly cut into a slab of meat.

It was incredibly satisfying.

As for wounds, Monster Hunter: World didn't display much gore.

Although it was a hunting game, having players hack monsters to bloody bits and then dismember them would be too much.

Therefore, there were appropriate wounds during the hunt, primarily to enhance player immersion.

But it didn't pursue so-called realism.

Additionally, the game had a damage system where players could see the damage they inflicted.

This system was enabled by default, but it could be turned off to enhance immersion.

It was enabled by default primarily to help players become more familiar with the game.

Because in Monster Hunter: World, there were Hitzones and weaknesses in different body parts.

With damage indicators, players could better distinguish these differences.

Of course, for most hunter players currently, this was completely useless.

After all, what good was it to tell players about weaknesses?

They might not even be able to hit them.

They'd still be 'foot massage masters' and 'back scrubbers'.

Which veteran hunter didn't evolve from being a 'foot massage master' and 'back scrubber'?

As for Hitzones? Weaknesses?

Completely clueless!

One word: Just go for it first!

After a brief moment of excitement, Zhang Yi sheathed his Great Sword to collect his spoils.

At the same time, he took out his Whetstone and sharpened his Great Sword, restoring its Sharpness.

Although he had defeated the first monster of his hunting career.

But after the brief excitement, Zhang Yi's mood quickly returned to normal.

After all, he knew very well that the Aptonoth was specifically for players to practice on.

There was virtually no chance of failing to defeat it.

In such a situation, there was naturally no sense of accomplishment.

It was like defeating Gundyr the Ash BOSS at the beginning of Dark Souls; that sense of accomplishment was off the charts, primarily because he knew that BOSS was a huge challenge for him at the time.

And he had painstakingly honed his skills through countless hardships to defeat that BOSS.

Or in some RPGs, where players painstakingly grind levels and craft equipment to clear BOSSes due to insufficient level attributes, it also brings a sense of joy and accomplishment.

But now, having defeated an Aptonoth that wouldn't fight back or talk back, and was only slightly stronger than a training dummy, if that could bring a sense of accomplishment, then nobody could be blamed.

So now, Zhang Yi mostly just felt that he hadn't chosen the wrong weapon.

This Great Sword was simply too powerful.

Charged attack hyper armor, explosive damage.

Truly worthy of being the main hunter's weapon in the promotional video.

Like the three Longsword Heroes at the end of the previous promotional video, they clearly belonged to the minor character level of hunters.

“It's just that this Aptonoth is really too fragile!”

Carrying his Great Sword, he didn't immediately follow the green Scoutflies to find the Squad Leader to complete the main quest, as fifty minutes still seemed ample.

With the Great Sword on his back, Zhang Yi found and eliminated two more Aptonoth one by one.

At the same time, he wandered around the outskirts of the Ancient Forest, and he discovered some very interesting things.

That is, on the game's large map, there were many interactive elements.

Various fruits and food items could be gathered, and even insects and animals on the ground could be captured.

Just now, he used the net on him to catch a grey Detour Rabbit.

After wandering for a long time, Zhang Yi finally followed the green Scoutflies through a small path and reached the quest location: Jagras's Den.

As soon as he peeked out, Zhang Yi saw a group of Small Jagras, with some larger ones nearby.

“So many!”

Seeing a pile of Jagras in front of him, Zhang Yi instinctively felt a little panic.

This was all a lingering effect from playing Dark Souls.

You know, the scariest thing in Dark Souls wasn't seeing a BOSS, but seeing a group of mobs.

However, once Zhang Yi actually started fighting, he realized he had completely overthought it.

“My health bar isn't Photoshopped anymore! It's so sturdy!”

Accustomed to the easily shattered health bar in Dark Souls, Zhang Yi instantly became excited seeing only a tiny bit of his health bar drop after these Small Jagras attacked him in Monster Hunter: World.

What did this mean? It meant that Monster Hunter: World was indeed not a high-difficulty game like Dark Souls!

Next, the feedback Zhang Yi got from striking the Jagras with his Great Sword further proved this point.

With a charged swing, the Jagras was immediately knocked down. He followed up with two more hits and successfully took one down.

Monsters barely hurt him, but he could defeat them in two or three hits; he had practically turned into a BOSS!

Moreover, inside the cave, there were some firefly-like entities that, when interacted with, acted like Flashfly, temporarily blinding the Jagras.

At this point, the Great Sword could be mindlessly charged, taking down enemies 'one hit, one kid'.

And his Palico companion even helped him; invincible!

He had never felt so exhilarated.

This game is so easy!

It's actually a Hack-and-Slash Game!
