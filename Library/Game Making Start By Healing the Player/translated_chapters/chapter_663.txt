Chapter 662: Filled with Doubt (Please subscribe for monthly passes)

Regarding the baptism ceremony, Zhang Yi wasn't entirely clueless.

Generally, there are two types of baptisms: aspersion and immersion. The former involves sprinkling water on the hands and making the sign of the cross on the forehead, while the latter involves full immersion in a pool.

But what the heck kind of baptism ceremony involves holding someone's head underwater?

'Gurgle, gurgle'

The sound of splashing water and rising bubbles filled his vision and ears, leaving Zhang Yi instantly speechless.

What the heck could *this* be called baptism?

And it wasn't just once; he was submerged three times in a row.

The last time he was plunged into the water, the splashes before Zhang Yi's eyes gradually vanished, and his vision darkened.

“What's going on? Did this baptism drown me? Is it a plot kill, or am I supposed to resist here?”

Looking at the game's perspective, which had plunged into darkness, Zhang Yi was utterly bewildered.

He couldn't quite figure out what was happening.

However, soon enough, the corresponding game scene appeared.

Inside a room, on the table lay a pistol, some bullets, and countless wine bottles and cigarette butts.

‘Bring us the girl, and your debt is cleared.’

‘What do you want to do?’

‘We had a deal, DeWitt! Open the door, now!’

‘I told you… I won't do it!’

The dialogue between Booker and a man reached his ears.

So, this was Booker's past memory?

Booker, burdened by debt, took on this mission to kidnap Elizabeth?

Watching the plot unfold, Zhang Yi was a little confused.

Pushing open the door in the game, he saw a city engulfed in war. But before he could make out more details, his vision went black.

The camera returned to Columbia, the Sky City.

At this point, Zhang Yi was completely baffled.

He even felt more confused than when playing Souls series games.

After all, in Souls series games, even if you don't understand what's happening, you can just slash with your sword and be done with it.

But BioShock Infinite, so far, was still in a narrative phase, and it didn't seem like the kind of game where you just 'bang bang bang' your way through.

However, just from the opening content, Zhang Yi felt it was a bit too complex.

If that was Booker's past memory, then what was the deal with seeing a destroyed city after pushing open the door?

An illusion? Or was it the past, or the future?

Many questions arose in Zhang Yi's mind.

However, this doubt was quickly replaced by everything he saw before him.

Because having undergone the baptism, he could now move freely.

‘Those idiot priests should learn the difference between baptism and drowning someone!’

As Booker woke up and appropriately grumbled in New Eden, Zhang Yi also carefully observed his surroundings.

Unlike before, viewing Columbia, the Sky City, from a cramped flight cabin.

Now, immersed within this city, Zhang Yi could only describe it with two words: dreamlike.

A fantastical world.

Just like a world out of a fairy tale.

The city in the game had a very distinct steampunk aesthetic.

Giant gear mechanisms, where advancement and antiquity coexisted.

There were cars as well as carriages, magic alongside firearms, and prominently, airships representing the steampunk theme.

The opening content didn't immediately throw him into gameplay; it merely allowed players to admire this steampunk-styled city.

Similarly, Zhang Yi wasn't in a hurry to head to the objective on the mini-map to advance the game's main story.

Instead, he spent his time appreciating the scenery of Columbia, the Sky City, along the way.

But soon, Zhang Yi noticed something different: unlike reality.

Though this city boasted technology far surpassing that on the ground.

It was a fanatically religious city, yet what was eerie was that the beings these devotees worshipped in the game weren't deities like Jesus.

Instead, historical figures like 'Franklin,' 'Washington,' and 'Jefferson' were regarded as gods.

Meanwhile, according to some simple books and newspapers, Lincoln, also a leader, had become a demon and apostate.

Eerie, that was Zhang Yi's feeling.

Posters of all kinds adorned the streets and alleys, warning citizens to be wary of the false shepherd's arrival, lest he lead the lambs astray.

The entire game wasn't a completely open world, but there was plenty of content to explore.

For example, within the city, one could experience various interesting mini-games.

Shooting, testing strength, and even enjoying stage plays and movies.

“But is the final BOSS really so straightforward?”

Zhang Yi wandered through Columbia, the Sky City, making guesses.

From the current situation, Zhang Yi felt it was highly probable that Comstock, the one called the Prophet, was the final BOSS.

The entire Sky City was exceptionally prosperous, and currently, the city was celebrating Ascension Day, which was their national day.

Although Booker in the game probably wasn't in the mood for fun, Zhang Yi was having a great time here.

He eventually passed through a large archway, and beneath the reviewing stand with a colossal mentor statue, he was stopped by a newsboy.

‘Sir, your telegram!’

Zhang Yi, controlling Booker, took a card from the newsboy. Turning it over, he saw a message written on it.

【Stop, DeWitt! Don't let Comstock know you're here. Stop, whatever you're doing, don't choose number 77. Stop…】

What does this mean?

Just like Booker in the game, Zhang Yi was utterly bewildered.

What was the meaning of this abrupt, nonsensical message?

He repeatedly flipped the card over, finding nothing special about it apart from the message.

But did 'number 77' have some hidden meaning? He stored this information, but soon Zhang Yi was drawn in by the city's various entertainment activities.

The shooting mini-game resembled a circus act, and he also paid a vendor to learn a supernatural ability to control machines.

“So, in this world, magic is just out in the open, and you can learn it just by paying? Alright, that's very capitalist!”

Zhang Yi couldn't help but gasp.

This magic was just like firearms; you could buy it if you had money.

Wandering through the Sky City with a mix of emotion and joy, Zhang Yi completely forgot about the 'find the girl' mission.

Until he participated in a lottery.

After talking to an NPC, he received a numbered ball.

Number 77, that was the number written on it.

The moment he saw the ball, Zhang Yi recalled the content of an anonymous letter a newsboy had given him earlier.

Was there a connection between these two?

Without waiting for Zhang Yi to figure it out, the lottery ceremony began.

And, coincidentally, the winning number was 77.

However, the prize for the winner was quite astonishing.

Because the so-called lottery wasn't about winning a good prize, but a choice.

On stage appeared a black and white couple, newly married.

They had committed a crime: the crime of interracial marriage.

The lottery was for the person who picked the winning number to choose: one lives, one dies.

The winning number was the 77 ball that Booker had drawn.

Here, players could make two choices: throw the ball at the host's head, or make the selection.

But no matter the choice, there was only one outcome.

Zhang Yi, without hesitation, chose to throw the ball. But just as he raised his hand.

The guards seized his arm.

Because they saw the letters 'AD' on Booker's hand, which was the information the Prophet spoke of regarding the false shepherd.

The subsequent plot development utterly astounded Zhang Yi.
