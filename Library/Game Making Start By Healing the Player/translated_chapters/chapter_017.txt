Chapter 17 Isn't It Normal for Young People to Be Spirited?

"This is outrageous! How can there be such a person!" Ruan Ningxue exclaimed, looking quite angry.

It was important to remember that *Mirror* had her participation too.

"This person is cunning; he just wants attention, whether it's criticism or support," Yang Xin said, comforting Ruan Ningxue.

"Exactly, people like this are not uncommon; you find them in every industry," Chen Xu said with a smile.

"So, Chen Xu, are we just going to pretend we don't know?" Ruan Ningxue felt a bit wronged.

If they didn't fight back, others would just walk all over them. But if they did, wouldn't it be playing right into the other person's hands?

"Of course not, he wants to pick a fight, doesn't he? Let's give him what he wants!" Chen Xu chuckled, then opened his official Weibo account and sent a message.

'To certain self-proclaimed veterans: games are art, but they are also commercial products, just like films have art-house movies and commercial blockbusters. *Mirror* has never claimed to be art.'

'Of course, some veterans who claim their works are art must have been attacked by young people who lack "wude" (martial ethics), because for a work that can truly be called art, its ratings are quite indefensible!'

After sending the official Weibo message, Chen Xu also updated the store description for *Mirror*.

This was mainly because his official Weibo account had too few followers.

There were only a little over a thousand, and most of them had followed him previously through his comics.

After all, while *Mirror*'s sales were decent, most Gentleman's Gamers wouldn't pay much attention to its game producer.

Seeing the official Weibo post Chen Xu had sent, Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue were stunned.

"Chen Xu, didn't you say the other party was doing this on purpose? Isn't this exactly what they wanted?" Ruan Ningxue asked, puzzled.

"Someone's already being provocative; if I don't respond, wouldn't that make me too cowardly?" Chen Xu shrugged, a smile on his face.

Yang Xin, on the other hand, had her eyes light up: "*Undertale* isn't a very large game in scope. If we work some overtime these days, we can definitely get the asset production on schedule!"

Chen Xu nodded, "Exactly. Before, I was wondering how to promote it, but now... this free traffic is too good to pass up."

"However, everyone will have to work hard these next few days," Chen Xu said.

It was just like in the business world: when the top two fight, it's often the third one who gets wiped out.

The gaming industry was much the same.

The most terrifying thing wasn't being criticized, but being ignored.

As for the quality of *Undertale*, Chen Xu was quite confident.

……………………

As Chen Xu and his two colleagues entered "overtime maniac" mode,

the buzz around Chen Xu's official Weibo post slowly began to grow.

Although Chen Xu's official Weibo account didn't have many followers,

there were still a great many players active in *Mirror* during this period, and they were redirected to the post.

Furthermore, Zhong Mei had already been targeting *Mirror*, so many people were quietly watching to see how *Mirror* and Chen Xu would react.

Unexpectedly, they really did catch something.

At first, many people regarded Zhong Mei's official Weibo post as a joke.

After all, it wasn't the first time he had done something like this.

But with Chen Xu's official Weibo post following right after, the nature of the situation completely changed.

Anyone could see that Chen Xu was implicitly referring to Zhong Mei.

A single clap makes no sound; Chen Xu's response instantly drew in countless 'melon-eating' onlookers.

Various media outlets reported on the incident, and many 'melon-eating' players also joined in.

Sparking widespread discussion.

'Holy crap, what's going on?'

'They're fighting, they're fighting!'

'So Chen Xu is the creator of *Mirror*!'

'Bro upstairs, does this designer named Chen Xu have some kind of background?'

'No, why?'

'If not, then what are you exclaiming about?'

'Haha, Chen Xu's words are really cutting deep.'

'Spot on, Zhong 'Big Cannon' has indeed made two decent games, but they're far from being works of art.'

'I support Chen Xu! What's wrong with liking Gentleman's Games? Bring on the sequel and new DLC characters, GKD!'

'I actually think Zhong 'Big Cannon' is right this time; Gentleman's Games truly aren't respectable.'

'Bah! It's easy to talk tough after putting on your pants! Wasn't Zhong 'Big Cannon' the one who started provoking first?'

With Chen Xu's response, the buzz around the incident immediately soared, attracting attention from a large number of players.

Among them were many players who supported Chen Xu, as Zhong Mei's reputation, both in the gaming industry and among players, was not very good.

However, there were also some who couldn't stand Chen Xu and sided with Zhong Mei, given that *Mirror*'s game genre was indeed prone to controversy.

But one thing was certain: Chen Xu and Zhong Mei instantly became the focus of attention for many media outlets and players.

To say the entire gaming world was a bit of an exaggeration, but with various media outlets vying to report on it, most players who followed the independent game scene recently were basically aware of the incident.

Chen Xu's official Weibo account also gained over a hundred thousand followers overnight.

………………

At the same time, in the offices of Hapai Culture & Sports, Zhong Mei also learned of the news through his assistant's reminder.

However, he wasn't angry; instead, his face was filled with excitement.

"Excellent! We should indeed seek out young designers who are just starting out but have a bit of fame. This is what being young is all about! Spirited! If you're not spirited, can you still be called young?" Zhong Mei exclaimed, his face beaming with joy.

What was that online interview for before?

Wasn't it for buzz?!

Look now, hasn't the buzz arrived?

How long has it been since someone proactively stepped forward to cooperate?

Having someone cooperate and having no one cooperate are two different concepts!

Look at how enthusiastic the media reporting is now. Before, to stir up this topic, he had specifically bought some traffic.

But it hadn't caused much of a stir. And now?

With a response, he didn't even have to lift a finger; the traffic came automatically!

But he still needed to add more fuel to make the buzz even stronger!

With a smile, Zhong Mei opened his official Weibo and posted a message: "Some game designers are very adept at quoting out of context. I have never said my own games are art; I am merely someone who hopes to develop a game that can be called art."

"But judging by the games some designers develop, they may never understand in their lifetime how to create a true game, rather than relying on some cleverness... or rather, petty cleverness."

After the official Weibo message was sent, Zhong Mei even specifically @mentioned Chen Xu.

However, to Zhong Mei's surprise, the other party replied incredibly quickly; in about five minutes, he was @mentioned by them.

'That's what I should be saying too. The new game, *Undertale*, will officially launch on July 15th. Perhaps some designers can take a look and see if a game like this can be considered a true game, and if it possesses any artistic merit.'

Zhong Mei's smile suddenly froze on his face.

This move, it felt so familiar!

Thanks to 'Dimension within me' for the 500 tip.
