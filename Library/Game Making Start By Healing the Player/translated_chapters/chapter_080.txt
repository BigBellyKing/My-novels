Chapter 80: Time for Something Different

As time progressed, the two projects advanced very quickly.

The new employees who joined later finally understood why Qin Yi, Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, and others held Chen Xu in such high regard.

The daily work routine was as smooth as silk; everything was handled in one go, without the slightest dryness or obstruction.

It was as if the path forward was coated with lubricant; one simply had to run straight ahead, then slide into a sprint to reach the destination of happiness.

The entire team, despite having mutual creative discussions, had no arguments.

This was because the core of the entire game was already established.

Everyone simply needed to try different things to achieve this goal.

In such circumstances, even overtime felt like happy overtime.

One should know that the overtime pay Chen Xu offered at Nebula Games was truly high, and all sorts of benefits were maximized.

Among them, the improvements to Sanguosha were more focused on gameplay experience than on rules.

Of course, besides the rules, Sanguosha actually had some extremely excellent aspects.

Those were the in-game dialogue and voice acting.

It could be said that this added a lot of charm to Sanguosha.

It could be considered among the very best.

Many of the classic lines left a deep impression on players.

Some players who hadn't played Sanguosha might not know the origin of these lines.

But they might have heard them.

For instance, Zilong's 'To advance and retreat is truly a divine weapon', Zhuge Liang's 'Knowing heaven is easy, defying it is difficult', and Guan Yu's 'I see you marking yourself for death'.

As for the gameplay mode, it was tentatively set as a standard 5-player match, meaning one Lord, two Rebels, one Loyalist, and one Spy.

Other modes, like the National War Mode, would definitely be saved for later gradual updates.

After all, a game really isn't suitable if its content is too rich from the start.

Because players need a certain amount of onboarding time and a learning curve.

Even the Zelda series, hailed as the world's best in his previous life, from the first 3D installment, Ocarina of Time, to Skyward Sword, Twilight Princess, and then the famous Breath of the Wild.

The content at each step was incredibly rich, yet it gradually introduced players to the various systems and content settings.

Therefore, for a game, trying to cover all bases or immediately presenting a large amount of content to players can sometimes prevent them from appreciating how rich your game's content truly is.

All they feel is discouraged, because it's too damn complicated! Why do I have to study so many system settings just to play a game, as if I'm preparing for a postgraduate exam?

As for the other game, Fall Guys, it was handled similarly to the previous Overcooked.

Apart from enhancing the player experience, the biggest key was the game's content updates.

It would also support compatibility with the 'Workshop', allowing players to create their own maps.

In his previous life, Fall Guys went from being a huge hit to becoming unpopular, and many players thought it was due to cheats.

That was indeed a factor, but definitely not the main one.

Because if cheats caused a game to become unpopular, there's actually a very noticeable pattern to it.

That is, players exhibit a gradual decline.

Normal gameplay — encountered cheats — mindset changed — quit the game.

This is the typical journey of a normal player quitting a game due to cheats.

But it wouldn't cause a game to become unpopular instantly.

The real core reason Fall Guys quickly became unpopular.

That was the loss of game content.

As a light casual game with a variety show obstacle course type, what truly defined its content was the fun of overcoming challenges in each level.

And once players understood all the levels and got tired of playing them.

Then the game actually offered little enjoyment.

What did the developers of Fall Guys in his previous life do after the game achieved great success?

Levels were definitely being made; that was unquestionable.

But what they did most was release skins and create crossovers.

By the time they realized that without new maps the game would become unpopular, it was already too late.

So for Chen Xu, what he had to do was maximize player enthusiasm, allowing it to linger longer.

And to give Fall Guys a long-term lifespan through the Workshop.

As for turning it into an enduring multiplayer game, that wasn't realistic.

Because Fall Guys' game attributes were pretty much like an internet celebrity.

It could be popular for a while, but it was impossible for it to remain popular indefinitely.

It wasn't a problem of game quality, but a problem of content depth.

............

As the exhibition date drew closer, the atmosphere within Nebula Games was relatively relaxed.

Because the progress of both games was very encouraging; Sanguosha had already begun testing various features of its online Sanguosha version.

Only some of the generals' voice acting remained to be completed.

The same was true for Fall Guys; the game's action levels were already finished.

The main remaining content was also in the area of sound effects.

Internally, employees from various departments also acted as the first batch of testers for the games.

However, for now, everyone preferred Sanguosha a bit more.

This was mainly because Fall Guys lacked players, so they couldn't experience the chaotic and comical feeling Chen Xu had described.

Sanguosha, on the other hand, became enjoyable after a brief period of familiarization with its basic content.

"You and I were originally ruler and minister, why must we wage war against each other?" Yang Xin sighed with a bitter expression.

"The Emperor is incompetent and without principle, I act in accordance with heaven's will!" Ruan Ningxue gleefully threw out two Southern Barbarian Invasion cards from her hand, taking away the last two health points of Liu Bei, the Lord.

"No, let's play another round, I refuse to accept this! How come you, Xiaoxue, always draw so many Stratagem cards, and every time I play Zhuge Liang, I'm stuck with an Attack card at the end!" Yang Xin protested.

"Sister Xin, just admit you have the 'African' (bad luck) attribute," Ruan Ningxue said with a smile.

"But speaking of which, I wonder what that 'Big Project' Mr. Chen mentioned earlier actually is!" Qin Yi, who had been silent beside them, spoke up.

During this period, besides developing Sanguosha and Fall Guys, they were also working on the Big Project Chen Xu had mentioned earlier.

However, each of them was working separately on their respective tasks, so they weren't clear on the specific details.

"A relatively dark Western mythological story, a bit like Ragnarök," Yang Xin, who was responsible for the plot, thought for a moment and summarized.

"Pretty much," Ruan Ningxue nodded.

"Mythology? The combat system on my end feels a bit like a medieval knightly duel," Qin Yi scratched his head.

"Why is Brother Qin thinking so much? We'll know when Mr. Chen starts the project," an employee next to him said.

"Exactly! What I'm more curious about is what kind of cosplayers we'll have at this exhibition – Toriel, Undyne!" Another employee seemed very excited.

"It's a shame Mirror can't be exhibited, otherwise!" Qin Yi sighed with a hint of disappointment.

"Pah! Men!" Yang Xin pretended to be disdainful.

"Exactly! Vulgar!" Ruan Ningxue chimed in, seconding the previous comment.

"That's right, Old Qin, your awareness needs to improve! And when it comes to female cosplayers, everyone's so repetitive and unoriginal, how can we compete with other companies? If we're going to play, let's play something different, check this out!" At this moment, Chen Xu and his assistant Lin Rou entered, carrying a large box.
