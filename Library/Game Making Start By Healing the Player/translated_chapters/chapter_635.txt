Chapter 634: We Win in the Future! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

What did “sea of people” even mean?

The farmhouse east of the Northshire Abbey, when Song Ren arrived, a crowd of people was already jamming the front of the house.

Unlike regular monsters in the game, Garrick was a quest monster that spawned only one at a time. Although Chen Xu had specifically designed an instance sharding system and adjusted Garrick's respawn rate in the game.

But after all, the server had just launched, so Song Ren witnessed a bewildering sight.

In front of the small farm, there were at least forty or fifty players.

The tightly shut farmhouse gate had just been opened, and before Song Ren could even see what the BOSS looked like, he saw a flurry of blades and shadows accompanied by various special effects like fireballs, then a miserable scream of 'Er-ah' reached his ears.

This monster named Garrick was instantly killed, and at the same time, a team-up invitation popped up.

All the nearby players were chattering away.

“Damn it, solo players, team up! If you're in a team and have the same quest, killing the BOSS will complete it for everyone. Don't waste spots!”

“LFP, LFP, LFP! Those without a team, type 111111.”

“Haha, is this an elite monster or a BOSS? Too pathetic, I didn't even see it live for a second.”

“BOSS: Are you polite? Can you at least let me glimpse what the outside world looks like?”

“Damn it, I've been waiting for five minutes and haven't gotten a hit in!”

“Haha, I got my hit, I'm out of here, I'm out of here.”

Seeing what the surrounding players were saying, Song Ren also joined a small team: two Mages, one Paladin, and one Warrior.

However, fighting this thing clearly had nothing to do with class composition; it was mainly about who had the fastest hands.

And Song Ren also understood why there were so many people here.

Although a small team could collectively complete shared quests, only one monster spawned at a time, accommodating a maximum of five people.

What's more critical was that new players were constantly streaming in, preparing to tackle this quest.

“Damn it, when the heck are we supposed to finish this?”

“Does it have to be this crazy?”

Clearly, some players had also noticed this problem. It was such a chaotic mess, there was no way to play.

A group of people spoke animatedly, some typing, some turning on their in-game public voice chat.

This was also different from his previous life; Chen Xu had built in voice chat in the game, allowing players who weren't friends, in a party, or in a guild to communicate via voice, though only within close proximity.

Amidst the messy voice chat, with some speaking Mandarin and some local dialects, someone eventually proposed an idea, and everyone's chatter eventually converged into one unified concept: queuing.

After all, the scene was truly chaotic, and playing like this was entirely a matter of luck, with new players continuously arriving.

If this continued, they would either have to abandon the quest or prepare to be stuck there indefinitely.

So, many players conferred and decided, “Let's just be polite and civilized about it. We're even building civilized cities in real life, after all.”

“Quality gaming, front row, damn it, queue up! One team per spawn is enough, everyone team up and don't waste time!”

“Exactly, have some class, queue up!”

“I'm queuing, I'm queuing!”

“That Paladin up front, what are you doing? No cutting in line! Look at the hammer in your hand, look at your Holy Light power, is that how a Paladin acts?”

“Line-cutters beware, or you'll find your bed full of Felguards tonight!”

At first, it was still a mess, but as they waited for the BOSS, everyone started chatting and spontaneously formed a long queue.

And the players who had just arrived were initially bewildered, but seeing everyone else so self-aware, they mostly joined the queue silently.

This was human instinct, the herd mentality; when everyone else is queuing, you'll unconsciously follow suit.

Of course, there were some who didn't intend to follow the rules, but they would be verbally lectured by others, and no one would invite them to a team. A single person trying to steal this quest monster simply couldn't compete with a five-person team.

So, after suffering setbacks, these players honestly went to the very end of the line to queue up.

However, while everyone was queuing, some Mages who had nothing else to do were busy conjuring water for everyone.

As for food, many Mage players hadn't reached that level yet.

The surrounding players also started discussing.

“You Mages have it too easy, you can be self-sufficient!”

“Not at all, not at all, we Mages have many places where we need to spend money, and these items also have a time limit and can only be used out of combat.”

“Actually, I think this is quite realistic. After all, in most Western fantasy games, aren't Mages basically rich kids?”

“Exactly, exactly, so Mages are rich, that's very realistic!”

Song Ren, waiting in line nearby, listened to the two Mages in his team chatting with other players and felt a bit mentally exhausted, drained.

“And if we're going by Western fantasy novels and games, generally Warriors should be cannon fodder, right?”

Song Ren fell silent for a moment, then quietly stepped forward.

“Only those without Mage talent would become Warriors, right?”

“Mages are all noble lords, and Warriors are just common soldiers?”

Song Ren listened to the surrounding players' discussion, grunted twice, and said nothing.

However, some Warrior players did retort.

“Indeed, we Warriors seem to be struggling a bit now, but I think we Warriors are characters that shine in the mid-game.”

“Exactly! See our Charge skill? In future PVP, we Warriors will be your Mages' nightmare!”

“And for dungeons, it's basically all on us Warriors with defense specs!”

“What do you mean 'basically'? We Paladins beg to differ!”

“No difference, no difference, Warriors and Paladins are one family. We Warriors are a bit miserable now, but are you Paladins having it easy?”

“That's true. No worries, let's work hard together. We win in the future!”

Listening to the surrounding players, Song Ren nodded in deep agreement.

Is conjuring bread and water such a big deal?

On the battlefield, those squishy Mages of yours wouldn't even be enough for a single slash from him, a valiant Warrior.

What are you so proud of? If you've got guts, don't let Warriors tank for you when you fight BOSSes or go into dungeons.

Bread and water?

He'd rather starve to death than accept a sip of water or a piece of bread from you Mages!

As Song Ren was thinking with great integrity, it was finally their team's turn. They easily dispatched Garrick, then looted his corpse for the quest item.

After getting the quest item, he added everyone in his team as friends. Song Ren then returned to turn in the quest, and the experience gained directly leveled him up to 6.

He seemed to have cleared almost all the quests around Elwynn Forest, so next, he was planning to check out Goldshire, which he had seen before. The grand journey of a mighty Warrior was about to begin.
