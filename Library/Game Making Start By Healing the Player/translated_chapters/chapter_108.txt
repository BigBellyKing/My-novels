Chapter 108: Mr. Chen, Why Are You So Proficient?

After watching Chen Xu enter the game and recreate a 'Deprived' character, Qin Yi and the others standing beside him exchanged glances, a knowing smile appearing on their faces.

Their eyes widened as they stared at the screen in front of Chen Xu, seemingly anticipating something entertaining to appear.

Chen Xu, who was experiencing the game, naturally noticed the subtle actions of Qin Yi and the others beside him.

However, Chen Xu said nothing, merely smiling silently as he continued to test the game's relevant content.

There weren't any major issues with the UI interface or anything similar, including the game's Character Customization System, which was more refined compared to his previous life.

After a quick try, Chen Xu used a preset default character to enter the game.

The first thing that caught his eye was the graphics.

In his previous life, the graphics were never the focus of Dark Souls, or any game in the Souls series for that matter.

Players wouldn't praise its graphics; rather, they'd laud the game's art design, such as the fairy-tale-like Irithyll of the Boreal Valley in Dark Souls 3, which could be said to have stunned countless players who saw the scene for the first time.

Furthermore, Fountainhead Palace in Sekiro, and Cathedral Ward in Bloodborne, all left countless players deeply impressed.

However, given that the technological level in this Parallel World was stronger than in his previous life, and mainstream computer configurations were also higher,

Chen Xu couldn't possibly ignore the opportunity to create superior graphics and insist on keeping them the same as in his previous life.

After all, good game graphics could also provide players with a better gaming experience.

And the current feeling the game gave him made him very satisfied.

The entire screen displayed a cool gray tone, the scenery was exceptionally desolate, and the ground was littered with bones and ashes.

Faint, ethereal mist floated in the air, appearing somewhat chilling.

The game's atmosphere was essentially perfectly captured.

For the game's opening CGI, Chen Xu still used the promotional trailer previously released at the exhibition.

Some of the intervals added for atmosphere during the exhibition were cut, simply to make the entire opening story more compact.

After all, the entire CGI cost a considerable amount, so it was best to make full use of it.

Entering the game, Chen Xu controlled his character, clad in large shorts and wielding a broken wooden shield and a Small Club, and began to try out some simple actions.

Just like in his previous life, there were specially prepared system hint messages on the ground, and Hollows were placed nearby for players to practice on.

However, for Chen Xu, there was clearly no need to read them.

After all, he was more than familiar with the entire game's system settings.

Running, locking on, normal attacks, heavy attacks, using weapon art, and rolling.

Chen Xu tried out all the actions one by one.

Then Chen Xu opened the in-game console and entered a line of code to bring up a shield capable of parrying.

The small broken wooden shield that the Deprived character started with in the game could only be used for impact and couldn't parry. So, to practice parrying, he had to switch to a shield with a blocking skill.

As for this code, it was only for convenient testing in the development version and would definitely be removed in the official release.

Equipping the shield summoned by code, Chen Xu approached the first Hollow mob.

He didn't rush to attack immediately. Instead, he circled around it to aggro it, making it stand up from the ground.

The Hollow opposite let out a roar, then charged forward, swinging a broken sword in its hand.

Under the bewildered gaze of Qin Yi and the others, a dull 'thud' sound came from the monitor's built-in speakers.

Qin Yi and the others, who had been fully involved in the game's combat system, understood that this was the sound of a successful parry.

The in-game character, facing the Hollow kneeling on the ground in a state of flinch, mercilessly struck the Hollow's head with a wooden club resembling a large chicken leg, instantly clearing its long health bar.

The execution animations in the game were more detailed compared to his previous life.

In the Dark Souls of his previous life, although different weapons had execution animations, besides broad categories like greatswords, axes, longswords, unarmed, and claws, it was roughly one animation applied to three or four weapon types.

So, Chen Xu had optimized a lot in this area.

Regarding the game's content itself, adding execution animations or not didn't actually have a huge impact.

However, for the player's experience, it did have a direct impact.

Because these execution animations were, in fact, a form of in-game reward.

Just like in fighting games, when players accumulate enough energy to unleash a powerful special move and successfully hit their opponent, there's a series of flashy animations.

This was a reward mechanism.

The executions in Dark Souls were no different.

For monsters that could be parried, a successful parry followed by an execution was also a visual reward for the player.

At the same time, there was another benefit: once every weapon had its own execution animation, wouldn't players be curious about what each weapon's execution effect looked like?

What? You're asking if whips have execution animations? And this weapon too?

Watching Chen Xu's effortless and fluid parry, Qin Yi and the others standing nearby froze.

“This parry operation, Mr. Chen, why are you so proficient?”

“The correct procedure shouldn't be to just go up and hack the Hollow to death with a couple of swings, right?”

“What's with this immediate parry?!”

“Although the entire game's combat system and action system were designed and planned by you, Mr. Chen.”

“But whether it was asset production or game testing, they were the first ones to do it. So why are you so proficient now?”

Chen Xu in the game moved with extremely fluid positioning, arriving at the first bonfire and lighting it, then ran and jumped onto another coffin-staircase to pick up a glowing white item.

Chen Xu, who hadn't lost a single drop of health throughout, had already arrived in front of the first BOSS, 'Gundyr the Ash'.

Qin Yi and the others, who had originally expected to see something entertaining, were all dumbfounded.

This was completely different from what they had imagined!

Nevertheless, Qin Yi and his group still held a glimmer of anticipation.

After all, regular mobs and BOSSes were different. Even if Chen Xu was the producer, hadn't they been involved in the entire game's development?

Knowing it was one thing, but actually experiencing it was another matter entirely.

It was just like various guides and advanced techniques; the text and videos were there, but would you truly master them after watching?

Not only would you not, but you'd also send a bullet comment: 'This streamer (author) actually thinks I can learn this.'

Everyone stared intently at Chen Xu's upcoming performance.

Especially Qin Yi; he had been thoroughly thrashed by this BOSS before.

Most BOSSes in Dark Souls shared a common characteristic: an extremely large size.

This inherently gave players a strong sense of oppression.

Furthermore, the weapons held by BOSSes were usually astonishingly long, allowing them to attack players from a great distance, and they often had wide-reaching attacks like sweeping blows.

Although 'Gundyr the Ash' in front of them was the first BOSS, it truly looked formidable.

Its attacks were also exceptionally powerful; although one could block them with a shield, a lot of stamina would be depleted instantly.

What was even more fatal was that most BOSSes in Dark Souls had two phases, and 'Gundyr the Ash' was no exception.

The second phase, the Black Giant Serpent-Man Pus Form, had previously stumped Qin Yi for quite some time.

Under the continued eager gaze of Qin Yi and the others, Chen Xu in the game was also preparing to engage the BOSS.
