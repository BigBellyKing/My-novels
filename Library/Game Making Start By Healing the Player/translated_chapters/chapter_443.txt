Chapter 442: The True Meaning of A Thief's End (Please subscribe for monthly passes)

Following Elena, they tracked down clues left by Sam and the others. Finally, Nathan and Elena arrived at the palace with the large watchtower they had seen before.

Crumbling structures, mottled walls – these ancient buildings were covered in thick moss, overgrown with trees. However, by now, most of the island paradise's territory was submerged in water.

But it had to be said, everything before his eyes was simply breathtaking. Song Ren's eyes widened as he observed his surroundings, not even paying attention to Nathan and Elena's conversation within the game's storyline. Well, after the couple had expressed their feelings to each other, the rest of the journey was just them showering players like him with 'dog food'. This plot, it wasn't worth listening to anyway!

Looking at the lost pirate utopia before him, Song Ren was filled with awe. Although it was a lost city, and had been hidden on this deserted island for 300 years, the passage of time only made this pirate paradise appear more magnificent. It even gave Song Ren the illusion that a pirate utopia genuinely existed in reality, hidden in some corner of the world, and that Libertalia itself should indeed look like this.

As Song Ren marveled at the surrounding scenery, Nathan and Elena spotted Sam, who had ventured deep into the complex, through their binoculars. Thus, to rescue this unreliable older brother, Elena and Nathan immediately set off.

Along this stretch of the journey, there was no longer any need for puzzle-solving mechanisms. It was just climbing and finding the correct path. If the earlier version of him had encountered this scene, the relatively complex climbing design would have still caused Song Ren to get stuck. But for the current him, it was no problem at all. A quick glance was usually enough to easily find the right way.

What captured Song Ren's attention even more were the things Nathan and Elena discovered there. Letters left by pirates, and various other clues, were gradually unraveling everything that had happened in this pirate paradise, Libertalia, 300 years ago.

Finally, in a grand hall, Nathan and Elena discovered a pile of pirate corpses. These were all historically renowned great pirates, yet they had met their demise simultaneously. However, one person was missing from the group: Henry Every. So, by now, the answer was clearly evident. Henry Every, a pirate once considered legendary, had used a series of methods to gather these famous pirates, and likewise, their wealth. Together, they built the pirate utopia of Libertalia. But in the end, Henry Every, in his greed to keep all the treasure for himself, murdered his companions. Countless treasures transformed these thieves into terrifying devils, causing them to slaughter each other.

Of course, this adventure also featured unavoidable fierce battles. Wielding machine guns, grenades, and RPGs, Nathan and Elena, whose combat power was off the charts, single-handedly wiped out a group of mercenaries. At the same time, half of the pirate palace collapsed again. However, Song Ren no longer felt any surprise about this; he'd be surprised if it *didn't* collapse.

Finally, after a series of intense battles, Nathan and Elena successfully rescued Sam. But the obsession with the treasure still lingered in Sam's heart, so after sending Nathan away, Sam decided to go after Henry Every's treasure alone. Having reached this point, what more could Nathan say? Although he desperately wanted to punch his brother in the face, Nathan still couldn't abandon him. So he instructed Elena and Sully to prepare for extraction, while he himself turned back once more. Climbing, fighting enemies, he finally reached the great pirate Henry's treasure ship. Amidst piles of gold and silver treasures, Nathan and Rafe engaged in a traditional pirate duel with cutlasses. Dodging, fencing – this was the most challenging battle Song Ren had faced in the game. Even with 'Explorer mode' activated, dangers abounded. Fortunately, he finally managed to defeat Rafe and escape the treasure ship with Sam.

Accompanied by explosions and sparks, the treasure ship and Rafe sank into the sea. Watching Nathan escape with Sam, Song Ren had an epiphany at this point, seemingly understanding some of the meaning behind the game's title, 'A Thief's End'. Henry Every, the other historically renowned pirates, and people like Rafe were all thieves. And in their pursuit of treasure, they utterly met their end. But Nathan was different; he wasn't the owner of the treasure, but its witness. For Nathan Drake, what truly fascinated him wasn't the treasure itself. Nathan Drake was merely a witness to the treasure, not its possessor. He witnessed the existence of these treasures and then buried them again. For Nathan Drake, that was enough. As for Sam, what he was curious about wasn't the value of the treasure either; he was also curious about the treasure itself. The difference was that Nathan Drake had already seen enough treasures; he could let go of everything. Sam, however, was not yet able to fully let go.

In the final moments of their return, Nathan and Sam had a conversation.

Sam: “I just thought after we found Henry Every’s treasure, I’d be... satisfied?”

Sam: “On the contrary... I... seem to have this strange sense of...”

Nathan: “Emptiness. Yes, you know no matter how thrilling the next adventure is, in the end, you’ll still feel the same way.”

Nathan: “Sometimes you just have to make choices, about what to keep, and what to let go of.”

Sam: “Well... I guess I haven’t reached that point yet. Besides, you know you’ve discovered several more ancient city ruins than me. I can’t just leave them be, so...”

Nathan: “I left a few for you.”

Listening to Nathan and Sam’s conversation, Song Ren couldn’t help but smile knowingly. Judging from Henry Every’s pirate paradise ruins and the treasure ship, Song Ren estimated that in subsequent DLCs, the ancient city ruins Nathan explored would pretty much all be in trouble. Before Nathan discovered these ruins, they were perfectly fine where they were. But once Nathan discovered them, well, who knows what would happen.

However, more than all that, what moved Song Ren was Nathan himself. What kind of thrilling adventures had Nathan Drake experienced in the past? How did he meet Elena and Sully? Song Ren didn’t know these details, but from the story of A Thief’s End, he could clearly feel Nathan Drake’s charisma. From Nathan’s initial deep-sea salvaging to doting on his wife at home, and then reminiscing about past events while lost in thought – all of this allowed people to feel Nathan’s inner world. Nathan could be described as a contradiction, a two-faced character; his blood held both a yearning for adventure and a deep appreciation for those around him. He was never a man content with an ordinary life; his heart constantly yearned for thrilling adventures. So Nathan Drake had always been pretending, pretending he was truly happy, making himself seem capable of adapting to a mundane life. He had been striving to overcome that sense of emptiness that came from moving from excitement to normalcy. But once he truly embarked on an adventure again, when he discovered clues about treasures, and clues about hidden historical truths, Nathan Drake, this man, his eyes glowed with fervor. This journey, however, was different. Nathan Drake had finally truly found the answers he sought.

At the end of the story, Sam brought out some gold coins from the treasure. He gave these coins to Elena, who then used them to buy the salvage company Nathan worked for, and, by pulling some strings, obtained a salvage license for the Southeast Asian waters. Finally, the couple decided that from then on, they would engage in legal yet treasure-hunting-themed work. Nathan was responsible for salvaging, while Elena would film it with a camera to create a TV show. As the screen finally faded to black, Song Ren sighed with emotion. At the same time, the player’s controlled character eventually became Nathan Drake’s daughter, years later.

Judging from the photos and information inside the house, Nathan and Elena’s life was truly delightful. Sam, meanwhile, had formed a new adventure duo with Sully, and from the photos, Sam and Sully were also doing well. Finally, in a cabinet, their daughter discovered the little secrets her dad and mom had kept from her. So the family of three went to their boat, recounting the wild adventure stories of yesteryear. In this atmosphere, the game came to an end. Looking at the list of the game’s development staff, Song Ren couldn’t help but breathe out a smile.
