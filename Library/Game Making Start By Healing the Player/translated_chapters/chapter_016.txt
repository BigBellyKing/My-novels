Chapter 16: Playing the Victim Card

In the meeting room, Chen Xu was explaining the details of Undertale to Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue.

The issues with Mirror (Game) weren't significant; following the previous template, it was just a matter of adding the corresponding standing illustrations and text plot.

The main focus going forward would still be on developing the content for Undertale.

In its previous life, Undertale was a work created by an independent game designer.

Yet, it moved countless players worldwide, making it a truly classic META game.

However, unlike other meta games such as Pony Island, ICEY, and The Stanley Parable, Undertale seamlessly blended META elements with RPG elements, practically subverting players' perception of traditional RPG settings.

The core ideas of the game were quite clear.

The main core of Undertale revolved around its story plot, complemented by META-specific twists, while the gameplay was merely a flavor enhancer for the game.

Of course, Chen Xu also planned to improve some aspects of it.

For instance, compared to its previous life, Undertale's game art would definitely need to be superior.

The simplistic pixel style and hand-drawn lines of Undertale in its previous life weren't chosen because such a style was beneficial to the game.

It was simply due to a lack of funds, as it was a personal independent game after all.

As for some so-called connoisseurs and media outlets claiming unique art style after Undertale exploded in popularity, that was all nonsense.

Indeed, pixel games aren't always a result of lacking funds; for example, Octopath Traveler in its previous life aimed to use pixels to create a blend of modern and nostalgic aesthetics, and some retro-oriented games intentionally use pixels.

And for a META game primarily focused on its core story, superior visual presentation would obviously only enhance the game, not detract from it.

For instance, Minecraft chose a pixel style because its block-building gameplay matched the pixel aesthetic.

However, Undertale's art style was clearly not a compromise made for gameplay's sake.

Of course, aside from the visual presentation, the story and music of Undertale were undeniably classic.

Finally, Sans's 'Megalovania' and Undyne's 'Battle Against a True Hero' were both incredibly classic.

After briefly introducing some of Undertale's core content to the two, Chen Xu also showed Ruan Ningxue the character design illustrations for the main characters.

The kind and gentle Toriel, the benevolent king who, before battle, seemed amiable but transformed into a formidable war god wielding a trident once combat began, the tall and short skeleton brothers, and Flowey, who appeared kind but was truly an expression meme lord...

Chen Xu would personally oversee the character designs for the main roles.

As for the regular small monsters, those would be handed over to the outsourcing team, and they would simply need to meet the requirements for acceptance later.

Next came the story, with its Neutral, Pacifist, Genocide, and Soulless Pacifist routes.

Chen Xu had already outlined the plot for these different routes, using the Memory Capsules he had previously drawn from the system.

The remaining task was primarily for Yang Xin to fill in the details.

After assigning their respective duties, Chen Xu sat back at his desk, logged into the official game engine's backend, and began preparing the basic framework for Undertale.

"Ningxue, was this how you developed Mirror (Game) previously?"

Looking at the manuscript, which was detailed beyond belief, Yang Xin still hadn't fully processed it.

Ruan Ningxue, who was holding the character design requirement drafts and already working on the designs, looked a little puzzled: "Yes, Sister Xin? Is there a problem with developing games this way?"

"A huge problem! It's too smooth! The ideas are too clear!" Yang Xin's eyes widened, but she kept her voice low.

Although in terms of scope, Undertale felt like a small-scale game.

But it was too seamless; it gave Yang Xin the illusion that even a dog could manage to develop it.

Thinking back to the chaos of game development at her previous company, Yang Xin briefly wondered if the employees she had hired before were all just putting on a show for her.

While marveling, Yang Xin meticulously reviewed Undertale's story, trying to figure out how to best fill in the details.

............... 

Chen Xu, sitting in his seat, wasn't thinking about anything irrelevant.

At this moment, he was experimenting with the official game engine.

The computational resources available were roughly twenty times more than before.

In the backend, the currently available resources were 0/1024MB.

Calculating by previous world units, it was roughly 1GB, but Chen Xu had checked the tutorial and related new content.

In the Parallel World, these resources were completely sufficient.

As for wanting more.

Either increase the designer's job title level, or spend money.

How to improve it? Either slowly accumulate, which is what's known as seniority.

Besides that, one would need to win some prestigious awards or have a positive impact on the gaming industry.

To some extent, the birth of Mirror (Game) could be considered to have spurred innovation in the gentleman's gaming industry.

Once he had a rough understanding, Chen Xu gently shook his head, no longer dwelling on these thoughts.

Instead, he proceeded with the development of Undertale.

This independent game wasn't particularly difficult for Chen Xu.

With the technology available in the Parallel World, developing such a game wouldn't take much effort.

The truly time-consuming and arduous parts were primarily the story text, character standing illustrations, and music.

It's worth noting that the music in Undertale was exceptionally outstanding.

This characteristic also appeared in many other independent game titles.

Story, music, and gameplay creativity have always been the three essential pillars of independent games.

"Sister Xin, who is this, coming out to bite us?"

"It's a staged accident provocateur. Probably envious of Mirror (Game)'s sales performance, plus his own new game is about to be released, so he deliberately comes to stir up controversy for hype. This guy's a habitual offender."

Noticing the commotion from Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue, Chen Xu was also a bit curious: "What's going on?"

Seeing Chen Xu approach, Yang Xin picked up Ruan Ningxue's phone: "It's this, a guy who specializes in staging accidents for attention."

Chen Xu took the phone; it was displaying a video reposted by a media outlet called Game Timespace.

After tapping it open, the screen showed a middle-aged man reviewing a game. The game image was Mirror (Game), featuring, of course, the fully-clothed standing illustrations.

'To capture players' attention, game designers nowadays will do anything.'

'Vulgar, utterly vulgar!'

'Gaming is a very artistic industry. To call such a work a game, I feel, is a desecration of games.'

'Can such a game designer have a positive impact on the gaming industry?'

'He cannot!'

'If these contents were in my upcoming game, Blooming, which I developed, I would be ashamed to show my face.'

'So, here, I also hope that the vast number of game designers can use fewer gimmicks and focus more on researching how to make truly good games, instead of resorting to vulgar content just to boost sales.'

The roughly two-minute video featured the speaker talking with righteous indignation.

However, an interesting point emerged when Chen Xu scrolled through the comments.

Besides a group of players praising him, there was also a large number of sarcastic players.

'Zhong 'Big Cannon', you're at it again?'

'Vulgar? Then I absolutely must go and criticize it!'

'Games made by others? Vulgar! Games made by me? Art!'

'Alright, tell us, when are you promoting your new game?'

'Elder brother above, you weren't paying attention during Zhong 'Big Cannon''s 'cannon-firing' segment, were you? Didn't he already slip it in? The game is called Blooming.'

After watching the entire video, along with some comments in the comment section and Yang Xin's explanation.

Chen Xu had a general understanding.

The other party was named Zhong Mei, a designer under Hapai Culture & Sports. Of course, he was also the owner of this company.

His reputation in the gaming circle was mixed, both praised and criticized.

As for the praise, it was because Zhong Mei indeed had some respectable works in the past.

Even in recent years, while his game quality hadn't been revolutionary, it wasn't too bad in terms of overall quality.

As for the criticism, that concerned Zhong Mei's character and conduct.

He often deliberately sought out trending and somewhat controversial games to disparage, using them to promote and elevate his own games.

Not only Chen Xu, but many other game designers had also been targeted in this manner.
