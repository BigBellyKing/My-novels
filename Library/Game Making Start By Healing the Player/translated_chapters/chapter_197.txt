Chapter 196: Don't Starve Launched (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

September 11th, with the Mid-Autumn Festival just past, only the last day of the three-day holiday remained.

During this period, many of the BOSSes in Dark Souls' Death Mode were finally conquered one after another.

Yhorm the Giant, who had been teased by players, was finally no longer alone.

During this time, many players also @-mentioned Chen Xu's official Weibo account with various questions.

There were all sorts of players.

Some asked about the type of Chen Xu's next work, some asked about the actual story of Dark Souls, and some inquired if there would be any new Dark Souls titles in the future.

But on this day, many players were surprised to find that the silent official Weibo, which had been inactive,

actually posted a message about a new game.

'The brand-new game Don't Starve is now available on the Nebula Games Platform.'

'This is a sandbox game that combines adventure, survival, role-playing, crafting, and exploration. Players need to find, excavate, and utilize various limited resources to survive in an unknown, mysterious world.'

'The game supports multiplayer. You can team up with your friends to explore and survive together in this mysterious, unknown world.'

'Game features: A comprehensive item crafting system that lets you experience the joy of creation; a distinctive Gothic art style; a huge and mysterious explorable map; and sandbox-style free gameplay.'

Similar to some of the previous small-scale games, such as Sanguosha and Overcooked.

This time, Chen Xu also simultaneously developed PC and mobile versions for Don't Starve.

Of course, considering the different control methods and the platform differences brought by subsequent MODs,

the two different versions each have their own Major Regions, with data interoperability only for the Vanilla Version.

This means that if corresponding MODs are added, players can play together, but only with other players on their respective platforms.

Furthermore, players don't need to buy it twice, as Data Interoperability is used.

After playing on PC, players can still continue playing on their mobile phones.

However, this is also limited to inheriting Vanilla Version Saves.

After Chen Xu's official Weibo post,

advertisements for Don't Starve were successively launched across major gaming websites, communities, and the Nebula Games Platform itself.

Of course, the scale was far from as grand as the previous Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame and It Takes Two.

But it still left many players Taken Aback.

"What's going on? Chen Xu developed another game?"

"Let me see, this seems to be a small-scale, low-cost game?"

"A mini-game? Let me take a look, this art style is a bit eerie!"

"What's there to exclaim about? Didn't Chen Xu say on the official Weibo, 'Gothic style'!"

"Bro, what is Gothic style?"

"How would I know what Gothic style is? I only know what Gothic Lolita is."

"???? Something's not right, where are the police officers? I want to report this!"

"Don't derail the topic. What does 'sandbox game' mean? What kind of game genre is sandbox?"

"No idea, Chen Xu probably just made it up?"

"Survival, and this art style... Holy crap, this isn't a horror game, is it?"

"It's not impossible! Maybe Chen Xu made the Silent Hill PT DEMO before and felt it wasn't enough."

"You guys, don't just fantasize. Didn't Chen Xu's official Weibo explain it clearly? There's absolutely no horror tag."

"Heh heh, I only believe half of what Chen Xu says now. Before, at the gameplay Expo, Chen Xu could talk about the big hammer game in terms of life philosophy. If you believe everything he says, you'll be sold off and still count the money for the buyer!"

"Anyway, I'll Wait and See for now!"

"Never mind, I'll just Get one's hands on it. It's only 26 Yuan, if it's not fun, I'll just get a refund."

Many players discussed under Chen Xu's official Weibo post.

Some players decided to take a wait-and-see approach for now, while others expressed great anticipation, as games with this survival mode gameplay seemed quite interesting from the description, and the 26 Yuan price wasn't expensive either.

After seeing Chen Xu's official Weibo post, many designers in the gaming industry also felt confused.

After all, Chen Xu was no longer an unknown.

In the PC platform sector, Chen Xu had launched numerous games that profoundly impacted the industry.

From the start, Undertale spearheaded the META game feature, then Overcooked and It Takes Two brought a wave of brilliance to cooperative games.

And Dark Souls even astonished many designers, proving that high-difficulty hardcore games could also attract so many players.

At the same time, in the VR field, Nebula Games had not yet fully ventured into it, and no designer had experienced it.

But even from the PC version's videos, it was considered a classic, and some horror games launched afterward directly incorporated looping settings.

Although Don't Starve was a small-scale game now, its 'Sandbox genre' tag still attracted the attention of many industry designers.

'Sandbox genre? What kind of genre is that? Did Chen Xu define it himself for better promotion?'

'Not really. There are actually quite a few sandbox and sandbox-like games on the market, and many of them have achieved decent results, but they are relatively niche.'

'Don't just focus on the game, haven't you noticed something a bit different about Don't Starve compared to Nebula Games' usual titles this time?'

'What's different?'

'The platform! Usually, Nebula Games' products are available on other platforms, even if there are extra discounts on their own platform. But this time, there's no news about Don't Starve being released on any other platforms!'

'Does that mean Chen Xu plans to only launch it on his own platform? Does Nebula Games have such a large user base?'

'Of course it does. Don't underestimate Chen Xu. And I think this is probably a test, since Chen Xu didn't say anything about it being exclusive.'

The launch of Nebula Games' new title, Don't Starve, this time garnered significant attention from many industry designers.

It wasn't just designers paying attention; traditional game developers and distribution platforms like NetDragon and TengHua were also closely watching Nebula Games' performance this time.

............

The industry's attention didn't really affect ordinary players much.

As for Don't Starve currently only being on the Nebula Games Platform, although many players discussed it,

players interested in the game didn't overthink it and chose to purchase it directly.

Especially the player base that Nebula Games had accumulated previously.

Every time a new Nebula Games title was released, purchasing it on their platform came with certain discount conditions.

Initially, players bought simply because of the discount conditions, but over the past two years, many players had developed a habit.

That is, when buying Nebula Games' titles, everyone subconsciously came to the Nebula Games Platform to make their purchases.
