Chapter 855: Old Assassin Behavior

Donning the masks representing the robbers, the operation officially began.

In the previous recon mode, they had essentially familiarized themselves with the interior. Now, Zhang Yi and his team's objective was to find the car dealership's manager and retrieve the keycard from him. According to the mission briefing, the target was a man in a suit, somewhat balding, but his exact location was unknown.

"How should we proceed?" Song Ren looked at Zhang Yi, waiting for him to issue the professional instructions for this heist.

"We can't go through the front. We'll go via the parking lot, hack into the electric box, and open the gate," Zhang Yi thought about the car dealership's layout and proposed.

They had already donned their masks and drawn their guns. Obviously, openly walking through the main entrance and then circling to the fire escape in the back hall was no longer a realistic option. Although it was a game, not reality, and NPCs possessed 'deaf and blind' attributes, it wasn't to the extent that three masked, pistol-wielding bandits running past them would elicit no reaction. Moreover, according to previously scouted information, the adjacent parking lot also offered access to the dealership, though two patrolling security guards required careful handling.

After a brief discussion, the three stealthily made their way to the green belt outside the parking lot, hacked the electric box to open the iron gate. Using the parked vehicles as cover, they quickly reached a back door. However, here Zhang Yi and his team faced two choices: either take out the security guards and get the keys from them, or pick the lock to open the back door. But considering that this operation's plan was stealth, and the two patrolling guards were within the camera's surveillance range, they had no other choice.

"I'll pick the lock. You two keep an eye out. If those two guards come over, take them out on the spot. Don't let them call the police or use their walkie-talkies." As a Ghost with stealth-focused talents, her lock-picking speed was faster than the others, so she was in charge of this pick-and-sneak task.

"No problem." Zhang Yi and Song Ren gripped their guns, sneaking and peeking while lying on the ground, observing the guards' positions through the gaps in the vehicle undercarriage.

Wang Han, meanwhile, pulled out a wire and a clip from her pocket and began fiddling with the keyhole.

"One's coming over!" Zhang Yi, fully immersed, whispered into the voice channel.

In his sight, the leather shoes were getting closer and closer to them. He could even hear footsteps in his ears. Their location wasn't a blind spot; they only had one black sedan as cover. So, as long as this guard approached, he would definitely spot them. And what was even more critical was that this guard was still within the camera's surveillance range, and they hadn't dealt with the camera beforehand.

In other words, at this moment, they had to rely on their luck. If the guard discovered them while still within the surveillance range, the stealth attempt would fail.

Zhang Yi and Song Ren, gripping their guns, were a bit nervous, but then came Wang Han's good news.

"1 second left... Done! Quick, get in!" Wang Han quickly spoke, watching the progress bar. With a click, the back door smoothly opened.

The moment it opened, the three stealthily slipped inside.

After they entered through the back door, the guard outside also approached it. Perhaps having heard the door close, the guard outside showed a puzzled expression. Simultaneously, Zhang Yi and his team inside saw a blue question mark appear above the guard's head.

Leaning against the door, Zhang Yi and his team were extremely nervous, gripping their silenced pistols, three pistols aimed at the main entrance. As soon as the guard outside stepped in, they would immediately show him why the flowers are so red.

To their relief, however, the blue question mark above the guard's head quickly vanished.

Listening to the footsteps gradually fade away outside, Zhang Yi, Song Ren, and Wang Han couldn't help but let out a breath.

Openly robbing places, they had done this countless times. The enemies who died by their hands numbered no less than eight hundred, if not a thousand. Yet, this stealthy approach, where they remained undetected, also brought them a thrilling excitement.

"A perfect stealth!" Song Ren exclaimed.

"But what now? There's a camera up ahead. Just shoot it out?" Cautiously groping their way forward, Zhang Yi stopped and asked as they neared the security door.

Opening that door ahead would lead them into the dealership's interior, and from there they could take the fire escape to the second floor. But the crucial point was the camera at that corner.

"Should I just silently take it out?" Song Ren asked.

"Shooting it out silently might 'beat the bush and scare the snake'. I'll install an ECM jammer. Looking at the previous layout, it feels like one less shouldn't be a big problem." Wang Han rejected the idea.

"Then just install the ECM jammer." Zhang Yi thought about it and agreed.

As a professional bandit operating at various heist locations, Wang Han pulled out an ECM jammer device, resembling a telephone, from her four-dimensional backpack, preparing to place it on the ground. Just then, a 'click' sound suddenly came from the security door in the corridor that connected to the car dealership.

A patrolling security guard, yawning, pushed open the door and walked in, seemingly wanting to get some fresh air. For a moment, the game seemed to switch to mute mode. The guard stared blankly at the three masked bandits, momentarily unable to react, a blue question mark appearing above his head.

Then the question mark instantly turned into a crimson exclamation mark. At the same time, one of the guard's hands reached for the walkie-talkie on his chest, while the other moved towards the pistol at his waist, preparing to shout.

Just then.

'biubiubiubiu...'

A series of silenced gunshots rang out. The guard in front of them acquired a row of bullet holes and softly fell to the ground. Wang Han, completely immersed in the game, rushed forward and grabbed the falling guard's body. Zhang Yi picked up the walkie-talkie from the ground and bluffed the connected guard on the other end. Song Ren quietly closed the door.

"It's fine, we weren't exposed." Zhang Yi glanced back and forth at the shaken Song Ren and Wang Han, then pursed his lips and whispered.

"Exactly, if we take out everyone who sees us, then we haven't been exposed." Song Ren also nodded in agreement, his words the standard statement of an old Assassin.

"So what do we do now?" Wang Han looked at the corpse on the ground.

"No big deal. First, let's change his clothes and find him a home." As Zhang Yi spoke, he pulled out a body bag from his pocket. It was unclear whether this was due to purchasing favorable conditions earlier or if this area was simply designed this way. In the corridor, there were two trash cans, perfect for hiding bodies. Zhang Yi put the corpse into the black bag, then opened the trash can. He tossed it in with a 'thump,' then Zhang Yi took a deep breath.

"Alright, let's continue installing the ECM. Our stealth so far has been perfect; no one has discovered us!"
