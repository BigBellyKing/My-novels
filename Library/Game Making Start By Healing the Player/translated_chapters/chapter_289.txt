Chapter 288: Mr. Chen, So Mighty? (7th Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Entering the game, Chen Xu also got a little serious. After all, his opponent was a professional player, and a rather strong one at that.

As for the race, Chen Xu chose the Night Elf race, and the map was the relatively fair ‘Twisted Meadows (TM)’, which had a neutral tavern in the middle where heroes could be recruited directly.

Checking the spawn point, Chen Xu found himself in the upper right corner. Since the spawn points were random, mainly distributed at the four edges of the map, Chen Xu placed a Moon Well, then sent his newly created Wisp to scout in a clockwise direction. This was a standard maneuver.

Meanwhile, in the live stream room, Huang Donglai and Sun Yixie were commentating. It had to be said that while their skills weren't on par with professional players, their understanding of the game's mechanics and strategies was quite profound.

“Hey... Mr. Chen here is going for a rather unconventional opening, building a Moon Well first then an Altar of Elders. Is he going for a neutral hero opening?” Sun Yixie was the first to notice this detail.

Because in the game, summoning a hero requires a food-providing building: Human Farms, Orc Burrows, and for the Elves, Moon Wells. Generally, if summoning a hero of one's own race, one usually places the Altar of Elders first, then the food-providing building, as the latter's construction time is shorter, allowing for the fastest hero summon.

“And Brother Huang, look, Mr. Chen's micro is really skilled!” “Scouting clockwise, found no one in the upper left, continued scouting downwards, directly wedging the Wisp inside, providing a bit of vision while gathering wood. Not bad!”

Sun Yixie was commentating very seriously. He originally thought this would be a battle without suspense, but from the current operations, it was quite methodical!

While controlling the Wisp to scout, his base operations didn't stop either. For now, no specific high-level skill could be seen, but he was definitely not an ordinary player.

“Oh, Brother Sun, it’s no use, you have to know who Mr. Chen is facing.” “Shu Ben, an incredibly powerful man! Double Ancient of Wars, one placed next to the mercenary camp, what kind of play is that?! Does he want to mass Huntresses?” Huang Donglai, who was commentating, stated that he still didn’t favor Chen Xu, but he did notice a small maneuver by Chen Xu in the game.

“We can see Shu Ben still chose his most proficient playstyle, single Burrow fast tech.” “Although I don't really want to say it, in front of absolute skill, all tactics and macro are but fleeting clouds. Mr. Chen is in trouble now.” Huang Donglai bravely made his judgment.

Chen Xu in the game didn't overthink it. He placed one Ancient of War at his base and another at the mercenary creep camp on the right. This was because he had already planned his strategy for this match.

The opponent hadn't scouted him immediately, which indicated they hadn't spawned in the bottom right. He also hadn't scouted anyone in the upper left. So, the opponent most likely spawned at the far bottom-left position; later Wisp scouting confirmed his idea. Of course, even if he'd guessed the wrong location, he could still cancel the Ancient of War at the mercenary camp in time.

Then, when the time came, the mid-lane tavern directly summoned a neutral unit, the Beastmaster. After summoning a Quillbeast, he directly headed towards the Orc base in the bottom right.

On the way, he encountered a Blademaster accompanied by an Orc Grunt, looking to creep. Clearly, the opponent was sticking to the traditional Orc playstyle, starting with a Blademaster. The Blademaster chased, and the Orc Grunt body-blocked. Although Chen Xu's micro was decent, he was still body-blocked twice and hit three times by the Blademaster for free.

The bullet comments in the live stream room were also very lively.

‘What’s going on? Shouldn’t Night Elves start with a Demon Hunter?’

‘Confirmed! Orcs are the strongest! Look, Mr. Chen is playing Night Elf, but the first hero he recruits is still the Beastmaster!’

‘Damn, your thought process is bizarre!’

‘I’m more curious why Mr. Chen built two Ancient of Wars at the start. Is he going for Huntresses? But Huntresses can’t beat them!’

‘Shu Ben’s double Burrows are still building, and the Beastmaster with the Quillbeasts is going to destroy them. Three piglets are so fierce!’

‘The Blademaster took a bit of damage this wave, he didn’t even have time to creep, but at least he got the Quillbeasts' experience.’

‘This harassment is quite well-played, Mr. Chen really has some skills!’

During the commentary, many players also noticed some different insights.

This couldn't help but surprise quite a few RTS players.

It seemed Chen Xu really had something up his sleeve!

In the commentary channel, through the God's-eye view, Sun Yixie and Huang Donglai were also quite surprised.

“Double Ancient of Wars massing Huntresses, the early game was very well executed, but it’s a pity Mr. Chen is facing a professional player, Shu Ben. Look, the Orcs at home are already at Tier 2 tech, Wolf Riders are out, and the second hero chosen was a Shaman.”

“And Wolf Riders’ movement speed is faster than Huntresses. This means only Wolf Riders can surround and kill Huntresses, while Huntresses can’t kill Wolf Riders. How can he lose? Shu Ben, he's already in an invincible position!” Huang Donglai stated that as a professional commentator, he should be brave enough to make judgments.

The battle on the field was still quite stalemated, but Chen Xu was smiling happily, because everything was under control.

Although he was still at Tier 1 tech, his second expansion base was already mining, and his economy was in excellent shape.

‘Here they come, here they come, charging! Shu Ben’s Wolf Rider push! And everyone, note that Wolf Riders have Siege attack type, with extra damage bonus against buildings.’

‘Hey, Mr. Chen chose to base trade with the Beastmaster? A very clever move, but it was useless, he directly lost two Huntresses.’

‘Shu Ben feels like he’s already won, no matter how he plays, he’s won. He won the head-on fight, and he won the base trade.’

The commentators' performance was very professional, and Shu Ben in the game also felt his advantage should be quite significant.

He reapplied a great potion to a low-health Wolf Rider. Shu Ben was preparing to save up two more Wolf Riders and then run, but soon he discovered something was amiss.

That was, the opponent didn't choose multiple heroes, still only leveled one Beastmaster, and only produced Huntresses throughout.

And this Beastmaster's level had actually reached a terrifying level 5.

And he had clearly wiped out almost a small squad of the opponent's Huntresses earlier.

How was there another squad now!?

Did he open an expansion?

How many did he open!?

In the early game, he was constantly harassed by the Beastmaster, coupled with the single Burrow fast tech, and then started producing Wolf Riders.

Shu Ben had no time at all to open an expansion; he had always been on a single base. Now his main mine was almost depleted. And the opponent's home base was clearly torn apart by him, but why did they still have so many troops!?

Not just Shu Ben, the audience and commentators in the live stream room also noticed this scene through the God's-eye view.

It seemed that every wave Chen Xu lost and suffered heavy losses, and even the main base's buildings were torn to shreds.

But he hadn't suffered any fatal damage at all!

On the contrary, with the appearance of a third expansion, money was no issue at all.

Expansion? Base?

As long as I have money, anywhere is my main base!

As for the Huntresses, four Ancient of Wars were massing them. By the time I send you a squad and you're resupplying, my new squad is ready again.

I just won't engage you in a direct all-in push. If you come to demolish my base, I'll go base trade yours. If you're so bold, then don't use a Town Portal scroll.

The longer they played, the worse Shu Ben's economy got, while Chen Xu's economy became even better.

Finally, as the Beastmaster reached level 6, he directly brought a massive amount of Huntresses to Shu Ben's base and unleashed his ultimate ability.

Watching countless Thunder Lizards rampage through his base, Shu Ben, whose mentality was finally starting to crack, typed out 'GG'.

“What’s going on!? Shu Ben really lost? Night Elf, no, isn’t Mr. Chen this mighty?” Huang Donglai on the commentary desk looked incredulous; even now he felt a bit bewildered.

And at this moment, the bullet comments in the live stream room completely exploded.
