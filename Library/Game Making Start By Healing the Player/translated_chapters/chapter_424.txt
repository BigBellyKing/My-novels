## Chapter 423: Mr. Chen! You're too good! How can you hide a knife in this game? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Although the weapon durability setting, coupled with limited equipment slots, caused immense suffering for many players with hoarding disorder.

However, in terms of gameplay and overall game design, this approach offered significant advantages.

Firstly, every single weapon, from a small twig on the ground to a Guardian Axe or Royal Broadsword, found its purpose.

It wasn't like typical games where players would always use their most suitable weapon, discarding the rest in storage or selling them in shops.

At the same time, each weapon had its own unique characteristics. For example, the Korok Leaf, often considered trash by many players and only used for fanning, proved invaluable against certain Wizzrobes.

These Wizzrobes flew in the air, possessed teleport abilities, and often worked in conjunction with melee monsters. Consequently, players found combat incredibly challenging. Wanting to eliminate the Wizzrobes first was difficult because they flew and teleported, making them hard to defeat quickly.

And if players chose to engage the ground-based melee monsters first, the Wizzrobes' incessant ranged attacks were equally frustrating.

But in such situations, using a Korok Leaf could easily knock the Wizzrobes to the ground, allowing for opportunistic attacks.

Beyond these intricate details, the game's portrayal of its story and characters also left some players deeply moved.

Based on the Old King's narration at the beginning in the Great Plateau Tower, it seemed like a cliché story of a Hero rescuing a Princess.

In fact, as many players continued playing, they even forgot about the Princess entirely.

Yet, delving deeper into the game, the four Champion's Villages, each with different styles and locations, and the four Champions who had died and transformed into Spirits, left an indelible impression on players.

The Divine Beasts in the game didn't have a fixed order for defeat. However, after numerous strategy guide videos were released, most players' first destination became a place called Zora's Domain.

This wasn't because it was close to the newbie village, Kakariko Village, but because of one of the Four Champions — Mipha.

The Water Divine Beast, Vah Ruta, which had been dormant for a century, had recently reawakened there. Due to the Divine Beast's innate supernatural ability to create 'water,' it was now uncontrollably generating massive amounts of 'water' from within.

This water caused continuous heavy rain in the Zora region, and the reservoir was overflowing, on the verge of bursting its banks.

Only shock arrows could incapacitate the Water Divine Beast, but the Zora tribe's fish-men feared the power of lightning above all else.

Thus, Zora Prince Sidon (Mipha's younger brother), inheriting Mipha's last wish, led the young Zoras. Disregarding the objections of the elders in their tribe, they sought out Hylians to help the Zora tribe overcome the crisis.

It was under these circumstances that Link arrived.

However, not everyone in Zora's Domain welcomed Link.

The young Zoras who had played with Link in their childhood were very fond of him.

But the warriors who had fought alongside Link lived in a century of regret over losing Mipha. Perhaps to escape their own powerlessness, or simply unable to accept Princess Mipha's death, they blamed Link for everything.

Princess Mipha, the Zora Princess, was a gentle healer who constantly treated wounded warriors on the front lines.

She was also a devoted princess who silently loved Link but ultimately couldn't express her affection.

She had healed Link's wounds multiple times when he was injured.

'No matter how many times, no matter how serious the injury, I will… always protect you.'

'After our battle with Calamity Ganon is over, will you still come here to play with me, like when we were children?'

But Mipha and Link wouldn't meet again until a century later, and she could no longer play with him as before.

'Thank you. Thanks to you, my soul has been freed, and Vah Ruta has been reclaimed.'

'But… I don't think I can… play with you like before.'

Mipha, in her spirit form, slowly walked towards Link.

'My healing power is the same; I am now a spirit.'

'I can no longer use that power…'

'So, I want to pass this power on to you… my power… Mipha's Grace.'

'Until yesterday, I was still crying… because I had become a spirit, trapped here… the thought of being alone forever from now on… But today, you risked your life to save me, and I saw you again.'

'And from now on, my power will also lend you a hand.'

'So… I'm fine now.'

'Well then… I'm leaving.'

Finally, Link left the Water Divine Beast, and Mipha, in her spirit form, stood on the Divine Beast, looking at Zora's Domain in the distance.

'Father, are you well?'

'I never listened to your advice, and I worried you sick for me… If I could… I wish… I wish I could see you one more time.'

Watching Mipha's lonely back at the end, some emotional players even shed tears uncontrollably.

And after their sadness, these players erupted in indignation.

They flocked to Mr. Chen's official Weibo account to leave comments.

They had thought this was just an ordinary story about defeating a Demon King, as lighthearted and joyful as Odyssey.

But damn it, they never expected that in a game like this, a fairy tale world, you could hide a knife!

The Warrior of Love never forgets his original intention, does he?

You're too good, Mr. Chen!

Of course, in addition to the lovable Princess Mipha, the other three Champions were also full of personality.

Daruk, the hero of the Goron tribe, had witnessed Link's swordsmanship before Link became the Hero. Because Link had once saved his life and he had eaten the Goron Spice (rocks) Link gave him, they became sworn brothers.

Just like his massive physique, he was a big brother figure. Unlike Mipha, who gave Link healing power, Daruk would block all attacks for Link. Even after his death, he would still protect his brother's back.

Revali, on the other hand, was a massive tsundere. His relationship with Link wasn't good. While he acknowledged Link's abilities, he consistently believed he was the strongest, much like a child showing off an expensive toy. Revali never forgot to display his abilities at any moment, hoping Princess Zelda and the Hero would admit that he was the main force for destroying Ganon and saving the world.

However, despite this, when Calamity struck, he was able to grasp the bigger picture, abandoning personal honor and piloting the Wind Divine Beast to assist Link.

Upon meeting Link again, the tsundere Revali still refused to directly admit that Link was stronger than him.

Nevertheless, he eventually bestowed his most prized ability upon Link, and after Link was teleported away, he silently acknowledged Link. Even without wings, Link could reach the Wind Divine Beast; he truly was a Hero stronger than himself.

Then there was Urbosa, a heroic big sister who was an old acquaintance of Princess Zelda's mother and possessed formidable abilities.

But what left the players deeply impressed wasn't her cool finger snap.

It was Link, cross-dressing here.
