Chapter 352: My Teammates and I, 9000 Yuan! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

In the game, Song Ren, Zhang Yi, and Wang Han all had a very special experience.

In the previous Normal Mode, it was basically just "bang bang bang" shooting. You couldn't avoid fighting, after all, the map was only so big, and it was a shooting game; what else could you do besides shoot?

But the 'Warzone' gameplay gave Zhang Yi and the others a whole new understanding: you could completely avoid fighting.

The map was large enough, and in addition to health, each player could also install three armor plates. Sometimes, even if they were shot in the back, as long as there was cover nearby, they could instantly retreat behind it instead of being instantly killed, which added some margin for error.

And at this point, if the surrounding terrain was complex enough, they could completely escape.

At the same time, the game's content was rich enough, not to mention vehicles for now.

For example, RPGs, Claymores, Flashbangs, Incendiary grenades, frag grenades, and UAV drones – there were all sorts of weapon elements.

Next was the store system: armor plate bundles, gas masks, UAVs, Cluster Bombs, and Precision Airstrikes. All were very interesting.

Especially the UAV. Unlike in Normal Mode, in Warzone, you could directly buy it with money. After using it, all nearby enemies would be marked, though not in real-time. And it couldn't mark enemies equipped with the red perk 'Ghost (perk)'. Of course, if two UAVs were used simultaneously to enhance it, then it could still detect them.

Besides that, the game also had a Heartbeat Sensor device, similar to a small radar, which could detect enemies within a certain range. This offered a completely different experience from Normal Mode.

As for the money to buy items, it was distributed across the game map, with money in crates being more plentiful than scattered cash. Of course, the most effective method was to pick up contracts and complete some missions.

"How much money do you guys have? I have 3000," Song Ren said, looking at the money he had.

"I have 2100 here."

"1600."

Wang Han and Zhang Yi each checked their money and replied.

"I remember a Loadout Drop marker costs 6000 Yuan. If we pool our money, it's just enough," Song Ren suggested. This was because the best fully-equipped red-tier weapons came from Loadout Drops. Although there were orange-tier weapons on the map, they relied too much on luck and might not be what they wanted. Unlike a Loadout Drop, where they could directly select their preset weapons.

"No problem." Nodding, Zhang Yi and Wang Han threw all their money to Song Ren. Their position was around the TV station, and from the mini-map, there happened to be a shopping cart icon nearby.

Without hesitation, Song Ren bought a Loadout Drop marker and threw it onto an open space nearby. A moment later, a huge equipment crate fell from the sky, emitting red smoke.

"Perfect!" After swapping his White-tier M13 for his Pink M4A1, Song Ren felt almost invincible.

"Exactly!"

"Number one sniper is in position!"

Song Ren toyed with the Pink M4A1 in his hand, then turned to look at the weapons in Zhang Yi and Wang Han's hands. He fell into a moment of silence. A Kar98K and an AX-50. One heavy sniper rifle, one single-shot rifle.

*Bang bang bang!* 

Just as Song Ren was about to say something, a burst of bullets suddenly swept over. From a rooftop in the distance, a person with an assault rifle was spraying bullets at them. However, due to the distance and the opponent's rather poor marksmanship, they only managed to take down two layers of Song Ren's armor plates.

"Cover! Find cover!" Song Ren, holding his M4A1, immediately ran towards the nearest cover, not staying to retaliate. The main reason was that the distance was too far, and he wasn't confident he could kill the opponent. Plus, it was only one person, and he didn't know where their teammates were.

Hiding inside a small house nearby, a fresh volley of bullets immediately swept over, indicating the opponent had reloaded.

"Don't be scared, watch my big sniper work its magic! I don't even know who this assault rifle is suppressing!" Zhang Yi, full of confidence, peeked out from cover, ready to deliver a harsh blow. Song Ren also used his M4A1 to spray at the opponent, helping Zhang Yi draw attention.

The opponent, suppressed by Song Ren's firepower, retreated behind cover. By this time, Zhang Yi's sniper rifle was aimed, just waiting for the opponent to show their head. But just as Song Ren was about to discuss tactics—whether to fight or run—a glint of light in the distance suddenly stung his eyes. He froze for a moment, then realized: there was another sniper aiming at them!

"Old Zhang, get down, there's a sniper..." Song Ren quickly warned.

But before he could finish.

A *whoosh* sound. Zhang Yi collapsed directly to the ground beside him.

"Holy cow!" Zhang Yi was also shocked. The idiom 'The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind' applied here; someone else was aiming?

"It's okay, I'll save you." Song Ren ran to Zhang Yi, intending to revive him.

Unlike Normal Mode, in Warzone, players who are downed survive for a period. As long as they're not fully killed or bleed out, they can still be revived by teammates.

"No time! They have a Jeep, they're driving straight at us!" Wang Han, holding her Kar98K, fired two shots, nervously stating. Whether she hit anyone was unknown, but the gunshots were crisp.

"It's okay, there's still time, just one second left." Song Ren wasn't nervous. The moment the Jeep slammed into the wall and screeched to a halt, he had already revived Zhang Yi.

He quickly turned around and peeked out from cover. On the opposite side, three figures, likewise resembling Captain Price, Soap, and Ghost, appeared. With quick reflexes, Song Ren continuously sprayed bullets from his M4A1, instantly killing the player character of Captain Price, then fiercely sprayed at another person.

However, two fists were no match for four hands. Before he could kill the second person, he was already shot down.

"Killed one, the other is on very low health! Old Zhang, it's up to you guys!" Song Ren shouted loudly.

Ten seconds later, three more prisoners were added to the Gulag.

"Ah, just a little bit, just a little bit! The last one only needed one more shot, my secondary weapon was out of bullets, no time to switch to the pistol!" Zhang Yi's voice in the voice channel was full of regret.

"I traded one for one!" Wang Han stated that she had done all she could.

"So, next time, can we not use double sniper rifles?" Song Ren said speechlessly.

Before the fight, he never expected that he would be the main strength.

"No problem, Old Song, you're our commander. Next time, if you say one, we won't say two; if you say charge, we won't retreat half a step," Zhang Yi promised.

"Enough talk, let's win the Gulag fight first. The circle isn't small yet, there's still a chance for us to make a comeback!" Song Ren sighed.

"This Gulag setup is pretty good. Even after dying, you can make a comeback, giving us a chance for revenge!" Zhang Yi praised.

"Exactly, this Gulag setup is very humane!" Wang Han also nodded.

Soon, the first Gulag match began. Song Ren took the lead, with Wang Han and Zhang Yi on the second floor helping him call out enemy positions. He used a revolver, calmly listening for footsteps, then peeked out and squeezed the trigger, unleashing bullets.

"I'm out of jail first, you two keep it up!" With his first Gulag victory, a 'King of the Gulag' prompt appeared in the upper left corner of Song Ren's screen.

Suddenly, Song Ren's mood brightened. That's right, he was the King of the Gulag! Could a mere Gulag stop him?

Parachuting back into the game from a plane, the circle was still quite large. This time his drop point was near the farm. It had clearly been looted, as the doors and windows were open, but luckily, there were still some unwanted White-tier weapons on the ground.

Just then, Zhang Yi's voice came through the voice channel: "Old Song, I've failed your expectations! 4500 Yuan, hang in there, I can still live!"

The next second, Wang Han's voice also rang out: "Old Song, and me, 9000 Yuan, it's all up to you!"

Standing still, Song Ren fell into a moment of silence, looking at the 300 Yuan in the bottom right corner. He silently pulled a frag grenade from his pocket and threw it at his feet.

A brother worth 4500 Yuan, he could still manage. But a brother worth 9000 Yuan, he felt it was better to join them. This burden was too heavy; he couldn't bear it!
