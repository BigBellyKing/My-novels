Chapter 221: Absolutely Mind-Boggling! (Sixth update, requesting subscriptions, monthly passes)

After two consecutive official Weibo account videos, many players had already guessed that this was Nebula Games' special promotional strategy for Minecraft.

Players who had previously built houses in the game, spurred on by the 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' and 'Forbidden City' videos, were even more restless, unable to focus on food or drink.

Their minds churned with all sorts of operations, wishing they could immediately dive into the game world and experience it.

Although many players knew in their hearts that achieving projects on the scale of 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' and 'Forbidden City' might be a bit of a stretch for them alone.

But surely some slightly simpler projects would be within their grasp, right?

In that instant, many players who had previously built matchbox houses had completely forgotten their past experiences.

Their minds were filled with images of magnificent structures.

It was like playing Dark Souls; even though they had just been thrashed by Gundyr the Ash in the game, seeing other veteran players defeat the Nameless King without taking damage suddenly made them feel capable again.

They felt as if they had learned a lot, thinking that while they might not be able to defeat the Nameless King, going back to fight Gundyr the Ash should be no problem at all.

This was the psychological activity of most players at this very moment.

As for the many designers in China, they too were marveling at this wave of promotion for Minecraft.

Clearly, the recent popularity had also shocked them.

"This move by Chen Xu is truly amazing! He's made Minecraft's promotion so unique and creative!"

"Yeah, I never imagined this game could be so stunning. An 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' and a 'Forbidden City' – absolutely awesome!"

"The key is that everything in these videos seems achievable by players themselves."

"And this promotion has even broken out of its niche."

"No choice, it's mainly positive and uplifting, and the art style of the game itself is very harmonious. Although it involves fighting monsters, it's very cartoon-like."

"But no matter what, it's still a block-building game, so it's hard for much to change, right?"

"Indeed, no matter what, it's still a block-building game."

"Stop talking nonsense, quick, check Chen Xu's official Weibo account! Holy cow! Minecraft can actually be played like this? I'm thoroughly impressed!"

"What's going on?"

Similarly, three days after the 'Forbidden City' video, Chen Xu once again released an official Weibo post.

Many players were incredibly excited. Over the past two days, numerous players had been discussing whether there would be new promotional videos.

Or what stunning scenes the new promotional video might bring.

All sorts of guesses emerged, such as the existing Classical Gardens of Suzhou, the ruined Old Summer Palace, and the fantastical Lothric Castle.

All had been suggested by players.

And this time, they finally welcomed another new video.

They also discovered a pattern.

Namely, a video was released every three days.

Calculating the time, it seemed like this pace was intended to continue updating until the game's official release date?

However, when players eagerly clicked on Chen Xu's official Weibo post and video, many revealed bewildered expressions.

Because this third video was completely different from the previous 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' and 'Forbidden City.'

The video's title was very simple: How to play 'To Liva' on the piano in Minecraft.

Seeing the video title, many players were taken aback.

Wasn't it about building houses, building ancient cities?

How did this turn into a piano concert?

But after entering the game, countless players were bewildered!

"Holy cow, what did I just see!?"

"Damn it, this can be played like this too?"

"Wait! Isn't this a block-building game?"

"Did they update content?"

"Please don't tell me this is actual in-game sound, not something added later!"

Countless players watched the video footage, a bit dumbfounded.

Previously, whether it was the Forbidden City or Along the River During the Qingming Festival, many players felt shocked.

But they could also mentally visualize and imagine that those structures were built by themselves.

But what about this video now?

All the players were dumbfounded.

Inside the video was a massive piano constructed from blocks, complete with 88 black and white keys, a piano case, pedals, a soundboard, strings, and a hammer action mechanism.

While its appearance was impressive, it wasn't as astonishing as the previous "Along the River During the Qingming Festival" and "Forbidden City" videos.

But the most crucial point was that this thing moved!

And it genuinely produced sound.

As 'To Liva' began to play, the black and white keys constantly moved. Simultaneously, the camera slowly shifted to the piano's interior, showing the piano's dampers continually jumping and the hammer action mechanism beneath the strings striking them.

It wasn't just the players who were astonished.

This time, game designers in the industry were equally stunned.

What's going on?

Isn't this a block-building game?

How can it also make a piano!

And even produce sound in the game!?

Many game designers were completely bewildered.

They had absolutely no idea that Minecraft could be played like this.

Especially those players who had already experienced the game for five days were now filled with doubt, hurriedly opening the Nebula Games Platform to double-check.

That's right!

I didn't buy the wrong game either!

So why was this video completely different from their own in-game experience?

What was the principle behind this?!

However, some more in-depth hardcore players and grinders did figure out a few insights.

It seemed like this was utilizing Redstone technology within the game?

Many players had also discovered these elements in the game's Creative Mode before.

However, not many players paid attention, or rather, hadn't quite figured it out, only knowing that these things could be used to create some switches in the game.

But now it seemed there was far more to it!

As for ordinary media outlets, they weren't too concerned about what kind of game Minecraft actually was.

But the fact that a game previously recreated 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' and the 'Forbidden City' had already drawn attention from several non-gaming media outlets.

This time, even many gaming media outlets were astonished.

A piano built in-game that could also produce sound.

How rare was that!

So these media outlets quickly reposted, with headlines more attention-grabbing than the last.

'A young man, unable to afford a piano, built one in-game!'

'Have you seen a pixel-style piano? Turns out it's…'

Each one was an old marketing account.

Nevertheless, it indirectly boosted Minecraft's popularity.

And for players who had been following the game, it could be said that Minecraft had completely redefined their perception of games.

Just by watching these videos, they genuinely couldn't believe that these creations were made within the very game they had previously played.

At the same time, many players also developed greater anticipation and curiosity for subsequent videos.

Namely, did this game have even more astonishing things to offer?
