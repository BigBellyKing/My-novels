Chapter 216: How Can You Build a Beautiful House Without Materials? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Hearing Zhang Yi's words, Wang Han, who was sitting there eating duck leg rice, glared at him.

What kind of talk is that?!

Why is it embarrassing?!

What's wrong with the name 'Construction Master'?

People always need to have hope!

Besides, it might be a bit ugly, but it's a house, isn't it?

"Hmph, don't talk about me. I think if it were you, it wouldn't be any better. This game looks simple, but it's actually quite difficult. Just mentally visualizing the structure of a house will be a bit of a struggle for you," Wang Han said defiantly to Zhang Yi.

This was Wang Han's most intuitive feeling.

Currently, she hadn't experienced much of the game's content.

But just building houses, she felt she could play for a long time.

Moreover, although the game's controls weren't very complicated, the promotional trailer she saw earlier on Chen Xu's official Weibo account showed houses and castles that were beautiful.

However, it was only when she personally tried to build a house that she truly felt the difficulty.

Because there were no reference objects, she couldn't simply copy what she saw.

Building a house purely based on mental visualization in her mind truly turned out to be quite difficult.

Especially when visualizing a house in her mind, she would unconsciously associate it with real-world houses.

But the crucial point was that in the game, everything was constructed with these cubes. When there were discrepancies with what she imagined, she could only use her experience to choose blocks as substitutes.

So, as she kept substituting, it ended up looking completely different from the image in her mind.

"I understand!" Wang Han exclaimed, clapping her hands with a look of sudden realization as she cleared away the finished roast duck rice from the table.

"What did you understand?" Zhang Yi, sitting in Wang Han's seat, looked bewildered.

While Wang Han was eating, he had also taken her seat to experience the gameplay of *Minecraft*.

Although he hadn't watched any new player tutorials like Wang Han, he already understood some basic operations. He had just crafted a stone hoe and was about to go look for coal to dig up two pieces for torches when Wang Han's shout startled him.

"Hmph! Why did I construct a building with such a peculiar shape?" Wang Han asked Zhang Yi.

Hearing this, Zhang Yi couldn't help but inwardly complain.

That prison just now, could it even be called peculiarly shaped?

It was ugly! And ridiculously ugly at that!

Of course, he certainly wouldn't voice this inner thought, merely adopting an attentive posture.

"As the saying goes! A clever housewife cannot cook without rice."

"Of course, while I might not have reached the title of 'Construction Master' yet, I believe my abilities are not limited to this. The real reason I built *that* house was simply a lack of materials, which is why I couldn't build it in the style I wanted!" The more Wang Han spoke, the more confident she became.

Looking at the 'prison house' built of wood before her, Wang Han had to admit one thing: the house was indeed quite ugly.

And she began to ponder in her heart. After all, she had only used wood throughout; how could she build a beautiful house with just that?

If she had more materials, the room would definitely be much prettier!

As the saying goes, a clever housewife cannot cook without rice.

The same applies to building a house.

Without good raw materials, how can you build a beautiful house?

Therefore, Wang Han directly exited the game, then looked at the save seed named 'Construction Master World' and immediately chose to delete it.

It was a bit of a dark history.

So, Wang Han started by selecting Creative Mode and gave her character a new name: Ziqing.

"What kind of bizarre name is that? Not 'Construction Master' anymore?" Zhang Yi, sitting beside her, asked curiously, looking at Wang Han's new name.

"Hmph, haven't you heard the idiom 'superb craftsmanship'? Ziqing is the protagonist of that idiom," Wang Han huffed, explaining the origin of her chosen name.

Zhang Yi took a sip of water and remained silent.

What the house would actually look like was still unknown; the only reference point was the previous 'prison darkroom'.

But as for the name, it was quite elaborate.

Ziqing, and superb craftsmanship, I'd like to see what you can build.

Zhang Yi sat beside her, staring at the computer screen, ready to see what astonishing structure Wang Han would create.

"The things in Creative Mode are so abundant!" Wang Han exclaimed, her face full of surprise upon entering the game.

Compared to Survival Mode, where you start with nothing, Creative Mode was completely different.

Not only could she freely control her character to fly and build structures more freely.

A crucial point was that destroying things only took one hit, and she had infinite resources.

Even more importantly, she could summon all sorts of materials, most of which she had never seen before.

All kinds of glass, doors and windows, carpets, and so on, everything was readily available.

Seeing these materials, Wang Han felt completely invigorated, filled with an inexplicable confidence.

"You think I'm bad at building houses, right? Let me show you what my skills are really like," Wang Han thought, recalling Zhang Yi's words, and her expression became serious and focused.

From now on, she was going to prove herself.

Prove that the previous 'prison house' was absolutely just an accident.

Looking at the various materials in her inventory, Wang Han quickly chose a picturesque spot, leveraging her ability to fly.

First, she laid the foundation as before. This time, with materials available, Wang Han felt she could be a bit more extravagant.

She decided to build a larger residence.

She first filled the ground completely with stone blocks, and then various wondrous buildings she had seen during her travels appeared in Wang Han's mind.

She selected building materials and stacked eight pillars.

Then, she began building walls around these pillars, using them as load-bearing supports.

Wang Han meticulously refined the structure around the foundation.

She laid down some carpets and various miscellaneous items on the ground.

At the same time, Wang Han also discovered a very magical block, a block called Glowstone.

It could even emit a very bright light, directly replacing the function of torches.

Glancing at the unfinished roof, she decided to cap it directly with Glowstone.

This way, it would remain sparkly throughout.

Glass, diamond ore, emeralds—in short, anything Wang Han felt was beautiful, she used.

About fifteen minutes later, Wang Han felt she was nearly done building. She stepped back to admire her work, but in the next moment, she fell silent.

The house before her... it was just strange.

While building it, Wang Han's mind had envisioned something magnificent and grand.

But as she kept building and then looked at the actual product, she couldn't tell where she went wrong.

In any case, it had unconsciously become completely different from what she had imagined.

It felt a little unfamiliar.

Although it was clearly shaped like a house, it looked strange no matter how she viewed it.

It was perfectly square, appearing very orderly.

The material in front of the door resembled marble, with glass replacing the walls, creating a transparent appearance.

The ceiling was entirely composed of Glowstone, sparkling brightly.

The entire structure of the house, Wang Han had based on the symmetrical design of the Forbidden City.

At the entrance, she had even deliberately built a rather long flight of steps, dug a water channel filled with water, and laid a wooden plank bridge.

But her ideas were great, yet just like the difference between a concept drawing and the actual building, the gap from her mental image was too vast!

The Glowstone sparkled, but a ceiling made of so much Glowstone looked strange no matter how she viewed it.

And the water channel at the entrance, according to her inner vision, should have evoked the artistic conception of 'a small bridge over a flowing stream, with homes nearby', but now it felt more like a sewer.
