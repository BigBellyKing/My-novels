Chapter 476: Once I Wash My Hands, I'll Slaughter You! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

“So, the culprit behind everything is this Evelyn!?” Zhang Yi sat in front of his computer, deep in thought.

“Yeah! Who would have thought! The story of Resident Evil is like this,” Wang Han next to him remarked with some emotion.

Because the game had two versions, Zhang Yi hadn't played the VR version.

As for why? Of course, he was scared!

Moreover, the VR version had a significant drawback: you could only face the unknown horrors alone. Unlike the PC version, where two people could play together—that was its biggest advantage!

Initially, Zhang Yi was quite scared, but as he played on, taking down the One-Punch Man father-in-law, the bug-loving mother-in-law, and the mechanism-expert brother-in-law, and successfully creating a serum for his wife Mia, he felt the game's fear factor rapidly diminish.

More and more weapons and equipment made him feel like the game had become an FPS game.

After all, as is well-known, fear comes from insufficient firepower. With ample firepower, there wasn't much to be scared of. He even found it quite enjoyable.

And playing up to this point, with all the events along the way and the notes and recordings collected, he, who was initially confused about the entire game's story, finally understood what was going on.

The Baker family, who fought Ethan along the way, weren't actually that strange.

Jack Baker, the One-Punch Man father-in-law, was truly an honest, hardworking old farmer. Three years ago, Jack, the head of the family, heard that a large ship seemed to have been shipwrecked by the sea, so he ran out early in the morning to see if he could help. There, he found Mia and a ten-year-old girl, Evelyn.

Mia was in very bad shape at the time, her mind somewhat unclear. So, the kind Jack Baker and his wife decided to temporarily take in and help Mia and Evelyn.

But things weren't that simple, because Mia wasn't a nanny as she initially told Ethan. Her true identity was a special agent for a large company, and Evelyn wasn't a little girl but a biological weapon experiment created by that company.

The shipwrecked large ship was the one Mia and the company used to transport Evelyn. The shipwreck itself was also orchestrated by Evelyn. She deeply infected the crew on board, created chaos and explosions, and successfully escaped with Mia.

As for why she didn't kill Mia, it was because she had an obsession from being experimented on as a biological weapon since childhood: she wanted a home and to feel its warmth. Mia was the mother she chose. After being taken in by the Baker family, she controlled them and made them kidnap passersby to form a family.

Anyone infected by Evelyn would fall under her control, which is why Ethan could feel Mia, and even old Jack, having moments of lucidity during their battles. Simultaneously, after Ethan arrived, Evelyn knew that Ethan was the father she wanted. After all, Ethan and Mia were a couple—this was an original family, not a reconstructed one!

So Evelyn wanted to control Ethan and infect him.

“I wonder if Mia can be successfully rescued in the end! Please don't let it be like the Assassin's Creed game before,” Zhang Yi worried a little at this point.

He had been terrified by Mia at first, but as the plot progressed and various weapons and the truth of the events were revealed, he didn't feel much fear anymore. Especially during the previous cabin level, Mia resisted Evelyn's control, forcibly rescued Ethan from the mycelium, gave him the virus serum that could end everything, and then locked herself in the cabin to avoid harming Ethan again.

Mia was frenzied at the time, but she fought Evelyn for control of her body with her rationality, shouting, 'I love you, Ethan, run!' This made Zhang Yi fully feel the emotional bond between Ethan and Mia.

But it was precisely this situation that made Zhang Yi worry. He wasn't afraid of weak bonds; he was afraid of bonds that were too deep, prompting a certain designer to ruthlessly kill them off!

“It shouldn't be, right? The players have already been scared so badly,” Wang Han said, also a bit apprehensive.

“You can't really say for sure. After all, later on, it felt like an FPS game, and I think the scariest part wasn't encountering any monsters, but not having enough inventory slots,” Zhang Yi pondered.

This was his honest thought, at least when he played the PC version. The feeling of not being able to take everything, having to leave something behind, was truly terrifying. It even made Zhang Yi feel at one point that this wasn't Resident Evil, but Inventory Crisis.

He re-examined his equipment, made some choices, and picked up the bullets.

Zhang Yi embarked on his final journey, following the mission's guidance deep into the mine, killing various mutated fungal beasts along the way. The most disgusting ones for Zhang Yi were the two fat ones; not only did they spit goo, but their health bars were incredibly thick. It took him a long time to kill them.

But at this point, these monsters no longer scared Zhang Yi. The weapons and ammunition on his person gave him endless confidence. After killing the fat fungal beasts, he traversed the intricate mine and pushed aside the wooden planks blocking the path.

Behind the planks was a small room. The first thing that caught his eye was Evelyn's wheelchair. Due to being an experiment, Evelyn's body would age 25 times faster if not treated. The old woman in the wheelchair when Ethan and the family were happily eating was Evelyn, but at this point, Zhang Yi no longer cared about that.

However, a doll caught his attention.

“Hey! This doll! Isn't this the basement from when I first started the game?!” Zhang Yi recalled. He had initially played it in VR, but after Mia's domestic violence, he switched from VR to the PC platform, so he hadn't recognized it immediately. Had he just come full circle? The place where the dream began?

Just then, Ethan seemed to experience some hallucinations. Mia's figure stood there, pulling at her hair and screaming in崩溃: “It's here! It's here! I couldn't be mistaken!”

This was the scene where Mia couldn't find her way back then. Seeing this, Zhang Yi felt a little excited. It was like playing Dark Souls for the first time, getting beaten by Teacher Gundyr repeatedly, but then on higher New Game+ cycles, with all buffs maxed out, pulling out Gundyr's Coiled Sword and jointly thrashing him so that he collapsed before even finishing his second phase or cutscene. Then, casually remarking: 'It is well-known that Gundyr the Ash has no second phase.'

The current Ethan was no longer the Ethan who had arrived with just wire cutters and a flashlight!

Standing in the basement room, Zhang Yi took out his 'hand sanitizer' to wash his hands.

At this moment, Zhang Yi could also feel that Ethan was somewhat abnormal. Leaving everything else aside, if handwashing was a game mechanic, then his severed hand being stapled back together by his sister-in-law, receiving a smartwatch, and the hallucinations he was experiencing clearly indicated that Ethan had also been infected.

But what did that matter?

“Evelyn? Once I wash my hands, I'll slaughter you!”
