Chapter 217: Quite Grim (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Just as Wang Han was looking at her own construction, feeling a bit doubtful about life.

The nearby Zhang Yi finally spoke.

"Don't be discouraged, at least it looks like a house. If I'm not mistaken, you must have referenced the design of the ancient Roman Pantheon when you built it."
"The eight huge columns at the front of the portico, coupled with the gilded dome, and how great artists and emperors like Raphael and Victor Emmanuel II are buried here, along with legends of gods and heroes like the God of War and Julius Caesar also interred here."
Zhang Yi sighed, looking at the building in the game.

"You could tell?" Wang Han was a bit bewildered by Zhang Yi's words.
Was she referencing the Pantheon?
She didn't even know it herself!
Besides, she had never even seen what the Pantheon looked like.

"I didn't 'see' it, I guessed it. After all, your building aligns well with the concept of the Pantheon," Zhang Yi said.

"Are you saying I have a talent for this?" Wang Han still didn't quite grasp Zhang Yi's meaning.

"No, I'm saying your house is quite grim, just like the Pantheon. After all, a house is only a temporary dwelling; a small box is an eternal home. Whether it's the Pantheon or a black box, they all lead to the same destination."
"Moreover, it's a 'supernatural feat of craftsmanship' – though the 'supernatural' part isn't visible yet, the 'feat of craftsmanship' is spot on. Keep it up, you still have room for improvement." Zhang Yi's face was full of smiles.

Listening to Zhang Yi's words, if reality had a comic book art style, Wang Han would currently have a row of black lines above her head, with a crow flying over her, trailing six dots.

Glancing at the incongruous house she had built on the screen, then looking at Zhang Yi, who was grinning like a sunflower in front of her, Wang Han finally uttered that classic line: "If you can do it, you go ahead!"

After watching for a while, he clearly felt that building a house was indeed not a simple matter, but given the challenge, Zhang Yi naturally accepted.

So, ten minutes later, Wang Han's cheerful laughter echoed from inside the room.

"Haha, I thought you could build some amazing house! We're both equally bad, the pot calling the kettle black!"

Seeing that Zhang Yi's construction methods were exactly like her own, Wang Han finally couldn't help but let out a joyful laugh.
She thought he was so impressive! But it turned out to be just this?

"Cough cough, building houses is just one gameplay aspect of Minecraft. Let's not talk about it. I'll start a new World Seed, and we can play Survival Mode together. We can also call Old Song and the others," Zhang Yi said, lightly coughing twice and changing the subject, looking at the house in front of him that resembled a big refrigerator.

In reality, this was a common experience for many players who had just started playing Minecraft.

Before buying, they didn't really know how Minecraft was played.
But one thing everyone knew was that in this game, you could build houses like stacking building blocks.

So, after most players entered the game, whether playing Survival Mode or Creative Mode, they didn't go out to explore the world.
Instead, they fully immersed themselves in their grand construction projects.

But soon, these players discovered a very important issue.
What they built was completely different from what they imagined.

To put it simply, it was — Brain: "I get it! So that's how it is!"
Hands: "Brain, what did you just say?"

The houses actually built always had a gap of about a gazillion points from what was imagined.

Although it had just launched, the relevant community forums were already flooded with various pictures, all of them players complaining about their own constructions.

Before building, they were full of grand ambitions, but after finishing, everyone discovered, "Well, this thing is just a dark room matchbox!"

At first, some players thought it might be due to insufficient materials in Survival Mode, but then in Creative Mode, everyone discovered that the houses they built were just as ugly as ever.

While waiting for Song Ren, Wang Yifan, and Joey, Wang Han and Zhang Yi were also scrolling through the forums on their phones.

Seeing those pictures, both of them chuckled with relief.

Because most of these house-building players were like them, creating square and regular houses.

At the same time, many players ran out of materials halfway through building, so they just used local resources, not caring if dirt and wood matched, they just dug and filled it in.

Of course, there were also some players whose methods Wang Han was very familiar with: where the person was, there the home was.
When it was light, they would chop trees, mine, and gather various materials; when night fell, they would simply lower their heads, take out their pickaxe, and start digging.
They'd dig a pit, then cover the top.

Of course, Wang Han found that these people were a bit more professional than her.
Because they would make a bed and a torch.
This way, they could immediately get through the night without it being too dark to see.

"This game makes building houses so hard!"
"Right! That trailer before, it couldn't have been a misleading trailer, could it?!"
Zhang Yi and Wang Han chatted, looking at the similar painful experiences of other players online.

"Not at all, building a house is actually quite simple, just need a concept," Song Ren said as he entered the voice channel while Zhang Yi and Wang Han were chatting.
As he spoke, he also sent a game screenshot in the voice channel.
A very beautiful small wooden two-story house appeared before everyone.

The entire second floor was suspended in the air. From a realistic perspective, this would definitely be a high-risk building.
Because it was only supported by a few columns, but in the game, that was obviously not an issue.
On the first floor, besides the main house, a spiraling staircase assembled around the central pillar led to the second floor, and a railed courtyard was also built.
From a distance, it looked absolutely beautiful.

"Holy cow! Old Song, this isn't an internet picture you found, is it?"
Seeing this house, Zhang Yi and Wang Han's eyes widened.
If it was just a first glance, it wouldn't be much; it would just seem decent.
But the key was that they had experienced their own "dark room matchbox" previously; compared to that, this was the difference between a bright moon and fireflies!

"Old Song is awesome!"
"Oh my god, Old Song, how did you build this house?"
At this moment, Joey and Wang Yifan also joined, and seeing the screenshot Song Ren sent, they too were astonished.
Clearly, they had also played Minecraft before and knew the difficulty of building houses.

"It's very simple! Isn't building a house just placing materials on the ground? How else would you build it?" Song Ren, on the other end of the computer, listened to the praises, his face full of smiles, saying something rather obnoxious.

Of course, he also had his special trick: building houses in Minecraft was similar to using building blocks.
So, he would find some houses suitable for construction in advance, then sketch them out, and based on their characteristics, divide them into block forms.
He didn't need to consider whether the area could actually be divided into blocks; it just needed to look roughly similar.
After all, this was for building in a game, not in reality.
Then, for each area, how many blocks were needed, whether to place them horizontally or vertically, he just followed the template like putting together a puzzle.
It was a bit troublesome, but to smoothly pull off this boast, he had specifically prepared the day before the game launched.

However, the next moment, his smile froze.

"Old Song, since you're so amazing at building houses, it looks like the important task of building our base can only be entrusted to you!" Zhang Yi's voice came through the voice channel.

"Exactly!"
"Old Song is awesome!"
"Chief Architect: Old Song!"
The other three echoed in agreement.

Listening to everyone's words, Song Ren hesitated, wanting to speak but holding back.
