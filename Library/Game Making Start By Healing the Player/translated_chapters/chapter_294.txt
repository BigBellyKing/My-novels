Jiedong in the group chat was a little helpless.

Actually, that Frost Armor Spider just now, although quite disgusting.
But now, recalling it after collecting himself, he felt that if he had truly played well, he wouldn't have been without a chance.
It was just that at the time, for some unknown reason, seeing this completely new tactic startled him, directly causing his operations to feel a bit rusty compared to before.
Ultimately, he directly lost that crucial skirmish.

Jiedong: "But Chen Xu really has something, I've never seen such a strong designer."
Satellite: "He's indeed amazing, but I feel it would have been better if Wolf Riders didn't get Wind Riders."
Jiedong: "That's all hindsight now. In your game, I even said it would have been better if you went for Far Seer!"
Shu Ben: "Honestly, the three of us weren't disgraced. We've proven through personal experience that the Orcs are not the 'version's chosen ones' (top-tier)."

The others in the group chat watched the three talking, all whispering amongst themselves.
How was it not the 'version's chosen ones'? It felt like after watching the three rounds just now, the Orcs were practically the 'version's grandchildren' (underpowered)!

"Honestly, Guashen should be up for the last round tonight, right?" someone in the group said.
"Exactly, the glory of my Orcs cannot fall here!" Shu Ben instigated.
"Guashen! Guashen! Guashen!" Satellite also sent messages in the group.

The main reason was that this group of pro gamers had been defeated by a designer, which genuinely felt a bit embarrassing.
The key was that everyone felt quite stifled, because during the games, they all felt their own mechanics were actually a bit better than Chen Xu's.
But the crucial point was that it hadn't reached the stage where raw mechanics were truly tested.
Essentially, they were directly crushed in the early stages.
And in that crushing phase, facing these novel tactics for the first time, none of them knew how to counter them.
By the time they roughly had an idea, they had essentially missed a golden opportunity and directly entered a disadvantageous phase.
If they were to play against Chen Xu's tactics again, everyone felt they could win.
But they didn't have the face for it.
Now, everyone turned their attention to Guadi.
Moreover, many people also wanted to see how Guadi would handle Chen Xu's tactics, which could serve as a good reference.

"You guys!" Guadi in the group chat was speechless, but at the same time, he felt a bit eager to play.


As for the official live streaming room, it was even livelier.
Countless bullet comments filled the screen as if it were a festival.
And Sun Yixie, at the commentary desk, wanted to laugh but held it in, his expression was simply incredible.

"What the heck, this isn't scientific!" Huang Donglai felt a doubt about himself at this moment. Was he truly cursed?
Whoever he rooted for, died!?
But he was clearly analyzing things very scientifically and rationally!
Why was this happening!?

"Brother Huang, the bullet comments are all saying you're jinxing it well!" Sun Yixie said from the side.

"Damn it! Stop jinxing everything, okay? We need to believe in science! Mr. Chen is indeed very strong, but he also made mistakes during the games, and to be honest, Mr. Chen's fundamentals are indeed not as good as a professional player's!" Huang Donglai defended himself, and even, somewhat agitated, he blurted out a couple of catchphrases.

"Brother Huang, you're still rooting for the pro players!?" Sun Yixie probed quietly, enticing him.

"I've already received the news, okay? The last player to go on stage is Guadi! He's currently the strongest Orc player, and Mr. Chen's previous tactics have all been used. What reason do I have to believe Mr. Chen can win?" Although there had already been three victims, Huang Donglai never changed his opinion, because he was a professional commentator.

Others could question him, but he couldn't question himself; he believed in his own judgment.

"Brother Huang, it's not that I don't believe your judgment. I just think Mr. Chen's performance today has genuinely impressed me, the professional players, and the audience." Sun Yixie said with a very sincere tone.

"Regarding the balance of 'Warcraft', I don't think anyone should have any doubts, because Mr. Chen's skill level is evident. If Mr. Chen were a noob, you could certainly say he doesn't understand, but now it's clear Mr. Chen himself is a powerful player who deeply understands the balance of each race in the game."

"As the saying goes, even a good horse may stumble, and even a wise man may err. Guadi is strong, that's true, but frankly, Mr. Chen is not weak. Brother Huang, won't you reconsider?" Sun Yixie revealed his true intention.

"No need to reconsider. I firmly believe in my opinion. Guadi is invincible, okay? Don't you favor Guadi?" Huang Donglai countered.

"To be honest, compared to Mr. Chen, I definitely favor Guadi more. After all, Mr. Chen basically played all three races today, and Guadi probably watched all of them, so I think Mr. Chen might have some trouble in the last game." Sun Yixie, at this moment, still stood by his good brother.

"Exactly! We commentators have to talk science! Don't always believe in superstitious beliefs. I refuse to believe Mr. Chen can still hide tactics and defeat Guadi; that's impossible!" Huang Donglai said.

"Oh, don't talk anymore! If Mr. Chen can defeat Guadi, Brother Huang and I will shave our heads to celebrate." Sun Yixie said, looking at the diverse bullet comments in the live stream room.

"That's right, if Mr. Chen wins, we'll shave our heads, but that's impossible!" Huang Donglai said.


Completely unaware that someone had already made a "flag" to shave their head based on his victory or defeat, Chen Xu now felt his condition was unprecedentedly good.
At the same time, he felt a surge of surprise.
The commentators still didn't favor him?
He originally thought that after defeating one or two pro gamers, the commentators might start leaning towards him. He clearly felt this in the third game, which was why he won quite precariously.
Moreover, his opponent in the third game was weaker than those in the first and second, and luckily, at the crucial moment, he once again felt that mysterious power; otherwise, he actually should have lost that round.
And now, they still didn't favor him?
Even though this opponent named Guadian was indeed very formidable.

On the live streaming website's bullet comments, the spectators were also excited.

"Here they come, here they come, I wonder if Mr. Chen can beat Guadian!"
"It's not impossible!"
"Anyway, I hope Mr. Chen wins, that would be totally awesome!"
"I'd rather see those two shave their heads bald!"

"Huh, why did Mr. Chen pick Night Elves on this map, CH (Hidden Valley)? Is he going for that expanding strategy? But this map is too small, isn't it? Won't he be found immediately before Tier 2 tech is fully developed?"
Many knowledgeable players in the live stream room were a little taken aback.

One characteristic of this map was its relatively narrow terrain, which wasn't friendly for large late-game armies clashing in groups.
But the crucial point was that the Orcs' power spike wasn't very late. After reaching Tier 2, with the high mobility and Ensnare of Wolf Riders, and whether going for the AOE-burst Tauren Chieftain or the control and healing Shaman as the second hero, both were very effective against squishy Night Elves.
And the most critical point was that Chen Xu's previous expanding strategy was basically very difficult to execute effectively on this map.

Huang Donglai and Sun Yixie were also introducing the current situation on the field, after all, this concerned their hair.

"Mr. Chen's building construction, he built a straight line to block the entrance, preventing the opponent's starting Blademaster from coming to harass. The Ancient of War is still placed next to the neutral creep camp; after leveling up, it can return to block the entrance. But he only built one Archer and didn't choose a neutral hero, opting for the Demon Hunter as his starting hero instead?" Huang Donglai was a bit puzzled.

"This is a bit conventional, but also a bit unconventional!" Sun Yixie also expressed that he didn't quite understand it.

"However, Guadian is still very confident, directly adopting the default opening of Altar, Burrow, Barracks, and Shop." Sun Yixie continued.

"Hey, he directly trained on a nearby Fat Ogre, and luckily it dropped a Circlet of Nobility, giving +2 to all attributes, which is a very good item. But isn't he going to continue leveling? He's going straight to the neutral shop instead?"
