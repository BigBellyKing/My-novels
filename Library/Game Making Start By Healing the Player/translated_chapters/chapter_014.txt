# Chapter 14: Arrangements for the Next Game

*Mirror (Game)* is a hit, that's beyond doubt.

Of course, it's impossible for it to become a phenomenon or reach the level of a 3A masterpiece. But judging from the current trend *Mirror (Game)* has shown, it's highly likely to influence games in this category. Even the development of this specific genre.

In its previous life, *Mirror (Game)* actually led a trend in Gentleman's Games after its launch. During that period, almost all kinds of Gentleman's Games adopted the dual mode of Match-3 game + Galgame. Of course, the quality among them varied, with some excellent ones and some simply muddling through.

Historically, 18R Rating games, both to players and the Gaming Industry Professional, generally had one impression: low quality. Aside from specific elements, there was nothing worth boasting about. But *Mirror (Game)* was different.

The Match-3 game gameplay wasn't an original creation of *Mirror (Game)*, but *Mirror (Game)* implemented a corresponding combat and development system within it. Battle, then earn coins, and buy different skills and items. Besides that, the game's voice acting, character illustrations, and even its somewhat moving and thought-provoking story, all surprised people that this was actually an 18R Rating game!

Moreover, the game's rating consistently stayed around 9.2 points. Although the rating started to fluctuate a bit as sales grew, it remained very stable. This shows the game's popularity.

Furthermore, as a game with a not-very-long playthrough and only a few characters, it was possible for players to try it out for free and then refund it within the refund period. However, *Mirror (Game)* players rarely requested refunds.

Of course, this also related to *Mirror (Game)* only costing 10 yuan. So, no matter what, *Mirror (Game)* definitely became a hit.

Although due to the game's unique nature, mainstream media and channels were essentially unable to report on it. However, within the Gentleman's Game community, *Mirror (Game)* was undoubtedly the brightest star at the moment. Even within the Gentleman's Game player circles, many called it a groundbreaking Gentleman's Game.

Compared to other shoddily made Gentleman's Games, *Mirror (Game)* was undoubtedly the most dazzling star. Similarly, within the Gentleman's Game industry, *Mirror (Game)* also showed many Gentleman's Game designers a new direction.

So, Gentleman's Games could be made this way, and this type of game could actually generate such terrifying sales. The emergence of *Mirror (Game)* for the Gentleman's Game world was like a shining lighthouse of knowledge appearing on a dark sea. Like an oasis suddenly appearing in a scorching desert.

Clearly, *Mirror (Game)* was that lighthouse, that oasis. The powerful combat effectiveness of gentlemen was directly reflected in *Mirror (Game)*. Its sales grew day by day.

70,000 sales in the first week, accumulated 160,000 sales in the second week. As of two weeks after the game's launch, according to third-party sales data, *Mirror (Game)* had garnered 230,000 sales. For a Gentleman's Game, this was simply incredible. Even for some high-quality Independent Game, this sales volume would already be quite impressive.

Such a sales volume also drew the attention of many Independent Game producers in the gaming industry. After all, it was truly astonishing, even though the sales trend had already shifted from rising to falling. But this was merely a normal market pattern.

After all, *Mirror (Game)* was a relatively special game, meaning it could only spread within a small player community.

………………

Compared to the industry's surprise at *Mirror (Game)*'s performance, Chen Xu himself also analyzed why *Mirror (Game)* could achieve such excellent results. As a Game Producer, Chen Xu naturally wouldn't believe that a successful work from his previous life would necessarily succeed again if remade.

In fact, many games from his previous life that became popular had quite limited success factors. For example, if he were to create "Legend" from his previous life, Chen Xu believed there would only be one outcome. That is, it would be dead beyond resurrection; first, the graphics and art would have no advantage, the gameplay content would have no advantage, and the world view and plot would be nothing at all.

This was a game where its characteristics of the era clearly outweighed its game quality.

As for *Mirror (Game)*, in Chen Xu's view, its success was mainly due to differentiation. As an 18R Rating game, it offered a Galgame and Match-3 style game experience. While its content as a pure Match-3 style game and Galgame was clearly insufficient, it appeared before players as a Lewd Person game.

It was precisely these two differentiations that made *Mirror (Game)* successful. Just as players enjoy Lewd Person content in normal games, and building simulations in Lewd Person games.

Looking at the compiled sales figures, Chen Xu knew he had made the right choice. While he couldn't claim both fame and fortune, the "fame" aspect was limited, given it was an 18R Rating game. It mostly spread within the industry, and for most ordinary players, a 10 yuan 18R Rating game would likely go unnoticed by anyone but Lewd Persons.

In the future, Chen Xu had no plans to continue making this type of game; it was primarily for the initial accumulation of startup capital. The most crucial point was profit.

With a price of 10 yuan and nearly 230,000 units sold to date, after deducting taxes and platform commissions, the game's first-month revenue was roughly around 1.5 million yuan. Chen Xu stroked his chin and nodded gently.

Initial capital was secured, including the Job Title of Game Designer. By the end of the first week after *Mirror (Game)* launched, he had received official notification and went to the Game Department in Modu for registration. As for the Emotion Points from the system, Chen Xu wasn't particularly satisfied.

So far, he had only accumulated enough for one 7-consecutive Gashapon draw, which was over 700,000 points. However, thinking about it, it wasn't surprising; the true peak of players' emotions probably only lasted a minute or two. It might even be just a few dozen seconds; Chen Xu estimated the absolute maximum was no more than five minutes. In this situation... well, he understood.

Looking at the backend statistics of the Official Game Platform, Chen Xu leaned back on his sofa at home, contemplating the next direction. In Chen Xu's plan, the subsequent strategy would still primarily focus on single-player games that sold based on volume. One reason was for reputation, and the other was to continue his own development.

As for why he didn't choose pay-to-win games, the reason was simple. It wasn't because he feared a damaged reputation; in fact, if he were to really make one, there were many pay-to-win mobile games with relatively good reputations in his previous life. But after careful consideration, Chen Xu still gave up on the idea.

Primarily, it wasn't suitable for the current time, and the gaming environment in the Parallel World was also quite different from his previous life. In his previous life, mobile games largely dominated, with free-to-play + in-app purchases being the mainstream. But in the Parallel World, buy-to-play games held the larger share.

Furthermore, pay-to-win mobile games also had significant limitations. Taking card games as an example, they also went through several typical periods of development in his previous life.

First, games like "I Am MT", "Grandmaster", and "Million Arthur" brought card games widespread fame, then came "Dota Legend" which revolutionized card games, ushering in the action card game era.

Subsequently, "The King of Fighters '98 Ultimate Match OL" helped the then-dying SNK turn losses into profits, with its annual financial report showing a 6-fold increase, indirectly sparking a wave of IP Card Games. It was also during this stage that card games became diversified.

Later, titles like "Junior Three Kingdoms" which followed the traditional Numerical Design route, the refined "Onmyoji", and the IP-driven "FGO" were all typical examples.

In this world, Chen Xu also carefully researched the current card mobile games. Currently, their development lies between refinement and IP integration. A stable industrial scale chain has already formed.

For the current Nebula Games, entering this field would be less advantageous than self-developing new games. There were still two reasons: no money and no channels.

A game could be developed, but without sufficient promotion funds, if it couldn't become an instant hit upon launch, it would merely become a stepping stone for other game developers. After all, card games are entirely different from other games. Because their gameplay and numerical stimulation models are completely replicable.

If the Parallel World's mobile games and card games had similar concepts that were not yet fully mature, that would be good news for Chen Xu. But now? There were too many uncertainties.
