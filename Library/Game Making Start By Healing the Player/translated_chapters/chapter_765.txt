Chapter 764: The Truth of Silent Hill

Upon entering the first floor of the Lakeview Hotel, James saw a map in the elevator lobby. 

The rooms on the other floors were quite normal, but on Room 312, it was written: 'I've been waiting for you.'

This was the room James and Mary once stayed in. So, was Mary truly still alive?

Later, James also found a note at the counter.

It read: 'Mr. James, the videotape you forgot is stored in the 1st floor office.'

He then found the key to Room 312, and a fish-shaped key in the restaurant.

Just as Zhang Yi was about to control James to leave the restaurant, the piano in the corner of the restaurant suddenly made a sound.

In the previously dead silent restaurant, the sound of a piano suddenly rang out, startling Zhang Yi immensely.

He quickly turned to look in the direction of the sound, only to see Laura lying on the stool behind the piano.

“What the heck, it's you again, you little Brat!”

“You ask if I was scared? What do you think?!”

Looking at Laura, who walked out from behind the piano, Zhang Yi felt speechless.

Even though she didn't look particularly special.

But after the deaths of Eddie, and the resurrected-then-died-again Maria and Angela.

Zhang Yi genuinely felt a little traumatized by Laura.

Especially since every time this little girl appeared, it would usher in an eerie scenario.

In the apartment, she kicked the key on the floor, making him confront Triangle Head directly.

In the hospital, she locked him in a small room to play 'hug of love' with three monsters, and after escaping, he entered a bizarre world.

It was simply taking years off his life.

However, here, Laura didn't seem to be teasing James as before. Instead, she told him her story and gave James a letter from Mary.

'Dear Laura, I'm leaving this letter for Rachel to give to you after I'm gone.'

'Now... I'm going far away, to a quiet and beautiful place.'

'Please forgive my sudden departure, take care, Laura.'

'I know you hate James because you think he's not good to me, but please give him a chance. It's true he has a bad temper sometimes and doesn't smile much, but he's truly a good person deep down.'

'Laura... I love you as if you were my own. If it hadn't come to this, I would have adopted you.'

'Happy eighth birthday, Laura.'

Seeing this letter, James confirmed it was indeed written by Mary.

Also, from Laura's words, she did know Rachel, the nurse who took care of Mary at the time, and Laura was only eight years old.

At this moment, James was in confusion.

Because this meant Mary couldn't have died three years ago; she might even have been alive just a week ago.

Had Laura lied, or was the letter forged, or was there something wrong with his memory?

Was Mary really still alive? Was she really waiting for him here?

Slowly searching the Lakeview Hotel, Zhang Yi's mood was still relatively relaxed.

The overall atmosphere of the Lakeview Hotel was much better than before. Aside from the lingering deathly silence, there were no overly scary or oppressive monsters.

He found the videotape Maria and the note had mentioned earlier. James then followed the instructions and went to Room 312, where he and Mary had once stayed.

The room was very bright, and the furniture was neatly arranged.

The windowpanes and everything else were perfectly intact.

Other than the dust on the floor and tables, which proved the room hadn't been occupied for a long time, everything else was fine.

Through the window, he could see the dense white fog enveloping Silent Hill.

In front of the fireplace directly opposite, there was a television and a VCR, as well as a sofa placed sideways.

Controlling James, he walked forward, moved the sofa in front of the TV, and then inserted the videotape he had found earlier into the VCR.

Was Mary dead or not? What was going on with Silent Hill?

Zhang Yi had a premonition that everything would be explained in this videotape.

'Zzzzzt...'

Accompanied by static on the screen and a burst of electrical noise.

The content of the videotape was displayed on the black and white television.

'Are you recording again? Oh, don't...' 

On the television screen, a woman identical to Maria appeared. This was clearly James's wife, Mary.

However, unlike Maria, Mary's hair was tied up, and her expression wasn't as seductive.

Waving at the camera, Mary sat on the sofa by the window, gazing outside.

'I don't know why, but I just love it here.'

'It's so peaceful.'

Mary turned her head with a smile.

'Do you know what I heard?'

'This place used to be sacred... now we understand why.'

'It's a shame we have to leave...' 

'Promise me, you'll bring me back here again... *cough cough*.'

Mary's face held a smile and anticipation, but before she could finish speaking, she couldn't help but cough.

At the same time, the image on the TV suddenly became chaotic.

Different fragments intertwined and flashed.

He didn't know whether it was James's memory or the content of the videotape itself.

One moment it was Mary coughing, another it was Mary gazing out the window, and then it was Mary lying gravely ill in bed.

These different images intertwined and tangled, finally freezing on the scene of Mary lying in bed with James caring for her.

But the next moment, James stood up and blocked the camera.

The television screen became incredibly blurry, but through the模糊 image, one could vaguely see James pulling something off and pressing it towards Mary, who was lying in bed.

Then, after a burst of noise, only static remained on the television.

James sat blankly in front of the TV, head drooping, motionless, as if all his strength had been drained.

Only the rustling static from the TV echoed in his ears.

After a while, he heard footsteps. The little girl, Laura, ran over, pushed James, and asked if he had found Mary. If not, she suggested they go look for Mary together.

Slowly lifting his head, James looked at Laura in front of him.

“Mary's gone... Mary, she's dead.”

Laura shouted excitedly, “Liar! You're lying!”

“No, it's true...”

James shook his head.

Looking at James, Laura seemed disbelieving: “She... she's dead? Died of illness?”

“No...”

“I killed her.”

Even though he had guessed it in his heart, hearing James's words, Zhang Yi's eyes widened in the game.

Mary had already died, and James killed her?

What on earth was going on?

After confessing to killing Mary, Laura became furious with James, crying and hitting him.

James apologized to Laura guiltily, but Laura still left.

However, eerily, Mary's voice then came from the radio again, asking him to come see her quickly.

Was this Mary's ghost, or something else?

As he walked out of Room 312, the hotel was dilapidated, and blood kept dripping from the ceiling.

Just like the hospital before, James once again entered the Otherworld.

On the stairs, he encountered Angela. The stone stairs had turned into wooden ones.

Flames surrounded them, and Angela told James about the misfortunes she had experienced: her father, mother, and brother had never truly treated her as a person.

Just like this sea of fire, her life had always been this way, and so, in despair, Angela slowly walked into the flames.

Continuing onward, James reached the attic and saw Maria again.

This time, she was fixed upside down on an iron frame, being impaled by two Triangle Heads.

At this point, James and the players finally understood everything. Combining the previous encounters of Eddie, Angela, and James, a complete explanation had emerged.

These Triangle Heads were created by James to punish himself for his crimes.

Silent Hill, this land, has possessed incredible power since ancient times. It draws those with darkness in their hearts into an alternate dimension.

It materializes all the negative emotions within a person. So, the bizarre scenes James saw, the terrifying monsters, and all the experiences he had in Silent Hill were actually manifestations of his inner darkness.

That's why Angela, Eddie, and James could see all sorts of monsters, while the little girl Laura could walk freely in Silent Hill because she was just a child and didn't possess the same darkness as James and the others. To her, Silent Hill was just an ordinary town.
