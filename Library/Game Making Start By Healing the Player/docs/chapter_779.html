                <p>Chapter 778: Mythra is the Big Sister, Pyra is the Mom, I Love Nia and Everyone!</p>
<p>Although Vandham's heroic sacrifice, teaching Rex the understanding that one must have power to protect, brought a touch of sadness to the game, Song Ren's sadness only lasted for that one moment before his full attention was drawn to Pyra and Mythra.</p>
<p>After all, as a long-time veteran player of Nebula Games, he had seen similar plotlines many times. While Vandham's death did move him for a moment, considering the countless protagonists and supporting characters who had died in Nebula Games over the years—certainly dead ones like Arthur Morgan, Roach, and Soap; and uncertain ones like Ethan and Chen Qingsui—plus innumerable major and minor supporting characters, such as Mipha from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Ghost from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Song Ren's resistance to such plots was now very high. Instead, he was more concerned that, besides Pyra, the game now featured Mythra.</p>
<p>Unlike Pyra's gentle nature, Mythra was a complete tsundere. And during this part of the journey, she brought Song Ren a long-lost joy. The scene where Mythra sleepwalked into Rex's room and fell asleep made Song Ren want to give a big chicken leg to the cinematographer in Xenoblade Chronicles 2. Later, there was the much-anticipated hot spring scene. In this particular moment, Song Ren's gaze wasn't drawn to Mythra's stunning figure; instead, he was captivated by Poppi, fully armored and dog-paddling in the hot spring. Their two distinct personalities were truly double the fun.</p>
<p>Moreover, during their adventure, through the conversations between Grandpa Azurda, Mythra, and Pyra, some hidden plot points became apparent. Especially what happened during the Aegis War five hundred years ago, and how Jin, who seemed to have once been Mythra's companion, ended up with Malos. These were all points that made Song Ren quite curious.</p>
<p>For several days, Song Ren was immersed in the world of Xenoblade Chronicles 2. The adventure storyline completely met his expectations; it was a standard story-driven game. Chairman Bana, whom he had previously thought was a villain, truly was a big villain. And Zeke, who arrested them in Gormott Province and whose 'turtle head' comment near the factory left a deep impression on Nia, also turned out to be a teammate.</p>
<p>As the game's story progressed, these characters gradually joined the party. As for the maps, Song Ren couldn't help but sigh with emotion. From Gormott Province, like a tropical rainforest, to the dreamlike Kingdom of Uraya, the hot, retro-steampunk Mor Ardain, the Leftheria Archipelago located in the Cloud Sea, the religiously flavored Indoline Praetorium, and the snow-covered Tantal, the various diverse scenes left Song Ren utterly astonished.</p>
<p>At the same time, as a traditional RPG, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 was extremely time-consuming. Grinding Blade Affinity and farming various Core Crystals could take up a huge amount of a player's time. So far, he had only barely progressed to Chapter 6, mainly because he spent a lot of time exploring the game. Of course, the harvest was also considerable; his collection of Blades gradually increased. Besides the Blades obtained through the story, such as Perun, Dagas, and Mòrag's younger brother's Blade, Wulfric, he also drew several brand-new Blades from Core Crystals. He didn't know which ones were strong, but he knew which ones were beautiful. Strong Blades might not always be useful, but beautiful Blades were definitely worth focusing on training. Moreover, with the Mercenary Group unlocked, sending Blades out to complete various missions could also unlock their corresponding Affinity Rings. For Song Ren, he would remove any Blades other than Pyra and Mythra and send them to the Mercenary Group for training.</p>
<p>But now, he discovered a very serious problem.</p>
<p>“What the heck! This is a guy?!”</p>
<p>Staring at the Mercenary Group interface, Song Ren's eyes widened.</p>
<p>It was a mission to Gormott Province, requiring two Blades who use Launch Balls and two male Blades. But when he placed Floren, the cute girl Blade who had accompanied him all this way, as one of the Blades fulfilling the weapon condition, something terrifying happened.</p>
<p>Floren actually met both conditions simultaneously!</p>
<p>This meant that the cute girl he had always thought she was, was actually a cross-dresser!</p>
<p>Game description error?</p>
<p>Song Ren fell silent, looking at the Blade in the game. Risking potential spoilers, he tremblingly opened a video website and typed in “Xenoblade Chronicles 2” and “Floren”.</p>
<p>Song Ren successfully found the answer he was looking for.</p>
<p>In the final Affinity Ring unlock mission, a cheerful Floren waved with a smile: ‘Don't call me big sister, you should call me big brother instead!’</p>
<p>“Goodbye!” Song Ren looked at Floren in the Mercenary Group and quietly removed him.</p>
<p>No matter what, he didn't want to see this Blade anymore!</p>
<p>Mythra and Pyra were still the best!</p>
<p>Song Ren sighed, having completely lost the desire to train Blades.</p>
<p>What Affinity Rings?</p>
<p>No more!</p>
<p>Push the story, take my wives to Elysium!</p>
<p>Song Ren changed his previous mindset, but soon he had to face a harsh reality.</p>
<p>That was, in Chapter 6, Rex and the protagonist's party were ambushed by all members of Torna.</p>
<p>Even with the help of Tora, Mòrag, and Zeke, Rex, unable to unleash the full power of the Aegis, was easily defeated and crushed by Jin. Finally, Mythra transformed into Pyra's form, threatening suicide to make Jin spare Rex and the others, while she herself was taken away by Jin and Malos.</p>
<p>My wife was stolen!</p>
<p>Well... that wasn't the most crucial point. The most crucial point was that here, players also lost both Pyra and Mythra, the two Aegises.</p>
<p>His previous Affinity Rings were mainly unlocked for these two, and all the powerful Weapon Chips and Auxiliary Cores were also given to Pyra and Mythra. Now Song Ren was in a very awkward situation.</p>
<p>He had no damage output!</p>
<p>“Fine, cross-dresser it is then. As long as he's pretty, nothing else matters.” Song Ren sighed, looking at Floren, whom he had previously swept under the rug, and silently equipped him to the party.</p>
<p>As the first Blade he drew, before he knew that the cute girl actually had something bigger than his, he had seriously trained him.</p>
<p>Now, he was considered the strongest combatant besides Pyra and Mythra. Although he wasn't a damage dealer, he could at least heal, so slowly chipping away at enemies would be fine.</p>
<p>After learning that there was actually a third sword of the Aegis, Song Ren guided Rex under Grandpa Azurda's guidance all the way to the Spirit Crucible in Mizar Village.</p>
<p>“Nia, something feels off. Is this hinting at something?”</p>
<p>Watching Zeke recount his story with Pandoria, stating that he was a Flesh Eater, just like Rex, having suffered a fatal injury and then having half of Pandoria's life core transplanted into him with the help of the Praetorium. That's why he felt unwell in the Spirit Crucible, a place that suppresses Blade Ether energy.</p>
<p>But Nia next to him also looked distressed. Connecting this to the earlier plot point where Nia sent Dromarch away and used an unknown power to revive Mòrag's younger brother, Song Ren had a bold guess in his mind.</p>
<p>And the subsequent plot confirmed Song Ren's idea.</p>
<p>In the Spirit Crucible, seeing Rex knocked down by the phantom of the trial left by the great hero Addam 500 years ago, Nia was finally able to confront herself.</p>
<p>Unlike Zeke, Nia was a Blade Eater. Originally, Nia was a Blade living in the home of a lord in Gormott Province, but because the lord's daughter eventually died from illness, the lord decided to transplant his daughter's cells into Nia. This way, a part of his daughter could continue to live with Nia, the Blade. This was why Nia had always concealed her Blade identity.</p>
<p>Song Ren didn't care about Nia's identity at all; the crucial thing was, who could resist Nia after her transformation?!</p>
<p>Long hair, dressed in a white Japanese-style robe, boldly revealing everything, especially those legs that could definitely rival Mythra's!</p>
<p>She was completely different from the previous Nia, who was tightly wrapped in yellow clothes and had short, tomboy-like hair.</p>
<p>‘I won’t be bound anymore, whether by the past... by Jin, or by my own identity as a Blade.’</p>
<p>‘I can live more freely, I can be more selfish, right? Rex!’</p>
<p>‘Otherwise, there's no meaning in living. Thank you for teaching me that.’</p>
<p>‘I love you most, Rex!’</p>
<p>Holy crap, a confession!</p>
<p>She just directly confessed her feelings!</p>
<p>Nia's stock has hit rock bottom and rebounded!</p>
<p>Who said Mythra and Pyra were the only heroines, the only wives? Nia, who walked alongside Rex all this way and encouraged him to regain his fighting spirit after Pyra was captured, looked exactly like the heroine!</p>
<p>So, Mythra is the big sister, Pyra is the mom, and Nia is the true wife?</p>
<p>Watching Nia express her feelings, Song Ren in the game suddenly grew excited, even his previous worries about Pyra and Mythra were suppressed.</p>
<p>Following Nia's confession, a series of dazzling battles ensued. Finally, when Nia was exhausted, Rex, like a hero, stood in front of her and repelled the enemies.</p>
<p>It's coming! The response is coming!</p>
<p>Song Ren was fully focused.</p>
<p>‘Rex...’</p>
<p>‘I really like you too, Nia!’</p>
<p>Is that really it!?</p>
<p>Song Ren listened to Rex's words, looking surprised, and Nia in the game also showed a surprised expression.</p>
<p>But the next second, Song Ren's expression froze.</p>
<p>‘I love Nia, and everyone!’ So I’ll never stop moving forward!</p>
<p>Nia's stock, hit the daily limit down!</p>
<p>Song Ren looked at Nia, who seemed to be laughing so hard she was wiping away tears, indicating that this was fine, and couldn't help but fall silent.</p>
<p>Especially after this part, seeing Nia, who could transform into a Blade, and the unlock condition for the Field Skill named ‘Endurance’, Song Ren became even more silent.</p>
<p>Fighting alongside Mythra and Pyra, so why does fighting alongside Mythra and Pyra increase ‘Endurance’?!</p>
<p>Stop bullying Nia!</p>
