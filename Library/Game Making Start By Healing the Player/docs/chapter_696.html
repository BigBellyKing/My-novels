                <p>Chapter 695: The Grudge of the Severed Arm, To Be Repaid Today! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>“How the heck do I beat this Iai Swordsman?!”</p>
<p>Staring at the “YOU DIED” screen, Zhang Yi felt like he was about to collapse. Most of the previous BOSSes, he had managed to beat using clever tricks.</p>
<p>For example, the Chained Ogre and General of the Samurai Kawarada earlier, he assassinated the minions one by one, then used oil and the Flame Vent to take them down. Gyoubu Masataka Oniwa and Blazing Bull were also defeated by cleverly using firecrackers.</p>
<p>But after painstakingly getting into Ashina Castle from the rafters, under the barrage of those shuriken ninjas, and overcoming numerous obstacles to reach the watchtower, Zhang Yi encountered his most difficult enemy yet.</p>
<p>It was an Ashina-style samurai. His Iai slash made Zhang Yi’s scalp tingle.</p>
<p>He wasn't like the Shinobi Hunter or the Mountain Bandits from three years ago, where it was just ganging up on one. Nor was he as imposing as Gyoubu Masataka Oniwa. He was simply in a small room, one man, one sword, and his Iai slash gave Zhang Yi goosebumps.</p>
<p>His attack power was incredibly high; even blocking, a single combo would essentially deplete his Posture Bar. Moreover, his aggressive intent was particularly strong, and the movement space in the watchtower was limited, making it easy for him to get up close. His attack method was very simple: just an Iai combo slash, but the speed was just too fast. Sometimes, with good luck, Zhang Yi blocked the first hit, but couldn’t seize the opportune moment for the second.</p>
<p>After dying a dozen times, he finally entered the second phase. But then Zhang Yi discovered that this guy’s attack power and speed had increased again. It made his scalp tingle even more.</p>
<p>In fact, it wasn't just Zhang Yi. Almost all players who chose to cheese their way here, rather than truly relying on their raw skill, found themselves in a bitter struggle.</p>
<p>The title 'Sekiro: Die Twice in a Row' was vividly demonstrated.</p>
<p>But as the saying goes, if you skip class, you fail exams. Before this, through various unconventional methods of cheesing, players had easily beaten BOSSes like Gyoubu Masataka Oniwa, Chained Ogre, and Yamauchi Shikibu Toshikatsu. But when it came to the Iai Swordsman, even though it was a true 1v1 duel, countless players suffered terribly due due to their weak foundations.</p>
<p>And a similar scenario also happened three years ago in Hirata Estate. Many players who first entered Hirata Estate, and didn't truly rely on their raw skill to reach Lady Butterfly, were also thoroughly schooled.</p>
<p>Although there was an easier way to beat Lady Butterfly – the infinite dodge step strategy – in the second phase, as long as you maintained your health, you could completely ignore the light orbs. After all, those light orbs only dealt damage and couldn’t interrupt attacks. But the key was that for early-game Sekiro players, it was obviously impossible to discover this cheese method so quickly.</p>
<p>Thus, players who were previously debating online whether Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice was difficult or not, now, as their game progress reached these points, unanimously agreed: Mr. Chen was indeed the familiar Mr. Chen!</p>
<p>“Aaaahhhhh!” Zhang Yi cried out in anguish, looking at the Iai Swordsman’s last sliver of Posture Bar. He was just a tiny bit away from taking down this Iai Swordsman!</p>
<p>What is the most painful thing in a Souls-like game?</p>
<p>Losing your accumulated souls?
Dying to a hidden trap?</p>
<p>No! The truly painful thing is when success is within reach, but brutally snatched away. When you see a bonfire or Sculptor's Idols, you get killed by a mob. When you get a BOSS down to a sliver of health, and one more hit would kill it, but then the BOSS turns around and kills you. The despair brought by this kind of pain is a devastating blow. It can even cause a steadfast player to undergo a mental shift.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was exactly like this now. He had already mastered the first phase of the Iai Swordsman, not even needing to use his first life. But now he felt as if he was back in the early-game progression stage; his mind was in disarray.</p>
<p>“Old Song, where are you?” Resurrecting in front of the Sculptor's Idols again, this time Zhang Yi decided to take a break, contacting Song Ren to check on his situation. When you're suffering, you need to find a kindred spirit.</p>
<p>“I’m still at Hirata Estate. Wolf’s adoptive father from three years ago has almost had his head bashed in, and the mastermind seems to be a BOSS called Lady Butterfly. She’s too damn strong; that pair of scissors has stabbed me to death fifty or sixty times,” Song Ren replied, looking equally pained. He had also encountered his most formidable enemy, Lady Butterfly. The first phase wasn't a big problem for him, but he felt the second phase of Lady Butterfly was a bit shameless. Because she could create illusions, forcing him to run, but the critical point was that Lady Butterfly's Posture Bar recovered super fast. Running meant all his previous Posture Bar damage was wasted, and the summoned light orbs in the second phase, though they didn't interrupt actions, dealt damage and couldn't be blocked. He had died several times with low health from those light orbs.</p>
<p>“Don’t you dare spoil it for me! I’m about to fight Genichiro Ashina here. Gyoubu Masataka Oniwa and Blazing Bull weren’t hard, but the Iai Swordsman in Ashina Castle is too damn fierce! And I’m telling you, Ashina was almost wiped out; they’re researching something called Regenerative Water, which, like the Power of the Dragon’s Heritage, can bring people back to life, but it has side effects! And Emma seems to know Genichiro Ashina too!” Zhang Yi also chose to subtly spoil some plot points.</p>
<p>“No more talking, I feel like once I beat Lady Butterfly, there won’t be much left of the Hirata Estate storyline,” Song Ren replied. He felt he had explored most of the Hirata Estate map from three years ago. And Lady Butterfly was already in the basement; it couldn't be that there was another basement after beating her, right?</p>
<p>“Well, then it’ll probably be hard for you to catch up to my progress,” Zhang Yi said gleefully.</p>
<p>“That’s not necessarily true,” Song Ren smacked his lips. He felt his skills were already perfected. If he had to fight those BOSSes again, he wouldn’t say he could do it without taking damage, but they certainly wouldn’t stump him.</p>
<p>“Heh heh!” Zhang Yi expressed his disbelief. Zhang Yi felt there were simply too many story maps here. Ashina Castle goes without saying; he even encountered an old woman on the bridge when he first entered, talking about Senpou Temple. Besides that, the promotional trailer also showed a small village like Blighttown in Dark Souls, as well as the cloud-top scenes, none of which he had seen yet. How could Old Song catch up to his progress in this situation?</p>
<p>After chatting for a bit, Zhang Yi continued his confrontation with the Iai Swordsman. With his previous experience and adjusted mindset, this time Zhang Yi didn't take long to defeat the Iai Swordsman. Mainly, he discovered a small trick: it was quite difficult if he relied solely on attacking the Iai Swordsman. Because when you attacked, he would likely hit you with a two-hit combo. However, if you simply parried and could perfectly Mikiri Counter the Iai Swordsman, his Posture Bar would rapidly increase. He continuously used the Flickering Blade Technique, and although he failed several times, the last time his luck was good, he managed two perfect Mikiri Counters in a row, allowing him to successfully defeat the Iai Swordsman.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi breathed a sigh of relief, looking triumphant. He picked up all the glowing items on the ground, and also noticed a scroll detailing a technique on the wall.</p>
<p>“Lightning Reversal? What does this mean? Jump up to catch lightning and throw it back without landing?”</p>
<p>Zhang Yi scratched his head, looking at the scroll and its contents. It didn't look like a skill book; after all, he couldn't pick it up, and there was no prompt to learn it. He pondered for a moment, unable to fully grasp it, but it wasn't crucial. From the storyline, it seemed he was now at the top floor of Ashina Castle, and the next challenge would likely be Genichiro.</p>
<p>At this moment, Zhang Yi was full of confidence. He had overcome the difficult Iai Swordsman, what was there to fear? He had transcended!</p>
<p>The grudge of the severed arm, to be repaid today!</p>
<p>Moreover, Genichiro Ashina didn't seem that strong from the previous promotional trailer; he was just an early-game story kill BOSS. It’s well known that story kill BOSSes in Souls-like games are pushovers. Some BOSSes look incredibly powerful and imposing, but they're weaklings in actual combat. For example, Yhorm the Giant in Dark Souls, or Amygdala in Bloodborne, who pulls players into the Hunter's Dream—when you actually fight them, they all just sing 'conquer' on the ground.</p>
<p>This Genichiro, he estimated, was just an appetizer; Isshin Ashina was the real challenge.</p>
