                <p>Chapter 764: The Truth of Silent Hill</p>
<p>Upon entering the first floor of the Lakeview Hotel, James saw a map in the elevator lobby. </p>
<p>The rooms on the other floors were quite normal, but on Room 312, it was written: 'I've been waiting for you.'</p>
<p>This was the room James and Mary once stayed in. So, was Mary truly still alive?</p>
<p>Later, James also found a note at the counter.</p>
<p>It read: 'Mr. James, the videotape you forgot is stored in the 1st floor office.'</p>
<p>He then found the key to Room 312, and a fish-shaped key in the restaurant.</p>
<p>Just as Zhang Yi was about to control James to leave the restaurant, the piano in the corner of the restaurant suddenly made a sound.</p>
<p>In the previously dead silent restaurant, the sound of a piano suddenly rang out, startling Zhang Yi immensely.</p>
<p>He quickly turned to look in the direction of the sound, only to see Laura lying on the stool behind the piano.</p>
<p>“What the heck, it's you again, you little Brat!”</p>
<p>“You ask if I was scared? What do you think?!”</p>
<p>Looking at Laura, who walked out from behind the piano, Zhang Yi felt speechless.</p>
<p>Even though she didn't look particularly special.</p>
<p>But after the deaths of Eddie, and the resurrected-then-died-again Maria and Angela.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi genuinely felt a little traumatized by Laura.</p>
<p>Especially since every time this little girl appeared, it would usher in an eerie scenario.</p>
<p>In the apartment, she kicked the key on the floor, making him confront Triangle Head directly.</p>
<p>In the hospital, she locked him in a small room to play 'hug of love' with three monsters, and after escaping, he entered a bizarre world.</p>
<p>It was simply taking years off his life.</p>
<p>However, here, Laura didn't seem to be teasing James as before. Instead, she told him her story and gave James a letter from Mary.</p>
<p>'Dear Laura, I'm leaving this letter for Rachel to give to you after I'm gone.'</p>
<p>'Now... I'm going far away, to a quiet and beautiful place.'</p>
<p>'Please forgive my sudden departure, take care, Laura.'</p>
<p>'I know you hate James because you think he's not good to me, but please give him a chance. It's true he has a bad temper sometimes and doesn't smile much, but he's truly a good person deep down.'</p>
<p>'Laura... I love you as if you were my own. If it hadn't come to this, I would have adopted you.'</p>
<p>'Happy eighth birthday, Laura.'</p>
<p>Seeing this letter, James confirmed it was indeed written by Mary.</p>
<p>Also, from Laura's words, she did know Rachel, the nurse who took care of Mary at the time, and Laura was only eight years old.</p>
<p>At this moment, James was in confusion.</p>
<p>Because this meant Mary couldn't have died three years ago; she might even have been alive just a week ago.</p>
<p>Had Laura lied, or was the letter forged, or was there something wrong with his memory?</p>
<p>Was Mary really still alive? Was she really waiting for him here?</p>
<p>Slowly searching the Lakeview Hotel, Zhang Yi's mood was still relatively relaxed.</p>
<p>The overall atmosphere of the Lakeview Hotel was much better than before. Aside from the lingering deathly silence, there were no overly scary or oppressive monsters.</p>
<p>He found the videotape Maria and the note had mentioned earlier. James then followed the instructions and went to Room 312, where he and Mary had once stayed.</p>
<p>The room was very bright, and the furniture was neatly arranged.</p>
<p>The windowpanes and everything else were perfectly intact.</p>
<p>Other than the dust on the floor and tables, which proved the room hadn't been occupied for a long time, everything else was fine.</p>
<p>Through the window, he could see the dense white fog enveloping Silent Hill.</p>
<p>In front of the fireplace directly opposite, there was a television and a VCR, as well as a sofa placed sideways.</p>
<p>Controlling James, he walked forward, moved the sofa in front of the TV, and then inserted the videotape he had found earlier into the VCR.</p>
<p>Was Mary dead or not? What was going on with Silent Hill?</p>
<p>Zhang Yi had a premonition that everything would be explained in this videotape.</p>
<p>'Zzzzzt...'</p>
<p>Accompanied by static on the screen and a burst of electrical noise.</p>
<p>The content of the videotape was displayed on the black and white television.</p>
<p>'Are you recording again? Oh, don't...' </p>
<p>On the television screen, a woman identical to Maria appeared. This was clearly James's wife, Mary.</p>
<p>However, unlike Maria, Mary's hair was tied up, and her expression wasn't as seductive.</p>
<p>Waving at the camera, Mary sat on the sofa by the window, gazing outside.</p>
<p>'I don't know why, but I just love it here.'</p>
<p>'It's so peaceful.'</p>
<p>Mary turned her head with a smile.</p>
<p>'Do you know what I heard?'</p>
<p>'This place used to be sacred... now we understand why.'</p>
<p>'It's a shame we have to leave...' </p>
<p>'Promise me, you'll bring me back here again... <em>cough cough</em>.'</p>
<p>Mary's face held a smile and anticipation, but before she could finish speaking, she couldn't help but cough.</p>
<p>At the same time, the image on the TV suddenly became chaotic.</p>
<p>Different fragments intertwined and flashed.</p>
<p>He didn't know whether it was James's memory or the content of the videotape itself.</p>
<p>One moment it was Mary coughing, another it was Mary gazing out the window, and then it was Mary lying gravely ill in bed.</p>
<p>These different images intertwined and tangled, finally freezing on the scene of Mary lying in bed with James caring for her.</p>
<p>But the next moment, James stood up and blocked the camera.</p>
<p>The television screen became incredibly blurry, but through the模糊 image, one could vaguely see James pulling something off and pressing it towards Mary, who was lying in bed.</p>
<p>Then, after a burst of noise, only static remained on the television.</p>
<p>James sat blankly in front of the TV, head drooping, motionless, as if all his strength had been drained.</p>
<p>Only the rustling static from the TV echoed in his ears.</p>
<p>After a while, he heard footsteps. The little girl, Laura, ran over, pushed James, and asked if he had found Mary. If not, she suggested they go look for Mary together.</p>
<p>Slowly lifting his head, James looked at Laura in front of him.</p>
<p>“Mary's gone... Mary, she's dead.”</p>
<p>Laura shouted excitedly, “Liar! You're lying!”</p>
<p>“No, it's true...”</p>
<p>James shook his head.</p>
<p>Looking at James, Laura seemed disbelieving: “She... she's dead? Died of illness?”</p>
<p>“No...”</p>
<p>“I killed her.”</p>
<p>Even though he had guessed it in his heart, hearing James's words, Zhang Yi's eyes widened in the game.</p>
<p>Mary had already died, and James killed her?</p>
<p>What on earth was going on?</p>
<p>After confessing to killing Mary, Laura became furious with James, crying and hitting him.</p>
<p>James apologized to Laura guiltily, but Laura still left.</p>
<p>However, eerily, Mary's voice then came from the radio again, asking him to come see her quickly.</p>
<p>Was this Mary's ghost, or something else?</p>
<p>As he walked out of Room 312, the hotel was dilapidated, and blood kept dripping from the ceiling.</p>
<p>Just like the hospital before, James once again entered the Otherworld.</p>
<p>On the stairs, he encountered Angela. The stone stairs had turned into wooden ones.</p>
<p>Flames surrounded them, and Angela told James about the misfortunes she had experienced: her father, mother, and brother had never truly treated her as a person.</p>
<p>Just like this sea of fire, her life had always been this way, and so, in despair, Angela slowly walked into the flames.</p>
<p>Continuing onward, James reached the attic and saw Maria again.</p>
<p>This time, she was fixed upside down on an iron frame, being impaled by two Triangle Heads.</p>
<p>At this point, James and the players finally understood everything. Combining the previous encounters of Eddie, Angela, and James, a complete explanation had emerged.</p>
<p>These Triangle Heads were created by James to punish himself for his crimes.</p>
<p>Silent Hill, this land, has possessed incredible power since ancient times. It draws those with darkness in their hearts into an alternate dimension.</p>
<p>It materializes all the negative emotions within a person. So, the bizarre scenes James saw, the terrifying monsters, and all the experiences he had in Silent Hill were actually manifestations of his inner darkness.</p>
<p>That's why Angela, Eddie, and James could see all sorts of monsters, while the little girl Laura could walk freely in Silent Hill because she was just a child and didn't possess the same darkness as James and the others. To her, Silent Hill was just an ordinary town.</p>
