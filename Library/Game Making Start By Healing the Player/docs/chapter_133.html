                <h3>Chapter 132: A Game Full of Despair (Requesting Subscriptions)</h3>
<p>Many games, after completing the first playthrough, basically offer a complete understanding of the game's plot.</p>
<p>The subsequent second playthrough is more for studying certain playstyles or completing content that wasn't collected during the initial main story playthrough.</p>
<p>But Dark Souls is different; even after players complete the first playthrough, they might not have discovered much of the game's core content.</p>
<p>For instance, players playing Dark Souls for the first time, without looking at a guide, would rarely know that besides using Ember to encounter NPC and player invasions or summoning help for BOSS fights, there are other aspects.</p>
<p>Actually, in front of certain BOSS rooms, NPCs can still be summoned.</p>
<p>For example, in front of the Lothric Ice Dog's BOSS room, if the Uchigatana Guy was defeated earlier in the Firelink Shrine, then the Uchigatana Guy's spirit can be brought to fight the Ice Dog, and his name, Expert, is also revealed.</p>
<p>Also, before the stairs to the left outside the fat Winged Knight's door, one can see the spirit mark left by Lion Knight Albert for summoning, though players can only see it when in the Embered state.</p>
<p>Many players, when first arriving here, would have already lost their Embered state due to the previous torment from various mobs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the world of Dark Souls, there are many elements unique to ARPG games: side quests.</p>
<p>However, these side quests require players to discover and trigger them themselves.</p>
<p>And the more players understand these NPC's side stories, the more they realize this is a game full of despair.</p>
<p>The worldview, story, and difficulty are all like this.</p>
<p>The first place players begin their adventure, beneath the High Wall of Lothric, holds a thief named Greirat, wearing a hood.</p>
<p>After rescuing him, he appears in a corner of Firelink Shrine, and from him, players can obtain an item, prompting them to go to the Undead Settlement to find a woman named Loretta.</p>
<p>She might be his lover, or his relative, but clearly, this woman is his emotional anchor.</p>
<p>To repay the player, Patches would even specifically go out to steal useful items and sell them cheaply to the player, which is much more affordable than the Shrine Handmaid in front of the Blacksmith.</p>
<p>But when players went to the Undead Settlement, they inadvertently knocked down a hanging corpse, and upon picking up the glowing relic, discovered that this corpse was the person Patches was looking for.</p>
<p>They returned with the relic to tell Patches.</p>
<p>‘Ah... so that's it... that woman... she's dead.’</p>
<p>‘Thank you. I had a premonition of this, actually. Hmm... I feel much lighter now. Take this ring... consider it a token of my gratitude.’</p>
<p>His calm tone, however, revealed despair.</p>
<p>After this, Patches would help players by going out to steal things.</p>
<p>Each time he stole, he managed to acquire some useful items.</p>
<p>The first time, Patches cleverly slipped back.</p>
<p>The second time, heading to Irithyll of the Boreal Valley, if the prerequisites were met, Patches would still return safely and tell the player that an ‘Onion Knight’ had saved him.</p>
<p>But the third time, when Patches again suggested a venture into the Lothric Capital, players agreed due to the previous two hauls, but this time Patches would never return.</p>
<p>‘Hey... listen, I want to go steal some more things. The Lothric Capital might have something you need.’</p>
<p>‘I know... this city seems very dangerous, but I still want to go...’</p>
<p>‘After all, I don't want to be just a lowly street rat until I die.’</p>
<p>On the rooftop of the Grand Archives where the Corvians are, players found Patches' ashes. Recalling Patches' words before he left, their hearts were filled with mixed emotions.</p>
<p>Clearly, after Patches learned of Loretta's death, besides wanting to repay the Ashen One who helped him, he also had a death wish, which led him to repeatedly put himself in danger.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Moreover, most players fought alongside a truly living NPC for the first time, not the spirit of the Onion Knight.</p>
<p>The first time seeing the Onion Knight, he seemed a bit goofy and endearingly naive.</p>
<p>Yet, one could also feel his optimistic personality and righteousness.</p>
<p>Seeing the Ashen One fighting the Fire Demon, he immediately stepped forward to help, and after the battle, he would drink with them and Praise the Sun.</p>
<p>Along the way, the Onion Knight and the player had several encounters, until in Irithyll, he told the player something.</p>
<p>That was, he had a mission, and this mission ultimately led to the same goal as the Ashen One's.</p>
<p>He was to personally send off his old friend, one of the Lords of Cinder, Yhorm the Giant, King of the Profaned Capital.</p>
<p>Because this was a promise he had made, the highest promise of knightly honor and friendship.</p>
<p>As the bells awakening the Lords of Cinder rang, Yhorm awoke from his slumber to see his capital in desolation, his former subjects turned into a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood.</p>
<p>Deep within Yhorm, besides self-reproach, there was a seething hatred for Linking the Fire. His hope had not become reality but had transformed into a grotesque flame consuming everything; his soul too began to twist with this power, and the corruption of the Profaned Flame caused his mind to completely collapse.</p>
<p>Thereupon, Yhorm cast aside the shield that had accompanied him for years, and wielding a Great Machete, guarded the deepest part of the Profaned Capital, obsessively and ferociously attacking anyone who trespassed his domain.</p>
<p>And the Onion Knight, Siegward of Catarina.</p>
<p>He too was about to fulfill the promise he once made: to personally kill his former closest friend.</p>
<p>The Storm Ruler, two greatswords capable of slaying giants.</p>
<p>One lay beside Yhorm's Throne in the Profaned Capital, while the other was entrusted to his most trusted friend.</p>
<p>‘Yhorm, my old friend!’</p>
<p>‘Siegward of Catarina, here to fulfill my promise!’</p>
<p>‘May the Lords of Cinder and the Sun be with us!’</p>
<p>After the fierce battle, Yhorm the Giant's body fell, and the exhausted Onion Knight sat down on the spot, seemingly transported back to the scene when he first fought alongside the Ashen One, defeating the Fire Demon.</p>
<p>‘My apologies! Always having you save my hide.’</p>
<p>‘But I thank you too; thanks to you, I was able to fulfill my own promise.’</p>
<p>‘Alright, let's raise a final toast together.’</p>
<p>The Onion Knight once again offered the Ashen One a cup of his self-brewed fine wine, and they raised their cups and drank together.</p>
<p>‘May your courage and mission, and my old friend Yhorm, be with the Sun!’</p>
<p>‘Alright, I'm going to take a little nap. Be sure to do this after the victory celebration!’</p>
<p>‘My friend... may you safely accomplish your mission.’</p>
<p>The two met on their journey for different reasons; the Onion Knight's mission was now complete.</p>
<p>The Ashen One still had to continue fulfilling their mission.</p>
<p>The Onion Knight sat there, his head bowed.</p>
<p>But this time, the Onion Knight did not snore as he had before.</p>
<p>It wasn't until the player had walked away that a dull thud, of something falling, reached their ears.</p>
<p>All players understood that the Onion Knight would no longer be seen on their subsequent journey.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>It can be said that there are far too many memorable characters in the game for players.</p>
<p>The Crestfallen Warrior in Firelink Shrine, constantly spreading negative thoughts, was once a member of the Farron Undead Legion. However, after players repeatedly completed challenges he deemed impossible, he finally ceased to be crestfallen and decided to inherit the will of the Undead Legion.</p>
<p>He no longer sought swordsmanship but instead pursued the power of dragons. Having fought his way through Archdragon Peak, he obtained one-half of the Twinkling Dragon Stone of fate, and eventually concluded his journey at the Farron Keep where he fought alongside his teammates.</p>
<p>The Crestfallen Warrior, picking up his Great Sword again, carrying Estus Flasks for the entire team of Undead, engaged in a battle for the Dragon Stone with the Ashen One. The victor would possess the power of the Elder Dragon, while the vanquished would slumber.</p>
<p>Then there's the Saintess, burdened with the mission of becoming a Fire Keeper. If she came into contact with the Dark Scripture, she would lose her mind and eventually be consumed by darkness.</p>
<p>But if she didn't learn the Dark Scripture and truly became a Fire Keeper, she would only turn into a machine that only knew how to upgrade players, waiting to die alone in a tower filled with Fire Keeper corpses.</p>
<p>And her guardian, Knight Eygon, would also feel his duty was complete. He would first go to the Dragon Slayer Armour's arena to leave a White summon sign to repay the Ashen One's favor, and ultimately return to the Saintess's original dungeon to commit suicide.</p>
<p>Champion Gundyr, Nameless King, Twin Princes... whether BOSS or NPC, each has their own backstory.</p>
<p>But these stories, too, are full of despair.</p>
<p>No matter what one does, the only outcome is tragedy.</p>
<p>Just like the game's name, Dark Souls, the more you understand, the darker the world feels.</p>
<p>Originally, most players believed that continuing to Link the Fire at the end was the true, canonical ending.</p>
<p>Because whether it was Chen Xu's official Weibo before the game's launch or the promotional trailer, all indicated that the game's theme was Linking the Fire.</p>
<p>However, as players understood more of the game's content, and besides Linking the Fire, three other endings were discovered one by one by players.</p>
<p>These were the End of Fire ending, plunging the entire world into darkness.</p>
<p>The Usurpation of Fire ending, which involves attacking the Fire Keeper during the End of Fire ending and snatching the dying Cinders.</p>
<p>The Lord of Hollows ending: after rescuing the Pilgrims of Londor, they will guide the player to draw out the hidden dark power within them. Players who follow this path will eventually collect eight Dark Sigils, consuming the flame at the end to become the Lord of Hollows.</p>
<p>Whether Linking the Fire was truly the correct choice became a major topic of debate among players.</p>
<p>Each of the four endings had its own player base supporting it.</p>
<p>Players who supported the Link the Fire ending believed that Linking the Fire was about passing on the fire of hope. When the flame extinguished, the world plunged into darkness, filled with phantoms everywhere. How could such a despairing world be the correct path?</p>
<p>Conversely, players who advocated for the End of Fire ending believed that Linking the Fire was a conspiracy. Moreover, just as the Fire Keeper stated, one day new flames would surely emerge from the darkness. Plus, being able to live happily ever after with the Fire Keeper at the end, let the world be dark then!</p>
<p>Of course, there were also those who believed that the Lord of Hollows ending should be the true ending.</p>
<p>Even the Usurpation of Fire ending had many players who believed it was the true ending.</p>
<p>As for the reason, it's very simple.</p>
<p>After all, the ending's mention of the Ashen One craving Cinders, can be said to be echoed from the game's beginning.</p>
<p>That is, this ending actually has narration at the very end!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Dark Souls' plot is fragmented and open-ended.</p>
<p>Thus, ‘a thousand people have a thousand Hamlets in their eyes,’ and each player has their own interpretation they believe to be correct.</p>
<p>Players who had already completed the game increasingly delved into Dark Souls' content, much like archaeologists.</p>
<p>They hoped to unearth more credible evidence to prove their own viewpoints were correct.</p>
<p>Even though Chen Xu did not release Dark Souls 1 content, the existing related content was sufficient for players to imagine what kind of epic story lay behind it.</p>
<p>The more they dug, the more players were moved.</p>
<p>Initially, the suffering was Dark Souls' label, but with more and more plot and detail revelations within the game.</p>
<p>It became clear that labels like ‘suffering,’ ‘hardcore,’ and ‘high difficulty’ could not fully encapsulate the game Dark Souls.</p>
<p>It possessed qualities far more captivating than these.</p>
