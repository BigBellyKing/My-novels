                <p>Chapter 122: Players Questioning Life Itself</p>
<p>It wasn't just Song Ren, Zhang Yi, and Wang Han; all the other players who got their hands on <em>Dark Souls</em> immediately felt a sense of bewilderment.</p>
<p>They even wondered if there was something wrong with how they had opened the game.</p>
<p>Because it was simply too malicious!</p>
<p>Players experiencing <em>Dark Souls</em> basically went through four different stages of emotional change.</p>
<p>First, there was the excitement before entering the game, filled with joy and wanting to pass on the so-called "fire of hope" to become a Firelinker.</p>
<p>Then they encountered the Crystal Lizard and Gundyr the Ash, and were thrashed into bewilderment.</p>
<p>After choosing to persevere and finally defeating Gundyr the Ash, players were filled with confidence and had new expectations for their future Firelinking journey.</p>
<p>Finally, they arrived at the High Wall of Lothric, where they thoroughly began to doubt life itself.</p>
<p>Because after reaching the High Wall of Lothric, players completely understood the game's tone.</p>
<p>That is, except for the Gem Crystal Bug, affectionately dubbed "Porsche" by players, any hostile unit in the game that could move was capable of taking a player's life.</p>
<p>Although you could easily kill mobs in the game; usually it took only three, four, or five hits per mob.</p>
<p>But similarly, mobs could do the same to you.</p>
<p>In the game, you were as fragile as glass, shattering with a single touch.</p>
<p>Of course, if you wore a full set of armor, it would be much better.</p>
<p>Because there was a plastic bag wrapped around that layer of glass.</p>
<p>In short, any monster in this game could take your life.</p>
<p>Even seemingly the easiest Hollows to deal with in the game.</p>
<p>But if you faced two or three at once, and weren't skilled, they could leave you dead in the street.</p>
<p>Furthermore, players could fully experience the sheer malice brought by the game's Level Design.</p>
<p>Just as you defeated a small group of enemies and happily advanced, a Hollow wielding a short sword would charge at you around the next corner.</p>
<p>When you saw only one monster ahead and thought nothing of it, some other mobs were actually hidden in a corner, waiting to ambush you.</p>
<p>Besides, what countless players found even more outrageous was that the first treasure chest they saw in the High Wall of Lothric turned out to be a Mimic.</p>
<p>It could be said that almost all players lost their precious lives when they encountered this fellow.</p>
<p>And there were many similar scenarios in the game.</p>
<p>The fire-breathing wyvern on the bridge, the Lothric Knights in the corridors, the Pus of Man on the rooftops, and the Spear Knights in the rooms.</p>
<p>Finally, in the courtyard filled with corpses, there was also a fat big brother, the Winged Knight, wielding a great axe, teaching players what cruelty meant.</p>
<p>Of course, players who started playing in the second batch were luckier, because the game had a system of in-game messages and bloodstains.</p>
<p>Players could leave messages in certain areas to warn later players.</p>
<p>At the same time, bloodstains would appear on the ground where players had recently died, serving as a warning to those who came after.</p>
<p>Players who reached the treasure chest room later, seeing the ground full of blood, would naturally be wary.</p>
<p>But for new players embarking on early-game progression, there wasn't such good luck.</p>
<p>Everything they faced was unknown.</p>
<p>Of course, these 'veteran' players would also proactively leave messages.</p>
<p>It's just that some of them were true, and some were false.</p>
<p>For example, in the treasure chest room, players who had suffered before would leave a tip: "Beware of Treasure Chest." Players who saw this warning afterward would then be slightly wary of the chest inside.</p>
<p>However, some more mischievous players would leave an ambiguous hint, such as "There's a great treasure in the chest."</p>
<p>Although messages had a like and dislike function, sometimes it was of little use.</p>
<p>For such hints, some impatient players who didn't think too much would naturally follow in the footsteps of those before them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the message system was also one of the main reasons many players persevered in Dark Souls.</p>
<p>Because through it, they could know that they weren't the only ones suffering continuously in this world.</p>
<p>This could be considered a human trait: if you endure hardship alone, your endurance capacity significantly decreases, and you feel very lonely.</p>
<p>But if you knew that someone else was suffering with you, and some were even worse off.</p>
<p>Then you could persevere instead.</p>
<p>Of course, while finding solace for their minds, none of the hardships to be endured could be avoided.</p>
<p>In the game, monsters you thought you could defeat, you might not be able to defeat.</p>
<p>And monsters you thought you couldn't defeat, you definitely couldn't defeat.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the part of the game that made players feel most broken.</p>
<p>That was, monsters that they had just painstakingly killed would all respawn as soon as they teleported or rested at a bonfire.</p>
<p>And the souls on their person, which were both currency and experience.</p>
<p>What were good things in other ARPG games, many players felt became a burden in <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>When they had a considerable amount of souls but didn't meet the conditions to level up.</p>
<p>At this point, it felt like a heavy burden.</p>
<p>Because all of them would drop upon death, and if they died again midway, it would all be for nothing!</p>
<p>After many players suffered a painful physical and mental blow in Lothric, they would return to Firelink Shrine to admire the Fire Keeper's figure, imagining her stunningly beautiful face behind the metal blindfold.</p>
<p>Listening to the Fire Keeper's gentle lines in the game, the motivation to Link the Fire immediately surged.</p>
<p>The only thing that annoyed players was the Uchigatana Guy, Old Wang Next Door, outside the Firelink Shrine.</p>
<p>And inside the Firelink Shrine, there was also the Crestfallen Warrior, squatting by the stairs, spreading negative energy every day.</p>
<p>So, individual players, whose emotions had exploded from being tormented, saw the Crestfallen Warrior still spreading negative thoughts and went up to him with two slashes.</p>
<p>"If you don't Link the Fire, then don't Link the Fire, but why spread negative thoughts every day?!"</p>
<p>"He couldn't beat Old Wang Next Door with the uchigatana outside, but this Crestfallen Warrior couldn't be dealt with either?"</p>
<p>After three slashes, he became hostile, and then players discovered that, damn it, he really couldn't be dealt with.</p>
<p>Rolling, drinking Estus Flasks, parrying—this Crestfallen Warrior was proficient in everything.</p>
<p>Looking at the bewildered players, the Crestfallen Warrior also revealed a sinister grin: "I heard you call me Crestfallen Warrior, didn't you? Today I'll let you know that 'Crestfallen Warrior' actually has another interpretation!"</p>
<p>Moreover, once he became hostile, players didn't even have a chance to repent; they would be hunted down as soon as they appeared in Firelink Shrine.</p>
<p>"What? You say it's a misunderstanding?"</p>
<p>"Once, a slip of the hand; twice, mischievous hands; but you continuously slashed three times and tell me it's a misunderstanding?"</p>
<p>"Come! Dance street dance with me!"</p>
<p>Besides, although the Blacksmith and the old woman selling items wouldn't become hostile if attacked, they would respawn later.</p>
<p>But Uncle Blacksmith would directly refuse to serve players, and after killing the old woman once, she would still sell items, but the price would be...</p>
<p>Although it was possible to atone with souls in the sewers of later maps.</p>
<p>But current players had no idea.</p>
<p>Of course, even if they knew, it wouldn't be much use. Not to mention whether they could even get there now, the souls needed for atonement were a pain they couldn't even bring up.</p>
<p>Many players, in despair, deleted their save files because of this.</p>
<p>If it had been at the very beginning, it would definitely have been a quit-inducing setting.</p>
<p>But for players who had already defeated Ash Judgment Gundyr and arrived at Firelink Shrine, a certain attribute had essentially awakened quietly within them.</p>
<p>Although despairing, it also gave them a very strange feeling.</p>
<p>After all, being able to attack NPCs and trigger subsequent reactions was quite rare in other games.</p>
<p>Of course, besides players who had awakened a certain attribute, there were also many players who had eagerly prepared to Link the Fire but were then "taught a lesson" and quit the game, venting their anger on the forum communities.</p>
<p>"Damn it, damn it, Chen Xu is literally retaliating against the world! The malicious difficulty of this Dark Souls game is simply unbelievable!"</p>
<p>"+1, players who don't like masochism, definitely don't buy it! I'm completely broken!"</p>
<p>"I originally thought it was a hack-and-slash game, and I wasn't wrong! Except the monsters were doing the hacking and slashing to me!"</p>
<p>"Though it's an old meme, I still have to say, 'Warrior of Love' hehehehehe..."</p>
<p>Many players who had been tormented and quit the game spoke up to warn those who hadn't bought it yet.</p>
<p>However, some players refuted these comments.</p>
<p>The idea of these players was simple: just like with <em>Outlast</em> in the past, they hoped more people would get into the game and experience the suffering they had endured.</p>
<p>Of course, some players weren't simply fooling around or tricking others.</p>
<p>These players, who had already developed a certain special attribute, were truly attracted by <em>Dark Souls'</em> art design, mysterious world-building, and intense and thrilling BOSS battles.</p>
<p>"Honestly, the Nebula Games Platform tag for <em>Dark Souls</em> already states it's high difficulty. Compared to typical ARPGs, it is indeed a bit hardcore, but don't exaggerate it like that, alright?"</p>
<p>"Exactly, when did Mr. Chen ever say this was a hack-and-slash game? Didn't he say it mainly depends on the players themselves?"</p>
<p>"+1, for action games, all I can say is, those who know, know. If you don't know, there's nothing that can be done."</p>
<p>"Strongly recommend players come experience it, the Fire Keeper lady at Firelink Shrine is so beautiful! I solemnly declare her my wife!"</p>
<p>"Bro above, your wife is awesome!"</p>
<p>However, for now, players who were grumbling and disparaging the game still made up the larger portion.</p>
<p>(No need for broken bowls begging today, it's a robbery! Hand over your Monthly Passes and recommendation votes!)</p>
