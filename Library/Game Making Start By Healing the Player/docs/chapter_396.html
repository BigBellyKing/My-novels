                <p>Chapter 395: The Boat of Friendship Has a Big Hole (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>After figuring out the attributes and content of Animal Forest, Song Ren and other exhibition players who had also experienced the game were astonished.</p>
<p>Because it was obvious, this was a game that players needed to keep playing to truly feel its unique charm.</p>
<p>For this kind of game, players would basically only have two attitudes.</p>
<p>The first attitude was to play for about ten minutes, feel it was completely pointless, and directly close the game.</p>
<p>For these players, simulation management games were clearly not their cup of tea.</p>
<p>The other attitude was to play for about ten minutes with a skeptical feeling, thinking the game seemed pretty good and worth trying.</p>
<p>When they felt the unique charm of the small animals on the island, were drawn in by the cartoon art style, experienced a relaxed and pleasant mood, and developed considerable interest in the game.</p>
<p>The game's features told them that this game required long-term play.</p>
<p>Some content would only unlock on the second or third day.</p>
<p>Even fish and some insects were linked to specific real-world months.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, this naturally wouldn't be an issue.</p>
<p>But the key was, this was an exhibition!</p>
<p>If they were lucky enough to win a chance to experience it on the first day.</p>
<p>What about the second and third days!?</p>
<p>And what about after the exhibition ended!?</p>
<p>An even more crucial point was that this trial play session was an hour and a half long, very generous.</p>
<p>Enough for many players to experience some of the gameplay and fun of the first day in Animal Forest.</p>
<p>For example, fishing – besides catching various fish, they could even catch things like shoes.</p>
<p>Moreover, the DIY crafting table in the game could create many items.</p>
<p>Suddenly, many players whose interest had been piqued by Animal Forest were completely dumbfounded.</p>
<p>They understood why the trial time was so generous this time, and why Animal Forest, unlike Super Mario Odyssey, was a full version.</p>
<p>Because to experience subsequent content in this game, it followed real-world time!</p>
<p>Full version or demo version, there was no difference at all!</p>
<p>Of course, there were also some players with crooked ideas who wanted to try modifying the time on the Nintendo Switch to see if they could experience the later content.</p>
<p>However, unfortunately, Chen Xu had already anticipated this.</p>
<p>After all, in his previous life, Animal Forest indeed had quite a few players who acted as 'time assassins'.</p>
<p>By modifying the game's time, they could accelerate their in-game item collection.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch consoles at the exhibition had their time locked, preventing players from playing mischief through this aspect.</p>
<p>As for these players who used 'unique magic,' Chen Xu actually had no prejudice.</p>
<p>Just like with Dark Souls and Monster Hunter: World, Chen Xu primarily placed restrictions on online multiplayer.</p>
<p>As for single-player, if players wanted to see later content and achieve a full collection but found technical skill to be a bottleneck, using trainers was understandable.</p>
<p>But using trainers would certainly prevent them from earning specific achievements.</p>
<p>When the Nintendo Switch and Animal Forest were officially released, players who had modified the time would also face some restrictions on certain content, such as being unable to give items to others, and their time records wouldn't be counted.</p>
<p>For example, a normal player has 31 days in a month, and if they play normally, every day will be recorded.</p>
<p>However, time assassin players would only have records for the days they played normally, and all modified time wouldn't count.</p>
<p>This was primarily a testament to the unspoiled players.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>“I can only say we can’t outplay Mr. Chen! Just when you thought there were no grand promises being made at this exhibition, he actually drew an enormous one,” Song Ren sighed with emotion.</p>
<p>“Indeed, a big pie with filling, where we bit into the plain crust, but could only smell and see the filling without being able to eat it—this truly is the highest realm of making grand promises!” Zhang Yi nodded in agreement, stating that Nebula Games certainly lived up to its title as the grandmaster of making grand promises.</p>
<p>“Stop joking, there’s still some time. Let’s try Super Mario Odyssey. I saw others playing it over there, and it looked quite fun, plus it has a two-player mode.” Wang Han reminded them. Although Animal Forest, due to its unique game mechanics, seemed to have no content left to explore, wasn't there still a new game on the Nintendo Switch?</p>
<p>“Old Zhang!” Song Ren gave Zhang Yi a look.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to tell me,” Zhang Yi snorted.</p>
<p>The two of them, with great tacit understanding, detached the Nintendo Switch controllers, one red and one blue.</p>
<p>They immediately entered the game. The opening animation was the trailer Chen Xu had previously shown at the exhibition, and since trial time was limited, both of them skipped it directly.</p>
<p>“So adorable!” Wang Han beside them exclaimed.</p>
<p>The cartoon art style was similar to Animal Forest, but looked even prettier.</p>
<p>Players actually understood that such game graphics were designed to save resources and adapt to the hardware.</p>
<p>Yet, it had to be said, this art style was genuinely good.</p>
<p>Moreover, it gave one the feeling that Super Mario Odyssey simply had to be in this style.</p>
<p>If it were made realistic, it would instead be incongruous.</p>
<p>“What the heck, why are you the main perspective? My hat can only follow you around?” Zhang Yi expressed his displeasure upon entering the game.</p>
<p>In the game, the player's first level was the Cap Kingdom, where Cappy awakened Mario.</p>
<p>According to the dialogue, Bowser had kidnapped Cappy's sister and transformed her into a crown as a wedding gift, all for the purpose of marrying Princess Peach.</p>
<p>Now, Cappy had to rescue his sister with Mario, and so he transformed into Mario's red hat to embark on an adventure together.</p>
<p>In the two-player mode, one player controlled the hat, while the other controlled Mario.</p>
<p>But the problem was that the game's camera followed Mario, so if the hat ran too far, it would disappear from view, only appearing as an icon at the screen's edge.</p>
<p>“Nonsense,” Song Ren said, rolling his eyes. “This is Super Mario Odyssey; if I, Mario, am not the protagonist, who is? Besides, your hat’s gameplay is much more interesting than mine, it’s all motion control.”</p>
<p>A very interesting aspect of the game was throwing the hat.</p>
<p>And this particular segment was fun for the player controlling the hat, waving the controller to guide the hat, just like a real hat toss.</p>
<p>A platforming game with a touch of puzzle-solving, one person controlling Mario, one person controlling the hat.</p>
<p>It looked like a perfect two-player cooperative game for friends.</p>
<p>Of course, this was a scene mentally pictured. Players who had actually experienced It Takes Two and Overcooked understood what this kind of game truly looked like in practice.</p>
<p>Nearby, some unfamiliar players sat together, especially two burly men sitting side-by-side, their hands resting on blue and white controllers, creating a very harmonious scene.</p>
<p>But for those who knew each other, like Zhang Yi and Song Ren, it was a different picture.</p>
<p>‘Damn it, run this way! My controller just vibrated, there’s good stuff here!’ Song Ren stood near a poster.</p>
<p>In the game, when discovering coins or some special hidden content, the controller would sometimes vibrate gently to give players a hint.</p>
<p>Just now, Song Ren felt his controller vibrate.</p>
<p>“You come over here first, I think there are definitely coins hidden behind this box!” Zhang Yi, over there, had a different opinion.</p>
<p>“You first!”</p>
<p>“No, you come over!”</p>
<p>“You’re not coming over? I’ll make you come over!” Zhang Yi chuckled, controlled the hat to Mario's side, and then frantically shook the controller.</p>
<p>Mario in the game was seen continuously stomping on the hat, jumping back and forth, completely unable to stop.</p>
<p>“Fine! If that’s how you’re going to be, then I’m done for! Let’s perish together!” Song Ren, realizing he had no real solution against this tactic, said.</p>
<p>He decisively leaped off the nearby cliff.</p>
<p>I’m done for! Everyone dies together!</p>
<p>Accompanied by the game’s childlike fun visuals, Zhang Yi and Song Ren, two men nearing their thirties, also became somewhat childish at this moment.</p>
<p>Clearly, the small boat of friendship had already had a big hole poked in it.</p>
