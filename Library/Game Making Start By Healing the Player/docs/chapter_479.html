<p>Chapter 478: How Did The Art Style Suddenly Change? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Watching the tough guy descending from the sky, Zhang Yi couldn't help but inwardly grumble.</p>
<p>Sure enough, in these kinds of games, the rescue team is always the last to arrive.</p>
<p>But I have to say, that final pistol was indeed very powerful.</p>
<p>With the help of the mysterious organization, the Blue Umbrella Corporation, Zhang Yi controlled Ethan as he boarded the plane, watching the subsequent cutscene.</p>
<p>In the game, the helicopter engine hummed, steadily rising. Looking down from inside the helicopter, Evelyn's calcified corpse entwined around the Baker farm, a truly terrifying sight, as the sun's rays began to rise in the distance.</p>
<p>'Ethan?' A familiar voice called out.</p>
<p>He turned his head to see Mia, who was on the stretcher, had already woken up.</p>
<p>'You did it, we're safe.' Ethan smiled gently at his wife, reaching out to tightly grasp Mia's hand, their fingers intertwined.</p>
<p>At the same time, the game's voiceover began.</p>
<p>'Someone once said, when God closes one door, he opens another.'</p>
<p>'Well… one door closed tonight.'</p>
<p>'It was a long night, and I'm not the only one who thinks so.'</p>
<p>'Mia and I weren't the only victims; the Baker family were too, and Evelyn has been eliminated.'</p>
<p>'I had accepted the fact that I'd lost Mia, but now she's back. We have to start over.'</p>
<p>'Perhaps… this is where the next door opens.'</p>
<p>As Ethan's monologue faded, the screen went black.</p>
<p>But the next moment, something that surprised Zhang Yi appeared, because the black screen wasn't followed by the traditional credits roll.</p>
<p>Instead, it was a short CG animation.</p>
<p>'Long… long ago, a little girl and her mother went to pick berries for her hard-working father.'</p>
<p>Hearing this voice, Zhang Yi immediately recognized it. Isn't that Mia's voice? Is this Ethan and Mia's life many years later?</p>
<p>In Zhang Yi's surprise, Mia's voice continued.</p>
<p>'But the forest that welcomed them was eerie and silent… the bushes were empty.'</p>
<p>'Determined to find berries, the mischievous girl slipped away from her mother's hand and vanished into the woods.'</p>
<p>'She went over vines, past branches… her mother's worried calls quickly faded.'</p>
<p>'She ran deep into the jungle…'</p>
<p>Mia's voice hadn't finished yet when two figures appeared in a dimly lit living room.</p>
<p>Mia, sitting on the sofa, and Ethan, whose face was unseen, beside her.</p>
<p>'Why is this story so dark?' Ethan asked curiously.</p>
<p>'It's just a local fairy tale,' Mia said with a smile.</p>
<p>'You really like those kinds of stories, don't you?' Ethan said with emotion.</p>
<p>And the next moment, the lights in the living room suddenly went out.</p>
<p>Then the developer credits list and Nebula Games' company LOGO icon finally appeared on the computer screen.</p>
<p>Sitting in front of the computer, Zhang Yi and Wang Han exchanged glances.</p>
<p>"Just now… what was that? A sequel trailer?" Zhang Yi said, a little uncertainly.</p>
<p>"It's a bit like it, but also not quite." Wang Han was also a little unsure.</p>
<p>"However, I'm more interested in Ethan and Mia's future lives. From Ethan's previous performance, it seems he's already infected with this fungal virus, right?" Zhang Yi remarked with emotion.</p>
<p>"What fungal virus? It's called fungal infection!" Hearing Zhang Yi's words, Wang Han retorted.</p>
<p>"Close enough, close enough." Zhang Yi chuckled.</p>
<p>"Hey, this game actually has DLC content?" At this moment, Wang Han noticed the additional information on the game interface.</p>
<p>After the credits list finished playing, two DLCs were unlocked.</p>
<p>'Not a Hero' 'Zoe's End'</p>
<p>Clicking on them, one could see that one character was the person named Redfield who provided Ethan with the pistol at the very end. As for the other, it was an unknown old man who looked quite fierce.</p>
<p>But as for Zoe, Zhang Yi remembered her very clearly. In the previous game, when escaping the brother-in-law's traps, players needed to collect items for Zoe, and she would use a centrifuge to make two serums, but one was used during the fight with the father-in-law. Thus, a choice between two options had to be made.</p>
<p>If Mia was chosen, Zoe would be left behind, her fate unknown. And if Zoe was chosen, Mia would eventually be controlled by Evelyn.</p>
<p>Of course, Zoe wouldn't continue with Ethan either; she would directly turn into a crystal-like statue, her fate also unknown.</p>
<p>Therefore, most players, especially those who had seen the subsequent plot, basically chose to give the serum to their wife Mia. After all, whether Zoe received it or not, her fate was unknown, so why bother giving it to her?</p>
<p>However, what surprised Zhang Yi was that beneath these two DLCs, there was a small line of text in the notes — [Bringing You a Brand New Refreshing Experience].</p>
<p>Seeing this small text, Zhang Yi felt a pang of discomfort. What does this mean? A brand new refreshing experience, is it going to be scary again? Now, he could say he didn't believe a single word Chen Xu said.</p>
<p>"Why don't you play it?" Wang Han, beside him, tempted Zhang Yi. She was quite curious about Zoe's ending.</p>
<p>"No!" Zhang Yi refused decisively; he was truly scared. Although it was still the same game, this was Mr. Chen's game; who knew what new tricks he might pull?</p>
<p>"Just play a bit." Wang Han slipped the controller into Zhang Yi's hand, gently nudging him.</p>
<p>"Fine then… just for a little while." Looking at the controller in his hand and the game screen before him, Zhang Yi had a resolute expression, as if sacrificing himself.</p>
<p>Clicking on the DLC in the game, a simple story recap appeared: Zoe had crystalized and lost consciousness under Evelyn's control, and the soldiers who had previously rescued Ethan found Zoe, preparing to take her away for rescue, but were intercepted by an old man named Joe Baker.</p>
<p>This old man was Zoe's uncle, Jack Baker's elder brother. From his actions and some information, Joe Baker seemed not to be infected, but that wasn't the key. What truly stunned Zhang Yi was how incredibly fierce Joe Baker was.</p>
<p>His attack method was very simple: boxing. Moreover, there were various combo modes depending on the frequency of left and right punches. Unlike Ethan, who healed by washing his hands, this Old Man Joe was even fiercer; he could recover health just by eating bugs.</p>
<p>Especially when facing the first Fungal Beast, Zhang Yi became completely exhilarated. Wang Han, who was watching beside him because she didn't dare to play herself, was also stunned. How did the art style suddenly change in the DLC?</p>
<p>This old man's iron fists were no joke; he took down a Fungal Beast in just a few punches and kicks. Initially, he was a little worried it might be too scary, but after punching the first Fungal Beast to death, Zhang Yi became completely hyped up.</p>
<p>"Holy cow! So exhilarating! Is this real? Punching Fungal Beasts, Old Man Joe, you're truly awesome!"</p>
<p>"Is this still the horror game I was playing before?"</p>
<p>"So satisfying! So you were scaring me before, right?"</p>
<p>"Where are the Fungal Beasts? I haven't had enough fun yet!"</p>
<p>Punching Fungal Beasts, the exhilarating feeling of fist meeting flesh, could only be described with two words: pure joy.</p>
<p>Of course, he wasn't completely invincible in the game. For example, the alligators in the water were still quite tough to deal with, and it was quite dangerous if he got surrounded.</p>
<p>But compared to Ethan's previous experience, Old Man Joe's gaming experience was absolutely maxed out! Horror game? That must be referring to the monsters!</p>
