<p>Chapter 421: Out of Stock Again (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Live streaming platforms, video websites, player communities, and exceptionally high media scores.</p>
<p>Made The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild one of the hottest gaming topics of the moment.</p>
<p>For players who already owned a Switch, directly purchasing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was a no-brainer.</p>
<p>As for players who hadn't bought a Switch before and weren't interested in games like Super Mario Odyssey or Animal Crossing.</p>
<p>At this point, they felt a bit conflicted.</p>
<p>The question was whether or not to buy a Switch to play it. After all, players who hadn't bought a Switch by then.</p>
<p>Basically felt indifferent towards the games previously released on the Switch.</p>
<p>Was it worth buying a Switch purely for Breath of the Wild now?</p>
<p>Many players were actually quite hesitant at this moment.</p>
<p>But how does that saying go?</p>
<p>If you're paying attention, you want it; if you're hesitating, you want to buy it!</p>
<p>Many players had already felt an irresistible urge after watching various videos and live streams of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</p>
<p>And now, the high scores from major media outlets for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild were the final straw.</p>
<p>For some game players, it's fine if they're not interested in a game.</p>
<p>But if they're very interested, not being able to play it during the initial launch period is an incredibly painful experience.</p>
<p>Their friends around them were all discussing their game experiences, while they could only watch longingly.</p>
<p>Although there's the saying, "buy later, enjoy discounts."</p>
<p>By that time, the game's popularity would have long faded.</p>
<p>Other players would have already played through the game once or twice, and playing it then would certainly lack the pioneering feeling of a first-day launch.</p>
<p>Especially with the current feedback from players and media for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, it clearly resembled another masterpiece like Red Dead Redemption.</p>
<p>In such a situation, as a game player, unless one was genuinely short on cash, how could they possibly resist?</p>
<p>And so, under the allure of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</p>
<p>Countless players who originally had no intention of buying a Switch gritted their teeth and opened their wallets, ready to make a purchase.</p>
<p>These players, who got into the game because of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, actually had a slight hesitation before getting their Switch.</p>
<p>Why? Because they felt they were making an impulse purchase!</p>
<p>But this regret vanished completely once they officially stepped into Hyrule.</p>
<p>This game is really fun!</p>
<p>However, some players who had hesitated for a while were no longer in such a good mood.</p>
<p>Because initially, they were still a bit hesitant about whether or not to buy the game.</p>
<p>By the time they finally made up their minds and wanted to buy it, the situation from when the Switch first launched reappeared.</p>
<p>"Damn it! Did I see wrong? How come the official website shows out of stock?"</p>
<p>"Not just Nebula Games' official website, but third-party distribution platforms are also out of stock!"</p>
<p>"The Switch price on second-hand platforms has risen to 1800? That's double!?"</p>
<p>"Not just the Switch, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild cartridges have also risen to over four hundred!"</p>
<p>"What's going on? How did it suddenly sell out?"</p>
<p>"You ask me, how would I know? I just ordered The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild cartridge, why is the console gone?"</p>
<p>"F***, what a coincidence, I ordered the console, and the physical cartridge is gone!"</p>
<p>Many players online were dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Because they found that inventory seemed to be gone from all channels.</p>
<p>Even the prices of the Switch and cartridges on the second-hand market were higher than the official retail price.</p>
<p>And it wasn't just domestic; the situation was even more severe abroad.</p>
<p>'F***, how much did it sell? Logically, shouldn't there be plenty of Switch stock?'</p>
<p>'Yeah! It's been out for months now, and it's one thing for the limited edition to sell out, but the standard console too?'</p>
<p>'No, Mr. Chen, you can't learn from Mr. Lei and play monkey tricks!'</p>
<p>'Damn, these second-hand prices have shot up, it's practically a financial product now?'</p>
<p>Many players were completely stunned.</p>
<p>Although the popularity of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild continued to rise, many players were initially quite calm.</p>
<p>After all, this was a handheld console that had been released several months ago.</p>
<p>But now?</p>
<p>It actually sold out again?</p>
<p>Players online were furious, especially Chen Xu's official Weibo account, which was stormed by players who wanted to buy but found no stock.</p>
<p>However, while players were angry, Chen Xu stated he was helpless.</p>
<p>In fact, Nebula Games wasn't without stock during this period.</p>
<p>But the main point was that this time it included not only domestic but also international markets.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, I didn't expect a stock of 3 million units to run out either!" Yan Xiong also looked startled.</p>
<p>After receiving a notification from Chen Xu, iQue had also prepared stock.</p>
<p>A stock of 3 million units, although intended for the global market.</p>
<p>He thought it was a very substantial amount.</p>
<p>Because the Switch's previous sales had only reached over 7 million after being on the market for so long.</p>
<p>Based on the data, Yan Xiong figured that a stock of 3 million units, even for the global market, would last for about two to three weeks, and by then, the second batch of goods would be out, and player demand wouldn't be as tight.</p>
<p>After all, it's really impossible to hoard too many electronic devices.</p>
<p>Yan Xiong was even a bit scared of the 3 million unit stock.</p>
<p>After all, if they didn't sell them all, the losses would be immense.</p>
<p>And it was just a single new game that had been released.</p>
<p>But who could have imagined that this one game alone would make the Switch sell like crazy again?</p>
<p>A stock of 3 million units would actually be more than enough for any single region.</p>
<p>But the key was facing the global market, with domestic and other countries, each region supplied a little bit.</p>
<p>The result was a shortage in every single region.</p>
<p>"Hurry up and replenish stock, and also guard against scalpers," Chen Xu told Yan Xiong.</p>
<p>Domestic scalpers were relatively easy for Nebula Games to combat, thanks to real-name authentication and the verification systems of major e-commerce platforms.</p>
<p>As for abroad, they could only try their best to prevent the consoles from falling into the hands of scalpers.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Mr. Chen, a new batch of goods will be out next week, and the contract manufacturers are also ramping up production," Yan Xiong nodded repeatedly.</p>
<p>A complete production line, and the product itself wasn't high-end technology.</p>
<p>With half a month of overtime and 24-hour, three-shift operations, the production lines of major contract manufacturers would certainly be able to churn out a batch of goods.</p>
<p>Chen Xu nodded gently, then opened his official Weibo account.</p>
<p>He had no choice but to tell players that they genuinely weren't playing monkey tricks; they simply had no stock!</p>
<p>Soon, Chen Xu, Nebula Games, and iQue (which had become a subsidiary of Nebula Games) all successively posted an announcement on their official Weibo accounts.</p>
