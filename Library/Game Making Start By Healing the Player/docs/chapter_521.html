                <h2>Chapter 520: The Witcher Goes Online (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h2>
<p>After watching the trailer for "The Witcher: Wild Hunt," many players felt a bit strange.</p>
<p>Although it was just a promotional trailer, the plot introduction had already revealed quite a bit to players.</p>
<p>Previously, during this vacuum period, the game "The Witcher: Wild Hunt" had continuously built momentum through crossovers with various classic games.</p>
<p>It could be said that like a spring, players' anticipation had been compressed to its extreme.</p>
<p>Now, with the release of "The Witcher: Wild Hunt" trailer, it was as if the hand compressing the spring had been released; players' passion erupted like a volcanic explosion.</p>
<p>Innumerable players instantly transformed into famous detectives like Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot.</p>
<p>They began researching the content of "The Witcher: Wild Hunt." Coupled with the crossover content Chen Xu had previously incorporated into various games, many dedicated fans even collected data to set up a Witch Hunter information station to organize and gather information about the game.</p>
<p>Before this, many players felt it would be a grand, epic work, but after this trailer came out, many were slightly taken aback by the summarized content.</p>
<p>Regarding gameplay, the trailer didn't seem to showcase much.</p>
<p>From the narration, it appeared to be an RPG game with multiple branching options.</p>
<p>Combat system? Gameplay? There didn't seem to be anything particularly special.</p>
<p>So, the only highlight might be the plot, but even through the trailer, the plot didn't reveal much. The only conclusion that could be drawn was that it seemed to be a game about a father looking for his daughter.</p>
<p>This couldn't help but make many players grumble inwardly.</p>
<p>Because why are Nebula Games' recent titles all in this same vein?</p>
<p>"Resident Evil" had a husband looking for his wife, "Hades" had a son looking for his mother, and now in "The Witcher: Wild Hunt," it's a father looking for his daughter.</p>
<p>One could say that fathers, mothers, husbands, wives, sons, and daughters have all been collected!</p>
<p>Of course, some players expressed a little relief. After all, in "Warcraft," Arthas and Jaina had showcased filial piety between children. Now, at least, it has evolved into a harmonious family atmosphere.</p>
<p>This is a small step for Mr. Chen, but a giant leap for the Warrior of Love!</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the FOW side, upon seeing the promotional video for "The Witcher: Wild Hunt," Alex couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief and smile.</p>
<p>Although he had acted very arrogant in previous interviews.</p>
<p>This was mainly because "Wasteland 1978" had performed exceptionally well.</p>
<p>But to say he completely looked down on Nebula Games would be impossible.</p>
<p>And now, he felt he could relax a little.</p>
<p>Because, from what the promotional video for "The Witcher: Wild Hunt" showed, the gameplay aspect didn't seem to have much in the way of unique features. Otherwise, it would definitely have been a primary focus of the promotion.</p>
<p>But for "The Witcher: Wild Hunt," there wasn't much content related to gameplay, clearly indicating that the game didn't offer significant breakthroughs in that area.</p>
<p>As for the plot, based on the content presented so far, it was evident that Geralt of Rivia would be the main playable character.</p>
<p>Combining this with the crossover easter eggs Nebula Games had released during this period.</p>
<p>Finding Ciri and repelling the so-called Wild Hunt was clearly the main quest.</p>
<p>And honestly, Alex didn't think such a plot would be enough for "The Witcher: Wild Hunt" to receive very high reviews.</p>
<p>Because this kind of family-oriented storyline, no matter how well told, would inherently carry less weight.</p>
<p>Unless they could truly depict a complete and grand worldview and portray it vividly.</p>
<p>But could "The Witcher: Wild Hunt" achieve this?</p>
<p>Alex was a bit skeptical. After all, the game's main thread seemed to be a father looking for his daughter; how could such a simple main quest showcase a grand worldview to players?</p>
<p>For these reasons, after watching "The Witcher: Wild Hunt" trailer, Alex felt reassured.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>While players engaged in various discussions and industry designers took a wait-and-see approach,</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games, Chen Xu and his team were meticulously refining the content of "The Witcher: Wild Hunt."</p>
<p>Concurrently, some game developers, following the release of Nebula Games' promotional video, either announced an early launch or suspended their planned promotions.</p>
<p>They essentially wanted to avoid clashing with Nebula Games.</p>
<p>After all, Nebula Games had previously promoted "The Witcher: Wild Hunt" through simple information and crossovers.</p>
<p>Now, with a full promotional video released, many believed that "The Witcher: Wild Hunt" was not far from its final launch.</p>
<p>And indeed, that was the case.</p>
<p>The main story of "The Witcher: Wild Hunt" was largely entering its final stages.</p>
<p>Aside from some minor adjustments still needed, the overall main story was undergoing internal testing.</p>
<p>Ensuring there were no major issues.</p>
<p>Of course, even though the main story was complete, this didn't mean the work was entirely done.</p>
<p>Hearts of Stone and the large DLC, Blood and Wine, which was hailed by players and media in the previous life as 'The Witcher 4,' were also in the subsequent development plans.</p>
<p>Especially 'Blood and Wine'; its content was almost as extensive as the base game itself. And how incredible was this DLC?</p>
<p>It defeated "Dark Souls 3" for the Game of the Year Best RPG award.</p>
<p>Of course, the content of this DLC was not a priority right now.</p>
<p>The focus was currently on the main game's content.</p>
<p>Players didn't have to wait too long. In late May, Chen Xu finally posted an official Weibo account message.</p>
<p>On June 1st, Children's Day, "The Witcher: Wild Hunt" would officially launch.</p>
<p>Upon the release of this news, many players were extremely excited, rushing to the Nebula Games Platform to pre-order immediately.</p>
<p>These players were mostly loyal fans of Chen Xu.</p>
<p>They had extremely high expectations for Nebula Games' new title.</p>
<p>On the other hand, they had been waiting for too long.</p>
<p>Unlike previous Nebula Games titles, "The Witcher: Wild Hunt" had begun its warm-up promotion almost at the beginning of the year, when it was first greenlit for development.</p>
<p>Moreover, the warm-up promotion methods differed from previous games.</p>
<p>It adopted a strategy of collaborating with numerous classic games under Nebula Games, revealing many key details.</p>
<p>These details didn't spoil anything, but merely painted a grand worldview for players.</p>
<p>Seemingly not making grand promises, yet constantly doing so, it truly kept players' appetites piqued.</p>
<p>All players were now eager to enter the world of the Witch Hunter.</p>
<p>To see for themselves what kind of game this would be.</p>
<p>A masterpiece or utterly unremarkable?</p>
