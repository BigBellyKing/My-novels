                <p>Chapter 780: Stop Persecuting Nia!</p>
<p>The game had reached this point, and from a story perspective, many players knew that it was now nearing its end.</p>
<p>Although there was still a lot of content to explore in the game, for instance, each different Titan represented a massive map, and there were also many powerful monsters on these maps that players hadn't touched. Not to mention other things, just the over level 80 Gorilla in Gormott Province and the level 90 Ancient Tyrannosaurus Rex, putting aside their story power and focusing on their in-game strength, just one monster could easily defeat the entire Torna team.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many players, even at this stage, had only managed to collect about ten or so different Blades. There were also the character's Affinity Charts, the Blade's Affinity Charts, and various regional side quests. It's safe to say that in terms of game content, <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em> could definitely keep players grinding for a long time.</p>
<p>However, the story was another matter entirely. Under the battle between Malos and Pyra and Mythra (who had awakened all her powers and transformed into Pneuma), Rex and the others fell from the ruins and arrived at the legendary apocalyptic land: Morytha.</p>
<p>This brand-new scene completely stunned the players who reached it. God, the World Tree, Elysium, along with Alrest, Blades, Titans, and the Cloud Sea – the vast worldview had initially led many players to believe that this would be a fantasy world, similar to one of swords and magic.</p>
<p>Many elements seemed to suggest this to the players. But as the story progressed, especially with the appearance of Siren and Sea Serpent, and Pyra and Mythra fully opening up their hearts to Rex, revealing the gigantic armor: Aion, it all told players one thing: the game's worldview wasn't what they imagined. Swords and magic? Have you ever seen mechs in a sword and magic setting?</p>
<p>And now, reaching Morytha, this new map made many realize that the background of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>'s world might be completely different from what they had imagined. Tornadoes and thunder, Morytha, located in the deepest part of the Cloud Sea, was shrouded in darkness. The most crucial point was that Morytha was filled with modern city ruins, incredibly familiar to players. Collapsed office buildings, ruined highways, buildings and metals melted by thermal warheads – clearly, this was once a world of incredibly advanced technology.</p>
<p>Combining this with the previous mentions of a so-called God, a Gundam-like figure, and a cutscene of a future world, Song Ren had a rather bold idea: that the so-called Aegis and devices like Siren and Sea Serpent were all weapons of war created by past humanity. Had a highly technologically advanced human civilization engaged in civil war due to resources or other reasons, ultimately leading to its collapse? Or perhaps it was attacked by hostile civilizations from space, like the various eerie monsters in Morytha.</p>
<p>Playing up to this point, Song Ren speculated about the game's worldview based on the information he had gathered. He didn't pay much attention to the main plot, as it was a classic righteous hot-blooded protagonist group's adventure, which, for a player his age, wasn't unappealing, but it no longer held much of that astonishing or intriguing feeling. Instead, compared to the game's main story, he was more concerned about whether Nia could reverse her fate or end up a loser... no, a loser cat.</p>
<p>Continuing to push the game's story, Malos, previously an enemy, also fell into Morytha. At a critical moment, Rex saved Malos, and after making a pact, they worked together to find a way out of this deadly place. Along the way, Malos also revealed the truth: Maipeni's conspiracy. After the Aegis War five hundred years ago, Malos was defeated, and the hero Addam, fearing Pyra and Mythra's power, decided to seal them away. However, after this, Maipeni attacked the survivors of Torna, and Malos's Driver, Laura, also died as a result.</p>
<p>"As expected, as long as it's a game, the Praetorium will definitely not be the good guys." Song Ren wasn't surprised listening to Malos reveal the truth. He had found many hints earlier that the Praetor Maipeni was not a good person. And thinking about it carefully, out of ten games, nine linked to a Praetorium or similar religious institution usually featured villains.</p>
<p>As the story progressed, Malos was taken by a Torna battleship, and Rex and the others headed towards the World Tree. Approaching it, unlike its distant appearance as a towering tree, the World Tree's interior was a sci-fi space station. At this point, Maipeni also controlled the Titans of Mor Ardain, Kingdom of Uraya, and other nations to attack the Torna main body and the World Tree.</p>
<p>At a critical juncture, Sadayhiko, who had remained outside the World Tree, suddenly stepped forward. Unlike others who followed Malos, he merely sought revenge against Praetor Maipeni.</p>
<p>Song Ren didn't show much emotional fluctuation during the subsequent plot involving Malos and Maipeni. As a traditional RPG, this storyline was quite conventional. After defeating Malos, Rex engaged in a debate, and at the crucial moment, Praetor Maipeni, who harbored a deep grudge against Malos, appeared and killed two other members of Torna. Finally, Malos, thinking of Laura, dragged his heavily injured body, exhausted all his life force to maximize his attack power, and died alongside Maipeni, his sworn enemy. In the end, he understood everything and entrusted Rex to stop Malos.</p>
<p>However, for Song Ren, his concern wasn't about this. He realized that even at this point, the game's systems and mechanics still seemed to be persecuting Nia.</p>
<p>Here, the game unlocked a brand-new Blade attack, called the three-person combo special move. It sounded very cool, and the conditions for its use were to have Nia participate as a Blade, and for Pyra and Mythra and Nia's combat bonds to be at their highest level, then use a Level 4 special move. The animation was very cool, but the damage was heartbreakingly low. Song Ren felt it wasn't even as strong as a Level 1 special move.</p>
<p>Combined with Rex's previous line to Nia, '<em>I love Nia, and everyone</em>,' and his confession to Pyra and Mythra in a completely different context, along with Nia's endurance stat in her Affinity Chart, Song Ren felt that Nia was being persecuted once again.</p>
<p>With a sigh about Nia's continued persecution, Song Ren guided Rex and his party towards Elysium. But Elysium, at this moment, was not the endless oasis Rex had imagined; it was a wasteland. The once beautiful Elysium was now just ruins. Following the sound of a bell, the group arrived before God's room, getting closer to God's location. But then, Rex suddenly realized that everyone around him had disappeared.</p>
<p>He successively encountered Nia, Mòrag, Zeke, and Tora, all of whom spoke harshly to him, provoking Rex. All of this was an experiment by 'God'; these were all projections of others' deepest fears.</p>
<p>Then, 'God' recounted the origin of this world. It turned out that the place called Morytha was once Earth. Countless years ago, a high-tech cosmic survival war had broken out. 'God' was once a mad scientist named Klaus, who ambitiously tried to use the Trinity Processor to control a substance from a higher dimension called the 'Conduit.' He naively believed this substance could selectively channel infinite possibilities from parallel universes into the worldline desired by the wish-maker, seeing it as an opportunity to change the world.</p>
<p>So, ignoring all warnings, he forcibly opened the Conduit. But because the ideal world in his mind had zero possibility of existence, the old world collapsed during the channeling process, and as a result, all of humanity and the essence within the Trinity Processor disappeared forever into a distant dimension, leaving behind only souls, rationality, ruins, and his other half. His other half vanished into a distant dimension, leaving only half of his body filled with regret. He hoped to create a world that could continue, to atone for his sins.</p>
<p>Therefore, he created the Cloud Sea – nanomachines that decomposed the old world's matter and converted it into new world matter. He then cast Core Crystals, containing all life information, into the Cloud Sea to form new life and an ecological cycle. Simultaneously, he created the Blades, transforming souls and rationality into the Aegis, managing the Blades' information. Through interaction with humans, the Blades produced information exchanges, eventually transforming into Titans carrying complete information, giving rise to new life.</p>
<p>Despite guessing everything, Song Ren was still amazed when the true worldview was revealed before him. This truly exceeded his imagination; he had initially thought it was a fantasy game, but it turned out to be a science fiction game?</p>
<p>And thinking about it carefully, many things could now be explained. For example, Malos's own data being lost, forcing him to steal data from Pyra and Mythra. And he very insidiously used a 'cut' instead of a 'copy,' thankfully Pyra and Mythra had a backup, which allowed her to revive. Also, Maipeni's earlier trip to the World Tree to steal the core could be understood as stealing a CPU. Since it was stolen, he could only try to use it, and because he didn't know the model, he accidentally blew up the machine.</p>
<p>Then, for some unknown reason, this CPU fell into Addam's hands. Compared to Maipeni, Rex's CPU came from a much more legitimate source; he used it honorably and even dared to consult the manufacturer and original seller on how to overclock it. Of course, putting aside these plot points, what impressed Song Ren the most was that even at this moment, the game still hadn't given up on persecuting Nia.</p>
<p>Aside from the previous '<em>I love Nia, and everyone</em>' and the 'turtle head' comment in the Mor Ardain Empire, Klaus's illusion just now could also be considered an iconic scene.</p>
<p>'<em>Pyra, Pyra, Pyra, you're always like this!</em>'</p>
<p>'<em>You only ever look at her, ignoring everything else!</em>'</p>
<p>'<em>I'm right here! Why can't you see me? Look at me! Just look at me, Rex!</em>'</p>
<p>Complete defeat!</p>
<p>Even though it was just an illusion, with Nia saying those words, in this battle for Rex, she had no chance left.</p>
