                <p>Chapter 638: You're a Logic Freak! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>“Old Zhang, have you guys arrived?”</p>
<p>Song Ren, who had just painfully learned his skills, looked at Zhang Yi and the others, who were already level ten, and asked curiously.</p>
<p>Not just Zhang Yi, even Joey said she had already run all the way to Ironforge and revived with a resurrection sickness. So how come the four of them hadn't arrived after such a long time?</p>
<p>“Ahem... we're almost there, running through the Deeprun Tram Tunnel.” Zhang Yi, as the representative of the four, stepped forward and lightly coughed, explaining.</p>
<p>On the other end of the voice chat, Song Ren, who had just passed through Mirror Lake and Westfall Fortress, arrived in Westfall after scouting the area and planning his route, looking bewildered.</p>
<p>What kind of move was this?</p>
<p>Didn't they say they were taking the subway? What was this about running all the way?</p>
<p>Song Ren, who had never taken the subway, couldn't fully understand what Zhang Yi and the others meant.</p>
<p>“Old Song, you don't know, there's a body of water midway through the subway ride, it's incredibly beautiful, and in the middle section, there's a huge BOSS that looks like a long-necked dragon passing by. That fleeting glimpse was absolutely captivating.” Zhang Yi explained the reason.</p>
<p>The first time the four of them gathered to head to Stormwind, they saw the stunning scenery of the body of water through the subway, and the mysterious water monster BOSS, Nessie. Everyone was amazed.</p>
<p>Then they saw some players jump off midway, wanting to get a clearer look at what the BOSS actually looked like.</p>
<p>So, the four of them put their heads together and jumped down too.</p>
<p>However, they found that the water area was inaccessible, something only to be seen. The subway had already departed, leaving them with two choices: Hearthstone back or keep running forward through the tunnel.</p>
<p>Clearly, the four of them chose the latter.</p>
<p>“You four…” Song Ren was utterly speechless.</p>
<p>To say it was far wasn't entirely accurate. Song Ren had been wandering around Stormwind for about ten minutes, and had even made a bit of money at the Auction House.</p>
<p>He had discovered that some rookie players, who didn't know anything, would just throw items onto the Auction House. Some of these newbies even listed items for less than what an NPC vendor would pay.</p>
<p>He was reselling items and actually earned 10 silver coins.</p>
<p>The only regrettable thing was that the Auction Houses in different cities didn't seem to be linked, so there wasn't much inventory. Also, he didn't know how much many of the items were worth, so he didn't dare to buy them for reselling.</p>
<p>“Old Song, where are you?” Zhang Yi’s voice came through the voice channel as Song Ren was still contemplating making money as a reseller.</p>
<p>“Let's gather at the Inn next to the Bank. You guys can bind your Hearthstone there too,” Song Ren replied.</p>
<p>Stormwind was a very familiar sight to everyone. There was no need to ask the guards, and soon everyone met at the entrance of the Inn.</p>
<p>“Haha, your Dwarf looks completely different from the one in the trailer!” Looking at Zhang Yi, who only reached his knees, Song Ren couldn't help but burst out laughing at the door.</p>
<p>It was simply too comical. Although the Dwarf looked muscular and strong, compared to the CG animation, Zhang Yi's character looked a bit dated. As for the Dwarf Auntie, there was no need to even mention it, especially since Wang Han chose twin pigtails for her character.</p>
<p>As for Wang Yifan's Gnome, it wasn't much better. The only character that could be considered good-looking was the Elf.</p>
<p>“Oh, cut it out! We call this being honest and dependable. Besides, Old Song, where's your Warrior's shield? What kind of Warrior goes without a shield?” Zhang Yi couldn't help but complain to Song Ren.</p>
<p>“Look around, where are all these Warriors' shields? That's all money for learning skills! You criticize me for not having a shield, but I'm complaining too!” Song Ren also felt a pang of helplessness.</p>
<p>Where did the shield go?</p>
<p>Before he discovered reselling at the Auction House, he simply didn't have enough silver coins. To learn skills, he sold everything to the vendors.</p>
<p>“You’re really struggling,” Wang Yifan couldn't help but sigh, then took out 10 silver coins from his trade pouch: “Buy yourself something good to eat and drink.”</p>
<p>“Don't bother! I'm not that short on money!” Song Ren immediately refused. How could he take money from a friend for such a trivial amount? Besides, it was only 10 silver coins. If it were one gold coin, he'd definitely take it!</p>
<p>“But I wonder when they'll start selling game time cards? When that happens, I'll sell a couple of time cards, and then I'll be fully geared up!” Song Ren mused.</p>
<p>Nebula Games had not yet announced any related content in this regard.</p>
<p>However, even though the game had only been open for its first day, the forums and related communities already had many players expressing their anticipation.</p>
<p>How many of them were Warrior players was unclear.</p>
<p>“Cut it out, Old Song,” Zhang Yi said.</p>
<p>“Honestly, if I were to sell game time cards, I feel like it would be a five-way win situation!” Song Ren exclaimed.</p>
<p>How was it a five-way win?</p>
<p>First, his own game experience would improve. He would have money to buy and repair equipment, buy potions, and learn skills – that’s the first win. With potions and equipment, his efficiency in fighting monsters and running dungeons would increase – that’s the second win. The players who bought his time cards would successfully exchange in-game gold for game time, saving them real money and allowing them to play for free – that’s the third win. At the same time, with the money from selling time cards and the transaction fees, Nebula Games, or rather Mr. Chen, would earn even more money. Mr. Chen would profit – that’s the fourth win. Finally, if “World of Warcraft” makes a lot of money, Mr. Chen’s game company won't go bankrupt. With money, they can develop even better games, allowing players worldwide to enjoy interesting games – that’s the fifth win!</p>
<p>“Old Song, seriously… I’m actually speechless!” Wang Yifan was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“Old Song, are you a logic freak?”</p>
<p>“Seriously… 'Logic genius' can't even begin to describe you, Old Song.”</p>
<p>Wang Han and Joey were also speechless.</p>
<p>“Get outta here with that!” Zhang Yi jumped on the spot, making a motion of hitting his head.</p>
<p>“So, according to your logic, Old Song, I think you could add a few more wins. If Mr. Chen’s company can’t make a profit, then it’ll go bankrupt. Nebula Games, plus all the outsourced employees and various industry chains, would all be affected!”</p>
<p>“This would then impact the entire gaming industry, just like the great gaming crash of the last century, radiating from the game industry to the entertainment industry, and then affecting the global economy, leading to a new financial crisis. And the origin of all this would be that one game time card of yours.”</p>
<p>Listening to Zhang Yi, Song Ren nodded: “I think that makes a lot of sense!”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on! Just stick to practicing two gathering professions and earn money by Mining,” Zhang Yi said.</p>
<p>The group chuckled and joked as they prepared to head to Westfall to level up.</p>
<p>Arriving in Westfall, Song Ren once again encountered the Murlocs he hated so much he ground his teeth.</p>
<p>However, with a full party, including a Priest and a Paladin, these monsters posed no threat whatsoever.</p>
<p>There were quite a few players in Westfall, but fewer than in the starting zone, and Westfall was also quite large, so there was no shortage of monsters to kill.</p>
<p>The only slightly troublesome aspect was the uneven distribution of quest monster levels in Westfall.</p>
<p>The range was too wide, from level 10 to level 18.</p>
<p>But the rewards were decent, especially one quest that gave a four-slot bag. The Coastline's Threat quest even gave three green-tier items.</p>
<p>After clearing a series of quests, the group had also reached level 18.</p>
<p>Through the Brotherhood quests, Song Ren and his friends also learned the location of the first dungeon.</p>
<p>It was the Deadmines, located in Moonbrook.</p>
