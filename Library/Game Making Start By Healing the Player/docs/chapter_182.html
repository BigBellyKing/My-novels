                <p>Chapter 181: What great storms haven't I seen? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Song Ren, located at the Firelink Shrine, was also filled with curiosity.</p>
<p>Because everything before him was completely different from the previous game. Except for the name 'Firelink Shrine', perhaps only the bonfire newly lit on the ground could still hint at its former self. There were no Thrones of the Lords of Cinder, and the entire Firelink Shrine was surprisingly open-air, surrounded by collapsed ruins and broken walls. The only thing he saw was an NPC sitting on a wooden stump, looking like a mercenary.</p>
<p>'Oh! You've come at just the right time. It's been a long while since I've seen a newcomer.'</p>
<p>'I bet you've probably come for those things, haven't you? The accursed Undead's mission and such... Everyone's the same.'</p>
<p>'When you're cursed, everything's over. Staying in the Northern Undead Asylum is the wise choice... You've suffered!'</p>
<p>'But it doesn't matter anyway. I'm idle, so I might as well teach you a thing or two.'</p>
<p>'In the accursed Undead's mission, the Bells of Awakening mentioned are two in total.'</p>
<p>'One of them is above this very spot, in the Bell Tower of the Undead Church; the other is deep underground, in the ancient ruins beneath Blighttown.'</p>
<p>'They say that once these two bells are rung, certain things will happen, but... who knows what that will be?'</p>
<p>'At least for me, I've never heard what happened afterwards... It doesn't really matter anyway.'</p>
<p>'Get going, then. Haven't you come to this accursed land of the accursed Undead precisely for this?'</p>
<p>'Hehehehe...'</p>
<p>With the simple dialogue, Song Ren immediately understood that this mercenary-like NPC was essentially the Crestfallen Warrior of this installment. Moreover, compared to the Crestfallen Warrior from the previous game, this guy in front of him clearly had more to say. There was also a crucial point: the Crestfallen Warrior from the previous game was merely disheartened. This Crestfallen Warrior, however, was also sarcastic, and his words even sounded like he was being snide towards him. Remarks like "preparing for suffering," "isn't it all just for suffering," and that final "hehehehe" made him feel even more targeted by the subtle mockery. It was like chatting with someone, and they send a system-generated 'smile' emoji, or just reply with "hehe." It always felt intensely sarcastic and mocking!</p>
<p>For a moment, looking at the Knight's Broadsword in his hand, Song Ren wanted to stab him. But at the critical moment, he held back. Primarily because he remembered the Crestfallen Warrior from the previous game; he had thought he was a weakling. But after attacking him three times, he was immediately taught a lesson in return, and even cornered and killed in the Firelink Shrine. What's more, Dark Souls also had a setting where opening the bonfire interface or the inventory interface did not pause time. This meant that in the Firelink Shrine, he had no time to light a bonfire and warp elsewhere, ultimately just getting hacked to death.</p>
<p>However, from his mouth, Song Ren still obtained some useful information, for instance, one of the two Bells of Awakening was in the Undead Church's Bell Tower and the other was in the ancient ruins beneath Blighttown. This perfectly matched the information given by the knight in the prison cell earlier, only he didn't currently know where the Undead Church's Bell Tower and Blighttown were. But since it mentioned underground, he would definitely need to go underground. Afterwards, Song Ren looked around the Firelink Shrine. However, something felt off: the Fire Keeper was gone.</p>
<p>Moreover, at the bonfire, he could surprisingly level up directly without needing to find the Fire Keeper. This was originally the Fire Keeper's function! Could it be that the Fire Keeper NPC was removed? But that shouldn't be the case! The Fire Keeper was a very popular NPC in the Dark Souls series. Many players were even drawn into the world of Dark Souls simply because they were attracted to the Fire Keeper maiden. A character like that directly removed? Impossible!</p>
<p>Song Ren explored everywhere in the Firelink Shrine, picking up three Humanities and one Firebomb along the way. Like the Firelink Shrine in the previous game, many surrounding areas were accessible, and there were also some Hollows. However, what surprised Song Ren was that when he accidentally stepped into a dark pit and fell, thinking he would die from the fall, he surprisingly found many treasure chests below. Due to the painful experiences with Mimics in the previous game, Song Ren was prepared, always attacking the chests first. But to his surprise, all these treasure chests were real, although they didn't contain anything particularly good. He only got a Red Eye Orb, a Spiked Mace, a few Bone Shards, and an Amulet. The entire Firelink Shrine wasn't very large, but it was like an elevator, divided into several levels. After wandering around, Song Ren felt a little lost.</p>
<p>However, he did find the Fire Keeper maiden he had been looking for. But she seemed to be locked in a prison, and there was no dialogue. Wandering around the Firelink Shrine like a marketplace, Song Ren clearly felt the differences from the previous game. That is, the map was much more complex, and the next stage didn't seem to be accessed by bonfire teleportation. In the previous game, to go to the first High Wall of Lothric, you would just teleport directly from the Firelink Shrine. But now, the teleportation icon on the bonfire was grayed out, clearly indicating that some condition needed to be met to teleport. This was also something Chen Xu added in the UI; after all, he wanted to give players something to look forward to—that the game actually had a teleportation function, but you just couldn't use it yet in the early stages. As for when it could be used? That was irrelevant to Chen Xu; it depended on the players' own efforts!</p>
<p>After wandering around the Firelink Shrine for a long time, Song Ren felt very frustrated, because he had no idea where to go. However, he did find a path lined with many tombstones, which he had discovered earlier after getting the treasure chests. And as he passed by, the skeletons on the ground would immediately gather, looking very eerie. Cautiously luring a Skeleton Soldier, Song Ren found that this small enemy had quite a bit of health. It took five or six hits to defeat it, but using the Spiked Mace he had found earlier, even though its base attack was only two points higher than the broadsword, it dealt more damage to the skeletons, clearly due to the weapon's striking damage attribute. "It's indeed a bit harder than the previous game; the new monsters have more health! Also, it seems I'm supposed to go to Undead Burg and the underground ruins next, which sounds related to death and the underground, so this path should lead to Undead Burg?" Song Ren looked at the path, making guesses internally.</p>
<p>But no matter what, he would just take a look. And as an experienced Firelinker, what kind of great storms hadn't he seen?</p>
