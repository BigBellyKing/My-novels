                <p>Chapter 68: Games Ruined Me!</p>
<p>After a few simple tutorial levels, the game officially entered story mode.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi and Wang Han, the two of them, chatted and laughed as they played the game.</p>
<p>The first few levels were very simple. Orders for customers would appear in the upper left corner; they just needed to complete each dish on time and place the finished dish in the serving window.</p>
<p>The first two levels were incredibly easy, nothing more than slicing sashimi or, for a slightly more complex task, cooking rice.</p>
<p>But as they reached Level 1-4, Zhang Yi and Wang Han clearly felt a change.</p>
<p>In this level, the game's background moved to the middle of a busy road.</p>
<p>Hmm... never mind why they had to cook in the middle of a busy road.</p>
<p>Anyway, that was the setting.</p>
<p>A truly excellent chef should be able to cook anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Only by focusing all attention on cooking can one be a good chef.</p>
<p>In this level, it was different from before.</p>
<p>Most of the scene was blocked by stoves, and the walkable path was shaped like a horizontal Chinese character '日' (sun/day).</p>
<p>But the key difference from before was that the paths above and below had one-way acceleration conveyor belts.</p>
<p>Moreover, the dishes requested by customers were no longer just sashimi that needed slicing or rice that just needed cooking.</p>
<p>Slicing, steaming, boiling, stir-frying—not a single technique was left out.</p>
<p>If the goal for this level was simply to pass it, it was actually quite simple. Filling the four plates in the middle and serving them would satisfy one condition for passing.</p>
<p>But obviously, their goal was no longer just to pass the level, but to aim for a higher score and a three-star rating.</p>
<p>And as the levels progressed, the rate at which orders increased grew faster and faster, and there were more and more of them.</p>
<p>Before one task was finished, another dish would come in.</p>
<p>“Cook the rice quickly!”</p>
<p>“Hold on! Hold on! What are you rushing for! This cucumber isn't sliced yet!”</p>
<p>“Where's the seaweed! And why isn't this fish sliced!”</p>
<p>“Stop rushing me! This conveyor belt carried me too far!”</p>
<p>“Hurry up and cook the rice! The order time is almost up!”</p>
<p>Compared to the sweet and tender scenes from before, as the orders increased, from their initial orderly pace, the two of them started to feel a bit overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Especially with the appearance of new orders and the urging from existing customers, their hearts immediately grew anxious.</p>
<p>And a more crucial point was.</p>
<p>That both of them had their own ideas; one wanted to cook the rice first, the other wanted to slice the ingredients first.</p>
<p>Suddenly, their rhythm was completely disrupted.</p>
<p>In an instant, both of them became a little flustered.</p>
<p>“Hey! Why did you make so much seaweed!?”</p>
<p>“Don't you need seaweed for sushi?!”</p>
<p>“The seaweed just needs to be plated, there's no rush at all, you cook the rice first!”</p>
<p>“I'm cooking, I'm cooking, stop nagging me! Look at you, always wandering around, slice the vegetables!”</p>
<p>“Aren't I waiting for you to cook the rice? How can I combine the sliced vegetables without the rice!”</p>
<p>“Wait, why is it on fire! Fire extinguisher, fire extinguisher!”</p>
<p>“It's right next to the stove, where are you running to!”</p>
<p>“Hurry up and put out the fire! You saw the fire extinguisher, why don't you pick it up and put out the fire!”</p>
<p>“Conveyor belt, conveyor belt! This conveyor belt is carrying me automatically, wait a moment, don't rush!”</p>
<p>“Plates, quickly wash the plates! We're out of plates!”</p>
<p>“Why do we have to wash plates now! This customer is so picky, wouldn't it be fine to just reuse them!”</p>
<p>“Do you think this is an Indian kitchen? Would you be happy to eat food served on unwashed plates! Stop talking nonsense and wash the dishes quickly!!”</p>
<p>“You're washing dishes way too slowly, aren't you?”</p>
<p>As orders piled up and waiting customers grew increasingly agitated, the situation became even more chaotic and frantic.</p>
<p>And when things got chaotic, problems escalated.</p>
<p>One by one, the orders on the upper-left screen blared alarms and then disappeared.</p>
<p>The rice cooking on the stoves, one by one, turned into mountains of flames.</p>
<p>And in the game, if the fire wasn't extinguished promptly with a fire extinguisher, it would still spread.</p>
<p>Finally, the entire kitchen was engulfed in flames, and time ran out.</p>
<p>The score they achieved only amounted to a two-star rating.</p>
<p>“Just a tiny bit more and we would've gotten three stars!” Looking at the final two-star rating, Wang Han wore an expression of regret.</p>
<p>“We were half a score short. That’s not 'a tiny bit', that’s clearly 'a bazillion bit'!” Zhang Yi, standing nearby, quipped.</p>
<p>“What could I do? Your fire extinguisher sprayed for ages and still didn't put out the fire.” Looking at the computer screen, Wang Han pouted.</p>
<p>“Hey! How can you blame me? Weren't you the one who didn't notice the rice was about to catch fire?” Zhang Yi was a bit displeased, declaring that he couldn't be the scapegoat.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Wang Han also felt a bit unconvinced and clearly had her own reasons.</p>
<p>“How can you blame me for the rice catching fire? Weren't you taking forever to slice a single vegetable! And I even had to help you!” Wang Han snorted.</p>
<p>“How can you blame me? Weren't you always blocking me on the conveyor belt! And you even threw one of the dishes away!” Zhang Yi's voice gradually grew louder.</p>
<p>“Wasn't I in a hurry! And speaking of, the first time the kitchen caught fire, weren't you the one who didn't notice? How can you blame it on me!” Wang Han was indignant.</p>
<p>“The first time it caught fire, weren't you the one who didn't know where to wash the plates? You couldn't even wash one plate properly for ages! And I even had to help you!” Zhang Yi also snorted.</p>
<p>“Are you yelling at me?” Wang Han's cheeks puffed out.</p>
<p>“I'm not yelling at you, we're just talking about the matter at hand!” Zhang Yi was also a bit defiant, feeling it wasn't his fault.</p>
<p>“Fine! Are you saying I wash plates slowly?” Wang Han's eyes widened.</p>
<p>“That's right! You do wash plates a bit slowly!” Zhang Yi nodded.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by that, are you looking down on me for washing dishes slowly?” Wang Han clenched her small fists.</p>
<p>“That's right, you're really too slow at washing dishes!” Zhang Yi said with a confident expression.</p>
<p>“Fine, since you're so particular about me, from now on, I won't wash the plates and bowls at home. You can wash all of them!” Wang Han suddenly raised her voice.</p>
<p>Hearing her voice suddenly rise and recalling their recent argument, Zhang Yi felt a surge of defiance.</p>
<p>What does that mean? Why are you shouting so loudly?</p>
<p>Not getting three stars wasn't entirely his fault for holding them back!</p>
<p>Without another word, Zhang Yi shot up to his feet, his face beet red, and said in an even louder voice: “I'll wash them, I'll wash them. From now on, don't wash any plates at home, just leave them all to me. I'll show you what efficiency is, what speed is!”</p>
<p>After instinctively blurting it out, Zhang Yi froze for a moment.</p>
<p>Wait, something seemed wrong.</p>
<p>What did he just say?</p>
<p>His stubbornness and defiance had clouded his mind, making him seemingly make an extraordinary promise just now?</p>
<p>“Since you insist on saying that, then, dear Zhang Yi, from now on, all the plates at home are yours. Let me see what efficiency and speed truly mean!” Wang Han patted Zhang Yi's shoulder meaningfully.</p>
<p>“No! What I meant was...” Zhang Yi's eyes widened.</p>
<p>“Don't say another word! Those who understand, understand; those who don't, won't even if I explain. It's decided then! After all, you strongly requested it yourself!” Wang Han pulled Zhang Yi's hand back to the mouse and keyboard and refused to talk about washing dishes.</p>
<p>Games ruined me!</p>
<p>Looking at the screen of <em>Overcooked</em> with its various cartoon characters, Zhang Yi felt utterly 'desperate'.</p>
<p>What the heck is this game!</p>
<p>Where was the promised warmth, where was the promised camaraderie?</p>
<p>Why did things suddenly escalate so intensely?</p>
<p>If it weren't for that sudden argument that clouded his mind with defiance, how could he have agreed to such an unfair pact!</p>
<p>The key thing was, he was the one who eagerly signed it himself!</p>
<p>However, compared to Zhang Yi and Wang Han, the performance of many other players in the game was far more filled with tension.</p>
<p>Writing to this point, I got the idea of wanting to play a two-player game with my girlfriend, but then I remembered I don't even have one~ T_T~</p>
