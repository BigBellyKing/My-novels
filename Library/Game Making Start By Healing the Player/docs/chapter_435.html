                <p>Chapter 434: Game Launch (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Looking at some of the information released by Nebula Games, many players and industry game designers were quite surprised.</p>
<p>At first, both players and industry designers subconsciously believed that the game Uncharted would be an open-world action-adventure game. After all, in the entire gaming industry, if anyone could be said to best represent open-world games, all players and industry designers would undoubtedly mention Chen Xu.</p>
<p>But to everyone's surprise, it turned out to be a linear game. Although this explained why Uncharted's graphics were so phenomenal, the key question was whether players would accept it.</p>
<p>Even Atari was surprised when they learned that Nebula Games' latest work, Uncharted, was a linear game.</p>
<p>After all, the trend in the gaming industry for the past two years has been open worlds, especially since it had only been less than half a year since The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild launched. Many game designers felt that players should still be quite enthusiastic about open-world games. But under such circumstances, Nebula Games actually made a linear game?</p>
<p>One can only say, it truly lives up to Nebula Games' reputation!</p>
<p>In Atari's Element World project team, the designer in charge of the project, Antorini, was filled with emotion. The year before last, although his Beautiful World lost to Red Dead Redemption, he felt that while the game lost, he himself did not. After all, Beautiful World actually received some positive feedback from players in terms of gameplay.</p>
<p>And he believed that if Atari had trusted him at the time, with the gimmick of cowboys battling robots, it might have been able to make a genre shift. Antorini felt that directly competing with Red Dead Redemption in pure Western and cowboy themes might not have been a match. But the key was that they didn't necessarily have to directly compete; by adding a multiplayer mode and subsequent DLC story content. Coupled with the game's inherent theme of robots versus cowboys, later, it might even lean towards sci-fi, adopting a sci-fi Western facade.</p>
<p>At the same time, Antorini also had a slight regret last year: Chen Xu hadn't developed any VR games, denying him a chance for a rematch, which left him quite disappointed. But he never expected that this time, by sheer coincidence, they would clash again! The only difference was that this time, the overall game genre was different.</p>
<p>Antorini felt that his open-world theme gave him a significant advantage! Even if he won, it would feel a bit like an unfair victory!</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games, Chen Xu was unaware of Antorini's positive mindset at Atari.</p>
<p>Uncharted was simply proceeding with its promotion and advertising as planned. Atari, on the other hand, was also relentlessly promoting their game. The top one or two hot topics in the entire gaming community were basically monopolized by Uncharted and Element World.</p>
<p>As for NetDragon's Shadow Operations: Communication Interrupted, it was fairly unremarkable, with some warm-up but not on a large scale, just maintaining a steady level of hype. It was clear they wanted to avoid Nebula Games' and Atari's new releases. The same applied to other game developers.</p>
<p>After all, Nebula Games and Atari were old rivals.</p>
<p>Amidst the global attention of players, Uncharted was the first to announce its launch date. It would officially be released on May 1st.</p>
<p>After Nebula Games announced this news, Atari, which had been aggressively promoting against Nebula Games, went silent for a long time.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they couldn't keep up with the development schedule!</p>
<p>Looking at Uncharted's release date, Antorini in Atari's Element World project office felt like he was punching cotton. At the current pace, Element World would need at least another half a month to complete its content development. And even after development was complete, it didn't mean it could launch; it still needed pre-release testing.</p>
<p>Although Uncharted was a linear game, and indeed had much less workload compared to an open-world game, "But Nebula Games, your speed is just too fast, isn't it? Did you put rockets up your butts?"</p>
<p>Antorini was filled with frustration.</p>
<p>As for Element World's promotion? "Let's pause for now." After all, promoting it at this time would actually be helping Nebula Games.</p>
<p>And with Element World's promotional silence, players online were also speechless. They had originally expected Element World to soon follow up with a game launch announcement, then go head-to-head with Nebula Games in a real fight. "But then you suddenly went silent?"</p>
<p>Judging by previous performances, Atari had clearly been very aggressive and shouldn't be afraid of Nebula Games. "But what's the reason for the sudden silence now? It's nothing more than the game not being finished. If you haven't finished development, why were you promoting it so fervently before, as if you wanted the whole world to focus on you? Were you just playing tricks? Making it seem so real!"</p>
<p>Many players online who had been looking forward to Element World were frustrated. Meanwhile, players anticipating Uncharted were celebrating with gongs, drums, and firecrackers.</p>
<p>Of course, it wasn't all anticipation; many players also felt a bit uneasy. Because during this period, Uncharted's promotion also revealed quite a few things to players. Content regarding technology and gameplay was secondary; what worried players more was the game's subtitle.</p>
<p>Just like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Red Dead Redemption, Super Mario Odyssey, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Uncharted also had a subtitle, which was revealed during the promotion: A Thief's End. The moment this title was released, many players' hearts immediately trembled.</p>
<p>And below Chen Xu's official Weibo account, many players were also commenting. But this time, Chen Xu showed no intention of replying at all. Instantly, many players became pessimistic. They all stated that Nathan Drake was "done for," and the only point of concern was exactly how Nathan Drake would meet his end in the game.</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>In Nebula Games' break room, Yang Xin and others watched Chen Xu, who was scrolling through his official Weibo, with surprise.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, players online are misunderstanding you so much this time, aren't you going to reply?" Ruan Ningxue asked curiously. In the past, whenever players misunderstood him, Chen Xu would always reply immediately. Now the game hadn't even been released, players had already assumed the protagonist would die at the end, yet they all knew that Uncharted: A Thief's End was completely different from what players imagined – it was actually a rather cheerful story. How could Chen Xu not step forward in this situation?</p>
<p>"When players all think it's a game that will break their hearts, and then they discover it has a happy ending, that's when they'll truly feel a sufficient amount of surprise," Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Of course, there was one more thing he didn't say in his mind. That was: now players misunderstood him, but when the ending was revealed, that misunderstanding would turn into guilt, and his "giver of heartbreak" label among players would naturally become blurred. Everything was under control!</p>
