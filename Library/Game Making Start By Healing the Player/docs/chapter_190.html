<h1>Chapter 189: Are You Being Polite? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h1>
<p>With the update of the brand-new 'Death Mode', many Firelinkers became interested.</p>
<p>After all, nearly a month had passed since Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame launched. Furthermore, unlike when Dark Souls was first released last year, even though Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame's initial maps and related settings were more malicious, it completely failed to deter players who had already awakened certain special constitutions. In fact, for them, the more malicious it was, the more excited they became!</p>
<p>In such circumstances, various maps and corresponding video guides emerged much earlier than for its predecessor. For example, regarding strategy guides, the previous game generally didn't have reliable guides until almost the end of the second week. But for Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame, guides for the Asylum Demon, Firelink Shrine, and part of the Undead Burg were already out on the very first day.</p>
<p>In less than a week, some hardcore players and high-level players had already successfully completed their first playthrough. Although many side quests and hidden content had not been discovered, the general route to completion and strategies for each BOSS were mostly figured out. Subsequently, guides like getting the Daddy Head, the Guandao, exchanging Light Stones with the Bird's Nest to upgrade the Guandao to +4, and starting with 449 stats, led many players to complete their first playthrough early.</p>
<p>For instance, facing the High Wall Taurus Demon on the Undead Burg wall, the Pure Love Warriors all expressed their anger, directly KO'ing it with a single dual-wielded Guandao strike from the second floor, allowing players to finally experience the thrill of one-shotting a BOSS. The experience was truly excellent. Many players even joked that these settings made Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame truly become a hack-and-slash game.</p>
<p>Therefore, Chen Xu chose this moment to release the brand-new mode.</p>
<p>After experiencing the joy, it’s always time to feel that familiar “Souls flavor”!</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Like all Dark Souls players, Song Ren and Zhang Yi were also analyzing the brand-new 'Death Mode'.</p>
<p>"This Death Mode feels really tough! And it even has a first-kill achievement, which means it definitely won't be easy to beat!" Song Ren voiced his opinion.</p>
<p>"That's for sure. For ordinary players, the random mode is actually more interesting, and in Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame, coupled with these interconnected maps, I feel the random mode might be even more fun," Zhang Yi shared his thoughts. The random gameplay in the previous game already felt very fun, but in Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame, because all sorts of maps are interconnected, combined with random gameplay, Zhang Yi felt it should be even more interesting. This was because there was more room for choice. After all, this random mode itself is designed to work with the game's maps to give players an experience. And in Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame, by choosing the Master Key as a starting item, upon leaving the Undead Asylum and reaching Firelink Shrine, the options were simply too numerous: Undead Burg, Catacombs, New Londo Ruins, or parkouring through the Valley of Drakes to Blighttown. Combined with random mode, every single location brings a huge surprise!</p>
<p>"Also, depending on the weapon, there will be some numerical balance once inside. This means you can't just rely on gear to steamroll; it's all about the player's skill. Even if a player's equipment isn't very good, special adjustments will still be made, but the characteristics of different builds and playstyles will still be present," Wang Han added from the side.</p>
<p>"What about items? Aren't there items that grant buffs? This mode should allow item usage, right?" Wang Yifan reminded from the side.</p>
<p>"I don't know about that. The update notes didn't mention it. We'll have to test it in-game. It's just finished downloading, I'll give it a try."</p>
<p>Looking at the new version of Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame already downloaded on the computer, Song Ren clicked to enter the game. Although the predecessor also updated this Death Mode, because the new game was updated first, Song Ren still decided to experience it in the new game. Of course, there was another reason: Song Ren had been playing Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame recently. Even though they were both games from the same series, and there weren't many major changes in the combat system, there were still some subtle changes. To put it simply, it was the so-called "feel." During this period, Song Ren had consistently played Age of the First Flame, so naturally, he was more familiar with it. He hadn't touched the previous game for almost a year, and his hands had gotten a little rusty.</p>
<p>Entering the game, his character had just started its second playthrough and was currently in Firelink Shrine. The weapon equipped on him was a +5 Guandao. As a professional "cheese" player, the Guandao was his life! As for it not being good in high New Game+, he'd save that discussion for high New Game+.</p>
<p>The entrance to the new mode was still very conspicuous, located in the collapsed ruins next to the Crestfallen Warrior, where there was a huge gray rock. After approaching, an interaction prompt appeared on the game screen. Song Ren pressed the interaction prompt, and a UI interface similar to the warping screen in the previous game popped up.</p>
<p>"You can freely choose the BOSS you want to challenge, but the difficulty of different BOSSes varies. But why are they all named BOSSes? Is my High Wall Taurus Demon so insignificant!?"</p>
<p>Song Ren looked at the BOSS selection interface and couldn't help but feel a shiver of indignation. "Look at what kind of BOSSes are on here? Artorias, Gwyn, the Witch, and the Black Dragon. What about the Asylum Demon big butt that players face at the beginning? Where's the Taurus Demon!? Just because these BOSSes are minor characters, they weren't selected? Shiver of indignation! Pick the softest persimmon to squeeze, but there isn't a single soft persimmon here; they're all thorny durians. How am I supposed to squeeze them!"</p>
<p>Completely unaware of Song Ren struggling and complaining deep down at this moment, Zhang Yi next to him saw that he hadn't moved for a long time and seemed to be hesitating, so he quickly urged: "Old Song, choose a BOSS! Quickly check out the gameplay of this new Death Mode!"</p>
<p>"What are you rushing for? Aren't I thinking about which BOSS would be better to fight?" Song Ren defended his actions.</p>
<p>"What are you thinking about? You definitely can't beat any of them anyway," Zhang Yi said.</p>
<p>Song Ren: …………</p>
<p>Are you being polite!?</p>
<p>If you can't speak properly, you don't have to speak!</p>
<p>He shot Zhang Yi a "fierce" glare, then turned back, thought for a moment, and decided to challenge his favorite BOSS in this game—Artorias the Abysswalker. It wasn't just because he was cool, nor just because his profoundly moving background story stirred him. It was also because, among these selectable BOSSes, he felt Artorias was the best one to fight. Although he had died several times when he first fought him, later, summarizing it, you just need to dodge the BOSS's charged thrust and large jump attacks, strike during its stun but don't get greedy, and always be mindful of stopping its burst aura; it's basically not too difficult. The only variable was not knowing what kind of entity this BOSS would actually be in Death Mode.</p>
