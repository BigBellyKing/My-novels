                <p>Chapter 99: Sorry, I Really Am France's Disgrace!</p>
<p>Seeing that the live streaming room was getting a bit heated, she quickly changed the subject: "How about the game? We'll know in a bit, won't we?"</p>
<p>"I wonder if you've noticed something special, and that's the game's English translation." Liuliu said, looking at the many players in the live streaming room.</p>
<p>In the past, Nebula Games' titles never had English names. But this time, <code>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</code> had a very obvious English name.</p>
<p>Although she was a streamer, Liuliu was quite unique in the streaming world; her educational background was remarkably high, having been the provincial top scholar back in the day.</p>
<p>Watching the game, Liuliu explained her findings to the bullet comments in the live streaming room.</p>
<p>"The game's Chinese name is <code>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</code>. From the background description, this World War refers to World War I. In English, there are three ways to translate World War I: 'World War I', 'First World War', and 'Great War'. The game specifically chose the third one. Just from this English title, you can already feel the irony, because the third one can also be translated as 'The Great War.'"</p>
<p>Clearly, just from the game title and these translation details, one could already feel that this was a different kind of game from the usual.</p>
<p>After hearing Liuliu's explanation, many audience members in the live streaming room who didn't understand English also looked surprised, realizing there was such an interpretation!</p>
<p>The game wasn't large; it was quickly downloaded and installed after purchase.</p>
<p>Filled with a bit of curiosity and anticipation, Liuliu adjusted her streaming issues, then clicked to enter the game.</p>
<p>Looking at the opening Nebula Games LOGO, Liuliu's heart was also full of curiosity.</p>
<p>For such a seemingly small 2D independent game, what kind of mode would it use to showcase anti-war sentiment and the cruelty of war?</p>
<p>However, given previous high-quality independent games like <code>Undertale</code> and <code>To the Moon</code>, she still had some trust in Nebula Games.</p>
<p>"This background music is really nice! So the protagonist is a soldier and a search and rescue dog?"</p>
<p>Accompanied by a melancholy background music mixed with orchestral sounds and piano, the game's UI interface appeared.</p>
<p>An old veteran in a military uniform, holding a black search and rescue dog on a leash, stood amidst the desolated ruins.</p>
<p>After staying on the interface for a few seconds and listening to the background music, Liuliu followed the prompt and clicked to enter the game.</p>
<p>After clicking confirm, the game entered a brief black screen, then a map of Europe appeared on the screen, with the territories and national flags of various countries divided.</p>
<p>[August 1, 1914, after Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, was assassinated, the German Empire declared war on the Russian Empire.]
[Due to forming alliances, France also began to prepare for the conflict.]
[Hours after general mobilization began, Germans living in France were asked to evacuate.]
[Karl was one of them.]</p>
<p>A series of comic-like cutscenes simply introduced the era's background.</p>
<p>She wasn't very familiar with World War I, but neither was she completely unfamiliar.</p>
<p>What she was more concerned about was one of the game's means of expression.</p>
<p>So far, this opening seemed a bit like <code>Undertale</code>, with both using a comic book style to present the story background.</p>
<p>As Liuliu was thinking, the game's screen arrived at a farm, and the top right corner displayed the time and location — August 1, 1914, France: Saint-Mihiel.</p>
<p>A blond young man was shoveling hay with a pitchfork. On the hay cart behind him, his wife was holding a child.</p>
<p>The sky was blue, the sun was shining brightly, and everything was so harmonious and beautiful.</p>
<p>But the next moment, two soldiers on bicycles arrived at the farm, grabbing Karl's arm.</p>
<p>Instantly, the game's slightly sad BGM began to play, the entire background turned dark, and the previously sunny sky immediately became overcast with dark clouds.</p>
<p>Amidst the sad background music, a heart-wrenching female voice rang out.</p>
<p>Karl's wife, holding the child, reached out her right hand, wanting to hold Karl back.</p>
<p>But in the end, Karl was still taken away by the soldiers, leaving French territory.</p>
<p>Behind him, Karl's father-in-law and wife slowly lowered their heads, watching Karl's departing silhouette, tears falling from his wife's eyes.</p>
<p>There was no dialogue, but with the sound effects, screen colors, and background music, Liuliu already felt that melancholic atmosphere.</p>
<p>A brief black screen, then a line of white subtitles appeared in the exact center — A few days later.</p>
<p>A few days after Karl's departure, the silent farm was broken by a letter.</p>
<p>At the top of the letter, it read: Armée de terre et armée de mer (Army and Navy).</p>
<p>This was a conscription letter from France.</p>
<p>The melancholy BGM mixed with the sounds of soldiers fighting on the battlefield made the entire game's atmosphere feel a bit heavy.</p>
<p>[A few days after Karl departed, the war intensified, and even Emile was taken away.]
[Emile, summoned to war, left the farm with a heavy heart for Saint-Mihiel, just like everyone else, he knew nothing of what the future held for him.]</p>
<p>Emile, upon arriving in Saint-Mihiel, participated in recruit enlistment and training.</p>
<p>In the game, this was the simple new player tutorial.</p>
<p>The game featured 2D side-scrolling movement, with not many controls required: forward and backward, attack, and throw.</p>
<p>These were the controls needed within the game.</p>
<p>Following the prompt, Liuliu picked up the grenade from the nearby box and threw it towards the target scarecrow ahead.</p>
<p>She threw several in a row. After the first grenade blew up the scarecrow, the instructor led Emile to continue forward. At this point, Liuliu, following the system prompt and moving forward, was chatting with the bullet comments while playing, completely failing to notice that on the ground ahead, another grenade she had thrown earlier was now flashing red.</p>
<p>A loud boom pulled Liuliu back into the game.</p>
<p>The game screen plunged into darkness, then returned to the previous training level.</p>
<p>"I blew myself up? I died during military training? Sorry, I really am France's disgrace!"</p>
<p>Thinking about the scene that just happened, Liuliu was utterly speechless.</p>
<p>Similarly, the live streaming room was flooded with various bullet comments.</p>
<p>'233333, I'm dying of laughter! Liuliu's grenade work is too godly!'
'I killed myself!'
'Is this what a French soldier is like?'
'Here we go, here we go! The French-bashing begins again!'</p>
<p>Seeing the full screen of bullet comments in the live streaming room, Liuliu felt a bit helpless. This incident really wasn't for show; she was purely playing while looking at the bullet comments, so her attention wasn't on the game. However, seeing the comments, she still explained.</p>
<p>"Ahem... everyone, take it easy, don't speak carelessly. France in World War I was actually completely different from France in World War II. The background of this game is World War I, and at that time, French soldiers were beyond reproach; they could be said to be the core strength of the Allied Powers. As for World War II... well, let's move on from that topic."</p>
<p>After completing the new player tutorial's military training, to the melody of <code>La Marseillaise</code>, Emile served as the flag raiser, hoisting the military flag.</p>
<p>The atmosphere at this moment was full of humor.</p>
<p>Next, Emile had to go to the train station to find his army, having already left his hometown far behind.</p>
<p>[At Paris Station, Emile, looking for his assigned regiment on Platform 21, was about to meet the closest friend with whom he would fight side by side for a lifetime.]</p>
<p>On the platform, a group of French soldiers surrounded a Black soldier, provoking him.</p>
<p>What Emile needed to do was to help out the Black soldier.</p>
<p>This part was also a component of the new player tutorial, primarily teaching players how the game's puzzles were solved.</p>
<p>"Hey, this is quite interesting. <code>Undertale</code> featured bullet hell dodging gameplay, <code>To the Moon</code> was pure story, so this 'Valiant Hearts' should have quite a few puzzle-solving elements in its subsequent levels."</p>
<p>First, she used the lever on the right to smoke away the soldiers on the right.</p>
<p>Then, by communicating with an officer, she learned he didn't want red wine, found a bottle of beer to bribe him, then directed a band to distract the soldiers guarding the train, pulled the lever on the left to smoke away the soldiers on the left, successfully helping out the Black soldier.</p>
<p>This segment wasn't difficult, even having clear prompts, but it still made Liuliu feel it was quite meticulous.</p>
<p>It was clear that <code>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</code> should also be a story-driven game.</p>
<p>Last year's <code>To the Moon</code>, though brilliant, undeniably offered little in terms of gameplay value; its puzzle-solving was essentially just an afterthought.</p>
<p>And currently, <code>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</code>, combined with the throwing learned in military training, movement and attack, as well as this train station puzzle.</p>
<p>Even though the game was 2D side-scrolling, it made Liuliu have some expectations for the content to come.</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay content, this game would clearly be considerably richer.</p>
<p>(Daily plea: let this inexperienced author get a glimpse of what recommendation votes and monthly passes look like! Speaking of which, the first time I played this game, I didn't die from German cannon shells, I blew myself up during military training...)</p>
