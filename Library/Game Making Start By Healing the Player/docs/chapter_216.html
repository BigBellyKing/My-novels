                <h3>Chapter 215: Let's Change the Name, It's Quite Embarrassing (Seventh Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h3>
<p>“What’s going on? How is it getting dark so quickly?”</p>
<p>Wang Han, still diligently chopping wood, completely engrossed in her building fantasy for later, hadn't noticed that the sky in the game had already changed from day to dusk.</p>
<p>“Oh no, I haven’t even built the house yet! And I haven’t found any sheep!”</p>
<p>Staring at the sky, Wang Han froze. She hadn't chopped much wood, only about sixty blocks. Had ten minutes really passed so quickly?</p>
<p>The game's time, just like <code>Don't Starve</code> which she played before, was divided into day and night. A full day lasted 20 minutes, with 10 minutes for day, 7 minutes for night, and the remaining three minutes for sunset. If she were to build, she didn't particularly like her current location. Although she could demolish it after building, it would be a hassle. But if she didn't build, she had no idea what might happen at night in the game.</p>
<p>While Wang Han hesitated, the sky in the game gradually darkened. Unlike <code>Don't Starve</code>, where darkness severely reduced visibility and posed a direct threat to the player's life, <code>Minecraft</code> didn't have such a setting. Instead, small white skeletons with bows and small green zombies would appear. However, in <code>Minecraft</code>, players used a first-person perspective and an over-the-shoulder perspective, and despite being a pixel game, this visual mode, combined with the night and the sounds of zombies and skeletons, created a terrifying atmosphere.</p>
<p>“So what should I do now?! What should I do! What should I do!” Wang Han saw the monsters running towards her and immediately took off. As she ran, Wang Han noticed that more and more monsters were appearing behind her. It was as if she were a locomotive pulling a long train of monsters. And among them, a white skeleton archer kept shooting arrows. Although she had crafted a Wooden Sword earlier in her <code>Item inventory</code>, based on her <code>Don't Starve</code> experience, she felt she was no match for these monsters, especially with so many.</p>
<p>However, the more she ran, the more monsters she encountered along the way. “Got it!” Suddenly, Wang Han had a flash of inspiration as she looked at the ground beneath her feet. She pulled out a Hoe from her <code>Item inventory</code> and started digging directly. Three blocks deep was just enough for her to drop down, and then Wang Han picked up a block of dirt and sealed the top. Instantly, the entire game screen plunged into darkness, with only the various roars of monsters coming through her headphones.</p>
<p>“Now I'm safe.” Hearing only the monsters' roars but seeing none of their movements, Wang Han couldn't help but smile. All she had to do now was wait for daybreak, for these monsters to leave. Wang Han was about to pull out her phone from her pocket to scroll through some <code>short video</code>s.</p>
<p>Just then, the sound of keys unlocking the door echoed from the living room, followed by footsteps. Wang Han instinctively turned her head and saw Zhang Yi entering the room, carrying a plastic bag. “<code>Hey, didn't you say you'd be over an hour?</code>” “I had good luck on the road today, green lights all the way,” Zhang Yi chuckled, shaking the plastic bag in his hand. “<code>I bought you Roasted Duck Rice. Eat it while it’s hot, otherwise, the duck will get fishy when it cools.</code>” “<code>Got it,</code>” Wang Han replied, taking the Roasted Duck Rice from Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>“<code>Huh, is the computer broken?!</code>” Zhang Yi, noticing the monitor was still black, paused. “<code>What's broken? I'm playing Minecraft!</code>” Wang Han said as she unwrapped the plastic bag. “<code>Then is it a BUG? Why is the screen completely Black Screen?</code>” Zhang Yi was a bit bewildered. The screen was totally black, and she was telling him she was playing a game?</p>
<p>“<code>It's night outside, and I was being chased by monsters, so I'm hiding underground for now,</code>” Wang Han explained. “<code>Isn't this game about building houses? How are you being chased by monsters?</code>” Zhang Yi asked curiously. “<code>There are different modes. I'm playing Survival Mode, which is similar to Don't Starve,</code>” Wang Han said. “<code>Ah, I see!</code>” Zhang Yi understood.</p>
<p>As she spoke, Wang Han switched the game's audio to the Speaker. The sounds of monsters outside seemed to have disappeared. However, to be safe, Wang Han continued digging forward for a while in the pitch-black hole.</p>
<p>“<code>Couldn't you just break a hole and get out? What are you doing in the pitch black?</code>” Zhang Yi, sitting beside her, watched Wang Han stuff food into her mouth while seemingly digging something on the dark screen, a bit puzzled. “<code>You haven't played this game, you wouldn't understand! What if the monsters are still waiting up there? It’s safer if I move forward a bit to bypass them,</code>” Wang Han explained.</p>
<p>After digging about twenty blocks, accumulating 20 dirt blocks in her <code>Item inventory</code>, Wang Han finally cleared the top. And by then, it was finally daytime. “<code>The graphics aren't bad!</code>” Zhang Yi commented, looking at the game screen from beside her. “<code>Alright, just you watch. I'll build a house first to have a place to live, and then I'll go find sheep to get wool for a bed,</code>” Wang Han said confidently, looking at the large pile of wood and dirt on her person.</p>
<p>Even before this, she had not only mentally practiced it. She had even specifically taken out building block toys she'd bought before to conduct practical training. Now it was time to test the results. Although her current materials were only dirt and wood, it was enough. Wood could be crafted into <code>planks</code> and <code>Wooden Door</code>s using a <code>crafting table</code>. While it was still far from the 'Pink Fantasy Mansion' she envisioned, building a simple, rustic wooden house shouldn't be much of a problem.</p>
<p>“<code>This place is great, with mountains and water,</code>” Wang Han said, deliberately choosing a spot near a lake. She first crafted a <code>crafting table</code>, then made <code>Wooden Door</code>s and <code>planks</code>. Then, Wang Han began her creation. Zhang Yi, beside her, watched with his chin resting in his hand.</p>
<p>First came the <code>Foundation</code>. She dug up all the Sand on the ground, then filled it with wood to delineate the house's area. Since there wasn't much wood, the area shouldn't be too large; a <code>One Bedroom, One Living Room</code> layout would suffice. Next, she started building the <code>Wall</code>s. Wang Han specifically left a gap in the middle for the door she would install later. She didn't know how to make stairs, so Wang Han just threw two blocks of wood to represent the <code>Threshold</code>.</p>
<p>As she ate her Roasted Duck Rice, savoring the delicious duck and the fragrant white rice, it felt as if she had unblocked her <code>Ren and Du meridians</code>. Wang Han felt her thoughts flow like a spring, and the image of the house in her mind became incredibly clear.</p>
<p>Because <code>Survival Mode</code> didn't allow flying like <code>Creative Mode</code>, when the <code>Wall</code>s became too high to top off, Wang Han had to build blocks beneath her feet to climb up. “<code>Hmm, I'll leave a few holes here. I see in the recipe list that I can make Glass later. I'll leave these spots for Glass so I can watch the stars when I'm in bed at night,</code>” Wang Han muttered to herself, continuing her grand infrastructure project.</p>
<p>“<code>As for the crafting table, I'll put it in this corner. Later, I'll add some decorations to make my house beautiful.</code>” With the last block of wood placed, Wang Han finally felt a sense of accomplishment. By this time, the sky in the game had slowly transitioned from day to dusk.</p>
<p>“<code>There's something I don't know if I should say, Comrade Little Wang, our Master Builder, but is your house going for a prison cell style?</code>” Zhang Yi couldn't help but say, looking at the house in front of them. The wooden house was a complete cube, and the <code>crafting table</code> in the corner looked just like a toilet. And there was no bed in the room. The spot originally left for the <code>Wooden Door</code>, with two blocks of wood placed below as a <code>Threshold</code>, now made it look exactly like a <code>prison visiting window</code>.</p>
<p>“<code>It does seem a little different from what I imagined,</code>” Wang Han said, walking out of the house and looking at the structure in front of her, falling into silence. In her vision, the house she built, though wooden, should have been simple yet sophisticated, with artistic craftsmanship evident in its details. But the house before them resembled a giant chimney, and the space left for the door looked exactly like a <code>prison visiting window</code>. Looking inside, there was nothing but a <code>crafting table</code>. Even a prison cell had a bed, for crying out loud!</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the sky in the game darkened again at that moment, and it started to rain. The drizzling rain fell through the reserved <code>Skylight</code>. Instinctively, Wang Han shifted her view upwards, jumped, and used the few remaining pieces of wood on her to block the opening. After blocking it, the rain indeed stopped leaking, but the only light in the room came from the <code>prison visiting window</code>. The entire room was pitch black.</p>
<p>“<code>You should change your name, it's quite embarrassing,</code>” Zhang Yi said after a moment of thought, looking at Wang Han's <code>Master Builder</code> title.</p>
