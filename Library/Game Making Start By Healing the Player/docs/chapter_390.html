                <p>Chapter 389: The Expo (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Previously, when Chen Xu acquired iQue, an old domestic handheld console manufacturer, many game designers and players in the industry paid attention for a while.</p>
<p>However, Nebula Games didn't engage in extensive promotion at the time, and no external news was revealed. Moreover, during the same period, there was a lot of news about blockbusters appearing both domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>These were also popular open-world games, which diverted many players' attention.</p>
<p>But now, Nebula Games has unexpectedly announced its participation in this year's gameplay Expo.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that Nebula Games hasn't actually participated in any gameplay Expos in the last two years. This is because Nebula Games had long passed the stage of relying on expos for player attention and hype.</p>
<p>The quality and reputation of the games themselves were enough to attract player interest. So, Nebula Games had been absent from gameplay Expos for the past two years.</p>
<p>But unexpectedly, Nebula Games is participating in the expo this time. Many players began discussing it online.</p>
<p>"Holy cow, Nebula Games is actually participating in this expo!?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, Nebula Games hasn't really participated in this type of expo in the last two years. Suddenly joining this year, I feel there's a high probability it's for the handheld console, right?"</p>
<p>"I heard there's also news about new games. This wave is going to explode!"</p>
<p>"Hehe, you guys are too young. Haven't you understood Mr. Chen's true nature yet? He talks about being a Warrior of Love, but he wants to torment our bodies and souls to shreds. And when it comes to drawing grand promises and digging pitfalls in the gaming world, I only admire Mr. Chen!"</p>
<p>"Exactly, exactly. Think about the games that debuted at previous gameplay Expos. The first one had a Dark Souls trailer, the second one didn't even have a trailer, just a Concept Art, and the third one, Nebula Games was completely absent. This time, I'm guessing there's a high probability we'll just get a game title."</p>
<p>"That's so messed up, now that you mention it, it really seems to be the case!"</p>
<p>Players online were discussing animatedly, but many were very pessimistic, feeling that Nebula Games might not bring anything significant to this gameplay Expo. Of course, pessimism aside, many players still planned to attend. On one hand, it was Nebula Games' first return to such an expo after two years. On the other hand, even if Nebula Games didn't have much to offer, NetDragon and TengHua, along with other game developers, also had many new works at the expo.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Nebula Games' office.</p>
<p>Chen Xu and Ruan Ningxue each held a Joy-Con controller, with It Takes Two displayed on the screen. Yang Xin, Qin Yi, and Meng Zuo watched from the side.</p>
<p>From a two-player game perspective, It Takes Two is actually more suitable for Nintendo Switch, but some details still require adjustments.</p>
<p>The first is the split-screen issue, where the camera angles have been re-planned to ensure players have a better experience. Also, in terms of controls, many motion control elements have been added.</p>
<p>For example, mini-games like Whac-A-Mole and Baseball can be controlled with motion, and the first nail item obtained can also be aimed and thrown using the Joy-Con controller.</p>
<p>"So, the lost trust still needs to be gradually earned back by oneself!"</p>
<p>After testing in the office, Chen Xu leaned back on the sofa, sighing at the players' online discussions.</p>
<p>Drawing grand promises?</p>
<p>That's out of the question now. This time, they were bringing something genuinely substantial to the expo.</p>
<p>And from the perspective of game attributes, after the double blows of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Red Dead Redemption, Chen Xu estimated that the players' fragile hearts must already be somewhat perforated.</p>
<p>So, for the new game, he wouldn't hit them again. This time, he would let them truly experience some heartwarming treatment.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu, Ruan Ningxue interjected, "But Mr. Chen, have you ever considered that when everyone expects you to draw grand promises, and you don't, in a way, that's also a loss of trust?"</p>
<p>"You can't say that. Weren't the Nintendo Switch versions of Monster Hunter: World and Dark Souls also 'grand promises'? So, players looking forward to the 'pie' shouldn't be disappointed." Chen Xu, sitting there, replied after hearing Ruan Ningxue's words.</p>
<p>Who said they weren't drawing grand promises?</p>
<p>There were plenty of 'pies,' okay? And this console, named Nintendo Switch, along with the games it features, wouldn't be released immediately.</p>
<p>Weren't these all 'pies'?</p>
<p>It's just that this year's 'pies' had an aroma that players could smell, whereas before, they could only imagine them from pictures. Drawing grand promises, that was a skill ingrained in Nebula Games' DNA.</p>
<p>If it weren't for the fact that Red Dead Redemption's subsequent plans for John Marston hadn't unfolded yet, and this gameplay Expo was mainly for Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Chen Xu would have wanted to make a big deal out of that, which would definitely ignite the player base.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, that couldn't be done.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, everyone showed speechless expressions.</p>
<p>What happened to 'earning back trust'?</p>
<p>"Alright, the test versions of each game need a few more rounds of testing; this is quite important. Also, we need to contact the expo organizers for booth arrangements." Chen Xu coughed lightly, interrupting everyone.</p>
<p>The development plans for Super Mario Odyssey, Animal Forest, and other games were progressing in an orderly manner. Although the games weren't entirely finished, they were entering the final stages. This time, Chen Xu intended to use the opportunity of the gameplay Expo to introduce the Nintendo Switch, a brand-new console, to players for pre-release promotion.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>Modu, the venue for the gameplay Expo.</p>
<p>Relevant staff members were busy setting up the site.</p>
<p>Unlike previous times, Nebula Games now had an independent exhibition area, just like NetDragon and TengHua. Within this independent area, there were also many third-party game studios and developers affiliated with Nebula Games.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu's setup this time did not include a PC zone or a VR game zone.</p>
<p>Because these two areas were not the focus of this gameplay Expo.</p>
<p>Of course, there would still be some appropriate promotion.</p>
<p>As for things like cosers and showgirls, that would be different from what players might expect.</p>
<p>Nebula Games no longer needed such things to attract attention.</p>
<p>So, in this regard, Chen Xu adopted the same strategy as when he first participated in gameplay Expo. A large group of staff members dressed in various mascot costumes, giant Bowsers and Marios, as well as Princess Peach, Tom Nook, Timmy, Tommy, and Isabelle characters.</p>
