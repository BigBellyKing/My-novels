                <p>Chapter 441: A Single Person Critically Hit (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>A familiar cry.</p>
<p>In his blurry vision, Song Ren saw a reassuring figure.</p>
<p>Yes, Elena Fisher.</p>
<p>Elena Fisher, who ultimately couldn't rest assured about Nathan Drake, followed various traces along the way and finally found Nathan at this critical moment.</p>
<p>Seeing Elena Fisher appear before him, Song Ren couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>He had just been truly startled, fearing that Nathan Drake would get written out (of the story), after all, Mr. Chen wasn't doing this for the first time.</p>
<p>What's wrong with the protagonist?</p>
<p>Who said the protagonist had to get written out at the end of the game?</p>
<p>Think of Soap, think of Roach, then think of Arthur Morgan.</p>
<p>These are eternal pains in players' hearts!</p>
<p>After confirming that Nathan would be fine, Song Ren began to ponder the game's plot.</p>
<p>It has to be said that knowing Sam wasn't actually threatened by the big gambler but concocted such a story to get Nathan to help him, truly startled Song Ren.</p>
<p>This was definitely tricking his younger brother!</p>
<p>But to say he hated it, Song Ren couldn't really bring himself to, after all, considering the prison incident and Sam's care for Nathan along the way, as well as his previous bullet-blocking, it was clear that Sam still cared deeply for Nathan.</p>
<p>As for why Sam fabricated this story, Song Ren already had a general guess based on the previous plot.</p>
<p>That was, after Sam was released from prison, he searched for Henry Every's treasure with Rafe.</p>
<p>But unlike Rafe, a rich second-generation heir, Rafe's treasure hunt was merely to prove himself, so Rafe wasn't particularly concerned with <em>how</em> to find the treasure; he only cared if he <em>could</em> find it.</p>
<p>For Sam, however, the treasure held a different meaning.</p>
<p>The remaining question was why Sam and Nathan were so obsessed with the treasure.</p>
<p>It seemed Sam was the one mad about treasure, but in the game's plot, Song Ren could also feel the pervasive hints.</p>
<p>On the surface, Nathan re-entered the scene for his brother, even trying to persuade Sam.</p>
<p>Yet, the joy Nathan showed during the treasure hunt, and his initial absentmindedness, made Song Ren realize that deep down, Nathan himself also yearned to continue adventuring and searching for treasure.</p>
<p>So why were these two brothers so fixated on treasure hunting?</p>
<p>Song Ren's heart was filled with curiosity.</p>
<p>Soon, the later plot provided him with the answer.</p>
<p>In a level after Nathan's unconsciousness, the timeline and story returned to Nathan and Sam's youth, specifically the events after Nathan escaped the orphanage at the beginning.</p>
<p>Through the plot, it was revealed that Nathan and Sam weren't actually named Drake; they were the sons of the brilliant historian Cassandra Morgan.</p>
<p>Cassandra Morgan had, in her earlier years, been dedicated to investigating information related to Francis Drake, and had always believed that Sir Francis Drake had descendants.</p>
<p>However, due to health reasons, she ultimately abandoned her exploration into Francis's life.</p>
<p>After their mother's death, Nathan and his brother Sam went together to search for their mother's keepsakes, eventually finding a logbook filled with adventures and an uncompleted treasure diary, which contained information about Francis's ring and Captain Henry Every's treasure.</p>
<p>Later, after an unexpected encounter with their mother's colleague, an old woman, Nathan and his brother Sam learned from her about their mother's regret: that she hadn't been able to prove these historical facts true in her lifetime.</p>
<p>So Sam and Nathan decided to fulfill their mother's regret, completing the adventure and finding everything in her stead. After leaving, at Sam's suggestion, Nathan and Sam changed their names to—Nathan Drake and Sam Drake.</p>
<p>‘You and I, with one heart and mind, our future is limitless.’</p>
<p>Under the bridge, Nathan Drake and Sam Drake gently bumped fists.</p>
<p>Watching this scene with Nathan and Sam, Song Ren couldn't help but sigh with emotion.</p>
<p>Of course, what he was sighing about wasn't the sincere bond between the two brothers, but their hair.</p>
<p>Brother Sam was quite handsome when he was young, so why did his looks go downhill after growing up?</p>
<p>The main reason was his hair.</p>
<p>Look at how thick Nathan Drake's hair is, then look at his brother's hair.</p>
<p>It proved one thing: baldness ruins everything!</p>
<p>He needed to protect the hair on his own head too.</p>
<p>While Song Ren was sighing, Nathan in the game finally woke up.</p>
<p>Next, the strongest husband-and-wife treasure hunting duo went online.</p>
<p>Originally, Song Ren thought Elena was just a pretty face, as is often the case in many games.</p>
<p>But facts proved him wrong; Elena was simply awesome.</p>
<p>Her performance in the game could be described as both intellectual and martial.</p>
<p>Facing the Shoreline mercenaries, she could wield a gun and carve a bloody path with Nathan, even stealing the enemies' vehicle.</p>
<p>Facing the island mechanisms, she could guide Nathan through puzzles.</p>
<p>The only slightly less wonderful thing was that wherever this couple went together, things would collapse.</p>
<p>When climbing, either a tree broke or a rock fell.</p>
<p>When driving over a bridge, the bridge itself collapsed right in the middle.</p>
<p>A perfectly fine ancient ruin was completely ruined by Nathan's passing.</p>
<p>Of course, this wasn't the most crucial point; the key was that after the partner changed from Sam to Elena.</p>
<p>The interactions between this couple during their adventure directly shoved a bellyful of affectionate public display by couples down players' throats.</p>
<p>On the elevator, Nathan looked at Elena beside him and finally spoke: ‘Th-thank you for saving me again… I mean, you almost didn't make it back.’</p>
<p>Hearing Nathan's words, Elena gazed into the distance: ‘Well, I couldn't just leave you when you were in trouble, and you know, wedding vows and all that.’</p>
<p>Nathan picked up: ‘For better or worse.’</p>
<p>Elena turned and nodded at Nathan: ‘For better or worse.’</p>
<p>‘But you know what? Even if you think you're protecting me, you have no right to keep me in the dark. Whatever it is, you can always come to me.’</p>
<p>All along, Elena wasn't angry about Nathan going treasure hunting; she was angry about him lying to her and keeping her in the dark.</p>
<p>Next, the two demonstrated perfect tacit cooperation in their actions, and during a thrilling cliff jump and climb, Nathan almost lost his life again.</p>
<p>But fortunately, Elena was by his side, once again saving Nathan from the brink of death.</p>
<p>Looking at his wife, this time Nathan finally chose to face his true feelings. He called out to Elena: ‘I didn’t tell you because… I was afraid…’</p>
<p>‘Afraid of what?’ Elena turned and looked at Nathan.</p>
<p>‘I was afraid I'd lose you,’ Nathan said calmly.</p>
<p>Hearing Nathan's words, Elena just nodded, appearing unfazed.</p>
<p>But the moment she turned away, she revealed a smile, clearly secretly delighted.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the two continued their journey towards Pirate's Haven, flirting and bickering along the way.</p>
<p>As for single players, many who played up to this point openly declared they were 'broken'.</p>
<p>Because of Mr. Chen's renowned title 'Warrior of Love', they played the game with trepidation, fearing Nathan might get written out at any moment.</p>
<p>But they never expected that instead of getting a deeply heartbreaking plot twist, they were fed a mouthful of 'dog food'.</p>
<p>“Alright, Mr. Chen! Now this ‘blade’ isn't just limited to tragedy anymore!”</p>
<p>“Has he mastered the true attack methods of a ‘Warrior of Love’?”</p>
<p>As a single person, Song Ren declared he had suffered 10,000 points of critical damage.</p>
<p>Absolutely outrageous!</p>
