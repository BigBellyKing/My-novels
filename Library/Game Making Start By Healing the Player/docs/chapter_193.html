                <p>Chapter 192: Players Who Embrace Death (Fifth Update, Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Not just Zhang Yi and Song Ren, but also ordinary players who had already cleared Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame, or high-level players who had completed several playthroughs, and even veteran Souls players who had gone through countless playthroughs and built their characters into well-rounded (stats) builds.</p>
<p>Looking at the brand new Death Mode, although they knew it might be difficult, they all felt they could handle it.</p>
<p>However, after truly trying it out, many players discovered:</p>
<p>The name of this mode was damn accurate; it truly was Death Mode!</p>
<p>BOSSes in their prime were terrifying!</p>
<p>It immediately brought them the most primal joy.</p>
<p>Artorias, with his hands intact, wielding his Great Sword and Great Barrier Shield, was utterly fearsome.</p>
<p>And Yhorm the Giant from the previous Dark Souls, while still retaining his characteristic vulnerability to the Storm Ruler, which dealt massive damage when hit, now had a limitation.</p>
<p>In multiplayer team-up mode, only one Storm Ruler could be carried.</p>
<p>"What, you ask why?"</p>
<p>"Didn't you see the story?"</p>
<p>"There were only two Storm Rulers in total; one was with Siegward of Catarina, and the other was next to Yhorm's Throne."</p>
<p>In Death Mode, players challenged Yhorm in his prime.</p>
<p>At this time, Yhorm had not lost his sanity to the Abyss's encroachment after witnessing the death of his subjects.</p>
<p>So, naturally, besides his terrifying greatscythe, he also had a massive shield that had accompanied him for countless years.</p>
<p>This meant that in Death Mode, Yhorm the Giant not only hadn't become a mad dog but also had a gigantic shield.</p>
<p>Facing the Storm Ruler's tempest, Yhorm the Giant could use his Great Barrier Shield to tank the hits.</p>
<p>Therefore, the only way to deal significant damage was to find an opening and bypass his Great Barrier Shield.</p>
<p>The only comforting aspect for players was that Yhorm the Giant, due to his massive size, was far less nimble than other BOSSes.</p>
<p>In addition, players finally saw how terrifying Gwyn from the new game was in Death Mode, a being whose combat prowess was considered the best in Dark Souls.</p>
<p>With a single Sunlight Spear, being hit meant instant death.</p>
<p>This was also the only move in Death Mode that could instantly kill players.</p>
<p>Of course, this didn't count situations where players insisted on fighting BOSSes naked.</p>
<p>Although overbearing, the wind-up and release of the Sunlight Spear were quite noticeable, so with some attention, it could still be dodged.</p>
<p>What truly broke countless players was that Gwyn in his prime was different from Lord Gwyn, the Lord of Cinder, who had been burnt into a hollow shell.</p>
<p>This time, players could not parry Gwyn's moves.</p>
<p>In the new game, Lord Gwyn, the Lord of Cinder, was often teased by many players as the easiest BOSS, even feeling simpler than the Taurus Demon on a first encounter.</p>
<p>The most crucial point was that "Old Man Gwyn," having burned into a hollow shell, could be parried.</p>
<p>Moreover, in Dark Souls 1, the parry window was much more lenient than in Dark Souls 3.</p>
<p>Although Chen Xu had made some numerical adjustments, for "Old Man Gwyn," who could be parried, his moves were still too easily read.</p>
<p>This created an illusion for many players that Lord Gwyn, the Lord of Cinder, was particularly weak.</p>
<p>But if players were forced to fight Lord Gwyn, the Lord of Cinder, without parrying, the combat difficulty would instantly skyrocket.</p>
<p>And now, in Death Mode, Gwyn was not only stronger in his AI performance, but players also couldn't parry him, meaning the difficulty had truly gone through the roof.</p>
<p>For ordinary players, their main focus was still on Random Mode.</p>
<p>Although Random Mode had appeared in previous titles, combined with the new game's interconnected map design, this Random Mode clearly offered a different experience.</p>
<p>As for Death Mode?</p>
<p>Many ordinary players, after trying it once for novelty, unanimously stated that this was not something they could attempt.</p>
<p>Random Mode, being a more entertaining mode, was what was prepared for ordinary players.</p>
<p>Death Mode, on the other hand, was designed for high-level players who sought a greater challenge.</p>
<p>It also served to fulfill some players' regrets.</p>
<p>After all, in the community forum, many players expressed regret, saying they wondered how powerful the Lords of Cinder and Ancient Gods were in their prime.</p>
<p>Death Mode was thus launched to fulfill their wishes.</p>
<p>However, even though Death Mode was extremely difficult, there were indeed many top-tier players who were determined to conquer its BOSSes.</p>
<p>Because for many high-level players, Dark Souls, from its initial high difficulty to becoming familiar after hundreds or even thousands of hours of gameplay, had already ingrained muscle memory.</p>
<p>They lacked no items or weapons, and defeating BOSSes was usually effortless unless they occasionally made a mistake and were instantly killed.</p>
<p>Some extreme players had even completed challenges like level 1 runs against all BOSSes.</p>
<p>Or even the feat of challenging all BOSSes without weapons, but with only a shield.</p>
<p>This Death Mode allowed these high-level players to rediscover the joy they felt when first experiencing Dark Souls.</p>
<p>Not only domestic players, but also international players were enthusiastic about Death Mode.</p>
<p>After all, this "Death Mode," like Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame, was launched globally simultaneously.</p>
<p>Furthermore, speedruns and first kills could both appear on the in-game leaderboard.</p>
<p>Driven by the excitement of fame and showing off, many master players discussed how to achieve these feats.</p>
<p>After countless deaths and failures, top Dark Souls master players, both domestic and international, summarized several features and tricks for Death Mode.</p>
<p>Firstly, while it could accommodate up to three players for BOSS raids, the difficulty varied depending on the BOSS and the team size.</p>
<p>For Yhorm the Giant from the previous game, many believed a three-player team-up would be easier because one person could avoid combat entirely, only needing to find opportunities to charge up and use the Storm Ruler's attack. However, it wasn't mindless; charging the Storm Ruler took time, and Yhorm the Giant's aggro would primarily be drawn to the person using it.</p>
<p>As for the Farron Undead Legion BOSS, it was considered more difficult with a multiplayer team-up, because the number of legion members appearing was not fixed; it multiplied based on the number of players in the team. This meant that the more players there were, the more Farron Legion members had to be fought.</p>
<p>After all, the more people there were, the easier it was for chaos to ensue.</p>
<p>Moreover, players weren't AI; even if everyone was a master, the battlefield was constantly changing, and there would always be moments of coordination failure.</p>
<p>But for AI, this situation clearly didn't exist; they were all pre-programmed.</p>
<p>Thus, more players made it harder to fight.</p>
<p>The characteristics of various BOSSes were gradually unearthed by the masters, as was their difficulty.</p>
<p>There were dedicated progress live streams on both international and domestic live streaming platforms.</p>
<p>Today, a certain international high-level player or team had reduced a BOSS's health to a certain amount.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, a certain domestic master would once again refresh the previous raid progress.</p>
<p>It could be said that both domestic and international players were holding their breath, eager to achieve the first kill.</p>
<p>After all, this was an honor that could be recorded in the annals of Dark Souls history. Imagine all the Undead (Ashen Ones) going to the Firelink Shrine and seeing their ID on a stone tablet—how thrilling was that!</p>
<p>Of course, many players also strongly demanded something on Nebula Games' official forum and community, as well as under Chen Xu's official Weibo account.</p>
<p>That was the hope for a "change name" function to be made available.</p>
<p>Because Dark Souls itself was a single-player game with multiplayer functionality, many players didn't pay attention when creating their characters, resulting in various prank names.</p>
<p>Normally, it was fine, but with the appearance of Death Mode, bearing some rather awkward names, how embarrassing would it be if they actually achieved the first kill?</p>
<p>"As for changing save files?"</p>
<p>"Who would abandon a save file they'd grinded for thousands of hours?!"</p>
<p>Likewise, many players also expressed hope for a re-character customization function.</p>
<p>Appearing on the leaderboard with an Eldritch face would also be quite embarrassing.</p>
<p>Of course, it wasn't just high-level players who felt awkward; there were also many ordinary players.</p>
<p>After all, when many first started playing, they were caught up in the moment, haphazardly picking names like AAA, 123, or ABC, and creating character customization like an old man with silver twin pigtails.</p>
<p>But as they played, they realized that the names and faces were genuinely a bit embarrassing, especially when using the multiplayer function.</p>
<p>However, if they were to switch save files, they had played on their current save for so long that they were a little reluctant.</p>
<p>So, seizing this opportunity, many players began to petition.</p>
<p>Moreover, the reasons they provided were quite valid: in real life, you can change your name and even get cosmetic surgery, so why not in a game!?</p>
<p>In response to these enthusiastic demands, Chen Xu met half of the players' requests.</p>
<p>As for names, a new exchange item would be added to the Firelink Shrine, but each save file could only exchange it once.</p>
<p>"And for faces? What's the fuss? Aren't five chances enough?"</p>
<p>Chen Xu gave a reply: "The world of Dark Souls doesn't have such advanced technology."</p>
<p>Seeing Chen Xu's reply, many players were speechless.</p>
<p>"What the hell about 'not such advanced technology'? Whether it exists or not is just a word from you!"</p>
<p>The remaining updates will come later; as expected, my luck is overdrawn, and I've transformed into a Benevolent Gambler King.</p>
