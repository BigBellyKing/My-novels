                <p>Chapter 697: Have I Evolved and Become Stronger? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>In reality, Genichiro Ashina is indeed a BOSS whose moves are easily understood, and he isn't a particularly difficult one either.</p>
<p>However, for new players, especially those who prefer to cheese and haven't solidified their fundamental skills, Genichiro Ashina proves to be the most challenging type.</p>
<p>This is because he tests all sorts of basic player skills.</p>
<p>Blocking, Mikiri Counter, dodge step, and pursuit—if you're lacking in any of these three, then facing Genichiro Ashina will essentially force you to pay back all the lessons you skipped, twofold.</p>
<p>This is why many people call Genichiro Ashina a teacher, as many players learned various fundamental skills from him.</p>
<p>“Are you serious?! Are you serious?!”</p>
<p>Zhang Yi's voice grew increasingly agitated and loud.</p>
<p>He had already died countless times, but he could now usually get through Genichiro Ashina's first phase without dying once.</p>
<p>After all, he did have some foundation, and frankly, Genichiro in his first phase wasn't that difficult.</p>
<p>But once he entered the second phase, everything changed completely.</p>
<p>First, there were more variables. Besides his grappling attacks, Genichiro Ashina's new counter moves included a low sweep attack in addition to his predictable thrusts that could be easily Mikiri Countered. This low sweep could not be Mikiri Countered; he could only avoid it by jumping.</p>
<p>The crucial point was that Zhang Yi sometimes couldn't react in time, because sometimes, even if your mind understood, your hands couldn't execute the action.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the second phase, Genichiro's little tricks increased.</p>
<p>Especially after he jumped, sometimes it was a cleave, and other times it directly turned into rapid fire, frequently giving his head a thorough “washing” with arrows.</p>
<p>There was once the historical allusion of Zhuge Liang borrowing arrows with straw boats; now there was Zhang Yi borrowing arrows with his iron head.</p>
<p>This Genichiro was truly despicable.</p>
<p>Just fight, what's the meaning of suddenly pulling out a bow out of nowhere?</p>
<p>Of course, what further shifted his mindset was not just Genichiro before him, nor the countless “DEATH” messages.</p>
<p>What truly changed his mindset were the off-field factors within the game.</p>
<p>While he was still suffering, the voice prompt rang again.</p>
<p>The familiar voice reached his ears.</p>
<p>“Old Zhang, where are you now? Have you passed Genichiro Ashina yet? I finally took care of Gyoubu Masataka Oniwa at the main gate.” Song Ren's voice echoed in Zhang Yi's ears.</p>
<p>He felt like speaking but held back.</p>
<p>Gyoubu Masataka Oniwa was already defeated!?</p>
<p>Doesn't that mean, besides the Blazing Bull and the General of the Samurai in front of Ashina Castle who doesn't need to be fought, there's only one Iai Swordsman left?</p>
<p>He was about to catch up to his progress soon!</p>
<p>“Genichiro? This BOSS is quite formidable, not comparable to the Blazing Bull or Gyoubu Masataka Oniwa from before. I can only say that Genichiro Ashina is indeed worthy of being the grandson of Sword Saint Isshin Ashina, right?” Zhang Yi coughed lightly and said.</p>
<p>This was his usual excuse when playing multiplayer games like Warcraft and Rainbow Six Siege.</p>
<p>Infinitely exaggerating the opponent's strength made it feel like whatever embarrassing things he did weren't a big deal.</p>
<p>It was the same now; who was the opponent?</p>
<p>The grandson of the legendary Sword Saint Isshin Ashina—how could he be weak?</p>
<p>“That formidable, huh? But Old Zhang, you've been stuck for almost an hour and a half, haven't you? I've already fought from Hirata Estate all the way to Ashina Castle. Have you died 100 times yet?” Song Ren smacked his lips.</p>
<p>“You talk too much!” Zhang Yi's mouth twitched upon hearing Song Ren's words.</p>
<p>Had it been 100 times?</p>
<p>If he counted the resurrection times, it probably was quite close, wasn't it?</p>
<p>“Don't be disheartened. I also died fifty or sixty times fighting Lady Butterfly before. But I feel like fighting humanoid enemies in this game is much more satisfying than fighting monsters. That Sword Clash feeling is simply amazing,” Song Ren said with some emotion.</p>
<p>“Enough talk, I feel it this time. Genichiro should be going down!” Hearing Song Ren's words, Zhang Yi felt he couldn't continue this topic any longer.</p>
<p>And he genuinely had that feeling: he was about to defeat the Genichiro before him.</p>
<p>Because he was already quite proficient in the first phase.</p>
<p>He hung up the phone with Old Song and continued his fierce battle with Genichiro.</p>
<p>Finally, Zhang Yi saw the light of victory.</p>
<p>It had to be said, Genichiro Ashina was absolutely the strongest opponent Zhang Yi had faced so far.</p>
<p>“Die!”</p>
<p>Zhang Yi shouted excitedly and aptly.</p>
<p>As the Kusabimaru in his hand pierced Genichiro's chest, the game screen didn't follow the usual BOSS kill animation but transitioned into a cutscene.</p>
<p>'Impressive... Shinobi... How regrettable. Do you intend to change masters?'</p>
<p>'Absurd.'</p>
<p>'Absurd, you say? As long as it protects Ashina, no matter how much it defies convention, I will master it... Let me show you Tomoe's Lightning!'</p>
<p>The armor on Genichiro before him receded, revealing his upper body covered in blade scars.</p>
<p>At the same time, a bolt of lightning ripped across the sky outside Ashina Castle, striking the blade in Genichiro Ashina's hand, which then shimmered with golden electricity.</p>
<p>The next moment, the game entered the combat phase. The original Genichiro Ashina had now transformed into 'Way of Tomoe - Genichiro Ashina'.</p>
<p>Looking at Genichiro before him, Zhang Yi in the game was utterly stunned.</p>
<p>“What's going on? What happened? There's a third phase?! Are you serious?!”</p>
<p>“And this lightning-infused third phase was waiting for me here!”</p>
<p>Zhang Yi completely panicked.</p>
<p>He recalled that before fighting Genichiro, he had seen a hint for Lightning Reversal on the wall in the dojo downstairs.</p>
<p>So, after all this time, Genichiro's third phase involves summoning lightning?</p>
<p>And this third phase Genichiro must be very strong, right?</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was cautious, watching Genichiro charge towards him, ready to dodge first.</p>
<p>With a dodge step, he stomped on the blade. Genichiro retreated, then followed with a continuous slash. This move was still from the first and second phases, and Zhang Yi was quite proficient at it, performing continuous blocks.</p>
<p>Sparks flew from perfect blocks. Although he didn't perfectly block every attack, as long as his Posture Bar didn't break, everything was fine.</p>
<p>Then a 'Perilous Attack' symbol appeared above Wolf's head.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi saw Genichiro flip back, draw his bow, gathering lightning around himself, and rapidly fire an arrow towards Wolf.</p>
<p>He remembered the Lightning Reversal scroll he had seen after defeating the Iai Swordsman.</p>
<p>Subconsciously, Zhang Yi immediately jumped, following the description of the Lightning Reversal skill he had learned: catch the lightning, then attack just as he was about to land.</p>
<p>The Wolf in the game caught the bolt of lightning with his Kusabimaru, then swung it back – Lightning Reversal.</p>
<p>Wolf's health bar dropped by one segment, while Genichiro's Posture Bar increased by almost two-fifths. More critically, Genichiro immediately entered a stun lock state.</p>
<p>“I... I successfully performed a Lightning Reversal?”</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was momentarily stunned.</p>
<p>He even forgot to attack Genichiro, who was in a stun lock state before him.</p>
<p>When Genichiro got up and continued attacking him, Zhang Yi blocked, dodged, and counterattacked, then noticed something.</p>
<p>This third-phase Genichiro was simply too fragile!</p>
<p>One strike took down a large segment of his health bar, and his Posture Bar filled up relentlessly.</p>
<p>Genichiro then retreated, continuing to summon lightning.</p>
<p>Timing it perfectly, Zhang Yi jumped to catch the lightning and returned it.</p>
<p>“Oh my God! Isn't this a free win? This Lightning Reversal is much easier than parrying!”</p>
<p>He accidentally made a mistake once and was defeated by Genichiro, but Zhang Yi wasn't disheartened at all.</p>
<p>Because he realized that this third-phase Genichiro really didn't seem strong!</p>
<p>He continued the challenge, returning to the rooftop from the second floor. After about three consecutive attempts.</p>
<p>Looking at Genichiro, whose Posture Bar was full and had an execution prompt, Zhang Yi pressed the attack button to execute him and was completely stunned.</p>
<p>He hadn't even fully processed what just happened.</p>
<p>Why did this third-phase Genichiro feel so easy?</p>
<p>Like a free win?</p>
<p>He had died hundreds of times in the previous two phases, so how did he clear Genichiro's third phase in just a few attempts?</p>
<p>It felt a bit unreal!</p>
<p>“Could it be that... I've evolved?!”</p>
<p>“Have I become so powerful that I don't even understand my own strength anymore?”</p>
<p>“It's not that this third-phase Genichiro is too weak; it's that I, having undergone arduous training, am now too strong?”</p>
<p>After successfully defeating Genichiro Ashina, Zhang Yi looked at the subsequent cutscene with Emma and Kuro appearing, his face filled with pleasant surprise.</p>
