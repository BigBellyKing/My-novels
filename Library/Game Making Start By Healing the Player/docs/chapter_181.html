                <p>Chapter 180: Chen Xu Figured Everything Out! (7th Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Looking at the Knight in front of him, Song Ren circled him back and forth.</p>
<p>There was nothing he could do; at that moment, he was filled with envy.</p>
<p>Why are we all Undead and all Knights, yet your equipment is so luxurious?</p>
<p>Bright silver knight armor, a Greatshield adorned with violet patterns.</p>
<p>Then look at his own shabby equipment.</p>
<p>The gap between Knights is too big, isn't it!?</p>
<p>And didn't you say you were almost done for, asking me to help you Link the Fire?</p>
<p>You won't be needing this equipment anymore, why not give it to me?</p>
<p>Looking at the Small Iron Shield in his hand, then at the magnificent shield in the other's hand, Song Ren was genuinely envious.</p>
<p>For a moment, he had the urge to chop the opponent down and peel off their shield.</p>
<p>But he restrained himself.</p>
<p>Because he felt that this Knight might be related to the later main storyline.</p>
<p>And given his understanding of the game Dark Souls.</p>
<p>If he were to strike down this Knight at this moment, there would generally only be two situations.</p>
<p>First, this Knight is a respawnable NPC, like the Fire Keeper.</p>
<p>Second, this Knight, who currently looks sickly and claims to be on his last legs, would suddenly stand up full of vigor and tell him what kind of virtues an Undead should possess.</p>
<p>So, after careful consideration, Song Ren decided to quietly leave.</p>
<p>The world is so beautiful; one, especially an Undead, should not be so irritable.</p>
<p>Song Ren confidently continued forward, going upstairs to a corner.</p>
<p>Suddenly, two Hollows wielding short swords rushed out from the corner, with an Archer shooting cold arrows from behind.</p>
<p>An arrow hit him square in the chest, causing his character to pause slightly.</p>
<p>Then the two short sword-wielding Hollows beside him unleashed a wave of relentless slashes on Song Ren.</p>
<p>Coupled with the stun lock from the distant Hollow Archer's arrow, this combo attack was simply seamless.</p>
<p>Compared to the arrow shots, which only chipped away a small portion of his health bar, the damage from the short sword Hollow's relentless slashes was a bit unreasonable.</p>
<p>Moreover, because the in-game character would pause upon being hit by an arrow, there was no time to dodge by rolling.</p>
<p>With a series of slashes, Song Ren's health bar was instantly depleted.</p>
<p>"What's going on? What happened? How are these two Hollows so ferocious!?"</p>
<p>Looking at the familiar [YOU DIED!] on the screen, Song Ren was completely bewildered.</p>
<p>He had encountered Hollows before, right after leaving the prison cell.</p>
<p>But the problem was, why were these Hollows so fierce once they picked up weapons!?</p>
<p>After respawning, Song Ren decided to be extra careful this time.</p>
<p>After all, he was playing Dark Souls!</p>
<p>He couldn't relax his guard like this anymore.</p>
<p>Song Ren, having returned to the second floor, warned himself inwardly.</p>
<p>After respawning again, Song Ren cautiously aggroed monsters, clearing out the Archer and the two short sword Hollows.</p>
<p>Ahead was a passage, and upon entering, he could see a phantom soldier holding a sword and shield.</p>
<p>Behind the phantom soldier was also a locked door.</p>
<p>Instead of immediately entering the white fog gate, Song Ren first challenged the phantom soldier.</p>
<p>However, the phantom soldier in front of him was surprisingly weak; Song Ren even felt it was less formidable than the previous two short sword Hollows combined with the Archer.</p>
<p>"Only dropped this trash?" Picking up the white glow, Song Ren obtained a Hollow Soldier Shield. However, after checking its stats, he found it was similar to his starting kite shield with a tower emblem, but heavier. Song Ren immediately rejected it decisively.</p>
<p>He couldn't even wear the Knight's armor, why would he take your even heavier shield?</p>
<p>Humming a tune, Song Ren walked towards the door behind, but received a bewildering prompt: No key.</p>
<p>"Wait, wasn't my starting gift a Master Key? The Master Key can't even open this damn door!?" Song Ren couldn't help but feel a wave of frustration.</p>
<p>But if he couldn't go this way, then the only option was clearly the fog gate.</p>
<p>Entering through the white fog gate, Song Ren found himself on the rooftop of the previous room, with the Asylum Demon below.</p>
<p>At the same time, in front of the white fog gate, there was an in-game message: "You can perform a plunging attack."</p>
<p>"This map design is awesome! It's all interconnected!" Song Ren couldn't help but exclaim.</p>
<p>The connected design is a major feature of Dark Souls.</p>
<p>And in the Northern Undead Asylum before him, Song Ren had so far discovered three interconnected areas, which truly surprised him.</p>
<p>What followed should obviously be similar to fighting the Ancient Wyvern in the previous game: a plunging attack from a high vantage point to execute it.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Song Ren couldn't help but smile, sheathed his shield, and switched his weapon to two-handing mode.</p>
<p>"You can't hit me, can you? Come hit me, please, please come kill me!" Standing on the balcony, Song Ren, who was contemplating what pose to use for the Asylum Demon's execution, noticed the BOSS pacing below, glaring fiercely at him, and grinned triumphantly.</p>
<p>But the next moment, Song Ren's smile froze.</p>
<p>He saw the Asylum Demon below suddenly let out a roar, then leapt up, swinging the Hammer in its hand directly towards his second floor.</p>
<p>With a thunderous crash, accompanied by the screen shaking.</p>
<p>The second floor where Song Ren stood was directly smashed and collapsed. His in-game character fell from the second floor, losing a large chunk of health.</p>
<p>Before he could even get up, the BOSS swung its Demon's Great Hammer again, finishing him off.</p>
<p>[YOU DIED!] The familiar three words reappeared.</p>
<p>"Holy cow, I can't even stall for time, or it'll just directly attack me!" Song Ren was completely stunned.</p>
<p>This was something he had completely failed to anticipate.</p>
<p>What was even more crucial was that, at the same time, a bronze trophy for the game achievement [Extreme Joy Turns to Sorrow] popped up in the bottom right corner.</p>
<p>Looking at the trophy's name, Song Ren felt a pang of frustration.</p>
<p>So, all of this was within Chen Xu's expectations?</p>
<p>He had already anticipated players showing off in front of the BOSS here, which led to this specific setting: not immediately attacking, but waiting a while before triggering the attack.</p>
<p>Soon, Song Ren, having respawned at the bonfire, returned to the balcony on the second floor of the Northern Undead Asylum.</p>
<p>This time, Song Ren learned his lesson and didn't just stand there foolishly.</p>
<p>He jumped directly from the balcony, and the weapon in his hand slammed hard into the BOSS's head.</p>
<p>Visibly, the BOSS's health dropped by half.</p>
<p>Having shed his armor, Song Ren's nimble body rolled on the ground, then he raised his hand and gave the BOSS a full set of foot massage (a series of low attacks).</p>
<p>"Now <em>this</em> is a normal attack!"</p>
<p>Seeing a portion of the BOSS's health bar deplete, Song Ren couldn't help but sigh with emotion.</p>
<p>No longer dealing very low damage, but able to inflict respectable damage, the difficulty immediately felt completely different.</p>
<p>Song Ren even felt it wasn't as formidable as Teacher Gundyr the Ash from the previous game; unlike Teacher Gundyr the Ash, this BOSS didn't even have a second phase transformation.</p>
<p>"And you look like a Stray Demon? Leave the group chat, you're an embarrassment!"</p>
<p>Roll, then land a couple of hits.</p>
<p>Soon, the BOSS in front let out a wail, collapsed, and died.</p>
<p>Song Ren then obtained a key to open the Northern Undead Asylum's main gate, and an item called Humanity.</p>
<p>Holding the key dropped by the BOSS, Song Ren opened the main gate of the Northern Undead Asylum.</p>
<p>Continuing forward, when he reached the cliff edge behind the Northern Undead Asylum, Song Ren successfully triggered a cutscene.</p>
<p>‘According to ancient legends, a select few Undead can leave the Northern Undead Asylum and embark on a distant pilgrimage.’</p>
<p>Accompanied by the background Narration, a giant black bird suddenly descended from the sky and appeared before him, just as it had after defeating the Ice Dog and leaving the High Wall of Lothric, grabbing the in-game protagonist and flying towards the distance.</p>
<p>‘That is the land of ancient kings... Lordran!’</p>
<p>Piercing through thick clouds, a magnificent ancient city-state appeared in Song Ren's vision.</p>
<p>However, it appeared to be in dead silence.</p>
<p>Finally, the giant bird dropped him in a scene that resembled ruins.</p>
<p>At the same time, the name of the area appeared in the center of the game screen: Firelink Shrine.</p>
<p>"What a familiar place!"</p>
<p>Unlike the grand Firelink Shrine from before, this Firelink Shrine seemed a bit primitive.</p>
<p>Completely different from what was in his memory, it was even open-air.</p>
<p>In the center, a save point bonfire was burning.</p>
<p>Looking around, the entire Firelink Shrine was like ruins.</p>
<p>"The path of Linking the Fire finally begins its proper course now!" Looking at the Firelink Shrine, even though it was different from the previous game, it was still where the legendary path began. Song Ren sighed with emotion.</p>
<p>Although he had died four times very naturally in the Northern Undead Asylum.</p>
<p>But he could only say it was no big deal!</p>
