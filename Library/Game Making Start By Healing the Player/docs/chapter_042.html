                <p>Chapter 42: Exceedingly High Praise</p>
<p>Amidst the various discussions among players and media online, at three in the afternoon, the Game Department's website, as well as official Weibo accounts and public WeChat accounts speaking for official games, simultaneously announced the latest selection news.</p>
<p>To the Moon successfully won first prize in this Game Design Competition, while Galaxy Heroes ranked second.</p>
<p>Chen Xu, from Nebula Games, also received a phone notification from the Game Department.</p>
<p>The content of the call was an invitation for him to attend the award ceremony at the Game Department.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the official game store, a notification of To the Moon's award win was also featured on the homepage.</p>
<p>And on the homepage of the official game store, an appreciation review designating To the Moon as the first-prize winner was also displayed.</p>
<p>'Imagine, you're sitting on your deathbed, recalling all the joys and regrets of your life, especially those regrets.'</p>
<p>'You always told yourself that if you could go back, you would do this, fulfill that dream, but it always seemed that something diverted you from realizing your dreams: family obligations, work, spending time with friends.'</p>
<p>'And now, as you are about to pass away, you no longer have time. What if you could alter your memories on your deathbed, thereby fulfilling that dream in your dying mind?'</p>
<p>'This is just the tip of the iceberg for To the Moon. It's not a major production; it lacks exquisite graphics and complex gameplay, but what I want to say is, just like producer Chen Xu's previous game, Undertale, To the Moon taught a lesson to all designers creating narrative video games, raising the bar for this genre to such a high level.'</p>
<p>'If one wishes to review the entire game, it's difficult to discuss without spoilers, but we can only say that if you are a player who values story-driven games, then this game is a must-play.'</p>
<p>'Such a view might be influenced by time, but at least for now, this is absolutely a perfect game.'</p>
<p>'The dialogue is perfect. There are many witty jokes in the collaboration between Dr. Eva and Dr. Neil, providing humor to break up what is often a somber story.'</p>
<p>'The story is perfect. Johnny and his wife Liva's story has many twists and turns, some bittersweet, some utterly poignant, but it's not merely a blend of humor and sorrow.'</p>
<p>'The music is perfect, filled with beautiful piano melodies, each track shining individually, recurring during different thematic stories and choice moments, just as you would expect from the best films.'</p>
<p>'To the Moon is about a life: the people, places, hardships, and joys that make us human.'</p>
<p>'The entire story begins as a mixed bag, but as the years rewind, it yields a satisfying crystallization.'</p>
<p>'Without a doubt, this is absolutely a perfect game.'</p>
<p>This appreciation article from the Game Department can be said to have given To the Moon an exceedingly high evaluation, fully affirming To the Moon's status in gaming.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games' office. Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue also saw the Game Department's announcement immediately, and both cheered.</p>
<p>"Chen Xu, look quickly! To the Moon has made it to the recommendation slot on the Official Game Platform!" Yang Xin exclaimed excitedly.</p>
<p>This was the Official Game Platform!</p>
<p>And this game actually took first place in this event.</p>
<p>This was something Yang Xin wouldn't have dared to imagine before.</p>
<p>For her, who was wholeheartedly committed to achieving great things in the gaming industry, it was so exciting that she couldn't control herself.</p>
<p>Her entire face turned red from excitement.</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue, beside her, was equally excited, her face beaming.</p>
<p>As for the new employees who joined Nebula Games during the period To the Moon was launched, they were also very excited.</p>
<p>Although this game had absolutely nothing to do with them.</p>
<p>But such an achievement completely proved that Nebula Games had a promising future, and since they were about to work for this company with unlimited prospects, they were naturally very happy.</p>
<p>"Oh, right, are you going to attend the To the Moon award ceremony next?" Yang Xin asked Chen Xu, remembering something.</p>
<p>"Yes, the Game Department's leadership just informed me." Chen Xu nodded.</p>
<p>"Award ceremony! Will it be on TV?" Ruan Ningxue, on the side, asked curiously.</p>
<p>"You're thinking too much. It's not a commercial award ceremony. It's basically just showing your face and getting a certificate." Chen Xu shook his head.</p>
<p>"Ah, I see!" Ruan Ningxue suddenly understood.</p>
<p>"Alright, enough about that. Let's talk about company matters. I'll give everyone a heads-up first. After the National Day holiday, we will also start developing new projects, and this time it will be a relatively big move."</p>
<p>"Also, before the end of October, the platform needs to be set up. For time-consuming, labor-intensive, non-core areas, we'll go directly with outsourcing."</p>
<p>Chen Xu looked at everyone and said.</p>
<p>Mirror, Undertale, and To the Moon, these three games were very small in terms of cost and scale.</p>
<p>But in terms of sales, they were absolutely successful.</p>
<p>The funds provided by the three games, for Chen Xu currently, were still insufficient for developing large-scale AAA games.</p>
<p>But some more refined, larger-scale games could definitely be ventured into.</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu's words, everyone's expressions turned serious, but at the same time, there was more anticipation.</p>
<p>After all, who in the gaming industry doesn't have a heart that wants to participate in big projects?</p>
<p>Whether from the perspective of personal goals or career resume.</p>
<p>After a brief chat with the team members, Chen Xu returned to his office, leaned back in his chair, and looked at the UI interface that only he could see.</p>
<p>It must be said that To the Moon truly earned him a huge wave of points.</p>
<p>It gathered enough points for three ten-pulls for him, in addition to what Undertale and Mirror provided.</p>
<p>His current points had increased to 4.5 million.</p>
<p>Enough for forty-five draws.</p>
<p>However, looking at these points, Chen Xu didn't immediately take action.</p>
<p>He was planning to save them for a while.</p>
<p>Although Chen Xu hadn't decided on the next new project, after all, even if he were to develop it, it would have to wait until after the National Day holiday.</p>
<p>During this period, Chen Xu estimated that, at the current rate of increase, he would probably accumulate enough points for another ten-pull by then.</p>
<p>After all, To the Moon, having just won first prize and landed a recommendation slot on the Official Game Platform, would definitely attract a large number of players.</p>
<p>And these players were fresh, hot points!</p>
<p>Saving up for a ten-pull at once, from a superstitious perspective, the chance of getting good items would be slightly higher.</p>
<p>Don't be like before, where a twenty-one pull yielded nothing but two Memory Capsules, not even a Rare Skill Book.</p>
