                <p>Chapter 683: Mr. Chen's Full Malice (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>The two <em>BioShock</em> games brought an artistic sky-city and an underwater city.</p>
<p>They also inspired many independent game designers.</p>
<p>A series of games with tragic character storylines could be said to have tormented many players significantly.</p>
<p>In this situation, Nebula Games, naturally attracting attention due to its prominence, became the primary target.</p>
<p>Many players online were discussing it.</p>
<p>'Damn, who started this trend of tragic-themed games? I played through three games in a row: one with a dead female protagonist, one with a dead male protagonist, and another where both protagonists died!'</p>
<p>'+1. It seems like there have been a lot more of these heart-wrenching games lately! And damn it, some of them are quite well-made, so you get immersed, and in the end, it hurts even more.'</p>
<p>'Heh heh, who started this trend? Just think about the tragic storylines in <em>World of Warcraft</em>, and the recently launched <em>BioShock</em>. Who do you think started it?'</p>
<p>'Honestly, I don't think Mr. Chen should take the blame for this one. After all, he's a repeat offender; he "stabs" us emotionally twice every year. This wave won't lead to a death sentence, at most life imprisonment.'</p>
<p>'Completely unconvincing! This trend emerged right after <em>BioShock</em>. Whose fault do you say it is?'</p>
<p>'But these are mostly small and medium-sized game developers and independent game designers. Logically, their development cycles shouldn't align, right?'</p>
<p>'Oh, what are you arguing about? Mr. Chen is the "Stabbing Master," no doubt about it! Just blame Mr. Chen; you can't go wrong!'</p>
<p>'Exactly!'</p>
<p>Many players chuckled and teased, inadvertently pushing Nebula Games and Chen Xu's names back onto the trending searches.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games, Chen Xu simply smiled faintly as he watched the online discussions among players.</p>
<p>In the past, he might have sighed with emotion, but now, his mood was completely unaffected.</p>
<p>Well... not entirely unaffected.</p>
<p>He was even a little happy.</p>
<p>After all, if players were full of resentment, it meant the games offered a stronger sense of immersion.</p>
<p>And now, what he could do was make <em>Sekiro</em> even better.</p>
<p>For example, through the subtle guidance in its level design.</p>
<p>Looking at Chen Xu's level designs, everyone in the team shivered.</p>
<p>They all understood the sheer malice contained within; it was designed to kill players without recompense!</p>
<p>Compared to <em>Bloodborne</em> and <em>Dark Souls</em>, <em>Sekiro</em> could truly be said to have the most effective guidance.</p>
<p>As long as you didn't skip all the dialogue, you could gather a lot of useful information.</p>
<p>For example, after defeating the second elite enemy, General of the Samurai Kawarada, players could talk to a senile old woman and obtain a bell to enter the memory of three years prior.</p>
<p>Also, from the petty merchant near the Chained Ogre, players could purchase information about the Chained Ogre's weakness to fire.</p>
<p>While some "cheese" methods in <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Bloodborne</em> required players to figure them out and explore on their own.</p>
<p>In <em>Sekiro</em>, these "cheese" methods were explicitly hinted at to the players through in-game guidance.</p>
<p>But this was the trickiest part.</p>
<p>It was just like in <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>; the initial quests were incredibly simple, with the first few monsters like Great Jagras and Coronated Dragon being incredibly weak.</p>
<p>However, the difficulty gradually ramped up later, and by the mid-game, monsters like Rathalos and Diablos started deterring players.</p>
<p>As for the cool Elder Dragons in the late game, such as Nergigante, Kushala Daora, and Teostra, they would school players in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>And <em>Sekiro</em> was no different. You happily "cheesed" your way through the early game, didn't you?</p>
<p>Just wait until you meet Lady Butterfly, and you'll understand why the sun is so bright. Oh, you "cheesed" Lady Butterfly with formulaic dodging too?</p>
<p>Forget about Genichiro in Ashina Castle; the Iai Swordsman on the second floor can give you a lesson or two for an hour or two.</p>
<p>Especially after the first DEMO version was released, Chen Xu personally played it and then issued an order: increase the difficulty.</p>
<p>This secretly made many people determined that no matter how good the game turned out, they, as the core development team, would not play it.</p>
<p>Because it was completely different from <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Bloodborne</em>.</p>
<p>Even if you knew the monster's moves, if your reaction wasn't fast enough, you still couldn't execute it.</p>
<p>It was very easy to find yourself in a situation where your mind understood, but your hands couldn't follow.</p>
<p>Therefore, compared to other games on the market, this time <em>Sekiro</em> was particularly special: after testing, brainwave input control was canceled, and it reverted to ordinary controllers.</p>
<p>As for why?</p>
<p>Because pure brainwave control had input lag, which made it even more difficult for some players.</p>
<p>Relying purely on muscle memory was actually easier.</p>
<p>However, despite this, as a Souls-like game,</p>
<p>perhaps many players would still cheer with joy.</p>
<p>After all, after undergoing the dual trials of <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Bloodborne</em>, players who had awakened their masochistic tendencies were not few in number.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p><em>Sekiro</em>'s development progress was rapid, as the main workload was focused on the diverse monsters.</p>
<p>As for the overall scene construction, on one hand, there were many corresponding resources in the art asset library, making development much faster.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <em>Sekiro</em>'s map resources were not extensive, and many could be reused.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of combat actions, players only used a single Kusabimaru from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Other various martial arts techniques didn't require specialized action adaptation like in <em>Bloodborne</em> and <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>These weren't particularly technical challenges; the difficult part was how to create that Jidaigeki film style of clashing blades.</p>
<p>Although the physics engine's performance was already excellent, there were still some detailed aspects that required fine-tuning.</p>
<p>On another note, <em>Sekiro</em>'s promotional materials were also being prepared simultaneously.</p>
<p>These promotional materials would also highlight the game's greatest feature: its weapon clashing combat.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>At the beginning of the month, many players were still "condemning" Chen Xu online.</p>
<p>But on this day, many players discovered that Chen Xu had uncharacteristically surfaced to post on the official Weibo account.</p>
<p>'To make up for everyone's feelings, this time I've brought you an exhilarating action game, and I believe the new game's ending will truly satisfy players.'</p>
<p>Upon seeing Chen Xu's Weibo post, players' resentment immediately boiled over even more fiercely.</p>
<p>'Oh, so you <em>do</em> know how deeply <em>BioShock</em> hurt us?'</p>
<p>'A new game ending that satisfies players? Does that mean another protagonist in a Nebula Games title is about to meet their demise?'</p>
<p>'Holy crap, I'd be a ghost if I believed you!'</p>
<p>Countless players complained one after another.</p>
<p>Of course, complaints aside, many players' little hands still instinctively clicked on the video attachment beneath the Weibo post.</p>
