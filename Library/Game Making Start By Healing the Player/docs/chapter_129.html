                <p>Chapter 129: Full of Malice</p>
<p>To be honest, after getting through the monsters encountered on the High Wall of Lothric, including bosses like the Curse-Rotted Greatwood that fell into the deep pit, they actually felt even simpler than regular mobs like the Black Knight.</p>
<p>And some elite monsters encountered along the way, such as the Outrider Knight, Black Knight, and Giant Crab, could be bypassed without fighting.</p>
<p>As for common mobs, although they were a bit harder compared to previous monsters, the difficulty coefficient hadn't increased to a terrifying degree. As long as players figured out their attack patterns and mechanisms, it wasn't difficult to get through.</p>
<p>But the most crucial core point was that the price paid before getting familiar with them was death. And players often weren't just facing enemies during combat; they also had to contend with the current map terrain and environment. For example, in Farron Keep, whether to endure the poisonous assault of the poison pools or just run around first. The combination of map traps and monsters could only be described as bringing countless players to tears.</p>
<p>Many players even felt that facing the Great Machete Ghru and Darkwraith in Farron Keep was harder than fighting bosses. However, players who had reached this point, aside from complaining about the map's overly dark design, didn't turn their aggression directly towards <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>Because after experiencing the previous levels, they already understood very clearly what kind of game <em>Dark Souls</em> was. And during this time, they had also felt its unique charm. Players were more inclined to point their fingers at Chen Xu. After all, he was the true mastermind behind the scenes.</p>
<p>“I'm speechless. What kind of genius could design a map like Farron Keep?”</p>
<p>“Look at my meme; it's this kind of person!”</p>
<p>“Honestly, Mr. Chen's design is just too dark and twisted!”</p>
<p>“Heh heh, back when <em>Outlast</em> came out, I already knew Mr. Chen's character. Sure enough, it's exposed now! What Warrior of Love? He's clearly a treacherous warrior!”</p>
<p>“Well said! But, old bro upstairs, I see from your Nebula Games Platform authenticated account that you bought every single one of Chen Xu's games. And your overseas platform authentication shows <em>Mirror (Game)</em> playtime of 420.1 hours? Have you been using this account for the past year?”</p>
<p>“<em>Cough cough!</em> Limited resources, and I was young and foolish.”</p>
<p>Due to the Farron Keep map, countless players became active in the forum community. However, to many people's surprise, at this critical moment, Chen Xu actually reposted an official Weibo account post complaining about Farron Keep being too difficult, and then left a comment below.</p>
<p>The official Weibo content was simple: The Farron Keep map is indeed quite difficult, classified as a top-tier map.</p>
<p>Seeing Chen Xu's reply, countless players were immediately speechless. <em>You knew all along that this map's design was full of malice!</em> But after a simple grumble, many players also started to feel a glimmer of anticipation. Since Farron Keep's malice was top-tier, if they gritted their teeth and persevered, things should get easier later, right?</p>
<p>Of course, some players felt that things might not be that simple. So, after struggling through the Farron Keep area, as the content progressed, they quickly realized: Yes, Farron Keep was indeed a top-tier malicious map. But that didn't mean the maps that followed would necessarily be weaker than it!</p>
<p>After defeating the Farron Breakdance… no, it should be the Farron Undead Legion, they opened the entrance to the Catacombs. In the Catacombs, players fully experienced what “love” meant. Not to mention the Carthus Swordsman wielding great machetes and the vast hordes of skeletons.</p>
<p>The mechanisms in this area could be said to have bewildered countless players. Walking along, inexplicably, a row of crossbow bolts would shoot out from the wall, blasting the player to pieces. Walking along, a giant rolling bone ball would descend from the sky behind you and send you flying. All sorts of jars and pots were placed there; if you were a hyperactive player, you'd roll into them, and the strange mist that emerged would directly teach you how to write “YOU DIED” all over again.</p>
<p>And some particularly talented and hardcore players, upon reaching Irithyll Dungeon and the Profaned Capital, would face even greater psychological blows. Besides various insidious and malicious traps, the monsters and scenes here directly made some timid players tremble, as if they had found the same experience as in <em>Outlast</em>.</p>
<p>The Wretches screamed, the Maggot-ridden Wretches and Cage Spiders showed them what mental pollution was, and even corpses would scream when picked up from the ground. The items dropped after killing a group of rats and giants might even be Dung Pie. There were also seven Jailers wielding glowing red branding irons, forming a Seven Jailers' Kindling Slaughter Formation, teaching players what it meant to be Butt-Roasting Experts.</p>
<p>Many players didn't flinch when first facing Gundyr the Ash, gritted their teeth on the High Wall of Lothric, self-motivated themselves in the Undead Settlement, and finally completed their transformation in Farron Keep. But upon reaching this point, they immediately chickened out, declaring they wanted to keep company with the Crestfallen Warrior. *This fire, whoever wants to Link it, can Link it!</p>
<p>Compared to ordinary players who simply quit if they didn't want to play anymore, streamers on various platforms were both in pain and joyful. The pain came from the game being full of malice at every turn, combined with its extremely high difficulty, which was simply insane. The joy came from the fact that players loved to watch.</p>
<p>Especially players who had been turned away from the game loved watching streamers play, feeling a sense of shared experience. When a streamer died, sending a few sarcastic bullet comments was pure delight. The popularity of live streaming and video platforms also boosted the game's sales and popularity, bringing in wave after wave of new players. After all, everyone knows that playing and watching are two different concepts.</p>
<p>Many players, after watching some streamers go mentally unstable from being abused, developed a feeling that “I definitely wouldn't be like that if I played.” Then, after buying the game, they found that it was completely different.</p>
<p>These players reacted to the game in various ways. Some directly chose to refund. Some chose to buy but not play. Other players chose to persevere, and from it, awakened a special constitution, feeling the unique texture and charm of the Souls series.</p>
<p>And while everyone was suffering, Chen Xu, in Nebula Games' office, was beaming as he watched his points increase. For <em>Dark Souls</em>, this emotion harvesting was simply unstoppable!</p>
<p>At first, many players contributed Resentment Points. But later, after defeating powerful enemies and acquiring better weapons, it brought a kind of joy and happiness. This was also the specialty of <em>Dark Souls</em>; it wasn't a game purely created for abuse. Besides the crushing resentment, once players truly immersed themselves and adapted to the game, they could gain many satisfying experiences.</p>
<p>The joy of becoming stronger, the joy of seeing through the producer's insidious traps, the joy of discovering new strategies and playstyles. It could be said that <em>Dark Souls</em> was definitely a top-tier emotion harvester.</p>
<p>“The resentment is overflowing!”</p>
<p>Looking at the golden item he had previously drawn in his inventory, the previously lowest Resentment bar among the four different progress bars was now full. Clearly, if it could be visualized, it would already be overflowing. Happiness was just a tiny bit short, while anger and sadness were next, still about one-sixth remaining.</p>
<p>However, according to the observed progress, it was only a matter of time. Chen Xu leaned back in his office chair, happily watching, when a knock sounded at the door, and his assistant Lin Rou's voice came through.</p>
