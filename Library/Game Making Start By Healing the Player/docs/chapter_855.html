                <p>Chapter 854: Operation Code: Avenge Our Shame</p>
<p>It must be said that Payday was incredibly addictive. For Zhang Yi and his two companions, it had been a long time since they had encountered such a satisfying and fun game.</p>
<p>Especially the role of a robber, it made them unable to stop clicking to start the next game.</p>
<p>Dazzling banknotes and thrilling gunfight operations, time and again, completely hyped them up.</p>
<p>And the game's music, with its wild electronic beats as the BGM, made their blood pump even more.</p>
<p>The crucial thing was that the music for each heist was different.</p>
<p>Moreover, it wasn't all tense and exciting, with heavy bass booming electronic music and rock that made one dizzy; there were also soothing piano pieces, operas, and ballads.</p>
<p>Although the game's storyline wasn't as exciting as Call of Duty's,</p>
<p>Combined with the grinding elements in the game, it could be said that the pace of robbing in the game simply couldn't be stopped.</p>
<p>The three-person Payday gang went from robbing four stores to a jewelry store, and then from the jewelry store to Las Vegas.</p>
<p>As the robberies progressed, their methods became more and more skilled, their net worth rose, and they also learned various skills in the game.</p>
<p>After all, this was a grind-heavy game. Upon completing missions, they could earn experience and money.</p>
<p>Experience could be converted into skill points, and taking different talent trees would grant different special abilities.</p>
<p>For instance, if your class was a Bruiser and you chose the Armaments talent tree, you could click on a talent called Porter, allowing you to carry two bags of loot simultaneously, and your throwing distance for bags would be further than others.</p>
<p>Similarly, if your class was a Ghost and you chose to unlock the Sixth Sense talent in the Stealth tree, you could automatically mark nearby enemies and civilians, and also increase the value of loot obtained in reconnaissance mode.</p>
<p>It could be said that each class had its unique characteristics and gameplay combinations.</p>
<p>Combined with the heist levels, the integration of these skills, along with different firearms, offered a completely different gaming experience.</p>
<p>"I think we should try stealth gameplay, don't you? We haven't succeeded even once yet," Zhang Yi suggested after successfully completing another jewelry store heist.</p>
<p>From the start of the game until now, their robbing spree hadn't stopped, and they had also become increasingly professional.</p>
<p>Ammo bags, medical bags, and mutual cooperation.</p>
<p>At least on low difficulty, for example, the One Skull difficulty, they had never failed.</p>
<p>As for areas with Two Skulls or more, those were still their forbidden zones for now.</p>
<p>In the underworld, the monikers of Zhang Mazi, Song Silang, and Wang Dabiao sent shivers down one's spine.</p>
<p>Yet, these three international outlaws harbored some regret.</p>
<p>Their very first heist, which was originally planned as a perfect, flawless operation where they would escape with the stolen money before the police could even react, leaving their achievements hidden.</p>
<p>But due to their immaturity in mind and lack of experience on their first 'delivery,' they turned Payday into Assassin's Creed. What was supposed to be a stealth mission devolved into a Musou-style rampage.</p>
<p>"No problem."</p>
<p>"Avenge our shame!"</p>
<p>Listening to Zhang Yi, Wang Han and Song Ren also nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>They were not who they used to be.</p>
<p>Why did they fail at the beginning?</p>
<p>Aside from psychological reasons, the main factor was a lack of understanding of the game's mechanics. Now, it was completely different.</p>
<p>"This is the mission!"</p>
<p>Zhang Yi entered crime.net and selected a freshly generated heist.</p>
<p>【Car Dealership Heist】: Our target this time is Taiya Motors. We'll act in the evening when there aren't too many civilians. These are supercars imported from Europe and Asia, works of art of modern engineering, a combined結晶 of various high-end technologies. Therefore, their value is very high. Bring them back without a single scratch.</p>
<p>"Let's get some practice first. We'll choose the One Skull difficulty. Also, I'll buy two advantageous conditions for us: more dumpsters and body bags." Zhang Yi chose to make the purchases.</p>
<p>This was another interesting aspect of Payday: in a heist, in addition to their own gear, players could pay an extra fee at the heist location to gain some favorable conditions.</p>
<p>"Let's go, let's go! This time, we're going to be high-IQ master thieves, not brutes!" Song Ren whispered, completely immersed in the role.</p>
<p>"No problem!" "Of course!" Zhang Yi and Wang Han, the couple, comically delivered a line from the Blue Ogre Magi.</p>
<p>As the heist loaded, the three quickly arrived at the car dealership's entrance.</p>
<p>As usual, the three performed their reconnaissance work before the heist.</p>
<p>Around them was a road under repair, cordoned off with red and white caution tape, but none of that mattered. What caught Zhang Yi's attention most were the four gleaming sports cars parked inside the transparent display window on the first floor of the car dealership across the street.</p>
<p>Dark green, coffee brown, black-gold, and bright red – all top-tier luxury sports cars. Although due to copyright issues, these four cars didn't have obvious brands, just their cool designs sitting there made him a little restless.</p>
<p>Seeing these four cars, Zhang Yi understood one thing: he was definitely getting this loot today!</p>
<p>"Old rules, first check the guard strength. Don't forget to look at the camera positions and alarm locations," Zhang Yi reminded in a low voice as the three walked towards the car dealership.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, all good," Song Ren and Wang Han replied.</p>
<p>After playing for several hours, the three had basically developed the habit of Payday players: upon entering, first check the cameras, then look for any one-button alarms.</p>
<p>It had to be said, worthy of a car dealership with four supercars, the cameras seemed to be free of charge.</p>
<p>And there were quite a lot of security guards, one every few steps.</p>
<p>The entire first floor was divided into a front hall and a back hall, both with plenty of security guards and cameras.</p>
<p>At the same time, the back hall also had a few luxury sports cars parked, and civilians listening to sales staff explain about buying cars.</p>
<p>"Five cameras. The corner closest to the leftmost door is a blind spot."</p>
<p>Wang Han, who had picked the Sixth Sense talent as a Ghost, quickly assessed the security distribution.</p>
<p>"Both the front and back halls have security guards, but their patrol frequency isn't high. There's a stationary head guard at the main staircase leading to the second floor in the front hall."</p>
<p>Song Ren also quickly identified the guard deployment.</p>
<p>"There's a door in the back hall leading to the second floor. Although it's closed, it can be opened without much noise. Also, the manager's office is on the far right of the second floor, followed by the conference room, and then the VIP room and lounge area."</p>
<p>Exchanging the information they had gathered, the three felt they had basically figured out the entire car dealership.</p>
<p>Exiting the car dealership, the three crouched by a nearby green belt outside, discussing their strategy.</p>
<p>Inside the entire car dealership, there were about eight or nine security guards, on both the first and second floors, plus two in the outside parking lot.</p>
<p>Among them, in addition to the stationary guards, many would patrol.</p>
<p>Next were the civilians, divided into those who remained stationary and those who moved around.</p>
<p>After consolidating all the intelligence, Zhang Yi finalized their plan for this operation.</p>
<p>"Go in quietly, no shooting."</p>
<p>"No problem!"</p>
<p>"Operation Code: Avenge Our Shame!"</p>
<p>Song Ren and Wang Han nodded.</p>
<p>"GOGOGO!"</p>
