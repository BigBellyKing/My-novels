                <p>Chapter 219: Along the River During the Qingming Festival (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>As the early access trial of Minecraft concluded, online players had mixed opinions about the game.</p>
<p>Some found the game quite interesting, and its block-building, Lego-style gameplay was also rather novel.</p>
<p>However, many players completely failed to grasp how Minecraft was played.</p>
<p>Because the entire game seemed to lack any specific objective.</p>
<p>In Don't Starve, players had to slowly develop themselves to survive.</p>
<p>For example, in Don't Starve, if players didn't quickly gather resources, they would almost certainly face a dead end during the first Hound attack.</p>
<p>Moreover, with the change of seasons, besides Hounds, there would also be some BOSSes attacking.</p>
<p>It could be said that surviving in Don't Starve was not an easy task, even on easy mode.</p>
<p>But in Minecraft, many players felt that surviving was simply too easy.</p>
<p>The most dangerous time in the game was only at night.</p>
<p>However, unlike Don't Starve, where you needed to be by a campfire,</p>
<p>the atmosphere at night in Minecraft, though also a bit scary,</p>
<p>was much easier to get through than in Don't Starve.</p>
<p>Dig a hole, bury some dirt, count to five; no need to sleep in a bed, just wait seven minutes until day, and you're basically out of danger.</p>
<p>As for hunger, there were cows, sheep, and chickens.</p>
<p>Such creatures were not uncommon in Minecraft.</p>
<p>If surviving in Don't Starve was a luxury,</p>
<p>then in Minecraft, it was a very relaxed affair.</p>
<p>Of course, higher difficulties were another matter entirely.</p>
<p>It could be said that as long as one didn't actively seek death, life was completely guaranteed.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, many players couldn't figure out what the focus of Minecraft really was.</p>
<p>This was also why Chen Xu added various new player tutorials to Minecraft.</p>
<p>Because players in this Parallel World had no concept of sandbox games, let alone open-world games.</p>
<p>Therefore, Chen Xu needed to guide them, so they could understand the fundamental appeal and unique characteristics of the game.</p>
<p>Once they understood, it would be time for players to let loose and express themselves.</p>
<p>While the industry discussed Minecraft's lukewarm performance,</p>
<p>Chen Xu and Nebula Games finally made their move.</p>
<p>Numerous domestic game media portals jointly published a series of news and articles.</p>
<p>“In Minecraft, You Can Even Travel to Bianjing, the Northern Song Dynasty Capital!”</p>
<p>“Is This Really Just a Pixel Game?”</p>
<p>“How to Recreate 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' in Minecraft!”</p>
<p>As for promotion, how could Chen Xu remain indifferent? He had long since made arrangements.</p>
<p>Discussions about Minecraft instantly exploded.</p>
<p>Immediately, the attention of many industry designers and players was drawn.</p>
<p>But what followed was a wave of bewilderment.</p>
<p>Along the River During the Qingming Festival?</p>
<p>What connection does 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' have with Minecraft?</p>
<p>Could it be that Nebula Games used blocks in Minecraft to piece together a scroll painting of 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival'?</p>
<p>Many players looked bewildered, completely unaware of what it meant.</p>
<p>Players who had or hadn't played the game, upon seeing these news articles, clicked on the video links within them out of curiosity.</p>
<p>The video began with a text overlay: 'This video features in-game footage; all structures can be recreated within the game...'</p>
<p>When players saw this text, they didn't react much.</p>
<p>But the next moment, when the video content appeared, all players were instantly stunned.</p>
<p>"Holy cow! My roommate asked why I was kneeling in front of the computer!"</p>
<p>"Is this a pixel game? Is this a damn pixel game? Is this really the pixel game I've been playing for the past few days?"</p>
<p>"Ah Wei died! This footage, Chen Xu, don't fool me, this must be a CG animation, right?!"</p>
<p>"Holy cow, it's really 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival'! I thought you were just piecing together a scroll painting, but you actually brought Bianjing to life for me!?"</p>
<p>Countless players who clicked on the video were instantly stunned by the visuals that greeted their eyes.</p>
<p>Everyone simply couldn't believe their eyes.</p>
<p>Those who hadn't played it might not have been as affected, but players who had played Minecraft were now incredibly excited and bewildered.</p>
<p>Because the visuals in this video, compared to the game they had played before, could they even be the same?</p>
<p>The video first showed a hazy drizzle.</p>
<p>As the raindrops fell to the ground, it felt as if one had traveled across a thousand years, returning to the banks of the Bian River from a millennium ago.</p>
<p>In the continuous rainy weather, the pattering rain fell on the deserted streets of Bianliang.</p>
<p>It seemed to subtly hint at the hidden dangers behind this prosperous city.</p>
<p>As the melodious background music began, the camera lens slowly ascended, encompassing the entire Bianliang and Bian River.</p>
<p>The camera slowly zoomed in on the buildings along the streets, allowing people to clearly see the structures in the main streets and alleys, as well as the temples and pavilions.</p>
<p>Passing through streets, canals, sky-high pavilions, and fields, the rain gradually stopped.</p>
<p>The sun slowly rose, casting its light upon the streets of Bianliang.</p>
<p>Countless people, with their joyous laughter, gradually appeared on the streets of Bianjing.</p>
<p>Next, the video footage changed with the camera's movements.</p>
<p>Merchants selling goods and tourists appeared in the streets and alleys.</p>
<p>On the canal, there were boats coming and going, carrying poets, merchants, and high-ranking officials.</p>
<p>On the roads outside Bianliang, merchants leading cattle and horses lined the streets.</p>
<p>In the fields were working farmers and playing children.</p>
<p>As time progressed, Bianliang gradually entered night.</p>
<p>Painted pleasure boats moored in the center of the Bian River, and countless Kongming lanterns drifted across the sky.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the video screen gradually plunged into darkness, and the originally melodious music slowly faded away.</p>
<p>And after this, there was making-of footage.</p>
<p>Using fragmented, fast-forwarded shots, it recreated how 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' was meticulously built, piece by piece.</p>
<p>From nothing to existence, it demonstrated that these things, if players desired, could likewise be replicated in the game.</p>
<p>Moreover, for the lighting and shadows in 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival,' Chen Xu did not use subsequent rendering; it was entirely displayed using the game's inherent lighting and shadow effects.</p>
<p>Although post-rendering would certainly enhance the visual representation, for ordinary players, it would clearly look a bit fake.</p>
<p>It was like a photo: you promised a bare-faced picture, but then you uploaded a beauty-filtered one, and a retouched one at that – wasn't that deceiving people?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Minecraft's inherent recreation of 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' alone completely stunned the players.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in this demonstration, Chen Xu also employed a cutting-edge technology.</p>
<p>That was the AI visual enhancement technology that Galaxy Smart Tech had been researching.</p>
<p>The tools used last year were now ticking down to completion.</p>
<p>Including Zhong Yue, who had already applied for relevant patents for the latest technology.</p>
<p>Chen Xu was also using this technology for the first time in the demonstration of Minecraft, or rather, 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival'.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the effect, it could be said that it fully met Chen Xu's expectations.</p>
<p>However, in terms of current optimizations, using the latest AI technology still consumes a lot of resources.</p>
<p>It also requires higher player specifications, so currently, at Nebula Games, Chen Xu has asked Qin Yi and his team to conduct further optimizations.</p>
<p>However, for players, it was clear that they couldn't fully appreciate this from the video alone.</p>
