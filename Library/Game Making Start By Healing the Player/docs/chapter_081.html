                <p>Chapter 81: Preparations Before the Exhibition</p>
<p>Looking at the cardboard boxes Chen Xu and Lin Rou carried in, everyone was filled with curiosity.</p>
<p>The boxes were quite large, about half a person's height, and from their appearance, it was impossible to tell what was inside.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, what's inside here?" Ruan Ningxue asked with some curiosity.</p>
<p>"Could it be custom-made exhibition sculptures? But weren't they already shipped over?" Qin Yi said.</p>
<p>Clearly, everyone was quite curious about these large boxes.</p>
<p>Moreover, Chen Xu and Lin Rou had carried them over themselves, so they probably weren't too heavy.</p>
<p>"These are the cosplayer outfits we prepared for our showgirls," Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Cosplayer outfits!?</p>
<p>In an instant, Qin Yi and the other male employees' eyes lit up.</p>
<p>At that moment, they thought of the character art for female characters like Sun Shangxiang, Da Qiao and Xiao Qiao from <em>Sanguosha</em>.</p>
<p>However, as Chen Xu cut open the seals of the boxes with scissors, everyone's expressions became very odd.</p>
<p>Because what was inside the boxes was not the type of cosplayer outfits they had imagined.</p>
<p>Instead, there were colorful mascot costumes.</p>
<p>"Hmm... the Fall Guys characters' costumes from <em>Fall Guys</em>."</p>
<p>They looked furry and quite substantial.</p>
<p>So, this was what was meant by playing with something different?</p>
<p>"For this exhibition, <em>Fall Guys</em> can be said to be our trump card. As for <em>Sanguosha</em>, in terms of popularity and spread, it's actually not as high as <em>Fall Guys</em>."</p>
<p>"Furthermore, all other game developers are uniformly featuring female cosplayers. Players will inevitably experience some aesthetic fatigue. In this situation, we will definitely stand out from the crowd," Chen Xu said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>He had thought of this two months ago when he decided to make <em>Fall Guys</em>.</p>
<p>Female cosplayers are indeed very alluring.</p>
<p>But it's clearly still very difficult to rely entirely on such things to attract players.</p>
<p>And with seven exhibition areas, there were countless large and small game companies.</p>
<p>Basically, every company uniformly featured female cosplayers, making it easy for players to experience aesthetic fatigue.</p>
<p>But <em>Fall Guys</em> was different.</p>
<p>It leaned into a silly and joyful style, which perfectly matched the game's characteristics.</p>
<p>When it came to attracting attention, Chen Xu was confident they wouldn't fall behind anyone.</p>
<p>Of course, one point was also crucial.</p>
<p>That is, Nebula Games currently genuinely doesn't have many characters suitable for female cosplayers to portray.</p>
<p>Their strongest weapon, <em>Mirror (Game)</em>, due to the powerful force of censorship, couldn't be featured on the exhibition stage, so they had to change tactics.</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu's words, and then looking at the various Fall Guys mascot costumes, everyone had to admit one thing.</p>
<p>At a game exhibition, they actually seemed quite eye-catching.</p>
<p>Especially with <em>Overcooked</em>, most of the characters were also essentially mascot costumes.</p>
<p>Just imagine, other game developers would all have long, bare legs, while their area would be like a children's playground. It would be impossible not to attract attention!</p>
<p>Of course, these were all external tactics; the real focus was still the games.</p>
<p>After all, <em>Fall Guys</em> might attract players' attention for a moment, but it couldn't attract their attention forever.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, men are only divided into lecherous men and old lecherous men.</p>
<p>Mascot characters and long, bare legs—due to a momentary curiosity, attention might shift to the mascot characters, but it would ultimately return to the long, bare legs.</p>
<p>But games are different.</p>
<p>Long, bare legs?</p>
<p>What are those? Don't disturb me while I'm gaming!</p>
<p>So, for this exhibition, during the previous development stage,</p>
<p>Chen Xu developed both <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em> as dual-platform games.</p>
<p>That is, for PC and mobile platforms.</p>
<p>Ensuring players could experience the charm of the games.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>Days passed, and the games entered their final testing phase.</p>
<p>Chen Xu also communicated with the exhibition organizers for Nebula Games, starting preparations in advance.</p>
<p>Similarly, as the days progressed,</p>
<p>The players in the gaming community also began discussing this year's gameplay Expo.</p>
<p>"There hasn't been much news about new games lately, has there!"</p>
<p>"The gameplay Expo is coming soon. According to past years' trends, all the game developers are probably holding back, preparing to drop bombshell news at the exhibition."</p>
<p>"Is anyone planning to go to this year's exhibition?"</p>
<p>"I feel like it might not be very interesting, probably just another two-person stage play by NetDragon or TengHua."</p>
<p>"Indeed, for blockbusters, those two companies are probably the only ones worth watching. Even if other game developers have some, they'd likely find it hard to release them at the exhibition, as they wouldn't be able to get enough attention."</p>
<p>"Don't always focus on blockbusters! While blockbusters are great fun, there are only a few of them throughout the year. I think everyone should pay attention to independent games."</p>
<p>"Speaking of independent games, Chen Xu comes to mind. He was probably the biggest 'surprise' in the gaming community last year, right?"</p>
<p>"Bro upstairs, I think 'shock' and 'pleasant surprise' can be separated there."</p>
<p>"Exactly, I still remember his phrase 'Warrior of Love' to this day. I've never seen such a shameless person!"</p>
<p>"I saw on Chen Xu's official Weibo account that he'd announced he'd be participating. I wonder if Chen Xu will bring any special games to this exhibition!"</p>
<p>"Unlikely, right? It's only been two months since <em>Overcooked</em>. What could he have made?"</p>
<p>"Maybe you're new? Chen Xu develops games really fast! Look at the short intervals between <em>To the Moon</em>, <em>Outlast</em>, and then <em>Overcooked</em>. And I heard Chen Xu's company has also expanded."</p>
<p>"That's right, and it doesn't have to be a full launch to be called a new work. He might release some playable demos, aren't other game developers the same?"</p>
<p>"You're right. I hope there'll be some surprises then."</p>
<p>"No more surprises, please. <em>Overcooked</em> and <em>Outlast</em> have given me more than enough 'surprises'."</p>
<p>While the players were discussing,</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>Modu, the gameplay Expo exhibition center.</p>
<p>Chen Xu had already arrived with Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and Qin Yi, and they began setting up the site.</p>
<p>Located in Exhibition Hall 6.</p>
<p>In terms of location, it could be said to be a relatively good spot.</p>
<p>It was in the central area.</p>
<p>For their own exhibition area this time, Chen Xu planned to divide it into three main sections.</p>
<p>One was reserved for their older, already launched games, such as <em>To the Moon</em>, <em>Undertale</em>, and <em>Overcooked</em>.</p>
<p>The other two sections would be for <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em>, respectively.</p>
<p>As for Nebula Games' showcase segments, rehearsals were also underway.</p>
<p>Among these individuals, there were men and women.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, everyone looked utterly bewildered by the variously shaped mascots in the backstage boxes.</p>
<p>Especially the female cosplayers, who looked even more bewildered.</p>
<p>Before receiving this commission from Nebula Games, they might have been thinking that this game company would attract attention by flaunting sex appeal, otherwise, why would the price be so much higher than other game developers?</p>
<p>But now?</p>
<p>Well, wow, they had overthought it.</p>
<p>These mascot costumes were indistinguishable between male and female, let alone showing off bare legs.</p>
<p>With the specially customized mascot heads, not even their eyes could be seen.</p>
<p>"At the time, everyone's movements can be more comical and exaggerated, but make sure to pay attention to your safety."</p>
<p>"The booth will use a rotation system, so organize yourselves well. Ice water and other things will also be prepared backstage. If you feel any discomfort, be sure to speak up in advance," Chen Xu said to the relevant staff in their exhibition area, detailing the points of attention.</p>
<p>After all, safety aspects must be taken seriously; if anything were to happen, it would be a major problem.</p>
<p>After simply finishing, Chen Xu found a stool and sat down to rest.</p>
<p>The cosplayers and Nebula Games' marketing manager were discussing and finalizing what methods to use to attract players.</p>
