                <p>Chapter 500: Mr. Chen Didn't Lie! There Really Are Shields! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Respawning in the Hunter's Dream, Song Ren looked at his empty Blood Echoes and dwindling Blood Vials, on the verge of tears.</p>
<p>This Big Bro Father was completely different fighting him compared to when he helped him defeat a BOSS earlier! When fighting a monster, one axe swing dealt a dozen points of damage, but against himself, with over 600 health points, one axe swing dealt twenty times that damage.</p>
<p>Is there no justice? Is there no law?!</p>
<p>At this point, Song Ren had basically figured out a few things: the Father before him was likely the Gun Parry teacher in <em>Bloodborne</em>. His aggressive intent was like a mad dog, constantly attacking the player, which gave the player many opportunities for Gun Parries. But it sounded simple; doing it was not.</p>
<p>Failing a Gun Parry had a much lower penalty compared to a Perfect Guard in <em>Dark Souls</em>. As long as he pulled back, there was no risk of being hit after a failed Gun Parry. But the key issue was that if he pulled back too far, by the time he successfully executed a Gun Parry and ran to the BOSS, the window for a Visceral Attack would be gone. Furthermore, unlike fighting minor mobs, when fighting a BOSS—at least Father Gascoigne—if a Gun Parry wasn't successful, it would only deal damage to the BOSS but wouldn't interrupt its actions. This meant the BOSS could still rush you and land an axe hit while you were shooting, showing you why flowers are so red.</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>There were quite a few players experiencing a similar sense of despair as Song Ren.</p>
<p>Chen Xu had followed the overall framework of the previous life's <em>Bloodborne</em> for <em>Bloodborne</em>. Of course, he made better optimizations in aspects like visual presentation and detail. While retaining <em>Bloodborne</em>'s art style, the model precision, animations, and physics collision effects all saw a qualitative leap.</p>
<p>And in the VR version of <em>Bloodborne</em>, it would definitely bring players the most intense and thrilling experience.</p>
<p>In addition, <em>Bloodborne</em>'s map design was very ingenious. In a broad sense, <em>Bloodborne</em> was somewhat similar to <em>Dark Souls 3</em>, allowing teleportation to various points. However, in a smaller sense, <em>Bloodborne</em> was somewhat similar to <em>Dark Souls 1</em>, with levels full of puzzle-solving elements. Moreover, before defeating Father Gascoigne, apart from the lamp at Iosefka's Clinic, there was only one lamp in all of Central Yharnam.</p>
<p>It seemed incredibly unfair, but in terms of actual gameplay, once players discovered shortcuts, whether heading to Father Gascoigne's Oedon Tomb or the Cleric Beast's bridge, it would take less than a minute. There were three different paths for players to choose from: climbing ladders in the sewers, taking an elevator, or going through the boar passage.</p>
<p>Compared to <em>Dark Souls 1</em>, where dying once in BOSS battles like the Bed of Chaos meant a long, frustrating run back, making players complain it was like a "365-li journey," <em>Bloodborne</em> was clearly more merciful in its speedrunning aspects. For veteran players, once the shortcuts were opened and the map routes understood, they could essentially turn <em>Bloodborne</em> into a speedrunning game. As for new players? Well, let's move on to the next topic.</p>
<p>Regarding the difficulty, <em>Bloodborne</em> and <em>Dark Souls</em> had completely different styles. <em>Bloodborne</em> was faster-paced and encouraged players to be aggressive; for example, the Gun Parry mechanic served this purpose. As for those who couldn't Gun Parry, could they still defeat the BOSS? Yes, they certainly could, and Chen Xu had even retained some classic mechanics from the previous game. On one hand, it fit the background lore, and on the other, it allowed players to suffer more effectively later on. Avoiding difficulties early, catching up later – isn't that only natural?</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>Inside Oedon Tomb, facing Father Gascoigne, Song Ren seemed to enter a new world, his face full of excitement and surprise. He discovered that, whether the Father had gone insane and lost his mind, or if it was designed this way by the game, the Father got stuck amidst a pile of gravestones while chasing him like a stray dog.</p>
<p>The only way to damage him was by shooting, but shooting couldn't instantly kill him! Moreover, his axe in the game could switch to a long-handle mode, and his Whirlwind Attack could directly pass through the gravestones to hit the Father.</p>
<p>"Did Mr. Chen miscalculate, or was this intentional?"</p>
<p>"But thinking about it, it's quite logical! Since the Father has lost his mind, his intelligence must have plummeted. Otherwise, why would Big Bro Father, who was fighting alongside me earlier, now be fighting me?" Song Ren excitedly chipped away at the Father's health with his Whirlwind Attack.</p>
<p>"Can't hit me, can't hit me, how annoying! Nyah nyah nyah, you just can't hit me!" Looking at the Father before him, Song Ren let out a laugh like a big villain.</p>
<p>Soon, the Father entered his third phase, transforming into a werewolf and smashing the gravestones into smithereens.</p>
<p>But Song Ren wasn't flustered in the slightest; he hadn't used the music box once yet. Music emanated from the box, and the completely beast-transformed Father began to struggle, falling into a state of confusion. Without a word, Song Ren threw an Oil Urn at the Father, followed by two Molotov cocktails. Instantly, the Father's health plummeted. When the Father recovered, Song Ren's charged Whirlwind Attack landed directly on him.</p>
<p>[Prey Slaughtered]</p>
<p>Blood-red text appeared in the center of the screen.</p>
<p>In the game, after killing the Father, Song Ren burst into laughter. Although his methods were a bit underhanded, he had succeeded after all. He walked to the Father's corpse and picked up the glowing item.</p>
<p>[Acquired Oedon Tomb Key]</p>
<p>"So, there's no way to save the Father?" Song Ren couldn't help but sigh. He initially thought defeating the Father would trigger some plot that could save him. But now, it seemed the Father had to be killed. If not killed, the subsequent story couldn't progress. And if he guessed correctly, the Little Girl's mother was likely also in grave danger.</p>
<p>After exploring Oedon Tomb, an item picked up from a tattered female corpse confirmed Song Ren's suspicions. It was the Ruby Brooch the Little Girl had mentioned, engraved with the Father's wife's name: Viola.</p>
<p>Clearly, the corpse lying on the rooftop was the Little Girl's mother. The gruesome wounds and spreading bloodstains on the body led to many dark conjectures. Especially with the music box the Little Girl had given Song Ren earlier, it prompted even more associations.</p>
<p>Did the Little Girl's mother, while searching for the Father, accidentally fall victim to an attack by beast-transformed Yharnamites, leading to her death? And seeing all this, the Father lost control and went insane, transforming into a beast himself?</p>
<p>Or was it that the Father's sanity had been steadily eroding, leading him to personally kill Viola?</p>
<p>The truth of the matter was unknown, as both answers seemed plausible. However, Song Ren preferred to believe that the Father had not killed his wife, but rather went mad because of her death.</p>
<p>"Poor Little Girl," Song Ren sighed inwardly, looking at the Ruby Brooch in his inventory and recalling the Little Girl's pathetic appearance earlier. He decided not to tell her this sad news for now. Song Ren decided to explore the path ahead first.</p>
<p>Song Ren gradually continued to push the storyline forward. Entering Oedon Chapel, he found an old woman wrapped in red cloth. She told the player that the chapel was a safe place. Incense kept the beasts away, and if he encountered normal humans, he could send them there. For them, the chapel was a safer place than their homes.</p>
<p>At this moment, Song Ren also remembered the Little Girl from before, and Gilbert, who had given him some information, as well as the sharp-tongued old woman. Clearly, these few were still normal people in the game. However, Song Ren didn't immediately return; he planned to explore a bit more.</p>
<p>After dispatching two large figures holding staff-like weapons at the staircase leading to a closed gate, Song Ren discovered something that made him ecstatic. What did he see? A shield! A shield! Mr. Chen really hadn't lied; this game had shields!</p>
<p>Looking at the newly acquired shield, Song Ren could only describe his feelings as utter surprise! If he had a shield, would he have feared that Father Gascoigne earlier? But why did this shield look like a broken wooden plank?</p>
<p>[Wooden Shield: A primitive wooden shield used by villagers to fend off monsters on the eve of the hunt. The shield itself is not problematic, but skilled hunters do not use it, as it would only reduce their hunting efficiency.]</p>
