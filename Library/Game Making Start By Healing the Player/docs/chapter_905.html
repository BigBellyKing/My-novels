                <p>Chapter 904: Online Experience</p>
<p>As an open-world game, Crime City is a comprehensive collection of various gameplay styles.</p>
<p>Crime City doesn't boast unique innovations in any single gameplay aspect. Whether it's racing, gun combat, simulation management, or stealth, other games offer these mechanics.</p>
<p>The truly critical element is that Crime City integrates these gameplay styles into a vivid world.</p>
<p>All gameplay revolves around the vibrant cities within the game, such as Lost City and Crime City.</p>
<p>This is the most captivating aspect of the game.</p>
<p>The game's Multiplayer Mode is no different, using other players to enhance the game's competitive and social elements, providing a more immersive progression experience.</p>
<p>In Lost City of Crime City, Song Ren and Zhang Yi were experiencing Crime City's online Multiplayer Mode.</p>
<p>Although there was DLC story content, the single-player story could be played anytime, but they were more eager to experience the Multiplayer Mode first.</p>
<p>After all, many games are like this: the truly addictive phase is right when the game launches, with everyone rushing through progress together.</p>
<p>But if you wait a while and fall behind in progress, that "flavor" is essentially lost.</p>
<p>Just like World of Warcraft, when it first came out, besides daily life and work, a group of people would grind levels and run dungeons every day.</p>
<p>At least to keep up with the mainstream players' progress, but after falling behind a little, even with new version updates, a few people would just play casually.</p>
<p>To this day, they haven't even completed Arthas's raid dungeon, let alone obtaining Invincible; they can't even clear the normal dungeons.</p>
<p>It's not about committing to playing forever, but if you're interested, you have to play it immediately when it launches.</p>
<p>"Holy cow, there are so many gameplay styles?!" Zhang Yi felt a bit overwhelmed.</p>
<p>As for Multiplayer Mode, it mainly employed mirrored battles.</p>
<p>After all, server capacity was limited, and locations were divided into three playable areas for players: Liberty City, Crime City, and Lost City.</p>
<p>In the early stage, once players selected a city, they couldn't travel to another. They needed to purchase a basic plane or cruise ship in-game to travel to other cities.</p>
<p>At the same time, the number of players in a session also increased, with a maximum limit of 84 players per city.</p>
<p>"It really is a lot!" Song Ren nodded in agreement with Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>In the original single-player mode, he felt there was already more than enough to do.</p>
<p>But with this online Multiplayer Mode, the sheer variety of gameplay also dazzled him.</p>
<p>The map was densely packed with all sorts of jobs.</p>
<p>Racing, Gang Deathmatch, Stunt Show…</p>
<p>The diverse job types left Song Ren and the others unsure which one to play.</p>
<p>"Look at your phone, someone sent a message, seems like it's our Tool-man." Wang Han said, looking at her smartphone.</p>
<p>"Our Tool-man? I think you've got that backward, we're the Tool-men." Zhang Yi couldn't help but complain.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, the protagonist equals the Tool-man.</p>
<p>Especially in some RPGs, while the protagonist is saving the world, they also have to deliver letters for Widow Li at the village head and feed pigs for Old Man Zhang at the village end.</p>
<p>However, complaints aside, Zhang Yi began to read what appeared to be the new player tutorial content.</p>
<p>"Hmm, it seems you haven't adapted to this society yet. To survive here, money is essential."</p>
<p>"But judging by your appearance, you probably don't even have a place to live, do you? Luckily, I can lend you some money so you can find temporary lodging, and I'll also help you find some work."</p>
<p>"Of course, I'll take a cut for myself. If you've made up your mind, come find me at the Textile Factory—Lester."</p>
<p>This part differed from the original; Chen Xu specifically designed a new player online tutorial mode.</p>
<p>The original Multiplayer Mode's online guidance wasn't particularly good.</p>
<p>Players basically had to figure things out themselves, and as the game's content grew later on, most new players were bewildered, completely unsure where to start.</p>
<p>At the same time, because the game was designed to sell Shark Cards, there weren't many efficient ways to earn money early on.</p>
<p>The most efficient methods were selling and smashing cars, and robbing convenience stores.</p>
<p>As for jobs like racing, they were time-consuming and low-yield.</p>
<p>Chen Xu made many changes here.</p>
<p>In the early game, there was a simple new player tutorial quest.</p>
<p>Guided by Lester.</p>
<p>After reading the message on his phone, Zhang Yi also noticed many other players' IDs on the map, all heading towards the Textile Factory.</p>
<p>"How do we get there? It's a bit far!" Song Ren asked.</p>
<p>"How to get there? Old Song, you've played Crime City, what are you pretending for?" Zhang Yi rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>With nothing to his name, Zhang Yi looked at the cars on the road and did what 99.99% of players would do.</p>
<p>He directly blocked a convertible and roughly pulled the big bald guy out of the car.</p>
<p>"Wife, get in! Old Song, you deal with your own ride!" Zhang Yi honked the horn.</p>
<p>Wang Han immediately got into the passenger seat.</p>
<p>"Are you even human?! There are so many four-seater cars around, why did you have to steal a two-seater convertible?" Song Ren cursed, then snatched a garbage truck.</p>
<p>It wasn't that he didn't want to steal other cars; it was just that when Zhang Yi stole his car, all the surrounding NPCs had fled.</p>
<p>Only a garbage truck, too large and slow to escape, was left for him to catch.</p>
<p>By the time Song Ren's slow-moving garbage truck arrived at the destination, Zhang Yi and Wang Han were standing at the main entrance, sighing: "Old Song, you're way too slow."</p>
<p>"Pfft! I don't want to talk to you guys!" Song Ren snorted.</p>
<p>At the main entrance of the Textile Factory, besides them, there was a group of players with their IDs displayed.</p>
<p>Some were sitting in their stolen cars honking, while others were chatting on open mics.</p>
<p>Even without playing any jobs yet, just seeing so many players like themselves directly in Lost City.</p>
<p>This gave a lively feeling.</p>
<p>This feeling was something completely unattainable when playing solo.</p>
<p>After all, while the game's AI was excellent and there were many NPCs on the streets making it seem lively.</p>
<p>Deep down, players knew these NPCs were just computers, completely different from real players.</p>
<p>Now, with all these real-player-controlled characters, the feeling was naturally different.</p>
<p>"Holy cow! Who drove a big truck over? Make some room!"</p>
<p>"Damn it, I'm cracking up! Can't find parking in real life at the mall, and can't find parking in this game either?"</p>
<p>"This is too realistic!"</p>
<p>"Good thing the cars in the game aren't mine!"</p>
<p>"Which big genius drove this damn garbage truck?!"</p>
<p>More players arrived at this moment, many complaining.</p>
<p>Because the entrance to the Textile Factory was completely blocked by a garbage truck, all the cars behind it couldn't get through.</p>
<p>"Ahem... let's not chat at the entrance, let's hurry inside and see what jobs there are." Clearing his throat a bit awkwardly, Song Ren led the way into the Textile Factory.</p>
