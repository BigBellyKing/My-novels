                <p>Chapter 576: Veteran Simp (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>After a quick trip to the restroom and a change of pants, Song Ren once again lay down in the Huanyu VR gaming pod.</p>
<p>If it had been at the beginning, he would definitely have been discouraged.</p>
<p>But having played for so long already, giving up now would be too much of a waste.</p>
<p>However, he had already mentally prepared himself, expecting the content to become even grimmer, but to his surprise, it didn't.</p>
<p>Immediately upon coming up from the basement, he encountered four or five dolls whose limbs had transformed into sharp blades, attacking him. The sudden assault, coupled with the grim lighting, certainly gave him a big scare.</p>
<p>But compared to the almost complete darkness and the monstrous infant scene before, this was just a simple fright, without much true terror.</p>
<p>At this point, the doll from earlier wanted to play hide-and-seek with Ethan.</p>
<p>However, after the treatment he received in the basement and with his daughter on his mind, Ethan was clearly enraged.</p>
<p>Upon finding the doll, he directly pulled out scissors and plunged them into its head.</p>
<p>This gave Song Ren a sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Because before, he was being hunted, but now, even though it was hide-and-seek, he had become the attacker!</p>
<p>Each time Ethan found a doll and stabbed it with the scissors, he received a curse of resentment from it.</p>
<p>'I wish Rose had never been born!'</p>
<p>'Would you do this to Rose, too?'</p>
<p>Every time the scissors pierced a doll, Song Ren noticed that the room became brighter, and he could even see sunlight streaming in through the curtains.</p>
<p>Finally, in the hallway, Ethan found the doll for the third time.</p>
<p>'You'll never get out!'</p>
<p>Thwack!</p>
<p>The doll, still spouting threats, was stabbed again, and threads of a string-like substance gushed from the wound. Suddenly, the doll became incredibly fearful.</p>
<p>'Idiot! What are you doing to my cute doll?'</p>
<p>“What am I doing? I'll stab you to death!” Song Ren controlled Ethan, plunging the scissors fiercely into the doll's head.</p>
<p>Then, the scene before him began to become psychedelic, and bright light gradually replaced his vision.</p>
<p>After a flash of white light, everything returned to normal.</p>
<p>A woman with half her face rotten and dressed in black robes lay there. As Ethan killed Angie, the Wedding Dress Doll, in the illusion, he also killed her in reality.</p>
<p>The next moment, the woman began to calcify, turning into fragments, leaving only the wedding dress doll beside her.</p>
<p>Clearly, everything that had just happened was Ethan's hallucination.</p>
<p>Puppeteer Donna, due to severe mental illness, had been infected by Miranda and possessed strong hallucinatory abilities. She herself had no great physical strength, acting only by controlling dolls. The previous Mia and the strange infant were all her illusions.</p>
<p>And just now, Ethan had actually killed Donna in reality.</p>
<p>The mad Puppeteer was dead.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous battle with Lady Dimitrescu, the Puppeteer required no actual combat, yet it was absolutely the most memorable level for Song Ren.</p>
<p>From Donna's shattered body, Ethan took a key and secured the second fragment of his daughter.</p>
<p>At first, Song Ren was a little worried that the subsequent experience would be as grim as the doll level.</p>
<p>But to his relief, after following clues outside, the familiar rhythm returned.</p>
<p>He could use his gun again.</p>
<p>In that moment, the infected mutated creatures, like werewolf-like monsters, even gave Song Ren a sense of familiarity.</p>
<p>Following the clues, Song Ren soon arrived at an underground mine and found the third of the Four Heavenly Kings: Moreau, the hunchbacked dwarf monster.</p>
<p>To be honest, this guy even made Song Ren feel a little pitiful.</p>
<p>The last of the Four Heavenly Kings, Heisenberg, was still unknown.</p>
<p>But truly, the Four Heavenly Kings were each worse off than the last.</p>
<p>Lady Dimitrescu, goes without saying, lived in a huge ancient castle, practically a local tyrant.</p>
<p>And the mad Puppeteer Donna lived by a waterfall, but still in a luxurious villa.</p>
<p>But this third BOSS, Moreau's, domestic situation had deteriorated even further.</p>
<p>When Song Ren found him, he was living in a dark, cramped mine, messy and filthy.</p>
<p>And his house was a shack like something out of a slum, leaky everywhere.</p>
<p>What amused Song Ren was that this guy didn't seem to notice Ethan's arrival. Instead, he was enthusiastically watching a TV show—he didn't know what cheesy idol drama it was, because as he watched, the guy actually made himself vomit.</p>
<p>As for the third bottle containing Rose's body, it was placed right next to the window.</p>
<p>Unlike the trap-filled feeling of Puppeteer Donna's stage, Song Ren simply felt that Moreau had nowhere else to put it, so he just left it there.</p>
<p>Ethan effortlessly stole the bottle.</p>
<p>Of course, Chen Xu made a slight change here. After all, in the original version, Ethan was a bit too arrogant; he'd steal something and then rub it in, saying, 'This is your daughter.'</p>
<p>So, Chen Xu made a modification here: as Ethan was about to secretly take the bottle, Moreau, who occasionally checked if the bottle was still there, discovered him.</p>
<p>Watching Moreau stand up, Song Ren in the game instantly tensed, ready to pull out his shotgun for an exciting battle.</p>
<p>But Moreau's subsequent behavior utterly astonished him.</p>
<p>Because where was the demeanor of a Four Heavenly King in this guy?</p>
<p>Facing Ethan, who had taken the bottle, his behavior was utterly pathetic, like a Simp. Of course, Moreau's target for simping was Miranda, so in a strict sense, Moreau was more like a Mama's Boy.</p>
<p>'Please give me back the bottle… otherwise, they’ll look down on me.'</p>
<p>'Please… Mom will be unhappy if you take it, she won't love me.'</p>
<p>Initially, Ethan was ready to turn and run, but Moreau's words made him pause momentarily, as he heard some crucial news.</p>
<p>Namely, what use Rose was to Miranda.</p>
<p>Miranda seemed to be preparing some resurrection ritual, intending to use Rose's unique powers to revive her child.</p>
<p>It sounded utterly ridiculous, once again making Song Ren exclaim that this was neither Resident Evil nor scientific!</p>
<p>'Please… please… give me back the bottle.' Moreau continued to plead.</p>
<p>However, Ethan, having already secured his daughter's bottle and obtained important information, wasn't prepared to waste any more words with Moreau.</p>
<p>He intended to turn and escape immediately.</p>
<p>But just then, something happened that left Ethan taken aback.</p>
<p>Innumerable disgusting, viscous, dark-green colloidal substances completely blocked Ethan's escape route. Moreau, who had previously been pleading so pathetically, let out an unpleasant laugh.</p>
<p>“Hehehehehehe… you can't leave… this is my territory, and I won't let you go!”</p>
