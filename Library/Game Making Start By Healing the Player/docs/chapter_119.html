                <p>Chapter 119: Just a Small Mishap on the Path to Linking the Fire</p>
<p>Zhang Yi sat in front of the computer, controlling the knight 'aaa' in the game.</p>
<p>After nearly half an hour of experience, the computer's ownership had now firmly settled with Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>After all, dying every two or three minutes and then switching players meant the seat barely got warm.</p>
<p>Of course, there was a more important factor: Wang Han had discovered something.</p>
<p>Watching others suffer and suffering yourself were two completely different feelings.</p>
<p>Sitting cross-legged in a large chair, a small basin filled with a plastic bag and washed grapes rested on her lap.</p>
<p>"Oh, just a little bit more! What a pity!" Wang Han watched the gray screen on Zhang Yi's monitor, lamenting the missed opportunity. Yet, the smile on her face showed no trace of regret.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, who had respawned at the bonfire, said nothing. He rolled a couple of times on the spot, then continued his path to challenge Gundyr the Ash.</p>
<p>He had to admit, he suddenly felt this game had a peculiar addiction to it. When Gundyr first beat him mercilessly, he felt a bit dejected.</p>
<p>Especially after seeing Gundyr had a second form, his mindset almost collapsed.</p>
<p>But as he continued to challenge, and especially as he became more skilled, watching Gundyr the Ash's health steadily drop, it gave him a rather strange feeling. As for being killed by Gundyr the Ash, it no longer seemed as difficult to accept as it was at first.</p>
<p>It's just one death in a game, what's the big deal?</p>
<p>Stepping back into Firelink Shrine, compared to his initial haphazard rolling and mindless parrying, Zhang Yi's current playstyle was very steady. He used his shield to block Gundyr's attacks without taking damage, carefully managing his green stamina bar to ensure it wasn't depleted.</p>
<p>Then, seizing the opening after Gundyr's attacks, he would land a couple of hits.</p>
<p>After roughly ten deaths, he had essentially mastered Gundyr the Ash's moves and timings, both in its first and transformed second phase.</p>
<p>Watching Gundyr the Ash transform into its second phase, Zhang Yi advanced, landed a couple of hits, then retreated steadily, carefully probing and rolling into attacks.</p>
<p>The BOSS's health gradually dwindled, and with the final blow, Gundyr the Ash's health bar was depleted.</p>
<p>"Roar…"</p>
<p>Amidst a mournful shriek from the Pus of Man, the massive BOSS twisted its body, collapsing into dust.</p>
<p>At the same time, a cluster of flames rose on the screen, as if ignited. The knight in the game, through his armor, could vaguely see sparks emanating from the skin beneath. His lost health not only recovered but also increased, signifying he had entered the Embered State after defeating the BOSS.</p>
<p>"Nice! I cleared it!"</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, in front of the computer, clenched his fists excitedly. He had to admit, the moment he defeated Gundyr the Ash, Zhang Yi felt incredibly awesome.</p>
<p>"You cleared it already!" Wang Han beside him was also surprised, though her tone seemed to carry a hint of regret.</p>
<p>"This Gundyr the Ash isn't that tough after all! Before, I just wasn't familiar with the game. Now, if you let me fight him again, I'll definitely win!" After lighting the bonfire that appeared in the middle upon defeating Gundyr the Ash, Zhang Yi felt as if he had transformed into a crab – strutting sideways!</p>
<p>Gundyr the Ash, this powerful BOSS, had fallen by his hand. Who else could stop his path to Linking the Fire?</p>
<p>The only slight regret was that he still wasn't very familiar with the parrying skill. He only succeeded two or three times while fighting Gundyr the Ash.</p>
<p>Although the reward was high, successfully entering an execution state would deplete a large chunk of health. But failure meant being knocked away directly.</p>
<p>So, he opted for the safer method of blocking with his shield.</p>
<p>"Don't show off, hurry up and see what's next!" Wang Han said, deliberately picking two large grapes and popping them into Zhang Yi's mouth as a reward.</p>
<p>"What's the rush? What's the panic? I have something more important to do right now." After resting at the bonfire and replenishing his Estus Flasks, Zhang Yi didn't push open the closed door behind him. Instead, he returned the way he came.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" Wang Han was a bit puzzled.</p>
<p>"Revenge! To personally slay that big lizard that took my first life!" Zhang Yi, retracing his steps, was bursting with confidence at this moment. He was no longer the ignorant person he once was!</p>
<p>He had defeated Gundyr the Ash, why would he be afraid of an elite mob? Could a mob possibly be more troublesome than a BOSS?</p>
<p>With that thought, Zhang Yi returned to the Cemetery of Ash. Following the narrow path, Zhang Yi quickly reached his destination. He engaged the monster, rolled, and raised his shield. Then, he became a bloodstain of messages left on the ground for later players.</p>
<p>Respawning in front of the bonfire, Zhang Yi looked at the several thousand souls he had accumulated after defeating Gundyr the Ash now reduced to zero, and his Embered State reverted to normal. He fell silent.</p>
<p>"What's going on?"</p>
<p>Looking at his respawned character, Zhang Yi felt a tiny bit bewildered. He had confidently gone to confront the Crystal Lizard that took his first blood earlier. However, he found that the experience he gained from fighting Gundyr the Ash was completely useless against the Crystal Lizard.</p>
<p>Its attacks were swifter, and a single combo emptied his stamina bar, leaving him no room to retaliate. Moreover, its attack power was not at all lower than Gundyr the Ash's. After three Estus Flasks, he hadn't even depleted half of its health before he died. Why did it feel even harder to fight than Gundyr the Ash? Was it an illusion?</p>
<p>Zhang Yi respawned, ready to challenge it again. First, he went to retrieve his dropped souls, then re-engaged. After creating some distance, a lizard's rolling attack instantly cleared his stamina bar, staggering him, then a three-hit combo left him utterly powerless.</p>
<p>"I don't think that's a monster you can challenge right now," Wang Han said from beside him.</p>
<p>"Yeah, it seems so. Can't provoke it, better run first." Zhang Yi, respawning again, re-entered the Crystal Lizard's territory, picked up his dropped souls, and fled. Fortunately, unlike BOSS fights, as long as he left the Crystal Lizard's aggro range, it wouldn't relentlessly pursue him.</p>
<p>"Let's go check out the later content. After all, our mission is to Link the Fire!"</p>
<p>Zhang Yi adjusted his mindset. The Crystal Lizard was just a mishap; the main storyline was the key. Now, it was time to officially embark on the journey of Linking the Fire. How exactly does one Link the Fire? And what kind of beings were the Lords of Cinder mentioned in the promotional trailer? Was Gundyr the Ash a Lord of Cinder? He even entered the Embered State after defeating it!</p>
<p>Returning to the courtyard, Zhang Yi pushed open the large door behind it. He walked upwards, encountering only ordinary Hollow monsters along the way. Zhang Yi easily dispatched them, which restored his previous confidence. This was the true gaming experience. Having defeated Gundyr the Ash, he had earned the qualification to Link the Fire. He could now embark on the path of Linking the Fire; the Crystal Lizard was just a small, unexpected detour!</p>
<p>As he walked upwards, he soon saw a very conspicuous circular building. It was as magnificent and grand as a cathedral. Entering through the open doors, he found a circular area resembling a shrine, much like an opera house. And on the circular high platform, there were five thrones. However, four of them were empty; only one had a frail old man seated upon it. In the very center of the shrine was a silver-haired, waist-length girl in a black robe, wearing a mysterious metal blindfold. It was the same girl who appeared in the promotional trailer.</p>
