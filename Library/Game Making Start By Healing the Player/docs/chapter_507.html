                <p>Chapter 506: Relaxing, Wholesome, and Very Satisfying? Has Mr. Chen Changed!? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)\n\nInside Nebula Games, Chen Xu, leaning back in a massage chair in the lounge, couldn't help but smile happily as he watched the various online debates among players.\n\nHe smiled even more broadly, especially when he saw posts from new players who had been drawn in later, expressing that they were on the verge of breaking down, and videos on major video websites showcasing what could only be called '100 ways a hunter can die'.\n\n“Mr. Chen, the players online are almost fighting, yet you're still smiling so happily?” Ruan Ningxue said, speechless.\n\n“Isn’t this perfectly normal? Seeing players so joyful because of my game, of course, I, as the designer, am very happy,” Chen Xu said with a slight cough.\n\nWithout speaking, Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin, who had just arrived, along with others nearby, all looked at Chen Xu with expressions that said, 'Who would believe that?'\n\n“Aside from the game’s storyline and high difficulty, these players are really amazing! They’ve already started challenging speedruns! Excluding the Orphan of Kos and similar bosses, the fastest managed to clear the game in just an hour and a half!” Qin Yi exclaimed with some emotion.\n\nAs Qin Yi was responsible for the game's numerical design and level design, he had naturally played Bloodborne during this period.\n\nYes… the PC version, of course, so he clearly knew what that data represented.\n\n“Theoretically, the time could be compressed to under 40 minutes. Don’t underestimate players,” Chen Xu said with a smile.\n\n“Mr. Chen! Please stop! This is just a small fraction of players. Please consider us clumsy players! Don’t try to ‘cure’ us with your great love anymore!” Ruan Ningxue said, raising her hand.\n\n“Exactly! I’m still stuck with the Yharnam Three Stooges!” Yang Xin complained. For clumsy players like them, it was truly too difficult.\n\n“If you really can’t get past it, you can search online for some modded dungeons created by players. Grind more souls to level up; that might make it easier. Of course, if you do that, your current save file won’t be able to connect with normal players for online multiplayer,” Chen Xu said with a smile.\n\nRegarding Bloodborne, Chen Xu still employed the same model as with Dark Souls.\n\nThat was to differentiate between normal players and special players.\n\nBy playing the Chalice Dungeons, both those included with the Chalice and the randomly generated ones, players could engage in normal PVP and PVE.\n\nOf course, players could also use special tools to modify the monsters and drops within the dungeons, which is what's known as modded dungeons.\n\nFor instance, after players defeated the Blood-starved Beast and acquired the first Pthumeru Chalice, they could directly search for modded dungeons, grind several million souls, and essentially start a hack-and-slash Musou in their first playthrough.\n\nNaturally, if they did this, they would largely be excluded from playing with normal players, encountering only other players who had also entered modded dungeons.\n\nIn fact, many players, after being thoroughly thrashed in their first playthrough, would enter modded dungeons, but after completing the ending...\n\nIf they were truly captivated by the charm of Souls-like games, many players would actually create a new, normal character and play through the game again from scratch, relying on their own efforts.\n\n“However, the gameplay design of the Chalice Dungeons has indeed added a lot to the game’s stickiness!”\n\nMeng Zuo, sitting beside Chen Xu, commented.\n\nWhen Nebula Games developed the two Dark Souls titles, Meng Zuo was still at NetDragon, but he had learned about them through various channels.\n\nWhile the popularity of Dark Souls at the time was decent, many ordinary players, aside from the hardcore ones, actually lost much interest in a second playthrough after completing their first.\n\nBut Bloodborne was different. With various combinations of Runes and Gems, along with skill point allocation, players could create diverse playstyles.\n\nAnd combined with the Chalice Dungeons, the game essentially became a grinding game.\n\nThis led many players to jokingly call themselves 'Gem Hunters,' with their biggest wish being to acquire a high-tier Gem with good attributes.\n\nOf course, while grinding, these players also accumulated a lot of resentment.\n\nBecause at higher depths, the monsters in the dungeons were utterly inhuman!\n\nBell Maidens, hidden somewhere, constantly summoned all sorts of monsters: sneaky spiders, swift, hair-flailing enemies with long, flowing locks, and large, hammer-wielding brutes with bare backsides.\n\nIt's safe to say that many players experienced intense psychological shock.\n\n“But for unlucky streak players, it’s just too unfriendly!” Ruan Ningxue added.\n\n“Exactly! Some people grind for a hundred hours and never get what they want, while others easily obtain their desired Gems!” Yang Xin said with immense emotion.\n\n“You feel so strongly about this, are you by any chance…” Chen Xu chuckled, looking at Yang Xin.\n\n“Not me, no way! Mr. Chen, don’t talk nonsense, my luck is great!” Yang Xin immediately launched into a triple denial.\n\nAn unlucky streak? She didn’t believe she was one!\n\n“However, players have indeed suffered quite a bit recently!” Chen Xu sighed as he watched online players lamenting that they still hadn’t cleared the game since its launch.\n\nListening to Chen Xu’s lament, the others present couldn't help but feel speechless.\n\nWhose fault was it that they suffered so much?\n\nIt was none other than you, Mr. Chen!\n\nLook at the recently released games. After Assassin’s Creed, he just let himself go.\n\nResident Evil, Bloodborne—horror, masochism, and the pain of an unlucky streak for players—it was all there!\n\nHow could players not suffer?\n\n“Hmm… we can develop a game that will make players very happy, and it would also be a good opportunity to arrange something for the Switch, as a grand opening for our year,” Chen Xu said with a smile, a thought striking him.\n\n“Mr. Chen, is your idea of ‘happy’ the same as our idea of ‘happy’?” Yang Xin asked, uncertainly.\n\n“What’s wrong with you all? You need to have faith in me! Am I the kind of designer who tricks players?” Chen Xu sighed.\n\nHe certainly wouldn't trick players; everything he said was the truth. But the crucial part was that it was always different from what players expected!\n\n“Don’t worry, this time it’s definitely a benefit for the players. Although it’s an action game, it won’t demand too much from players’ controls. It’s a very satisfying game to play. The setting will be Greek mythology, where players take on the role of Zagreus, son of Hades, fighting his way out of the Underworld,” Chen Xu said with emotion.\n\n“What’s more, it’s a relatively casual game. A single run takes about half an hour, quite wholesome,” Chen Xu added with another smile.\n\nHearing Chen Xu’s words, everyone looked very surprised.\n\nRelaxing, wholesome, and very satisfying hack-and-slash!? Had Mr. Chen changed? Wasn't he being too kind to players!?\n\nThey were actually a little unaccustomed to it!\n\nEveryone simultaneously let out a sigh of emotion.\n\nSeeing their surprised faces, Chen Xu also smiled.\n\nOf course, there were still some things he kept to himself.\n\nThat is, for Lucky King players, this game would be incredibly satisfying and a hack-and-slash breeze, but for unlucky streak players… they’d better pray for themselves.\n\nAs for relaxing and wholesome? Well, wouldn’t that depend on how players chose to play it?\n(End of Chapter)\n&lt;<END_OF_CHAPTER>&gt;</p>
