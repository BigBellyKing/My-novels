<p>Chapter 850: Payday</p>
<p>Without a doubt, this was the promotional video for Nebula Games' latest work.</p>
<p>But the key was, the progress bar of this latest promotional video didn't hold up.</p>
<p>At the most crucial moment, it suddenly cut off!</p>
<p>'I'm gonna puke! This damn promotional trailer can actually cut off like that!'</p>
<p>'Exactly, exactly! Anyone wanna join me in storming Nebula Games Headquarters?'</p>
<p>'Bro upstairs, stop bragging! If even one person could've stormed Nebula Games Headquarters all these years, I wouldn't be seeing this promotional video that only played half-way.'</p>
<p>'But I'm more curious about one thing: judging from this promotional video, it doesn't seem to be a counter-terrorism game. Instead, it looks like a robbery game?'</p>
<p>As this promotional video was released, players began discussing animatedly.</p>
<p>Putting aside the situation where it cut off halfway, what surprised many players most was that this unknown game seemed a little different from what they had imagined.</p>
<p>This didn't appear to be the counter-terrorism game they initially thought it was. From the various shots and background introductions, it seemed to be a game with robbers as the main perspective. In other words, they would be playing as robbers in the game?</p>
<p>'So this is making us wear masks and be robbers?'</p>
<p>'Holy cow, these robbers look a little cool, I have to say. Suit-clad thugs?'</p>
<p>'This game looks pretty awesome!'</p>
<p>'No, the key is it's really professional!'</p>
<p>'Exactly, exactly! Compared to some other robbery games, this game feels super professional!'</p>
<p>'First time I learned there are dye-filled banknotes, and banknotes with tracking chips inside.'</p>
<p>'Yeah, it feels much more professional than the robbers in some movies and TV shows. Look, they even have zip ties specifically for controlling hostages.'</p>
<p>'Exactly, exactly! And to prevent the hostages from becoming unstable, there's even a person specifically assigned to calm them down at the entrance.'</p>
<p>The players were all very excited.</p>
<p>Although playing as robbers goes against normal worldview, there's no denying that this direction certainly made players feel thrilled. Just imagining it felt incredibly exciting.</p>
<p>And the content within the promotional video further excited the players.</p>
<p>Because the robbers in this promotional video were simply too professional.</p>
<p>What real robbers are like, players don't know, but clearly, players will imagine it themselves.</p>
<p>Whether players portray good guys or bad guys, they generally hope the villains are intelligent beings, not dopey fools.</p>
<p>After all, if you're playing a bad guy, then you are the robber. If the game portrays them as dopey fools, what sense of immersion is there?</p>
<p>And if players are playing good guys, is there more achievement in catching a high-IQ criminal or a bunch of dopey fools?</p>
<p>So, just from the video Chen Xu released for Payday, it thrilled everyone to no end.</p>
<p>Of course, for reasons related to certain sensitive aspects, and similar to previous games, Chen Xu implemented many protective measures for Payday.</p>
<p>Firstly, there were various corresponding warnings, and the game undoubtedly received a 17+ rating.</p>
<p>At the same time, players were guided to understand that this game is not purely a crime game, but rather intended to instill a sense of reverence for life and law.</p>
<p>Although all players knew that this was definitely nonsense and that it was just a satisfying game.</p>
<p>But such measures were still very necessary.</p>
<p>After all, Nebula Games' current scale is significant, and it's not just Nebula Games; other developers also get people looking for trouble to take a jab at them every year.</p>
<p>Many parents who are indifferent to their children, perhaps not even knowing what their children do all day, will definitely find something to blame when their children's academic performance lags behind others. Games are often the first target. Their own fault? Of course, they can't admit it. As for games being gone, there are still TV shows, animations, and novels, and they'll just blame those one by one then.</p>
<p>Characters bleeding and getting hurt in the game? That's excessive violence.</p>
<p>Female characters in the game are too beautiful? That's objectifying women!</p>
<p>No female characters in the game? That's gender discrimination!</p>
<p>Small animals in the game can be killed? That's animal abuse!</p>
<p>For most players, it's actually very clear that a game is just a game. Unless it's an exceptionally egregious game, the game itself is merely a product for people's entertainment.</p>
<p>But there are always some people, perhaps genuinely believing it, or perhaps for profit, who will seize any opportunity to confront it.</p>
<p>Therefore, Nebula Games' own legal department and its contracted top law firms already have extensive experience in this area.</p>
<p>As expected, after the game's promotional video was released, there were continuous arguments online, not just among players but also within and outside the gaming industry.</p>
<p>A portion of players believed that this was a normal cultural expression, as similar works are not uncommon in movies and TV shows.</p>
<p>However, some so-called experts constantly criticized the game.</p>
<p>But Chen Xu didn't pay any attention to it.</p>
<p>After all, it wasn't the first time, and besides, the game successfully passed classification and obtained a publishing license.</p>
<p>If they disagreed, they could always go to the officials.</p>
<p>Amidst these controversies, Payday's popularity continued to rise, and Chen Xu subsequently released more promotional videos.</p>
<p>Just as players expected, picking up from the previous video, the second video showcased intense shooting scenes.</p>
<p>Sewers, stairwells, firearms, grenades, and various explosive conflicts made players feel as if they were watching an exciting police and bandit movie.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the second video, players finally learned the game's name: Payday.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Amidst player anticipation and ongoing controversy, Payday continued to announce new information and content.</p>
<p>Players had a general understanding of the game's content.</p>
<p>This wasn't a game of massive scale, but rather a PVE game structured with individual maps as levels.</p>
<p>Although some players were a little disappointed by this, it wasn't entirely unexpected, as the time from Payday's initial leak to its development and launch wasn't long.</p>
<p>And while it was called a small-scale game, that was only in comparison to Nebula Games itself and major game developers like FOW.</p>
<p>Being a VR version, coupled with Nebula Games' ample funding, the game's visual presentation was quite exquisite.</p>
<p>Not to mention the shooting feel and action performance, Chen Xu's Payday, in these experiential aspects, completely surpassed its predecessor from his previous life.</p>
<p>Combined with the game's AI performance, controlling hostages, having them perform actions, and even using them as a tactical element, differed significantly from the Payday in his previous life.</p>
<p>The same applied to stealth. At the very least, there wouldn't be situations where NPCs somehow failed to notice masked robbers, even when they were butt-to-butt.</p>
<p>Of course, this improvement in AI meant that stealth gameplay would become more difficult. Therefore, Chen Xu also planned many levels, and the game's maps would be larger, thereby increasing player enjoyment in the game.</p>
