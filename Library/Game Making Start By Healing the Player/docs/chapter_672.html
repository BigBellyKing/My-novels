                <p>Chapter 671: Excited Players (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>It wasn't just Zhang Yi himself; online, players like Zhang Yi who were among the first to clear the game had already erupted in excitement.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked by the incredible twist at the end.</p>
<p>Numerous players discussed the content of BioShock Infinite.</p>
<p>“I was utterly dumbfounded. When the ending appeared, it was full of surprise yet still made perfect sense.”</p>
<p>“It was absolutely explosive! The game had hinted at it countless times, but when the truth was finally revealed, I still felt a shiver down my spine.”</p>
<p>“Remember the underwater city Elizabeth took Booker to? It didn’t feel like a mere background texture. Do you think it might be a scene for the next part of the story?”</p>
<p>“Only Mr. Chen would know that! But now I'm going to play through it again. I feel like there are still some places I haven't fully explored, and I haven't completely understood Columbia's history and structure.”</p>
<p>“Playing through it again +1! Elizabeth is simply the most perfect NPC teammate!”</p>
<p>“Exactly! Before, my favorite NPC teammates were probably Ghost and Captain Price from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, but now I have to say it’s Elizabeth!”</p>
<p>The entire story campaign of BioShock Infinite took approximately 15 hours to complete.</p>
<p>Although it was a linear game,</p>
<p>players could still collect various items within the sky city of Columbia. Coupled with a combat system that allowed for combo strategies, the completion time would only be longer.</p>
<p>For Zhang Yi, this journey through BioShock Infinite left him deeply reflective.</p>
<p>Like most thread-based games, to provide players with a more immersive experience, most thread-based games are presented in a chapter-based format. The most direct aspect of this is the switching of different scene maps, giving players a feeling similar to a TV series.</p>
<p>For example, in The Last of Us, from the management district to Tommy's town and university town later on.</p>
<p>And in Uncharted, from the beginning in Scotland to Madagascar later, the journey also switched between different scene maps.</p>
<p>While BioShock Infinite didn't strictly follow this chapter-based format or instant map switching,</p>
<p>its design approach was indeed similar. The game's story began with Booker riding a rocket, accompanied by a 'Hallelujah,' arriving at Columbia, a sky city that felt like something out of a fairy tale.</p>
<p>To the player's eyes, this city in the sky was utterly breathtaking. Subsequently, as players explored, they switched between different locations: Monument Island, Warrior's Park, Finkton, Plaza of Zeal, and Comstock's mansion. Each of these unique structures conveyed the madness and extremism of this religious society.</p>
<p>Of course, what was even more crucial were the plot elements within the game, which left Zhang Yi in awe. Initially, he thought it would be an adventure like The Last of Us, focusing on Booker and Elizabeth. But he had no idea that Nebula Games had delivered such a stunning story in this game.</p>
<p>Parallel worlds, religious discussions, dystopia, quantum mechanics... these complex elements were all brilliantly showcased within the game. And, of course, it created a character that all players would never forget.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi had a feeling that Elizabeth, this unique NPC companion, was destined to become a classic character.</p>
<p>Elizabeth dancing gracefully on the beach, and her heartwarming call of 'Booker, catch!' when danger struck, filled people with emotion. One could say that only after playing BioShock Infinite would one truly understand how considerate Elizabeth was.</p>
<p>However, while many players expressed their emotions, there was also a common point.</p>
<p>That was whether Elizabeth and Booker were truly dead.</p>
<p>It must be said that the final story of Elizabeth and Booker was truly shocking. So much so that many players, upon seeing that ending, were too stunned to notice one detail: Booker was drowned by Elizabeth, which also implied that Elizabeth would die and disappear.</p>
<p>The disappearance of various parallel-world Elizabeths at the end also foreshadowed this. One could say that BioShock Infinite was a complete tragedy.</p>
<p>It was only because of the overwhelming impact of the original plot that players overlooked this point. But after recovering from the game, many players suddenly realized this upon reflection.</p>
<p>“Damn, Mr. Chen pulled out his knife again?!”</p>
<p>“BioShock Infinite is indeed incredibly shocking and amazing, but has everyone forgotten something? Mr. Chen's 'love' is here again! In the original Resident Evil Village, only Ethan Winters was gone, but now, Booker and Elizabeth are both gone!”</p>
<p>“Now that you mention it, you're right! It's absolutely infuriating!”</p>
<p>“But maybe not? I feel like Elizabeth should still be alive, right?”</p>
<p>“+1! I also think she didn't disappear, because the other Elizabeths from other worlds gradually dissipated. The final scene also lingered for about two seconds.”</p>
<p>“And isn't there a sequel? If Elizabeth and Booker are dead, how can there be a sequel?”</p>
<p>“They died, so there can't be a sequel? Look at Call of Duty: Modern Warfare—you play as a protagonist who dies in every game of the trilogy.”</p>
<p>“Exactly! And in Red Dead Redemption, you die and then play as John Marston. Get with the program.”</p>
<p>“Youngsters! You've only started playing Nebula Games and understanding Mr. Chen in recent years, right? I can only say, brothers, you're still too young!”</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>Three days after BioShock Infinite launched, many players had already completed the game's story.</p>
<p>At the same time, on Mr. Chen's official Weibo account, he received private messages and comments from players every day.</p>
<p>They all essentially asked the same thing: whether Elizabeth and Booker were truly dead.</p>
<p>Initially, Chen Xu hadn't planned to respond.</p>
<p>However, the players' reactions were too enthusiastic.</p>
<p>For two consecutive days, 'Elizabeth' and 'BioShock Infinite' held the top spots on the game's Trending Search Terms. So, facing the players' confusion, and with countless players watching, Chen Xu stepped forward this time to give players some clear answers.</p>
<p>As for the answer, it was quite simple:</p>
<p>'Elizabeth is still alive, but she will not be the sole protagonist. The final ending will not disappoint.'</p>
<p>While Chen Xu's response didn't reveal many detailed plot points, the key information was certainly abundant. It surprised many players who hadn't had any expectations.</p>
<p>Elizabeth is still alive, but not the protagonist?</p>
<p>And the game's ending won't disappoint? Doesn't that imply the game will have a good ending?</p>
<p>After summarizing the content of Chen Xu's official Weibo post, players immediately became excited.</p>
