                <p>Chapter 330: I'm Gonna Freaking Rave About Veteran Difficulty! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, having survived the ordeal, let out a long breath.</p>
<p>Although he knew this was all pre-set in the game, he still felt a strange sense of emotion. Even though it was just a short prologue level, and he had been wiped out several times in a row, and had seen the famous quotes countless times, Zhang Yi truly felt incredibly satisfied.</p>
<p>It wasn't just the layered tension in the game, or the atmosphere of whistling bullets and explosions. More importantly, this game made him feel a close connection and bond with his NPC teammates.</p>
<p>In previous games, NPC teammates were just simple stat-boosting NPCs, leaving him completely unfazed. But in <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, thanks to the powerful atmosphere creation, realistic graphics, and the NPCs' super high AI and performance, Zhang Yi felt like he <em>was</em> Soap, and that he wasn't disconnected from Captain Price and Gaz.</p>
<p>It was as if he had truly become a member of the SAS. Here, Captain Price would save him in critical moments of danger, teaching him the rules of survival on the battlefield. Here, his teammate Griggs would cover his rear, leaving him with no worries. Here, Gaz would provide cover, allowing him to better deal with enemies. Here, no one would abandon a teammate.</p>
<p>This feeling made Zhang Yi believe that these NPC teammates were flesh and blood, not just mere stat-boosting NPCs. At least, based on its current performance, <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> was absolutely the most shocking game he had ever played.</p>
<p>None other!</p>
<p>This thought became even more profound after reaching the second level, named Blackout.</p>
<p>It was just that the Veteran difficulty was indeed a bit too hard. After dying several times in a row, Zhang Yi quickly summarized some experiences. The enemy's marksmanship and firepower were basically extremely accurate. Trying to charge head-on was basically impossible. Cover was an extremely important element in this game, because if you left cover for more than a second or two, enemies would attack with incredible accuracy; every single one of them was a professional player. You couldn't get greedy; you could only use cover to eliminate opponents.</p>
<p>Of course, there was also a clever trick: if you advanced slowly, your teammates would push forward after you remained still for a while, then cooperate to eliminate enemies. However, this was much slower than the player's own efficiency. After all, while the performance was very realistic, it was still a player playing the game; it was impossible for the NPCs to truly eliminate all enemies directly. Though some players really did specifically hope for that.</p>
<p>The reason why the NPCs in the game had such AI performance was intentionally done by Chen Xu. The main reason for this setting was to allow players to better feel the reliability of their teammates. Doing so would make players develop a deeper recognition of these NPC characters.</p>
<p>In his previous life, players developed deep feelings for the members of the SAS and later Task Force 141. Besides <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> not being a single-protagonist game, the more important reason was to give players a strong sense of immersion. During missions, the mutual chat interaction and the highly isolated AI performance in his previous life, as well as the various forms of mutual support between teammates and players on the battlefield, made players understand that these NPC teammates were useful, not just decorative ornaments like in other games.</p>
<p>Because whether NPC teammates were a hindrance or a helper in a game truly affected players' feelings towards them. For example, Ashley in <em>Resident Evil 4</em> was clearly a negative presence; Ashley causing trouble for you? Incapable of success but prone to failure! And Sheva in <em>Resident Evil 5</em> was a complete silly girl; giving her herbs was like throwing them in the trash can.</p>
<p>In contrast, Elizabeth in <em>The Last of Us</em> and <em>BioShock Infinite</em> – besides the plot – more importantly, players could personally feel the help these NPC teammates provided. Although these characters' looks and gender also benefited them greatly, did <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> need that? Absolutely not!</p>
<p>In <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, every player could feel the help these NPCs provided, thereby developing a sense of identification and emotional bond with them.</p>
<p>“Captain, I’ve run over! The rest is up to you!”</p>
<p>Zhang Yi in the game performed a quick running slide, then skillfully prostrated himself on the ground. Facing the hail of bullets and explosions, Zhang Yi listened to Soap's heavy breathing and looked at the blood-red screen, eagerly watching Captain Price and Gaz, as well as the Russian reinforcements, Kamarov.</p>
<p>And they did not disappoint Zhang Yi, swiftly eliminating the surrounding enemies.</p>
<p>“NICE! Good marksmanship, Captain!”</p>
<p>“Beautiful, Brother Gaz, that was a beautiful shot!”</p>
<p>“Kamarov, do you know Fuze? His explosives are pretty fierce too!”</p>
<p>“Brothers, charge! I’ll cover the rear.”</p>
<p>The latter half of this level was a standard CQB level, an indoor close-quarters combat level. In the game, players, as Soap and Captain Price, simply helped Kamarov and learned the location where Nikolai was being held from him. This area was pitch black, giving a feeling similar to playing <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>. It was just that these houses couldn't be demolished.</p>
<p>The team advanced cautiously. They breached the door and cleared the tripwire bomb on the ground. Zhang Yi crouched the whole time, following at the very back of the team, occasionally shouting “NICE” to cheer on Captain Price.</p>
<p>There was no other way; earlier, he had tried to steal the fruits of his allies' labor by running to the front. As a result, because he didn't notice a corner, he was instantly taken out in one second and had to watch the famous quotes again. This taught him a lesson: don't take credit for work you didn't do.</p>
<p>At this moment, a private voice message came through. After connecting, Song Ren's voice suddenly rang out.</p>
<p>“Old Zhang, what level are you on? This game is too awesome, the atmosphere in the second level is completely maxed out, especially the great battle between the Russian army and armed militants in the mountains, it’s amazing!” Song Ren expressed his inner excitement without spoiling anything.</p>
<p>“Me? I’m also playing the second level, I should be almost past it. By the way, what difficulty are you playing on?” Zhang Yi responded.</p>
<p>“Normal, why?” Song Ren asked.</p>
<p>Hearing Song Ren’s words, Zhang Yi pondered for a moment: “I suggest you try Veteran difficulty, because Veteran difficulty is truly fun! I’m gonna freaking rave about Veteran difficulty!”</p>
<p>“At this difficulty, you can experience a completely different feeling, a more realistic sense of immersion, especially that feeling of entrusting your life to your comrades, it’s truly amazing, I’m gonna freaking rave about it! And you can learn a lot of knowledge too.”</p>
<p>After speaking, Zhang Yi hung up the voice call, then silently adjusted the game’s difficulty to [Normal]. Although what he said came from the bottom of his heart, and he truly wanted to rave about Veteran difficulty, and he could keep playing in that mode, Zhang Yi still wanted a bit of a sense of participation.</p>
<p>After all, with Veteran difficulty, he always felt like it was a team of god-tier teammates carrying one pig teammate. And he was that little pig.</p>
<p>On the other end of the call, Song Ren was a bit confused. “Veteran difficulty, a completely different experience? Entrusting your life to teammates? Why does that sound so mystical? And learning knowledge from playing games? What is Old Zhang talking about?” Song Ren muttered to himself.</p>
<p>However, upon entering the third level, he still changed the game’s difficulty from Normal to Veteran. He couldn't help it; he was curious.</p>
