                <p>Chapter 793: The Lusty Argonian Maid</p>
<p>After arriving in Whiterun, Song Ren didn't rush to Dragonsreach to find the Jarl. Instead, he wandered around the streets for a while.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous Riverwood, Whiterun naturally had many more NPCs.</p>
<p>Talking to the NPCs along the way, Song Ren discovered that their dialogue was all completely unique.</p>
<p>He hadn't felt much in Riverwood.</p>
<p>But after arriving in Whiterun, Song Ren had only one feeling:</p>
<p>That it was vibrant.</p>
<p>In terms of scale, Whiterun wasn't actually very large.</p>
<p>It was about half the size of Saint Denis in <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>.</p>
<p>Yet, the entire city gave Song Ren a remarkably lively feeling.</p>
<p>Khajiit and Tiger-folk engaged in trade came and went, and all the houses in the city could be freely entered and exited.</p>
<p>Every NPC could be spoken to, and all would provide players with some information.</p>
<p>These dialogues were not repetitive.</p>
<p>At the same time, Song Ren noticed that the furnishings inside these accessible houses were also different.</p>
<p>“It’s like that feeling I had when I first played <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> and <em>Breath of the Wild</em>!”</p>
<p>Song Ren had no intention of going to Dragonsreach to find the Jarl; instead, he wandered around the houses in Whiterun.</p>
<p>The only thing that left Song Ren a little dissatisfied was the absence of conventional RPG fun in <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>.</p>
<p>What is the most common fun in an RPG?</p>
<p>It's, of course, turning the protagonist into an old rogue, rummaging through everything and anything.</p>
<p>But in <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>, Song Ren found that while many items could be acquired, they were labeled 'Stolen'.</p>
<p>Moreover, if seen by an NPC, it would increase his crime value and lead to being hunted by guards.</p>
<p>However, putting that aside, the game's content once again gave Song Ren the same sense of exploration he felt when playing <em>Zelda</em>.</p>
<p>Especially when picking locks with a tension wrench, each successful lockpick filled him with anticipation.</p>
<p>“This homeowner must really love studying, huh? A bard? Why are there so many books? Can’t they hide an artifact or a god-tier item in their house?”</p>
<p>Although getting caught stealing by an NPC would increase bounties and crime value, what if he wasn't seen?</p>
<p>Sneaking around, waiting for all the nearby NPCs to leave, Song Ren picked a lock and entered a small house, beginning to rummage for items.</p>
<p>The only thing that left Song Ren a little depressed was that this house was full of books. Forget good stuff, there wasn't even a single gold coin.</p>
<p>“Honestly, though, I wonder how many books are actually in this game. The variety is truly immense.”</p>
<p>Song Ren sighed as he looked at the books he had just scavenged.</p>
<p>In such fantasy games, the game's background is basically presented to players through snippets of NPC dialogue and in-game books.</p>
<p>For example, Nebula Games' previous titles, <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> and <em>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</em>.</p>
<p>Aside from the main story, much of the content and world-building require players to read the in-game books themselves.</p>
<p>Otherwise, relying solely on the main questline makes it difficult to understand the overall context of the game's background.</p>
<p>For instance, the newspapers in <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, and the books detailing the background and affairs of various kingdoms in <em>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</em>.</p>
<p>Clearly, <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> also contains numerous books used to introduce players to the game's background.</p>
<p>While sighing, Song Ren also looked at the books in his inventory.</p>
<p>He wasn't particularly interested in these, to be honest.</p>
<p>After all, there were simply too many, making it hard to read them all. But sometimes he would flip through them to see what they were about.</p>
<p>This time, however, was different. Among the newly acquired books, Song Ren found one with a very strange title.</p>
<p>“The Lusty Argonian Maid? What kind of book is this? Why does the title sound so anime-style?”</p>
<p>Intrigued by the title, Song Ren was curious.</p>
<p>Compared to the other books, this one stood out like a firefly in the dark.</p>
<p>Filled with curiosity, Song Ren opened the book in the game and read:</p>
<p>‘The Lusty Argonian Maid, Volume 2’</p>
<p>By Crassius Curio</p>
<p>Scene Seven, Act Two.</p>
<p>Wags-Her-Tail: My goodness, that's a large breadstick! But how do I get it into the oven?</p>
<p>Crantius Colto: That breadstick is not yet ready to be baked, my sweet! It has not yet risen.</p>
<p>Wags-Her-Tail: But how am I to make it rise?</p>
<p>Crantius Colto: Oh, my little foolish maid, you must use your hands, of course!</p>
<p>Wags-Her-Tail: You want me to make this bread rise now? Here?</p>
<p>Crantius Colto: Of course.</p>
<p>Wags-Her-Tail: But what if the Mistress sees? This bread is for her breakfast!</p>
<p>Crantius Colto: Worry not, the Mistress will have food later.</p>
<p>Wags-Her-Tail: Oh, good! But I fear the oven isn’t hot enough, this will take hours!</p>
<p>Crantius Colto: There is plenty of time, my dear! Plenty of time.</p>
<p>End of Scene Seven, Act Two.</p>
<p>Looking at the book in his inventory, Song Ren went from confusion to bewilderment.</p>
<p>What the heck, this was erotic literature!</p>
<p>'The Lusty Argonian Maid,' seriously, is this book even decent?</p>
<p>It wasn't just Song Ren who was speechless.</p>
<p>Some players who were also exploring <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> and had discovered this rather special book were completely dumbfounded.</p>
<p>In the game, there were a total of ten such books, scattered at different locations.</p>
<p>Their content was all very, very explicit.</p>
<p>And as is well known, content that resonates with players and sparks widespread discussion often includes such suggestive material.</p>
<p>After the first player posted the contents of this book on the Tieba forums, the discussion among players quickly shifted from the plump chicken in Riverwood to Argonian Maids.</p>
<p>‘I’m completely stunned. As a pure-minded individual, I didn’t even react at first!’</p>
<p>‘Ahem, brother, don’t pretend to be pure. You understood it, so what purity are you talking about?’</p>
<p>‘23333333, I wonder how many of these books there are in the game.’</p>
<p>‘Indeed, the ancients didn’t lie to me: in books, there is a golden house; in books, there are beauties. No more talk, why be a Dragonborn? I’m going to read all the books in Skyrim.’</p>
<p>‘Speaking of which, <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> shouldn't turn into a pile driver like <em>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</em>, right?’</p>
<p>‘It shouldn’t. I feel this game is quite proper.’</p>
<p>‘To be fair, if you just read the text, the atmosphere is quite enchanting. But haven’t you seen what Argonians look like? I can only say that if that works, then you’re truly a warrior!’</p>
<p>‘+1, Argonians are too terrifying! I don’t think I can get myself to do it!’</p>
