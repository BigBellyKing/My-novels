                <p>Chapter 471: Can This Wife Still Be Saved? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>“It's fine, it’s fine, not scary, not scary,” Song Ren mumbled to himself.</p>
<p>The main reason was his complete lack of psychological preparation. To be honest, this head wasn't really that scary, just a little disgusting. Originally, he thought this was 'Silent Hill PT', but judging by the setup, it was more like 'Outlast'?</p>
<p>Song Ren pondered, as this sudden jump scare reminded him of 'Outlast', a game that almost made him wet himself years ago.</p>
<p>And very soon after emerging from the sewer, Song Ren felt this even more strongly.</p>
<p>It was bright, not pitch black anymore, but it looked like a basement scene.</p>
<p>“No crazy person is going to suddenly rush out and scare me, right?”</p>
<p>Walking, Song Ren cautiously scanned all directions, front, back, left, and right, terrified that someone might pop out and startle him.</p>
<p>Because it was adjacent to the sewer, although there was some light, it still seemed a bit dim. The walls were very damp, and the water stains reflected the light, making it even more eerie.</p>
<p>Song Ren walked carefully, but then suddenly, a rumbling sound came from above. It seemed as if something heavy had been slammed to the ground, giving him a fright.</p>
<p>“Holy cow! Someone's above!” His walking steps halted, and Song Ren looked upwards with lingering fear.</p>
<p>He waited there for a short while, and after confirming there were no intense scenes, he moved forward again.</p>
<p>But unlike before, when he couldn't grasp the layout in all directions, this time Song Ren looked in six directions with every step.</p>
<p>Why six? Because the commotion from above just now made Song Ren realize that it wasn't just front, back, left, and right, but he also needed to look up and down!</p>
<p>Originally, Song Ren thought it was 'Outlast', but now he felt like he was playing 'Silent Hill PT'. He hadn't even seen any scary monsters yet, but he was already scaring himself half to death.</p>
<p>Finally, after countless steps, he pushed open a door, and the dim yellow light illuminated the scene before him, making Song Ren exhale a long breath.</p>
<p>Light! That was much better!</p>
<p>Like a moth drawn to a flame, even though he didn't know what awaited him, Song Ren immediately rushed towards the light.</p>
<p>As he got closer, he realized it was a prison-like scene, with a large iron gate and a string of chains on it. Inside the room, there was a woman in pajamas with her back to him.</p>
<p>“Wait! That’s my wife, Mia!” Standing at the door, Song Ren observed for a moment and finally confirmed it.</p>
<p>“But something feels a bit off,” Song Ren said, looking at Mia inside, feeling a little hesitant.</p>
<p>Of course, he wasn't thinking of any disharmonious movie plots like being missing for three years or being imprisoned in a secret room.</p>
<p>It was because this was a horror game!</p>
<p>His wife had her back to him, not letting him see her face, which always made him feel like something was amiss.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Song Ren suddenly didn't want to save his wife anymore. Although Mia's character model in the game was indeed very beautiful.</p>
<p>It was the kind of character design that appealed to both Asian and European tastes, rather than forcefully making the female protagonist look like a King Kong Barbie, achieving political correctness to the point where you couldn't tell if they were male or female.</p>
<p>If it were like that, why save Mia?</p>
<p>Ethan probably wouldn't think that way: My wife is missing? That's great, just in time to get a new one!</p>
<p>“Mia! Wife! Darling! Can you hear me? How are you?”</p>
<p>Standing at the iron gate, Song Ren tried to see if he could wake Mia.</p>
<p>Although it was just a game, what if Mr. Chen had sneakily designed some microphone voice integration with the game?</p>
<p>After all, it wasn't unheard of for game companies to do that.</p>
<p>After circling for a long time and determining it was useless, Song Ren started looking for other ways.</p>
<p>On the nearby toolbox, he saw a pair of red wire cutters, which looked like they were specifically for cutting the chains. There was also a note with a list of names, headed by Mia. The other names had corresponding remarks, either saying 'mutated' or 'dead'.</p>
<p>“Right! Earlier in the house, I think there was a newspaper, and those three reporters who courted death also said many people were missing!”</p>
<p>“They were captured and used as test subjects! Only my wife is still alive!”</p>
<p>Song Ren suddenly understood, and quickly picked up the wire cutters to cut the chains on the large gate.</p>
<p>“Will my wife mutate in a bit?” After pushing the door open, looking at Mia with her back to him, Song Ren was very nervous, afraid of a turn-around jump scare.</p>
<p>He cautiously approached and pressed the interact button.</p>
<p>However, the anticipated turn-around jump scare didn't happen. His wife was still his wife; although she looked a bit haggard, she was still as beautiful as ever.</p>
<p>At this point, Song Ren finally understood why Ethan was so persistent in saving his wife.</p>
<p>Such a beautiful wife, who wouldn't keep thinking about her?</p>
<p>“Ethan? Ethan!” Mia, awakened, looked at Ethan before her with an incredulous expression.</p>
<p>“You shouldn't be here, Ethan!” Mia’s voice was somewhat flustered.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? You looked for me. You sent me an email asking me to find you, darling.”</p>
<p>“Me? No, I didn't! That wasn't me!” Mia’s eyes widened, and she shook her head repeatedly.</p>
<p>Then Mia got up from the bed and grabbed Ethan's hand, looking very panicked.</p>
<p>“By the way, did anyone see you when you came here? Did he see you?”</p>
<p>“He? Who is he? Is there anyone else here? What exactly is going on?” Ethan was full of questions, asking what Song Ren also wanted to know at that moment.</p>
<p>But Mia didn't answer. She just pulled Ethan's hand nervously and ran outside.</p>
<p>“Dad's coming, we need to go fast! Quick!”</p>
<p>Ethan in the game was dragged by Mia, and Song Ren was also bewildered. Was his wife saved just like that? And who the heck was Dad? At that moment, his mind was full of questions.</p>
<p>However, the only thing that brought Song Ren a little comfort was that he now had a companion. With his wife by his side, the sense of fear had significantly lessened.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, he wasn't young anymore; it was time to consider these things himself!</p>
<p>Song Ren sighed with emotion, looking at Mia beside him, his hanging heart slowly settling down.</p>
<p>And Ethan in the game finally couldn't hold back anymore.</p>
<p>“Mia, Mia, I think we need to talk. What exactly is going on with those emails you sent me?”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t me! Ethan!” Mia turned around, her face full of terror: “I swear, I didn’t send them to you, we need to go fast! This way!”</p>
<p>“This is where that family used to bring me food. I remember this path.”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you everything, Ethan, trust me.”</p>
<p>Mia said as she led Ethan along.</p>
<p>Soon, led by Mia, they arrived in a small room with a sofa but very bright light.</p>
<p>But Mia seemed utterly distraught: “It was here! I’m not mistaken, there should have been a door right here!”</p>
<p>“It was here… it was here! How did it disappear… how did it disappear!”</p>
<p>Ethan here was attracted by the photos on the nearby table, while Mia became unusually agitated.</p>
<p>But by the time Ethan walked over, Mia, who had seemed on the verge of a breakdown, quieted down, looked at Ethan, and said in a very flat tone: “We’ll be a family soon… since you’re here.”</p>
<p>Then Mia sat back on the sofa, breathing heavily, muttering: “We have to leave here… we have to leave here!”</p>
<p>Her strange behavior made Song Ren’s slightly relaxed heart clench up again.</p>
<p>Can this wife still be saved? Her mind seems to be a little off!</p>
