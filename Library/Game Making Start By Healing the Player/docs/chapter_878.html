                <p>Chapter 877: Multiple Escort Games</p>
<p>Regarding the new generation VR gaming pod, the corresponding development prototypes are being prepared for dispatch to Nebula Games and various major game developers across the country.</p>
<p>External publicity and promotion are also underway, but Nebula Games doesn't need to worry about these. After all, the scope of such things is too broad, and unlike the game market of the previous life, the current game market is now second only to commodities like tobacco and alcohol.</p>
<p>For Chen Xu, the main thing is to focus on making games; escort when it's time to escort, support when it's time to support.</p>
<p>After returning from the Game Department, Chen Xu began preparing the design concept document for the escort games for the new generation VR gaming pod.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, there are mainly three market regions. In addition, the Nebula World, originally exclusive to the Nebula Games Platform, will also need to be ported simultaneously. So there's quite a lot to do.</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>After completing the design concept document for the new project, Chen Xu called Yang Xin, Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, and others to the meeting room.</p>
<p>"Take a good look, ask if you don't understand anything. Once you've understood it, you can start working on the development prototypes."</p>
<p>Chen Xu handed the thick stack of printed concept documents directly to everyone.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, aren't you going to explain it?" Yang Xin looked at the stack of concept documents in her hand, speechless.</p>
<p>They had already received news about the new generation content and were aware of the information regarding developing escort titles.</p>
<p>Chen Xu chuckled, "No need, it's not necessary. Besides, these three games aren't particularly complex."</p>
<p>Yang Xin: "…………Alright, I'll take a look."</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, everyone seriously flipped through the concept documents in their hands. After an hour, Yang Xin was the first to ask a question.</p>
<p>"<em>Persona</em>? Mr. Chen, is this a Japanese anime style game? No action design? Pure dungeon turn-based strategy game!?"</p>
<p>"Cool fashion sense, high school students saving the world? Is this to establish characters with character and story as the core!?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, this is a renaissance!"</p>
<p>Yang Xin looked at the concept document titled <em>Persona</em>, her face full of surprise. She felt it was excellent.</p>
<p>Especially with several scene concept arts that Chen Xu had already completed, such as the protagonist Ren Amamiya and his Phantom Thief transformation into Joker, her maiden's heart was almost overflowing because he was truly handsome! Moreover, the game's background setting and Persona mechanics also felt fresh to her.</p>
<p>But the crucial thing was the gameplay mode, which directly launched into a renaissance mode!</p>
<p>It was a traditional RPG dungeon and turn-based combat, as traditional as it gets.</p>
<p>While the previous <em>Final Fantasy</em> also featured dungeons, it was real-time combat.</p>
<p>And <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>, though not turn-based, wasn't strictly real-time combat either, but it was an open world.</p>
<p>Now, <em>Persona</em> was different. Dungeons, turn-based – all the traditional elements were maxed out. Coupled with the popular plot of high school students saving the world, it felt like a complete renaissance!</p>
<p>"This isn't a renaissance; it's the culmination of traditional RPGs," Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p><em>Persona</em>, or rather, <em>Persona 5</em> starring Ren Amamiya, was considered the pinnacle of traditional RPGs in his previous life.</p>
<p>Compared to <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>, which blazed a new trail and carried the banner of RPG innovation, <em>Persona</em> was even more traditional.</p>
<p>To describe it using wuxia novels, <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em> would be like Zhang Wuji, born into a prestigious family but enduring hardships, then embarking on a cheat-like life full of fortuitous encounters and noble benefactors, all while still working hard.</p>
<p>But <em>Persona</em> was different. To describe it with a single character, it would be Hu Fei. All his martial arts were family heirlooms; cheats had nothing to do with him. He trained and trained continuously from the <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em> and <em>Persona</em> series until, in <em>Persona 5</em>, he finally mastered it all and became a master.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, are we going to make a wuxia game?" After Yang Xin's question, Qin Yi, who had finished reading the design concept document, also seemed a little excited.</p>
<p>He held a design concept document titled <em>Fate Seeker</em>.</p>
<p>Regarding themes, Nebula Games had made almost every type of game. But wuxia, honestly, they hadn't touched. The main reason was that in China, the terms wuxia and xianxia weren't usually associated with good things. Most players, upon hearing them, would immediately think of various crude and shoddy games and pay-to-win games.</p>
<p>Coupled with the so-called wuxia culture, whose market was primarily in China and Southeast Asia, Nebula Games had never really pursued it.</p>
<p>"This is a gift for domestic players," Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>In his previous life, there were indeed some good wuxia-themed games, such as <em>Scroll of Taiwu</em> and <em>Tales of Wulin</em>.</p>
<p>However, if he had to pick the one wuxia-themed game that left the deepest impression on Chen Xu, it would have to be <em>Fate Seeker</em>, or rather, its second installment.</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay, it was set against the backdrop of <em>The Three Heroes and Five Gallants</em>, combined with an open world and an 'Ace Attorney'-style deduction system, letting players know that the jianghu martial arts world wasn't just about fighting and killing.</p>
<p>Of course, the gameplay wasn't the most crucial aspect. It was the portrayal of the protagonist in the game, Zhuge Yu, who was a breath of fresh air compared to the overly virtuous characters in traditional wuxia games. He skillfully employed tactics like feigning death and faking surrender, demonstrating meticulous planning before action.</p>
<p>On the other hand, although he was a侠客 (hero), he never hesitated when dealing with evil-doers. Unlike typical game protagonists who might choose not to kill subdued villains, the protagonist in this game showed no mercy, striking them down with a single blow.</p>
<p>What was even more commendable was that the great hero Zhuge Yu not only showed no mercy to villains but also built his harem with logical and convincing reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, the ancient setting allowed it. Secondly, could any protagonist just build a harem? What was their status? And what was Zhuge Yu's status? A descendant of the Zhuge family, son of a former Imperial Censor, special consultant to Kaifeng Prefecture, with influential figures like Bao Zheng, who would later become Vice Minister of Military Affairs, in the imperial court, and respected by Shaolin and Cangmo in the jianghu.</p>
<p>Could an ordinary protagonist really have such a harem? They simply didn't have the capability!</p>
<p>In the meeting room, Chen Xu discussed the three games that would escort the new generation VR gaming pod.</p>
<p>Among them, <em>Persona</em> and <em>Fate Seeker</em> were the most discussed.</p>
<p>Conversely, the last game, a crime theme project called 'Sin City', the largest in scale and setting, didn't receive much attention.</p>
<p>This was mainly because those present saw some resemblance to <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, which had shocked global players back then.</p>
<p>While this game was much larger in scale than <em>Persona</em> and <em>Fate Seeker</em>, and its conceptual effects were stunning, everyone present had grown accustomed to such grandeur. After all, with games like <em>Elden Ring</em>, and previously <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>, what big projects hadn't they been involved in?</p>
<p>Instead, it was the anime games, full of fashion and chuunibyou, and the wuxia game that piqued their interest more.</p>
