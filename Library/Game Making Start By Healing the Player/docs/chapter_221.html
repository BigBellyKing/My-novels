                <p>Chapter 220: Is This the Game We Were Playing? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>After watching the official Weibo post, the comment section below the video and the player community forums instantly erupted.</p>
<p>Countless players frantically reposted and left comments to express their excitement.</p>
<p>"Tell me this isn't real! This must be a CG animation!"</p>
<p>"So this was really made in <em>Minecraft</em>?"</p>
<p>"Holy cow, this is unbelievably awesome! If that's the case, does that mean other structures can also be replicated in <em>Minecraft</em>?"</p>
<p>"I'm impressed! This is completely different from the game I'm playing!"</p>
<p>"I suddenly want to go online and try it out. Why didn't they release this before the demo?"</p>
<p>"Exactly! I'm suddenly interested in this game! I think if they had released it before the demo, I definitely wouldn't have built a dark room!"</p>
<p>"Heh heh, it's nothing special. Give us a hundred years, and we can definitely build it too!"</p>
<p>"Please don't use 'we,' because I definitely can't build it!"</p>
<p>"I can only describe it with two words: Holy smokes!"</p>
<p>"Awesome, plain and simple! But this shouldn't have been built by just one person, right?"</p>
<p>"Definitely more than one person! If it were just one person, how massive would the workload be? Didn't you see the fast-cut video later? Obviously, this was a collaboration of many people!"</p>
<p>"The workload is too huge, requiring many people, but what about smaller projects?"</p>
<p>"Is this still the pixel game I know? It feels even better than some blockbuster games!"</p>
<p>"Exactly!"</p>
<p>Although <em>Minecraft</em> itself is a pixel game, this doesn't mean <em>Minecraft</em> is ugly. On the contrary, unlike its previous life, the <em>Minecraft</em> developed by Chen Xu made no compromises in its art. There was no cost control; pixels were merely an artistic adjustment made for the game's gameplay. The in-game modeling, lighting, and shadows were all top-notch. If you looked at a single block, it might be hard to tell, but when assembled into large structures and complexes, that feeling instantly came alive.</p>
<p>This also left countless online players stunned after watching the video. Originally, in everyone's impression, <em>Minecraft</em> was just an ordinary block-building game, at most adding survival elements. For example, these points were experienced by everyone in the previous Early Access trial. There was nothing too surprising. Although some players had already built some relatively nice small houses during this Early Access trial, it didn't give players much of a sense of shock or anticipation. After all, the time was too short to fully see the game's potential.</p>
<p>But what was shown in this video was completely different.</p>
<p>What the heck is this?!</p>
<p>They actually recreated Along the River During the Qingming Festival inside the game?</p>
<p>Is this still the game they knew?!</p>
<p>Not only the curious onlookers but also many Game Designers in the gaming industry were stunned after seeing <em>Minecraft</em>'s promotional video. A block-building game could actually be like this?</p>
<p>Chen Xu already had a complete promotional model for <em>Minecraft</em>. Everything before could only be considered a warm-up; now was the real promotion for <em>Minecraft</em>. Amidst the players' shock and Nebula Games' various promotional channels opening up, many industry designers noticed <em>Minecraft</em>'s popularity soaring. It even broke out of its niche and landed on the official Weibo account's trending search. Even the Game Department's official account reposted it that day.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in addition to various gaming media reposting it, many unrelated media also reposted the video. The view count of the promotional video rapidly increased, reaching 15 million in just one day. Before this, there were games that broke out of their niche, but those games' breakout wasn't largely related to the game's core topic. <em>Minecraft</em>, however, was completely different.</p>
<p>Recreating Along the River During the Qingming Festival in the game was the main focus of media reports. It primarily used the promotion of traditional culture as its entry point, but the key was that this recreation itself was a gameplay feature of <em>Minecraft</em>. As a result, many people who hadn't played the game knew that there was a game where one could recreate the thousand-year-old Along the River During the Qingming Festival. This also sparked people's imagination: if Along the River During the Qingming Festival could be replicated, what about other structures and scenes?</p>
<p>In fact, they didn't have to wait long. Just three days after this promotional video was released, Chen Xu uploaded another video to the official Weibo account. This time, the scene displayed was the famous Forbidden City.</p>
<p>With the previous experience of Along the River During the Qingming Festival, countless players were even more excited this time. They clicked on it almost impatiently.</p>
<p>And the video's display did not disappoint them.</p>
<p>Raindrops fell sparsely from the gloomy sky onto the city walls of the Forbidden City. The camera slowly moved towards the Forbidden City's gate, revealing tranquil forests and pavilions, magnificent and resplendent glazed roof tiles. White jade stairs and nine-dragon reliefs, the pond and stone bridge in the backyard. Red columns, golden glazed tiles... It gradually showed players what this extremely magnificent structure looked like in <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>
<p>The popularity of Along the River During the Qingming Festival hadn't completely subsided; it hadn't even cooled down. With the release of 'Forbidden City,' it was like adding fuel to the fire. It instantly caused <em>Minecraft</em>'s popularity to skyrocket.</p>
<p>All the designers in the entire gaming industry were dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this was the promotional method Chen Xu employed. More importantly, this promotional tactic was something they couldn't replicate at all. Because this was entirely a unique characteristic of <em>Minecraft</em>! And it also came with a BUFF of promoting traditional culture, which directly helped it break out of its niche even further.</p>
<p>Meng Zuo, who had been following <em>Minecraft</em>, finally understood what Chen Xu's previous words meant when he saw this scene. With a move like this, who could possibly compete with you for popularity?!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the <em>Voyage</em> project office, Zhu Yi was now in a dilemma. If he pushed forward, <em>Minecraft</em>'s popularity was simply incredible. The upcoming <em>Voyage</em> had been completely overshadowed; apart from players who had been following it, it basically couldn't make any waves. But if he retreated, it wasn't really about losing face. After all, if they could achieve good sales, then losing face wouldn't matter. The key was that the promotion had already gone this far. If they retreated, it would be a huge loss, and they basically wouldn't get any decent recommendation resources later.</p>
<p>"It's not necessarily doomed. After all, <em>Minecraft</em>, with its Along the River During the Qingming Festival and Forbidden City, is indeed stunning, but isn't it still just block-building gameplay? Relying solely on this gameplay, even if its popularity is high now, <em>Voyage</em> with its content might not necessarily lose!" Zhu Yi comforted himself internally.</p>
<p>However, three days later, Chen Xu once again released a video on the official Weibo account, completely shattering his illusion.</p>
<p>First two updates, the rest later.</p>
