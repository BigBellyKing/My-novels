                <p>Chapter 208: The Game is a Beta, So Are the Houses, Of Course! (Seventh Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>In the office, only Chen Xu and Qin Yi were present. Chen Xu closed the initial DEMO of Minecraft and then opened the previous Design concept document.
This section pertained to Minecraft's crafting and tech system.
Thanks to the technology of the Parallel World, content that was relatively difficult to achieve in his previous life could now be realized.
It could be directly integrated into the game itself, rather than being cleverly implemented through MODs.</p>
<p>For instance, similar to Redstone technology, various materials and tools could be assembled into parts and control units, combined with corresponding model casings, to make them functional within the game.
The most intuitive manifestation of this in the game was the ability to truly build vehicles, rather than just using Redstone to create minecarts with rails.
“But Mr. Chen, isn't this too complicated? Can players really handle this content?”
“And these simple parts and control units are quite limited. Isn't this Redstone technology too complex?” Qin Yi scratched his head, saying.
Just looking at it already made his scalp tingle.</p>
<p>“Don't underestimate players; their abilities are stronger than you imagine,” Chen Xu couldn't help but smile slightly upon hearing Qin Yi’s words.
“Furthermore, I'm not planning to dump everything on players all at once. We're developing this feature now, but the first version for players won't be released yet,” Chen Xu explained.
While rich in content, it shouldn't be thrown at players all at once, as if desperate to show them how abundant the content is.
It's like playing a game where you initially want to clear all the side quests, but upon opening the map at the start, you find the game developer telling you how incredibly difficult these quests are, because the map is dense with countless question marks.
This, instead, becomes a unique form of discouragement; intending to tell players how rich the game's content is, it ends up scaring them away.</p>
<p>Moreover, for Minecraft, the game doesn't rely solely on official new content. Instead, it's the countless players who love this game, collectively shaping its community environment, that have created its unique miracle and splendor.
Therefore, for Chen Xu, subsequent promotions and content disclosures were more about inspiring players, making them understand that "this is also possible," and then encouraging them to experiment.
With sand, cement, and rebar as raw materials ready,
as for what kind of buildings could ultimately be constructed,
that would be up to the players themselves.
Whether it's the MOD modules extending these functionalities or the core game content,
after all, 'creation' is the essence of Minecraft.</p>
<p>Minecraft's development was progressing very smoothly. There were no difficulties with the game's core content itself; after all, in his previous life, it was developed independently by an individual, so creating it presented no challenge whatsoever.
For Chen Xu, the main challenge was how to make it easier and more open for players to create MODs.
This aspect was also slowly being overcome through continuous testing.
By late November, Minecraft's content was largely complete, though still some distance from a truly finished game.
Chen Xu was also discussing with Zhang Yida's Operations team what kind of model to use for Minecraft's future promotion.
After all, unlike the previous Don't Starve, Minecraft's strategic position was entirely on par with Dark Souls.
However, it was still in the discussion phase, and it would be some time before it was truly finalized and promoted.
In the office, Chen Xu glanced at the time, shut down his computer, and walked out.
Arriving at the rest area, he saw a group of people gathered around, experiencing the Minecraft game.</p>
<p>“Haha, Sister Xin, is this your house? Haha!”
Ruan Ningxue burst into laughter among the crowd.
Then Qin Yi, Lin Tao, and others also guffawed, and the atmosphere was filled with cheer.
“Haha, Sister Xin, that’s amazing!”
“I only respect you, Sister Xin, not even the walls!”
Hearing the commotion, Chen Xu also went over for a look.
On the computer screen in front of Yang Xin, there was a house enclosed by wood, appearing as a massive cube from a distance. The most crucial part was that it was hermetically sealed, with just a single wooden door at the entrance and torches lining both sides for illumination.
Stepping inside the house, it was decorated in a log cabin style, very fitting for nature.
As for the interior layout, it clearly adopted a minimalist approach.
There was a crafting table, a storage chest, and a bed in the corner; besides these, there was nothing else.
Wait, on the walls on both sides of the room, there were also four torches each, fully adhering to the call for energy conservation and emission reduction.</p>
<p>Yang Xin, who had felt quite good about her house during its construction,
heard everyone's comments and then stepped out of the house herself. After circling it carefully twice, she immediately felt a bit indefensible.
The more she looked, the more she felt it resembled a matchbox house.
Coupled with those few candles, it had a distinct prison darkroom vibe.
The design was indeed a bit embarrassing.
Of course, while she thought so internally, she still appeared calm on the surface.
“How good can a house under construction be? It’s just like how we make games; the game I’m playing now is still an unfinished, test phase version, so naturally, my house is also a test version house!” Yang Xin confidently spun some logic, facing everyone's gazes.
Then, probably feeling her argument wasn't quite convincing enough, Yang Xin continued, “And honestly, my house isn't that bad. It doesn't leak in the rain, and it's not drafty in winter. While it might look a bit shabby, its strength lies in being sturdy and durable.”</p>
<p>Watching Yang Xin still trying to defend herself, Chen Xu, who had been silent beside them, finally couldn't resist interjecting: “To be fair, the test version of the game shouldn't take the blame for this! After all, this pot is truly too black.”
“Originally, my plan was for all of us to participate in building some structures for later use, to guide players in understanding some of the game's unique selling points. However, I think it'll be difficult for you to take on this task now.”
Chen Xu's original plan was for team members to collectively construct classic buildings and character sculptures.
For example, iconic structures from Dark Souls, such as Firelink Shrine and other distinctive elements.
Although Chen Xu could create a dedicated building tool for most of the work, there would still be many parts requiring manual construction.
This would then serve perfectly as part of the game's promotion.
However, looking at Yang Xin's building, which resembled a prison darkroom, Chen Xu felt that the number of employees participating in this construction project could probably be reduced by one.</p>
<p>“Ahem, so Mr. Chen, when will we launch the game?”
Listening to Chen Xu’s words and glancing at the 'dark room' on the computer, Yang Xin swiftly closed the game on her desktop, coincidentally clicking 'do not save,' then changed the subject and asked.
“There are still some contents to be added, but it’s almost done. However, unlike before, after New Year's Day, we will conduct a small-scale test, mainly to check player feedback and identify any experience-related flaws that need correction,” Chen Xu said after some thought.
