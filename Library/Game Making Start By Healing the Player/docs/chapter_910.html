                <p>Chapter 909: Stars and the Game World</p>
<p>For many players, a major feature of the Nebula Games Platform was its capacity.</p>
<p>Due to the unique metaverse community of Nebula World, its capacity was outrageously large compared to other platforms.</p>
<p>Although during this period, some game platforms also tried to do the same as Nebula Games, creating an exclusive meta-game community.</p>
<p>But after a vibrant start, most were gradually shelved.</p>
<p>The most important reason was that these game developers couldn't maintain stability like Nebula Games.</p>
<p>Not to mention third-party renowned IPs; unlike the guest appearance game culture of something like Super Smash Bros., creating such a meta-game community requires a massive number of IPs.</p>
<p>And owners of various famous IPs generally don't lack funds. You want character authorization for a game, fine, but helping you build a community to attract platform users? How can I assist with that?</p>
<p>Wouldn't that be like two armies fighting, and I send all my weapons and warhorses to you?</p>
<p>Even if you pay up, it's still a no-go! If we lose this war, wouldn't you just take all your money back?</p>
<p>So, for major developers, they mostly go their separate ways, but this created a big problem.</p>
<p>Initially, metaverse communities could rely on their own long-standing major IPs, but as time progressed, existing IP content couldn't generate anything new. While newly released IPs and games might be profitable in terms of sales,</p>
<p>They were still far from becoming signature IPs, not to mention the occasional Waterloo.</p>
<p>This is also why, with the gradual development of the gaming industry, major game developers tend to favor a "new plus old" combination, slowly building new IPs while initiating old IP remake plans to capitalize on players' nostalgia.</p>
<p>But Nebula Games was different; since its inception, from small games to large-scale games and then VR games, it had never failed.</p>
<p>Although its various games varied in popularity, each one could be considered a success.</p>
<p>Not to mention that almost every year, a super top-tier IP would emerge.</p>
<p>This also allowed Nebula World to bring players a sense of freshness and new content almost every time a new game was released under its banner.</p>
<p>This naturally ensured the continuous vitality of Nebula World.</p>
<p>However, the consequence was that the capacity of Nebula World was incredibly exaggerated.</p>
<p>Many players even specially expanded the storage space of their VR gaming pods.</p>
<p>Of course, Nebula World wasn't tied to the platform, and quite a few players weren't very interested in it, so they didn't download this extra content.</p>
<p>But now, that was different.</p>
<p>The Nebula Games 10th-anniversary celebration event was actually being held within Nebula World, which was incredibly tempting for many players who had played Nebula Games.</p>
<p>Thus, countless players who hadn't downloaded Nebula World rushed to do so, because the space was simply massive!</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>"Holy smokes, did they open up player online multiplayer? There are too many damn people!" Zhang Yi's eyes widened.</p>
<p>The celebration time hadn't arrived yet, but like most players, Zhang Yi and his group had come to Nebula World early.</p>
<p>But the sight that met their eyes took them by surprise.</p>
<p>Previously, all players in Nebula World spawned on their own small islands, much like the islands in Animal Crossing, which players could freely decorate.</p>
<p>As for online multiplayer content, players could only invite friends to join them, and strangers couldn't see each other's Nebula World.</p>
<p>But now, all players were in one massive world.</p>
<p>Countless stars filled the sky, and they stood on a vast and boundless desolate continent.</p>
<p>Players, whether they knew each other or not, communicated via microphones, creating a somewhat chaotic atmosphere.</p>
<p>'Isn't it a celebration? It feels a bit desolate, doesn't it?'</p>
<p>'Patience, the celebration Mr. Chen announced isn't for a while yet!'</p>
<p>'I wonder what this celebration event will be like? Damn, I'm a little excited!'</p>
<p>'Excited +1, but I'm more curious about what stunning scenes we'll see next.'</p>
<p>Countless players conversed among themselves.</p>
<p>On this desolate continent, while players could perform various actions, they couldn't attack; clearly, that content hadn't been implemented.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, many curious players had already picked a direction and were running forward, trying to see if there were any invisible walls or map boundaries.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi and his group weren't so bored, because with just a glance in the game, they couldn't see the end of the map, indicating an extremely vast game world.</p>
<p>If it were an open-world game like Vice City, considering various resources, the map might have an upper limit, or it could adopt a procedural generation map design like Minecraft.</p>
<p>But given the current resources, there was nothing but yellow dirt and star textures in the sky; even running for a week, they might not reach the map's edge.</p>
<p>So, Zhang Yi and his companions mostly strolled around, observing other players with diverse appearances. After all, everyone was dressed up in Nebula World, so there were all kinds of characters: Minotaurs, masked robbers, mages, knights. Previously, they couldn't interact with strangers online, but now they could see everything clearly.</p>
<p>Although there was nothing specific to do, with so many players gathered together, treating it like an online forum, time flew by quickly as players boasted and chatted.</p>
<p>At exactly 10 PM, screams and shouts suddenly erupted from the crowd.</p>
<p>'Up there! Look up!'</p>
<p>'Holy cow, the stars are falling!'</p>
<p>Zhang Yi and the newly met 'bro' he was boasting with also quickly looked up.</p>
<p>They saw that the starry sky, which Zhang Yi and the others had thought was merely a texture, was now filled with countless stars carrying streaks of fire, rapidly plummeting towards their continent.</p>
<p>As star after star crashed into the earth, the ground shook violently, and then brilliant beams of light burst forth from the impact points.</p>
<p>After the light faded, all the players discovered that the land they stood on, except for their immediate area, was shattered, and the surrounding space had become a primordial Chaos.</p>
<p>The original continental fragments now drifted in this Chaos, connected by faint lines of light.</p>
<p>'Look! It's Lothric Kingdom!'</p>
<p>Players hadn't yet recovered from this sudden change when one player exclaimed in astonishment.</p>
<p>Like a starting gun, more and more players noticed the changes.</p>
<p>'That's Mount Hyjal!'</p>
<p>'The Lands Between! Holy cow, that's the Erdtree!'</p>
<p>Sharp-eyed players saw the changes in each of the fragments drifting in the Chaos.</p>
<p>Grand structures and wondrous sights were displayed before the players.</p>
<p>All were scenes familiar to countless players.</p>
<p>The stars that had fallen from the sky earlier represented individual game worlds, and the fragmented continent nurtured those game worlds!</p>
<p>Many players, combining this with previous content from Nebula World, suddenly realized what was happening.</p>
