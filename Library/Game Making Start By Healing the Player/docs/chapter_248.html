<p>Chapter 247: First Hunt (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>As Zhang Yi finished his selection, Song Ren unmuted his mic in the voice channel.</p>
<p>Although they had agreed to mute their mics and experience the game individually earlier, at this moment, Song Ren clearly could no longer suppress his inner excitement. He hadn't even started experiencing the game's combat content yet, but from the appearance of Zorah Magdaros at the beginning to entering the New World, and the magnificent Astera Settlement, he was bursting with things to say. How could he keep it all in?</p>
<p>“Folks, what's your progress? Have you chosen your weapons?” Song Ren’s booming voice filled the voice channel.</p>
<p>Someone spoke up, and instantly others responded.</p>
<p>“Not yet! I’m still looking at the introductions, there are so many weapons in this game!” Joey replied.</p>
<p>At this moment, she, like Zhang Yi before her, was suffering from decision paralysis, mainly because <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> offered players an overwhelming number of weapons to choose from. Each one was incredibly unique. With <em>Dark Souls</em>, for example, even though there were various classes and different weapons for each class's early-game progression, such as the Knight's Long Sword or the Deprived's Small Club, their appearances… well, it was better not to mention them. But <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> was different; each weapon was like a class in itself, with appearances that were either imposing, cool, or elegant.</p>
<p>There were also corresponding move demonstration videos embedded in the game. Players could intuitively feel the characteristics of each weapon. For rookie players, whether watching or experiencing, every weapon felt incredibly powerful, unless they had a particular favorite. Otherwise, it was genuinely hard to choose.</p>
<p>Following Joey’s words, Wang Yifan and Wang Han also agreed.</p>
<p>“Yeah! I feel like I want every single weapon!”</p>
<p>“But even though it’s a demo version, I feel like we should get familiar with one weapon first, and then our squad will be set for the official version!”</p>
<p>The few of them were very torn, completely unsure which weapon to choose.</p>
<p>At this moment, Old Song, who was the first to unmute his mic, spoke up.</p>
<p>“Why even think about it? Long Sword! What a cool weapon! And look at the beginning of the promotional video, those Wingdrakes carrying the three Longsword Heroes to assist the Hunter who got defeated by an Anjanath—what does that tell you? It means most Hunters play with the Long Sword, so it must be strong!”</p>
<p>“And the Long Sword is especially cool! Foresight Slash like the wind, spinning thrust; Helm Breaker, one slice, two halves; skillful turn, confident sheath—it’s truly so cool it's mind-blowing; a single person with a Long Sword is a magnificent performance!” Song Ren’s voice suddenly deepened slightly. Because at this moment, in his mind, just like Zhang Yi earlier, he had mentally pictured the magnificent scenes of the Long Sword in the upcoming battles. Just like the Hunter demonstrating in the video while watching the weapon introduction. Two words: invincible!</p>
<p>Before Wang Han and the others could respond, Zhang Yi was displeased. He had chosen the Great Sword, after all! While he admitted that in terms of coolness, the Long Sword might indeed be a cut above, he couldn’t stand for his Great Sword being belittled!</p>
<p>“Old Song, don’t talk nonsense! The three Longsword Heroes in that promotional video are clearly just sidekicks, and the Great Sword is the sole protagonist. What's the Research Team Leader in the cutscene carrying on his back? And where did the Great Sword get defeated? He’s leisurely and carefree roasting meat! He's just calling his underlings over to see the world!”</p>
<p>“Listen to me! The Great Sword is invincible! Small blade 50, great blade 100, comes with hyper armor and powerful charge attack. One Great Sword is a legend of the New World!” Zhang Yi strongly hyped up the Great Sword.</p>
<p>Here, Song Ren and Zhang Yi were embroiled in a debate over whether the Great Sword or the Long Sword was superior.</p>
<p>In the voice channel, Wang Han and the others ignored the two comic duo and quickly made their decisions.</p>
<p>“I’ll stick with the Bow. I feel like it should be very safe to fight with, and it’s very cool. Arc Shot, Power Shot, Dragon Piercer, each step solid and steady, each arrow from the string pierces the heart!” Wang Yifan made her choice.</p>
<p>“I’ll play Dual Blades. That Demon Mode looks really formidable, and I saw in the video that you can even spin around on the monster’s back! Red demon, blossoming like a flower, leaves no one within ten steps!” Joey thought for a long time before finally locking her weapon onto the Dual Blades.</p>
<p>“I think the Hammer is pretty good. Don’t let its weight fool you; I feel like it’s quite fast and agile when you’re moving around with it. And spinning like a top on flat ground, jumping like a fire wheel on slopes, charging up for a headshot in one go!”</p>
<p>Wang Han looked at the Great Hammer, and the demonstration from the video just now flashed in her mind: a Hunter wielding a Great Hammer directly bashed in the Anjanath’s head in the promotional video. It was unparalleled violence, so she decided on the Great Hammer!</p>
<p>As the three of them had confirmed their weapons, the argument between the Long Sword and Great Sword about who was number one was still ongoing.</p>
<p>“Stop arguing, everyone. Although the demo version doesn’t have online multiplayer yet, once the official version comes out and we team up to hunt monsters, won’t we see which weapon is more powerful?” Wang Han interrupted Song Ren and Zhang Yi’s debate.</p>
<p>After bickering a bit more in the voice channel, Zhang Yi also muted his mic, his heart full of excitement as he looked at the Great Sword on his Hunter’s back in the game.</p>
<p>It was time to get some practice and verify his ideas through actual combat!</p>
<p>Zhang Yi took the cable car to the dining areas on the second floor. After a conversation with the bun-haired receptionist, who was also his companion, he successfully received his first quest in his Hunter's career – Great Jagras and the Ancient Forest. The quest requirements didn’t seem difficult; he only needed to kill 7 Great Jagras. The time limit was also very generous, a full 50 minutes, which, rounding up, was almost an hour.</p>
<p>Additionally, the receptionist also introduced other related content. For example, before starting the hunt, he could have a good meal. Food prepared by the Palico Chef could increase various stats. At the dining table, Zhang Yi enjoyed a gourmet feast. Unlike his previous life, where Felyne Canteen meals were basically just a few ingredients used repeatedly, Chen Xu had thoughtfully visually optimized the Felyne Canteen meals' presentation. Each Felyne Canteen meal, composed of different ingredients, had its own unique corresponding presentation. Coupled with the high-definition modeling, watching the in-game character heartily eat the delicious Felyne Canteen meal made Zhang Yi himself feel a bit hungry.</p>
<p>Soon, after eating and drinking his fill.</p>
<p>Accompanied by a Wingdrake that flew in from somewhere, the Hunter grabbed its leg and flew into the clouds. After about two or three seconds, passing through the clouds, the Wingdrake brought him to the expedition camp in the Ancient Forest. Here, the receptionist and the Research Team Leader were already waiting. After a brief conversation, the receptionist stayed in the camp, while the action quest required him to move with the Research Team Leader. Following the guidance, Zhang Yi took some complimentary supplies from the item box nearby. He then followed the Research Team Leader and began his first hunting journey.</p>
