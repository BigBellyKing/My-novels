                <p>Chapter 594: The Last of Us (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>After the New Year, core employees from various departments successively onboarded, and the development of The Last of Us was already underway.</p>
<p>However, compared to the buzz surrounding Chen Xu's new game, the topic had completely cooled down.</p>
<p>This was mainly because, during this period, major game developers had successively announced news of their new titles.</p>
<p>And compared to the three keywords Chen Xu had only revealed before the New Year, the content showcased by these game developers was clearly more substantial.</p>
<p>Among them, FOW's Wasteland 1981 garnered the most attention.</p>
<p>On various domestic and international gaming websites, as well as relevant media channels, related game content was frequently being released, though, of course, there were no explosive actual gameplay demonstrations.</p>
<p>More often, it was concept art, a short CG, and grand promises about gameplay.</p>
<p>However, it was enough to excite players.</p>
<p>“Feels like the sequel's flavor is just as authentic!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, and it seems there's a companion now, a new dog added? Just wonder what the actual game experience will be like!”</p>
<p>“As for the story, I don't think it'll be bad, given the foundation of the previous installment.”</p>
<p>“But speaking of the protagonist's motorcycle, what happened to it? Is it broken? Did they add a motorcycle repair mechanic in the new game?”</p>
<p>As game content was disclosed, many players expressed anticipation upon seeing it.</p>
<p>Although open-world games weren't as sought-after as they were during the time of Red Dead Redemption and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, this type of game remained very popular among players.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>As time slowly progressed, the information released by FOW became more impactful and attractive.</p>
<p>The character concept art for Alex in Wasteland 1981 showed him more mature than in the first game, with an added scar on his face, a remnant from the previous installment's story.</p>
<p>Beyond that, more rich and diverse gameplay elements were gradually unveiled.</p>
<p>For example, players could repair and later modify their motorcycle.</p>
<p>This would be the player's primary mode of transport, much like horses in Red Dead Redemption and Roach in The Witcher: Wild Hunt.</p>
<p>He would also have a new companion: a dog, no longer just the motorcycle for company.</p>
<p>FOW continued to release one piece of game-related content and data after another.</p>
<p>The players' excitement and enthusiasm soared.</p>
<p>Alex and Grayson were both very happy.</p>
<p>Everything was progressing in a positive direction.</p>
<p>Until one day in mid-March, Nebula Games and Chen Xu made their move.</p>
<p>On the official Weibo accounts of Nebula Games and Chen Xu, there was simply one sentence:</p>
<p>'The Last of Us'</p>
<p>Along with it, a video attachment.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>This Weibo post instantly sent players into a frenzy, and Grayson and Alex were equally stunned.</p>
<p>What about the rumored Resident Evil sequel or horror game?</p>
<p>What was this 'The Last of Us' all about?</p>
<p>Looking at Chen Xu's official Weibo, many fell into confusion.</p>
<p>Because this was completely different from what they had imagined!</p>
<p>For so long, various media speculations and player discussions had led everyone to subconsciously believe that Nebula Games' new title would be a Resident Evil sequel.</p>
<p>Even though Chen Xu and Nebula Games had never confirmed it.</p>
<p>So upon seeing the title 'The Last of Us', they were so surprised.</p>
<p>It wasn't what they expected!</p>
<p>However, after a brief moment of surprise, most people's curiosity shifted to the game itself.</p>
<p>What kind of game was this exactly? A horror game? Or a survival game?</p>
<p>The Last of Us – did it mean only the player was left in the entire world, surviving in a post-disaster setting?</p>
<p>But that didn't quite fit, as Chen Xu had previously mentioned 'bonds'.</p>
<p>Innumerable players connected Chen Xu's past announcements with the game's title, drawing all sorts of associations.</p>
<p>Of course, thoughts were thoughts, but they immediately clicked on the video.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>As always, the Nebula Games LOGO appeared, and after it passed, the video went into a brief black screen.</p>
<p>Then, a post-disaster world appeared before all the players.</p>
<p>However, to every player's astonishment, the so-called post-disaster world was not what they had imagined.</p>
<p>A hell on earth, filled with blood and corpses, a ruined apocalypse with burning and exploding cars everywhere?</p>
<p>No, quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Green vegetation covered the towering buildings, and the distant sun slowly set.</p>
<p>Even in the steel-encased post-disaster city, small animals could be seen, a natural beauty.</p>
<p>But before players could fully appreciate the scenery, the scene abruptly shifted to an Quarantine Zone.</p>
<p>Ragamuffin ordinary people lined up for aid, while heavily armed soldiers stood guard.</p>
<p>A little girl's narration began.</p>
<p>'Choices are never easy, are they?'</p>
<p>'When to wake up, where to linger... what to wear... where to go...'</p>
<p>'But now, it's different.'</p>
<p>The scene of the Quarantine Zone slowly distorted, and in the next second, it transformed into a modern city before the disaster.</p>
<p>It was bustling, people laughed as they walked the streets.</p>
<p>Before players could react, time seemed to freeze.</p>
<p>Like a shattered mirror, the video's image cracked and broke, once again showing shouting crowds, explosions, and screams.</p>
<p>The entire city street fell into chaos.</p>
<p>Disaster had struck.</p>
<p>'Can you tell if the person in front of you is a friend or foe?'</p>
<p>'Can you kill without mercy?'</p>
<p>'Are you ruthless enough?'</p>
<p>The camera moved into a cramped room, where a burly man shielded a little girl behind him, shouting a warning at a zombie that had crashed through the glass, then shooting it dead.</p>
<p>'Do I need to remind you what's out there?'</p>
<p>In the dimly lit room, the man and the little girl huddled silently behind a wall. Through the shadows reflected by the sun, eerie, hunched creatures could be seen shambling forward, emitting chilling growls.</p>
<p>'I once had people I cared about very much.'</p>
<p>Dusk, in a lush forest, the man and the little girl slowly walked forward.</p>
<p>Looking at the path ahead, the little girl behind him skillfully cocked her pistol.</p>
<p>The two walked slowly forward, gradually disappearing with the game's slightly melancholic BGM.</p>
<p>What followed was a series of fragmented, rapid-cut scenes.</p>
<p>'We need to get her out!'</p>
<p>'Do I need to tell you what's out there?'</p>
<p>'This is our chance!'</p>
<p>'Enough, Tess, you're playing with fire!'</p>
<p>Hanging corpses in rooms, post-disaster raiders, and infected – every corner was fraught with deadly peril.</p>
<p>'What do we do now?'</p>
<p>'Don't waste a single bullet.'</p>
<p>Putting away the pistol, he stabbed a knife into an infected's head, and then the two sprinted through an abandoned mansion.</p>
<p>'It's not easy for us to survive in this world...'</p>
<p>'It's the same for him.'</p>
<p>They burst through a large door, seeing the world outside.</p>
<p>It wasn't the post-disaster scene they had imagined; there were no streets full of infected, no dead bodies everywhere.</p>
<p>Only a city overgrown with green plants and abandoned cars.</p>
<p>'Joel told me that this journey is either about surviving at all costs, or sticking to your morals.'</p>
<p>'Because today, that stuff has one use, and that is... to get you killed!'</p>
<p>Snow, cityscapes, forests, infected, raiders... scene after scene of the post-disaster world appeared in the video.</p>
<p>'But we've been through and sacrificed so much, it must mean something, right?'</p>
<p>With the little girl's final narration, the video abruptly ceased.</p>
<p>The Last of Us.</p>
<p>The game's LOGO appeared in the center of the screen.</p>
