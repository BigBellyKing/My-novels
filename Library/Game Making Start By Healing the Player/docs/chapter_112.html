                <h1>Chapter 112: One Life Per Person, You'll Be Sitting There All Day!</h1>
<p>As the release date drew nearer, Nebula Games' advertising investment in this area also became apparent.</p>
<p>On game media websites, there were various reports on the related <em>Dark Souls</em> special features.</p>
<p>Likewise, live streaming platforms and video platforms also had related <em>Dark Souls</em> events.</p>
<p>The most direct aspect, furthermore, was Nebula Games Platform's special offer for <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>A 69 Yuan discount coupon, exclusively for users on the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>It must be said, this kind of genuine benefit given to players with real money was quite effective at attracting users.</p>
<p>After the event was announced, Nebula Games gained approximately 150,000 new users.</p>
<p>And this number was continuously increasing.</p>
<p>Of course, for more players, the most direct point was that they could finally experience <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>On major game forums and communities, players discussing <em>Dark Souls</em> showed their joy in every word.</p>
<p>After such a long wait, they could finally Link the Fire!</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>In a residential community in the Imperial Capital, Zhang Yi and Wang Han were discussing their National Day holiday plans.</p>
<p>"How about going to Jiuhua Mountain?" Zhang Yi suggested.</p>
<p>"What's the point of Jiuhua Mountain? People go to Jiuhua Mountain to burn incense. Besides, can you even climb a mountain? Last year, you took the cable car the whole way up Huangshan and then complained about being tired after just a few steps on the remaining stairs." Wang Han rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>The two discussed several places in succession, then each found several flaws with them.</p>
<p>Either too tiring, or too crowded, or they heard it wasn't fun.</p>
<p>Finally, the two, with a tacit understanding, came up with a shared suggestion: "How about playing games? I heard Nebula Games' <em>Dark Souls</em> has launched."</p>
<p>"Good idea!" Also being someone who loves playing games, Wang Han agreed.</p>
<p>The main thing was that when traveling, there really weren't many good places to go.</p>
<p>Especially when thinking of major tourist attractions, coupled with a holiday like National Day, with crowds of people, how was that traveling for fun? Wasn't that just asking for trouble?</p>
<p>How great is it now?</p>
<p>Staying home, enjoying the air conditioning and eating ice cream, and experiencing the purest joy the game brings.</p>
<p>This is the life.</p>
<p>"Hey, the tag says 'difficult,' this game seems to be a rather difficult one!" As representatives of frugality, the two naturally chose the Nebula Games Platform, and upon entering the store interface, Wang Han noticed a characteristic.</p>
<p>That is, <em>Dark Souls</em> on the Nebula Games Platform had a total of four official tags: ARPG, dark fantasy, exploration adventure, and difficult.</p>
<p>Hearing Wang Han's words, Zhang Yi, who was scanning a QR code to pay, casually replied: "Who bothers with tags if they're a serious gamer? Don't worry about it, they're all just for show. And how hard can it really be? We both watched the online press conference before, so it's probably not that bad."</p>
<p>"Okay, bought it! Time to Link the Fire!" Zhang Yi stretched.</p>
<p>"But this game seems a bit troublesome if two people play it together." Wang Han said to Zhang Yi; Chen Xu had mentioned the game's multiplayer gameplay at the online press conference earlier.</p>
<p>"How about we both play on one save file using one computer? Whoever dies, the other takes over." Zhang Yi thought for a moment and said.</p>
<p>"Sounds good!" Wang Han agreed upon hearing this.</p>
<p>Life needs adjustments, and playing games together like this is quite nice.</p>
<p>The game's size was quite large, so after paying, the two chatted about irrelevant things while waiting for the game to download and install.</p>
<p>After the game was installed, the two entered the game.</p>
<p>As the game started, an old woman's voice also sounded as the screen appeared.</p>
<p>"Yes, this is Lothric..."</p>
<p>Familiar lines, familiar visuals.</p>
<p>Seeing this scene, Zhang Yi and Wang Han, sitting in front of the computer, blinked and complained.</p>
<p>"Isn't this just the promotional trailer from the exhibition?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, Nebula Games is really cutting corners."</p>
<p>However, despite complaining, the two didn't skip it, but watched it again.</p>
<p>Because the entire CGI cutscene was truly exquisitely made.</p>
<p>It cost a fortune, otherwise Chen Xu wouldn't have recycled it again to insert into the game.</p>
<p>After the cutscene finished playing, a character creation screen appeared, which didn't surprise Zhang Yi and Wang Han much.</p>
<p>After all, many ARPG games adopt this mode, allowing players to create their own character.</p>
<p>The character's name was very simple and easy to remember, simply "123".</p>
<p>Then came the various settings for character customization in the game.</p>
<p>Regarding the character customization task, Zhang Yi unhesitatingly took it upon himself.</p>
<p>"Hmm, for age, choose 'elderly'; after all, old ginger is spicier, and a mouth without hair cannot do things reliably, so add a bit of beard. Also, for hair, choose twin pigtails with silver color, 'old in body, young in heart.'"</p>
<p>"Change the eyes to squinting eyes, after all, squinting eyes are monsters. For the lips, add a touch of crimson to show a desire for slaughter."</p>
<p>After a series of operations on the character customization interface, a very peculiar-looking character appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>Wang Han next to him was silent for a moment: "I feel like you're asking for a beating!"</p>
<p>"Cough, cough, let's not talk about that. It looks like we can also choose a class and starting equipment. You decide." Zhang Yi coughed twice to change the subject.</p>
<p>"Let's go with Deprived. The stats feel very balanced, bucket-like (well-rounded) stats should be very strong. For burial gifts, let's choose this twig. The last one should be the strongest, right? And from the description, it seems like a time-limited transformation card that can make the character very powerful." Wang Han summarized based on her own gaming experience, then chose Deprived and a young white twig.</p>
<p>After everything was confirmed, there was a brief black screen, and then the game screen appeared.</p>
<p>The camera gradually zoomed in from afar, finally locking its view onto a desolate graveyard.</p>
<p>In the pile of graves, a coffin made a creaking sound.</p>
<p>A hand emerged from the coffin, and then the Deprived character '123' previously created in the character class selection interface slowly crawled out of the coffin.</p>
<p>At the same time, the game's UI interface also appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>In the center, the map name for the current area appeared — 'Cemetery of Ash'.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi looked at the UI layout in the game.</p>
<p>The bottom left displayed a small broken wooden shield, a broken wooden stick, and something called an Estus Flask. This should be the in-game item inventory.</p>
<p>The top left was the status bar, and as a gamer, Zhang Yi could pretty much deduce its functions.</p>
<p>The red one should be the health bar, the blue one the mana bar, and the green one should be the so-called stamina bar.</p>
<p>Most ARPG and ACT type games basically have this kind of interface layout; there was nothing to be surprised about.</p>
<p>Moreover, this was considered basic common knowledge widely recognized by players.</p>
<p>Basically, no developer would be so boring as to deliberately try to be unique and change it, saying something like, "I'm just going to swap the colors of the health bar and mana bar."</p>
<p>From a third-person perspective, Zhang Yi slowly moved the mouse, looking at the surrounding scenery.</p>
<p>A desolate and ruined graveyard, with white mist, like ash, permeating the air.</p>
<p>Thick clouds in the sky completely obscured the sun, and the gloomy, yet slightly luminous, dark tones gave off a very oppressive feeling.</p>
<p>"Stop being sentimental! Quickly, check how to operate. That red thing on the ground should be the in-game messages Chen Xu mentioned at the press conference. I'm waiting for you to die your first life so I can take over." Wang Han urged from beside him.</p>
<p>"Hmph! You underestimate me! Maybe you'll be sitting next to me for a whole day." Zhang Yi wouldn't admit defeat verbally, but his body honestly went to the in-game messages to interact.</p>
<p>(Daily request for recommendation votes, monthly passes...)</p>
