                <p>Chapter 626: A World Awaits (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>While the outside world was discussing the topic of World of Warcraft, Chen Xu wasn't idle. He was also working with the team on the content design for World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>The related class systems and so on were largely decided during the production of the relevant content in Nebula World.</p>
<p>However, compared to Nebula World, the full version would certainly be different.</p>
<p>The various races would no longer just be aesthetically pleasing; each would have unique racial talents and skills. This also included the design of dungeons, all of which needed to be created.</p>
<p>Besides this, there was another crucial point for Chen Xu: the adaptation of brainwave technology. World of Warcraft on Huanyu VR would have two operating modes.</p>
<p>One would be pure brainwave operation, similar to Detroit: Become Human and other games currently on the market. The other would be brainwave control combined with a physical controller.</p>
<p>From a convenience perspective, brainwave operation was indeed more convenient. However, even though World of Warcraft was an MMORPG, the release of skills and movement in the game required precision.</p>
<p>It could be said that a skill gap still existed between masters and ordinary players in World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>For true masters, the current brainwave operation technology still had subtle differences compared to pure nerve-driven muscle memory reactions. Just a few frames of detail could dictate the outcome of a battle.</p>
<p>Besides these, Chen Xu's focus was more on filling in the details of World of Warcraft's world exploration.</p>
<p>In his previous life, World of Warcraft was an epic game that ushered in a new era.</p>
<p>It could even be said that the rise of MMORPGs was solely due to the appearance of World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>The templates for MMORPGs, such as PVE dungeons and PVP, were essentially born from World of Warcraft, demonstrating its classic status.</p>
<p>However, it must also be said that due to the times, World of Warcraft also lacked many functions due to technical and related issues.</p>
<p>At the same time, the early versions of World of Warcraft were not so perfect in some detailed design concepts.</p>
<p>For example, Mists of Pandaria, while introducing excellent panda elements, had reputation quests that were utterly nauseating to complete.</p>
<p>But even then, World of Warcraft was still <em>that</em> Warcraft, until later when Blizzard's core team left, and the parent company began a series of missteps and rock-bottom performances, such as deleting terms like "green skin," fully demonstrating what it meant to go from god to bug. Later, a harassment scandal even erupted, directly kicking the game into the sewers.</p>
<p>In contrast to Warcraft's fall from grace, another game took the opposite path: FF14, or Final Fantasy XIV.</p>
<p>In its 1.0 version, this MMORPG was, perhaps an exaggeration to call it the worst in history, but it was certainly terrible.</p>
<p>It wasn't until Naoki Yoshida took over the mess that Final Fantasy XIV began its comeback, restarting its world and story directly from 2.0. Finally, with the 5.0 expansion, 'Shadowbringers', it surpassed the continuously declining Warcraft for the first time, becoming the MMORPG expansion with the highest media scores and player subscriptions.</p>
<p>Besides these, there were many other aspects of the game that required changes.</p>
<p>For instance, the game's camera angles needed some changes compared to his previous life. After all, the experience in VR was completely different from on PC.</p>
<p>Additionally, new technologies could also bring more content.</p>
<p>While dungeons were Warcraft's biggest highlight, this didn't mean other areas weren't prominent.</p>
<p>For example, in terms of World of Warcraft's questlines, many classic quests were born in early versions: the touching 'Of Love and Family', the Battle for Darrowshire, and the 'Princess Must Die!' quest that involved a lot of running and getting tricked...</p>
<p>Chen Xu would restore all these quests, while some ordinary quests would be handed over to the regular team.</p>
<p>With familiarity with the lore and world-building of Azeroth, there shouldn't be too many problems in this area.</p>
<p>At the same time, leveling up and questlines were indispensable to World of Warcraft. However, considering that many players might prefer grinding monsters.</p>
<p>Chen Xu would also conduct repeated numerical tests with the team to ensure various benefits for players completing quests.</p>
<p>This included equipment with unique appearances and good stats.</p>
<p>Players would be encouraged to explore and complete quests, and this equipment would also have some collectible value. Furthermore, in the absence of complete sets and dungeon gear, these quest reward items could serve as excellent transitional equipment.</p>
<p>Besides this, there were also daily routines, which Chen Xu planned to hand over to some younger teams newly joined Nebula Games later on.</p>
<p>In the world of Azeroth, there were not only wars of heroes.</p>
<p>There were also many stories of ordinary people and common soldiers.</p>
<p>For example, on a weekly basis, players would receive a corresponding prompt.</p>
<p>NPCs would appear in certain areas, and their stories would be independent plotlines.</p>
<p>They would reward players with decent equipment for the current version.</p>
<p>But these NPCs wouldn't always be there; they would have their own dynamic status, meaning if you missed them, you missed them.</p>
<p>The main purpose was simply to better create an atmosphere of Azeroth for players.</p>
<p>Additionally, it would also provide a channel for AFK players to acquire transitional equipment for the current version when they returned to the game.</p>
<p>Of course, in the early stages, the experience would still primarily be story-driven.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding World of Warcraft's server mechanism, hundreds of thousands or even millions of players on the same server sounded incredibly cool and wonderful.</p>
<p>But putting aside whether the technology and hardware could achieve this, the game's map and environments wouldn't be able to handle it either.</p>
<p>Therefore, the game would still use a multi-server model. According to Chen Xu's plan, each server would support a maximum of 30,000 players.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the early stages of the game, instance sharding would be enabled to prevent situations where too many players in the same area meant there weren't enough monsters to go around.</p>
<p>While kill stealing could be considered a feature, it also depended on the situation.</p>
<p>Ten or dozens of people competing for one monster created a great atmosphere.</p>
<p>But if hundreds of people were fighting over a single kobold, that would be utterly frustrating.</p>
<p>All these settings were designed to ensure players had the most immersive experience in the game.</p>
<p>Just like World of Warcraft's promotional slogan when it launched in his previous life: 'A World Awaits'.</p>
<p>Of course, although much of the content had been planned long in advance.</p>
<p>Even with Nebula Games' current capabilities, the development of World of Warcraft was still a substantial undertaking.</p>
<p>So, to help the excited players get through this difficult waiting period.</p>
<p>Chen Xu still made many preparations.</p>
<p>That was to make CGs.</p>
<p>If the game couldn't be made quickly, surely a CG could be made? Don't worry, it would be plentiful!</p>
<p>And so, amidst the excited gazes of countless players unaware of the development progress, World of Warcraft's second promotional CG made its debut.</p>
<p>And it was a character countless Warcraft players were most familiar with.</p>
