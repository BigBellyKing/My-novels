                <p>Chapter 4: Helper</p>
<p>Hearing Ruan Ningxue's words, Chen Xu couldn't help but blush.</p>
<p>However, in an instant, Chen Xu regained his composure, let out a light cough to dissolve the awkward atmosphere, and then started thinking of excuses.</p>
<p>“Well, there are multiple reasons for this…”</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue, sitting across the table, couldn't help but curl her lips.</p>
<p>Men's mouths, deceitful devils!</p>
<p>“But I can accept all the conditions you mentioned, though I also have a requirement!”</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue said, looking at Chen Xu with a beaming smile.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Chen Xu was taken aback.</p>
<p>He was still wondering how to persuade her.</p>
<p>When he first approached her, Chen Xu wasn't very confident; he just wanted to give it a try.</p>
<p>After all, he knew his own situation. Paying money?</p>
<p>He definitely couldn't do that now. If he did, there'd be no way to make the subsequent game.</p>
<p>After all, some essential resources still needed to be purchased.</p>
<p>Relying on their junior-senior relationship?</p>
<p>But she wasn't anyone related to him, nor was she obligated to help. Besides, it looked suspiciously like making grand promises.</p>
<p>But now, there's a chance?</p>
<p>“What's your requirement, Senior Sister?” Chen Xu asked Ruan Ningxue.</p>
<p>“One month’s time, and if your game’s sales are poor afterward, you’ll have to come work for me!”</p>
<p>“At least sign two contracts! Of course, in terms of compensation, I definitely won't think of freeloading your labor like you, Junior Brother.”</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue said with a smile.</p>
<p>Hearing Ruan Ningxue’s words, Chen Xu froze for a moment, then came back to his senses.</p>
<p>Regarding doujinshi, Chen Xu didn't have too many thoughts. After all, in his previous life, there were quite a few female doujinshi artists.</p>
<p>For example, 'Yuzuki N,' 'Nishizawa 5,' ahem... actually, Chen Xu didn't know any of these artists or their works, let alone seen them; he’d only heard about them from friends.</p>
<p>“What kind of sales would be considered poor?” Chen Xu asked Ruan Ningxue, having regained his composure.</p>
<p>If she were to say several million copies, Chen Xu really wouldn't have much confidence.</p>
<p>After all, this was a Parallel World, vastly different from the gaming environment of his previous life.</p>
<p>Even without the piracy factor, the market itself was different from his previous life.</p>
<p>Without capital for promotion and operation, relying solely on spontaneous player recommendations would be incredibly difficult.</p>
<p>Even highly praised Independent Games from his previous life, which sold millions or even tens of millions of copies, upon closer inspection, many only became popular half a year or a year later.</p>
<p>They were obscure at first.</p>
<p>Even strong titles like The Binding of Isaac were largely unknown in their early stages.</p>
<p>After all, even good wine fears a deep alley.</p>
<p>So, if Ruan Ningxue were to say one million sales, Chen Xu felt he'd rather go it alone.</p>
<p>Because if he agreed, with the game he was currently planning to make, there was a high probability he would end up as a doujinshi artist.</p>
<p>“Eh… 100,000, um, 50,000 is fine!”</p>
<p>“If sales don't exceed 50,000 within one month after release, then you lose!”</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue took out her phone, seemingly sending a message.</p>
<p>After about a minute, Ruan Ningxue looked up and stated a number.</p>
<p>Hearing Ruan Ningxue’s words, Chen Xu couldn't help but flash a confident smile.</p>
<p>50,000 sales in one month?</p>
<p>Although the game environment was slightly different from his previous life, and he didn't have much startup capital at hand.</p>
<p>Chen Xu could only say that this number was an absolute freebie.</p>
<p>“No problem.” Chen Xu agreed straightforwardly.</p>
<p>“Then, Senior Sister, let’s officially start tomorrow! I’ll go back to prepare first; see you tomorrow morning!”</p>
<p>With that, he bid Ruan Ningxue farewell, not giving her time to react.</p>
<p>Chen Xu turned and left the coffee shop.</p>
<p>Leaving Ruan Ningxue a little stunned.</p>
<p>Did I… say too little?</p>
<p>Thinking this, Ruan Ningxue quickly opened her contacts, found a phone number, and dialed it.</p>
<p>Two seconds later, the call connected.</p>
<p>“Sister Xin, you didn’t lie to me just now, did you? Are 50,000 sales in one month really high sales?” Ruan Ningxue felt a little puzzled, recalling Chen Xu's confident demeanor.</p>
<p>A clear female voice came from the phone: “Not high, no, but it’s relative. You asked how many sales would be considered high if someone was making a game for the first time with little money, right?”</p>
<p>“No money, first time making a game, and hardly any engine resources available to a Game Designer—this is literally a hell-difficulty start. 50,000 sales is an S-tier difficulty; a few thousand sales in a month would barely be a pass.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Ruan Ningxue was half-believing, half-doubting.</p>
<p>“Of course it’s true, this is the judgment of a professional Gaming Industry Professional!”</p>
<p>“By the way, Xiaoxue, are you planning to make a game? Have you thought it through? I told you, if you come help me with concept art design and character portraits, we can definitely achieve a great career!”</p>
<p>Yang Xin on the other end of the phone sounded extremely excited.</p>
<p>“Sister Xin, Sister Xin? What did you say? My signal is bad here; let’s talk later!”</p>
<p>Hearing the excited voice on the other end, Ruan Ningxue's expression subtly changed. She held the phone further away, said a couple of sentences, hung up, and then let out a long breath.</p>
<p>Then, thinking of what Yang Xin said on the phone, Ruan Ningxue couldn't help but smile.</p>
<p>First time making a game, no money, hell-tier difficulty—Chen Xu had all the labels applied.</p>
<p>So, her assistant problem was finally solved!</p>
<p>The only regret was that this assistant wouldn't officially start work for another two months.</p>
<p>After bidding farewell to Ruan Ningxue, Chen Xu returned to his apartment.</p>
<p>After briefly tidying up the room, Chen Xu sat in front of his laptop.</p>
<p>As a development machine, the computer's specifications were average, at least sufficient for the Mirror (Game) project.</p>
<p>Of course, Chen Xu couldn't develop larger games at all right now.</p>
<p>Because he simply had no money, and the resource permissions for the official engine were insufficient.</p>
<p>As for resource permissions, there were essentially two ways to increase them.</p>
<p>The first was to become an officially certified Game Designer and get promoted in terms of Job Title.</p>
<p>As for how to get promoted?</p>
<p>Game sales and awards received were all points that could be included in the evaluation.</p>
<p>The second was much simpler and more direct: just use Money Power. How many resources you could use depended on how strong your Money Power was.</p>
<p>However, these things were completely unimportant to Chen Xu at the moment.</p>
<p>And a game like Mirror (Game) wouldn't require much.</p>
<p>At least the resources Chen Xu could currently use were definitely sufficient.</p>
<p>Sitting in front of the computer, Chen Xu worked on the initial draft for Mirror (Game), which was the Game Design Document.</p>
<p>Although Chen Xu was the only developer, Ruan Ningxue was only doing illustrations.</p>
<p>But that didn't mean design concept drafts weren't needed.</p>
<p>Just like an outline for an essay, it could greatly improve efficiency.</p>
