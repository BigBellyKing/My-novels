                <p>Chapter 225: Freedom is the Core (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Whether it was private servers, Single-Player Mode, or the official servers, all were filled with incredibly excited players.</p>
<p>Without exception, all players who had visited the structures Chen Xu placed on the display server immediately entered <em>Minecraft</em> with an excited heart, ready to show off their skills and build the structures they had envisioned in their minds.</p>
<p>In Nebula Games' office, despite it being the Spring Festival, the importance of <em>Minecraft</em> to the development of the Nebula Games Platform was taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Therefore, Chen Xu had previously discussed working overtime during the Spring Festival with his team, though not excessively.</p>
<p>The main task was to manage various content during the Spring Festival. Employees residing in Modu who were on duty during the holiday would work in the office, while non-local employees could go home for the Spring Festival and work remotely.</p>
<p>Naturally, a comprehensive welfare plan was in place. Coupled with the year-end bonuses just distributed before the New Year, quite a few people were willing to stay and work overtime.</p>
<p>In fact, the number of willing individuals exceeded Chen Xu's expectations, necessitating a lottery selection. Of course, this was mainly due to the generous overtime pay and various benefits.</p>
<p>As Chen Xu walked out of the office, Yang Xin excitedly approached him, with Qin Yi, Lin Tao, and others also present.</p>
<p>Everyone lived in Modu, and they were all beaming with excitement.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen! Sales have already surpassed 3 million! Judging by today's trend, it's very likely to break 4 million!" Yang Xin exclaimed excitedly.</p>
<p>The rest, including Qin Yi, were also full of excitement.</p>
<p>"Hmm, keep an eye on the servers. The backup servers can also be activated," Chen Xu nodded, acknowledging the information and informing Qin Yi and the others.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, aren't you excited?" Yang Xin looked at Chen Xu, a little bewildered. Qin Yi and the others beside him were also puzzled.</p>
<p>First-day sales could reach 4 million!</p>
<p>This was definitely a shocking figure in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Although <em>Minecraft</em>'s price offered a significant advantage compared to big titles, the sales were genuine.</p>
<p>It might even challenge for ten million sales in the first week.</p>
<p>"Don't forget, <em>Minecraft</em> opened for pre-order a month in advance, and this is just the beginning. There's no need to be overly excited, and the overseas version hasn't even launched yet," Chen Xu said calmly.</p>
<p>The previous videos of Along the River During the Qingming Festival and the Forbidden City had played a good promotional effect.</p>
<p>Coupled with Nebula Games' consistent reputation, <em>Minecraft</em> only reached its current seemingly formidable stage by combining first-day sales with pre-order sales.</p>
<p>But Chen Xu knew that this was actually just the beginning.</p>
<p>These videos merely showcased the game's potential. To truly experience the fun and charm of the game, players needed to fully participate. This was a highly replayable game that only got better the more you played it.</p>
<p>At this stage, it could only be said to have gotten off to a good start. Even now, the current Workshop only contained the few building complexes MODs that Chen Xu had uploaded.</p>
<p>At the same time, Chen Xu had also made some settings regarding MODs.</p>
<p>That was to protect the rights of MOD authors.</p>
<p>For example, MOD authors could set whether subsequent players could modify their original MODs.</p>
<p>If Player A built a castle, but Player B merely modified a few things on it and then claimed it as their own MOD, this situation would be restrained.</p>
<p>After players created a corresponding structure, they could set whether other players could perform secondary creation after it was uploaded.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for the <em>Minecraft</em> community, Chen Xu specifically established a department to maintain the community.</p>
<p>In his previous life, the reason <em>Minecraft</em> became so popular was inseparable from its excellent community environment.</p>
<p>After discussing the current situation of <em>Minecraft</em> with Qin Yi and the others, Chen Xu returned to his office and opened <em>Minecraft</em>'s management backend to check the game's relevant data.</p>
<p>Currently, the official servers primarily offered three modes:</p>
<p>Survival, Creative, and Showcase.</p>
<p>The Showcase mode was where servers containing building complexes like Along the River During the Qingming Festival and the Forbidden City were stored, allowing players to freely visit them.</p>
<p>As for Survival, it was a large server capable of accommodating 2,000 players. In this mode, there were no strict rules; everything depended on the players' own development.</p>
<p>The entire game world was a super large map, and the map's appearance was randomly generated.</p>
<p>Players in the game were also randomly assigned spawn points on the map.</p>
<p>Of course, there would be many other players around each player.</p>
<p>After all, it was a multiplayer mode. If players started with nothing and only encountered others after developing to a certain extent, there would be no need for a multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>So, generally, in the early stage, players would usually encounter other players while collecting resources.</p>
<p>At this point, whether to huddle together for warmth, be mutually hostile, or develop individually was up to the players' choice.</p>
<p>Chen Xu and Nebula Games would not interfere with this.</p>
<p>Of course, with a server capacity of 2,000 players as the upper limit, some players would inevitably leave in the end.</p>
<p>However, in the plan, if just one-tenth of the players remained, it would be entirely sufficient for a server's ecological environment.</p>
<p>Besides these rule-unrestricted servers, there were also servers specifically designed for players who enjoyed building houses and peaceful construction.</p>
<p>In these servers, players could not attack each other, though the monster setting was still retained.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to prevent troublemaking players/griefers from destroying others' home bases, players in peaceful mode servers could set their structures to be indestructible by others. They also had a skill to save their buildings at a specific point in time, essentially a save function.</p>
<p>This could be used infinitely in peaceful mode. In normal multiplayer mode, however, there was a cooldown time, and structures were not indestructible. Instead, depending on the materials used, they would have a special durability. Other players wanting to dismantle them would require specific tools, and the process would be relatively slow.</p>
<p>Additionally, regardless of the mode, players could save their in-game data as a save file and transfer it to the single-player Survival mode, though this was a one-way transfer.</p>
<p>In his previous life, these gameplay elements existed but were limited to private community servers. Chen Xu estimated that some players would like these settings, while others would not.</p>
<p>But it didn't matter, because the core of <em>Minecraft</em> itself lay in freedom.</p>
<p>You couldn't say which mode was the true gameplay of <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there were plans for some mini-games later on, but Chen Xu did not intend to release this content through official channels.</p>
<p>After all, the early stage relied on official guidance, while the later stage would depend more on the power of the player community.</p>
<p>Of course, Chen Xu wasn't unprepared. If all else failed, he could always use a private account and pretend to be an ordinary MOD creator to publish them!</p>
