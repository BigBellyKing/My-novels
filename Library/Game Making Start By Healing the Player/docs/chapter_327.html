<p>Chapter 326: Early Launch, Striking First (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>As more and more information about <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> and <em>Storm Action</em> was revealed.</p>
<p>Online discussions about these two games grew increasingly heated.</p>
<p>Even in the later stages, Nebula Games itself didn't do much in the way of warm-up promotion, yet major gaming media both domestically and internationally were reporting on them frantically.</p>
<p>This was primarily because, for both players and game designers, <em>Storm Action</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> were among the first batch of New Era VR games.</p>
<p>Furthermore, both Nebula Games and atrai were industry-renowned game developers.</p>
<p>Naturally, they garnered a lot of attention.</p>
<p>However, regarding the actual content of the games, players were still relatively unclear.</p>
<p>On the <em>Storm Action</em> side, atrai had already released a good deal of information.</p>
<p>It could basically be confirmed as a game that advanced both single-player and multiplayer modes simultaneously.</p>
<p>However, <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> had not yet released much information.</p>
<p>Because of this, many anxious players were @-mentioning Chen Xu on the official Weibo account.</p>
<p>Hoping to get some answers.</p>
<p>Originally, this was just a way and channel to relieve stress.</p>
<p>However, many players didn't expect to actually receive a reply from Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Chen Xu's reply on the official Weibo account was very simple.</p>
<p>'Plot + multiplayer, and in terms of plot presentation, it will definitely leave a deep impression on players.'</p>
<p>Seeing Chen Xu's reply.</p>
<p>Many players were also surprised.</p>
<p>Although there wasn't much explanation regarding the gameplay.</p>
<p>However, in terms of game content, Chen Xu had already revealed quite a bit.</p>
<p>Like <em>Storm Action</em>, <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> featured both multiplayer and single-player story modes.</p>
<p>The only thing that concerned players was Chen Xu's later remarks.</p>
<p>According to Chen Xu, did he feel very confident about the plot?</p>
<p>Otherwise, why would he emphasize it like that?</p>
<p>This made many players look forward to it, while others were skeptical.</p>
<p>After all, Nebula Games had grown to such a scale that it had many die-hard fans.</p>
<p>But atrai also had many die-hard fans, and <em>Storm Action</em> itself was a major IP, so it had a considerable potential audience.</p>
<p>'If you're talking about gameplay, I think <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> might actually compete, but when it comes to plot, just forget about it.'</p>
<p>'Exactly, <em>Storm Action</em> is at least a blockbuster hit movie, and this time the game's plot also involves the original screenwriting team. <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> should just take a break.'</p>
<p>'From what I've seen in the promotional videos, the graphics and grand scenes are indeed stunning, but the plot of an FPS game isn't determined solely by graphics and grand scenes.'</p>
<p>'Exactly!'</p>
<p>Players supporting Nebula Games and those skeptical of it were engaged in a heated online argument.</p>
<p>However, at this very moment, Nebula Games released a major announcement.</p>
<p>Namely, <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> would be divided into a trilogy, successively launched on June 1st, June 10th, and June 20th.</p>
<p>At the same time, the multiplayer mode would be unlocked on June 25th.</p>
<p>Each part would cost 366 Yuan, and players could also choose to pre-order the collection directly for 999 Yuan.</p>
<p>Players who purchased any single part could experience the multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>In other words, the multiplayer mode in <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> was considered a bonus included with each part of the trilogy, with no difference in content.</p>
<p>The only difference was the single-player campaign; if players weren't interested in the single-player campaign's story, they only needed to purchase one part.</p>
<p>This sales strategy left many players taken aback.</p>
<p>Looking at the total price of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, it was essentially the standard price for a VR blockbuster.</p>
<p>The price didn't surprise many players; they had already prepared themselves psychologically.</p>
<p>The truly surprising part was that <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> was actually being sold in three separate parts?</p>
<p>In response, Nebula Games' official channels and Chen Xu's official Weibo account provided an answer.</p>
<p>That is, the game process of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> was too long, so this decision was ultimately made.</p>
<p>This was certainly not a lie, because compared to <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> in his previous life.</p>
<p>Although Chen Xu hadn't made many changes to the plot, as the original plot from his previous life was already very classic.</p>
<p>However, in terms of level design, some scenes had been enriched with more content.</p>
<p>Enemy soldiers, as well as allied NPC soldiers, and to give the plot and player experience a more impactful feel, some maps were also perfectly revised, for example, Soap and Roach heading to a Russian military airport in the Tian Shan Mountains of Kazakhstan to recover a lost artificial satellite ACS module.</p>
<p>Thus, the overall progression was a bit longer than in his previous life.</p>
<p>Of course, there was another more important timing.</p>
<p>That was to strike first and gain the initiative.</p>
<p>The overall content was actually nearing its final stages and had undergone extensive testing.</p>
<p>However, it involved multiplayer content, Makarov's final level, and some fine-tuning of minor details.</p>
<p>The twenty days reserved were precisely for these tasks.</p>
<p>How important was it to strike first?</p>
<p>In some game's team fights, striking first could increase the win rate by 30%, or even more.</p>
<p>And in games, a well-timed release would also hold an advantage.</p>
<p>Here, one couldn't help but recall a game from his previous life that suffered greatly due to its release timing: <em>Titanfall 2</em>.</p>
<p>Although its utter failure wasn't purely due to timing; it also had to do with poor multiplayer balance and the Rotten Orange Platform's '14 points combined' system that drove countless players to despair.</p>
<p>However, being awkwardly sandwiched between <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Battlefield</em> still greatly impacted its sales.</p>
<p>Now, with <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> and <em>Storm Action</em> both being popular FPS games recently, an early release would definitely give them a decisive advantage.</p>
<p>It would be a waste not to take advantage of such a good deal!</p>
<p>As soon as this timing was announced, atrai and Howard Warsaw were completely bewildered.</p>
<p>Insidious!</p>
<p>Far too insidious!</p>
<p>What 'too substantial in scale'? As game developers themselves, how could they not know Nebula Games' little tricks!?</p>
<p>In an instant, both atrai and Howard Warsaw were exasperated.</p>
<p>But at the same time, there was also a wave of confusion.</p>
<p>That is, how could it be so fast!?</p>
<p>They had <em>Storm Action</em> on their side, with a movie as a reference!</p>
<p>Yet, even with that, their progress wouldn't reach mid-July at the earliest!</p>
<p>Do you Nebula Games developers just make games in a straight line, never taking detours?</p>
<p>At that moment, atrai only felt endless frustration.</p>
<p>Howard Warsaw, in particular, was feeling quite dejected.</p>
<p>Especially from atrai, strict orders had been given to complete <em>Storm Action</em> as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Seeing this order from above, Howard Warsaw only wanted to smash a breaching hammer from <em>Rainbow Six</em> on the heads of those in management.</p>
<p>Is this something you can rush just by saying 'faster'?</p>
<p>But Howard Warsaw also knew that atrai was getting anxious.</p>
<p>After this period of warm-up promotion, players' expectations for both games had reached their peak, and now <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> was striking first.</p>
<p>If the quality was poor, then there would naturally be nothing to say.</p>
<p>But if the quality was excellent, then this 'vacuum period' of time.</p>
<p>Would be enough to determine the victor.</p>
<p>By then, their <em>Storm Action</em> wouldn't even get to eat warm 'poop' (meaning they'd get nothing good).</p>
<p>Now Howard Warsaw could only lead all his employees to work overtime, while also praying that <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> would utterly fail.</p>
