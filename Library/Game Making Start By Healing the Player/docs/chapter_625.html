                <p>Chapter 624: Excited Players (Please Subscribe for Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Upon entering the Nebula World, Song Ren quickly discovered something different.</p>
<p>That was, the parchment Chloe had given him earlier now had a new icon.</p>
<p>It was a yellowed Azeroth map.</p>
<p>To the left of the map was Kalimdor, featuring Thunder Bluff, Orgrimmar...</p>
<p>To the right were the Eastern Kingdoms, with Stormwind, Ironforge...</p>
<p>And in the very center was a giant Maelstrom.</p>
<p>'Since the Alliance and Horde fought side-by-side to resist the invasion of the Burning Legion.'</p>
<p>'Four years have passed since then, and although Azeroth was successfully saved,'</p>
<p>'the fragile truce between the Alliance and Horde has long since vanished.'</p>
<p>'Now, the thunderous war drums echo once more, and war will ignite Azeroth…'</p>
<p>Accompanied by the slow narration, the scene before Song Ren's eyes gradually changed.</p>
<p>The original island transformed into icy mountains. Amidst the howling wind and snow, a Dwarf appeared in Song Ren's vision.</p>
<p>Song Ren was no stranger to Dwarves, as he had seen many in the Stormwind scenario within the Nebula World.</p>
<p>However, in this close-up shot, he couldn't help but chuckle.</p>
<p>This was because the nose on the Dwarf's large head was too prominent, occupying about one-sixth of his face.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the incredibly realistic visual effects also left Song Ren amazed.</p>
<p>Brown beard covered in ice shards, and the fine lines on his face were all clearly visible.</p>
<p>Yet, despite his astonishment, he knew this wasn't actual in-game footage.</p>
<p>Nebula Games had very honestly placed a disclaimer nearby: <em>Video footage does not represent actual in-game graphics.</em></p>
<p>Amidst the howling cold wind, the Dwarf twisted his neck, surveying his surroundings, and his camera perspective slowly zoomed out.</p>
<p>The Dwarf Hunter, rifle in hand, traversed the snowy plains with his pet brown bear, heading towards Ironforge.</p>
<p>The camera pulled back higher and higher amidst the swirling snow, revealing the magnificent sight of Ironforge before the players.</p>
<p>Nestled in the snow-capped mountains, one could vaguely discern through the blizzard that the entrance to Ironforge seemed to be grand and majestic, situated halfway up the mountain.</p>
<p>Next, as a gust of wind kicked up a flurry of snowflakes, obscuring the view.</p>
<p>The scene shifted to a tranquil forest.</p>
<p>A scantily clad Night Elf was inspecting a broken blade in her hand within the jungle.</p>
<p>But the next moment, seemingly hearing something, the Elf turned and sprinted into the distance.</p>
<p>Through the tranquil forest, across mountain streams, and over broken cliffs, the Elf finally transformed into a black leopard and charged forward.</p>
<p>In the next second, the scene shifted again, showing an Undead Warlock chanting spells and meteors continuously falling from the sky.</p>
<p>The meteors fell, transforming into a green Infernal that appeared behind the Warlock, emitting an earth-shattering roar.</p>
<p>A Tauren on Thunder Bluff.</p>
<p>Orc warriors before a war-torn fortress.</p>
<p>Human Mages defending against Infernals on the city walls.</p>
<p>A series of thrilling combat scenes showcased different races and classes.</p>
<p>The video concluded with a Tauren's totem slamming down.</p>
<p>The four large characters “World of Warcraft” and the Nebula Games LOGO appeared in the center of the screen.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>It didn't even take a full day.</p>
<p>Less than an hour after Chen Xu posted on the official Weibo account,</p>
<p>keywords like “World of Warcraft” and “Azeroth” had already topped the trending searches.</p>
<p>Regarding Warcraft, despite it being an old game returning after six years,</p>
<p>many players still remembered the associated memories to this day.</p>
<p>Moreover, after the Nebula World launched, although not all scenes from Warcraft were fully integrated, some nostalgic scenarios were added after Stormwind.</p>
<p>At the same time, the related dungeons and class gameplay styles had, in essence, already been in operation.</p>
<p>In addition, while Nebula Games hadn't focused all its energy on merchandise and crossovers, it hadn't neglected them either.</p>
<p>Therefore, Warcraft's fanbase wasn't solely comprised of Warcraft players.</p>
<p>It also included players who had encountered Warcraft culture through Nebula World or learned about it through various RPG maps.</p>
<p>Another factor was the exquisite promotional CG animation for this new World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>The visual impact of this promotional CG animation was truly overwhelming.</p>
<p>It even captivated some players new to the gaming industry.</p>
<p>As for the veteran players, they smiled knowingly, displaying nostalgic expressions.</p>
<p>Nebula Games Film Studio truly didn't forget its roots!</p>
<p>One must remember that Nebula Games was once jokingly called an animation company delayed by games by players.</p>
<p>In the comments section of Chen Xu's official Weibo post and on relevant forum websites, countless players expressed their inner excitement and curiosity through words.</p>
<p>'After six long years, Mr. Chen finally remembered Warcraft!'</p>
<p>'With this CG animation, Nebula Games is finally returning to its old trade!'</p>
<p>'But what does 'World of Warcraft' signify?'</p>
<p>'What about Arthas and Illidan's后续 stories? Why aren't they in the trailer?'</p>
<p>'But this promotional CG is absolutely amazing! It brought back that shocking feeling from back then!'</p>
<p>'+1, when I saw the CG animation of Arthas returning to Lordaeron and killing the old king, it absolutely stunned me. I never thought an RTS CG story animation could be so incredibly awesome!'</p>
<p>'Cough cough, stop talking about story animations, everyone. Is no one going to pay attention to what type of game World of Warcraft actually is?'</p>
<p>'There's no point in paying attention, Mr. Chen only released a promotional video, and besides the background narration and race showcases, there's nothing else.'</p>
<p>While excited, the content displayed in the game also sparked curiosity among many players.</p>
<p>In fact, Nebula Games had not yet revealed any of the game's true content.</p>
<p>And the various characters appearing in the game were basically just the races and classes that had previously appeared in Warcraft and Nebula World.</p>
<p>For example, the Dwarf with his brown bear companion at the beginning, the Night Elf who could transform into a black leopard later, and the Undead Warlock who summoned an Infernal, as well as Tauren, Mages, and so on.</p>
<p>Popular characters familiar to players, such as Illidan, Tyrande, and Arthas, did not appear, and not much of the story was revealed.</p>
<p>It could only be inferred from the promotional CG animation:</p>
<p>Four years have passed since the Alliance and Horde jointly resisted the Burning Legion's invasion of Azeroth.</p>
<p>And the relationship between the Alliance and Horde had become fragile.</p>
<p>So, it was evident that conflict was brewing, and war was imminent.</p>
<p>The new game's storyline should revolve around the conflict between the Horde and the Alliance.</p>
<p>It was precisely this that left many players curious and puzzled.</p>
<p>What kind of game would World of Warcraft be?</p>
<p>First, RTS could be ruled out.</p>
<p>Because neither its performance in Nebula World nor the promotional video suggested it was an RTS game.</p>
<p>'Do you think it could be an ARPG? Doesn't the Stormwind performance in Nebula World feel a bit like it?'</p>
<p>'It's not impossible! The Warcraft story is vast and very suitable for an RPG!'</p>
<p>'I think it might be an open-world game, after all, isn't it called World of Warcraft? And when it comes to open-world, Nebula Games is quite experienced!'</p>
<p>'It could be something like The Witcher: Wild Hunt, where players can choose between the Alliance and Horde factions, and then their progress through quests influences the outcome of the final war.'</p>
<p>'Speaking of which, does no one think it might be an MMORPG?'</p>
<p>'It's not impossible. The Stormwind in Nebula World felt quite like it, with high-end dungeons requiring team and class cooperation.'</p>
<p>'Now that you mention it, that's certainly possible!'</p>
<p>Across the globe, regardless of time or region, all Warcraft fans were discussing news about World of Warcraft at this moment.
