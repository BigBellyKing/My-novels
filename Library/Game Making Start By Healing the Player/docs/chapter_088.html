                <p>Chapter 88: Don't You Nebula Games Players Have Your Own Exhibition Area?</p>
<p>One could say that Fall Guys is an incredibly addictive game.</p>
<p>In Chen Xu's previous life, it was a game from a small developer.</p>
<p>Within a week of its launch, its sales exceeded 2 million, and monthly sales surpassed 10 million.</p>
<p>It was truly phenomenal.</p>
<p>It could definitively be called a phenomenal game.</p>
<p>Although various reasons from the game developers prevented its popularity from lasting very long afterwards.</p>
<p>But from the inherent attributes of the game itself, its success was practically inevitable.</p>
<p>Where did the true magic of this game lie?</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay, it could be said that besides Fall Guys, no other game had successfully combined a variety show obstacle course with a video game.</p>
<p>At the same time, the game mechanism of exiting upon losing allowed players to seamlessly enter the next match, greatly reducing negative feedback.</p>
<p>Before players grew tired of the levels, the rich variety of obstacle course-style levels, akin to a collection of mini-games, offered extremely high replayability for players.</p>
<p>Of course, once they got bored, it was another matter entirely; at that point, players would feel the content was monotonous.</p>
<p>Therefore, to continuously maintain the popularity of Fall Guys, the best method was to constantly release new maps or special modes to keep players engaged.</p>
<p>When the official version of Fall Guys launched, in addition to the Workshop, the game would also feature a Daily Map Rotation Mode.</p>
<p>This would ensure players experienced different maps every day, further enhancing the game's novelty.</p>
<p>In terms of art and visuals, the cartoon-style Fall Guys characters, combined with exaggerated and comical movements, and the chaotic 60-person obstacle courses.</p>
<p>This filled the game with entertainment value, while the various sound effects in the game were also carefully selected.</p>
<p>They created a joyful atmosphere.</p>
<p>It could be said that for many players, the first impression of experiencing Fall Guys was pure joy.</p>
<p>In comparison, while Sanguosha might surpass Fall Guys in content depth, Fall Guys clearly made a stronger initial impression.</p>
<p>As a result, many players who tried Fall Guys quickly became addicted.</p>
<p>‘Anyone want to team up?’</p>
<p>‘Come on, let's go together!’</p>
<p>‘These Fall Guys characters feel so silly and cute!’</p>
<p>‘Yeah, they waddle like roly-poly toys when they walk.’</p>
<p>‘Hey, hey, who's this? Stop pulling me! I'm about to get eliminated!’</p>
<p>‘I can't seem to stop playing! And there seem to be quite a lot of levels.’</p>
<p>At the same time, when these players carried Sanguosha and Fall Guys to other exhibition booths, they created a new trend.</p>
<p>After all, while the Nebula Games exhibition area was bustling, complete with dedicated live streams and various cosplayers dressed in Fall Guys costumes livening up the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there were still relatively few games available to experience, and these two games also had mobile versions.</p>
<p>Previously, everyone wandered around mainly because the queuing time was too unbearable.</p>
<p>But now, it was different.</p>
<p>Now they had something in their hands to pass the time!</p>
<p>Over at NetDragon, in the exhibition area codenamed 'Star God', Meng Zuo and his staff maintained order.</p>
<p>Looking at the dragon-like queue, his heart was filled with excitement.</p>
<p>From the feedback of the players on site, the game 'Star God' indeed still had some areas that needed improvement.</p>
<p>But overall, the players' comments were largely positive.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, with a brand new VR blockbuster, NetDragon was the brightest star at this year's gameplay Expo.</p>
<p>The only slight drawback was that due to the competition between NetDragon and TengHua, the latter had also brought a brand new VR game.</p>
<p>Moreover, according to the feedback from the staff he dispatched, the opposing game also performed very well.</p>
<p>Clearly, they were a formidable opponent at this year's gameplay Expo.</p>
<p>“Next, regarding the media, issue a press release to conduct a preliminary review of the game as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“Also, we can buy some trending topics, and hire some astroturfers in various forums to boost the game’s popularity.”</p>
<p>Meng Zuo walked with a staff member, discussing the upcoming plans for the game.</p>
<p>This was the first major project he had been responsible for since joining NetDragon.</p>
<p>Although he wasn't solely in charge of the entire game's development process.</p>
<p>After all, it was a large-scale VR game.</p>
<p>But for the finished game and subsequent market operations, he was fully responsible.</p>
<p>Therefore, he placed considerable importance on the success of this game.</p>
<p>If it could become explosively popular, then he would truly be on the fast track to success!</p>
<p>In that instant, Meng Zuo's mind was filled with aspirations for a bright future.</p>
<p>After discussing the next work arrangements with the staff, Meng Zuo walked towards the long queue, preparing to check on the situation at their 'Star God' exhibition area.</p>
<p>Although he had already learned most of the player feedback and relevant data from the staff.</p>
<p>He still wanted to see it for himself.</p>
<p>However, as he got closer, he noticed something unusual.</p>
<p>“Wow, what kind of luck does this Zhen Ji have? Seven Luo Shen cards and a Zhuge Repeating Crossbow?”</p>
<p>“What? Seven consecutive Luo Shen activations? That's outrageously absurd! Why does my Luo Shen only ever show red?”</p>
<p>“Oh man, who's this Pineapple Head? They're so mean, they can't get past themselves and they're dragging me to my death too!”</p>
<p>“Quick, quick! Bros, the Yellow Team's score has surpassed ours, hurry and go steal eggs from the Yellow Team's base!”</p>
<p>“Haha, I'm dying of laughter, only three people made it through this 'Water Rises, Boats Float' level, everyone else drowned!”</p>
<p>What was happening? What were these players talking about?</p>
<p>After Meng Zuo got closer and listened to these players, he looked completely bewildered.</p>
<p>He understood every word, but why did he not understand what they were saying when put together?</p>
<p>Similarly, some players who had been waiting in line also listened to the others' conversations with curious expressions.</p>
<p>“Bro, what are you guys playing?” a puzzled player asked.</p>
<p>“Fall Guys and Sanguosha! They're super fun!”</p>
<p>“What games are those? Just released? I haven't heard of them!” Many players were confused as to why, with so many people playing, they hadn't heard of them.</p>
<p>“They're not out yet! These are the games Nebula Games brought to this exhibition.” The asked player explained.</p>
<p>“What! Nebula Games? That's the company that made Outlast and Overcooked? Those two games completely drained the last of my enthusiasm and fighting spirit; no matter what, I'm not playing them.” The guy immediately recalled some unpleasant memories upon hearing the words "Nebula Games."</p>
<p>“Haha, this time it’s really different! Chen Xu isn't tricking us this time, these two games are genuinely super fun, and it's also very convenient; you can just scan a QR code to download and play them. Want to give it a try? You can just use your phone to scan my code to download it.” The player who was asked also enthusiastically replied.</p>
<p>“Is that so! Well, thanks, bro, I'll download it and check it out!” Hearing this, the player also became interested.</p>
<p>You can play this without queuing!?</p>
<p>After downloading and entering the game, experiencing the new player tutorial, they quickly discovered the fun of these two games and became instantly addicted.</p>
<p>“Bro, it’s your turn!”</p>
<p>“It’s my turn already? Never mind… Bro, you go ahead and experience it first, I’ll just queue again. Damn it! This Grabber, why are they pulling me!”</p>
<p>Some players, while playing, had already reached the front of their original queue.</p>
<p>But because their current game hadn't ended, they simply couldn't bear to quit.</p>
<p>They glanced at the queue and decided to just join it again.</p>
<p>Witnessing the entire scene, Meng Zuo's eyes involuntarily widened, and he was completely stunned.</p>
<p>Not only Meng Zuo, but the same situation was also occurring at TengHua and some other game developers' booths.</p>
<p>All the developers watched as players, bringing Sanguosha and Fall Guys from the Nebula Games exhibition area, came to their booths and started playing.</p>
<p>Then they slowly 'infected' the players queuing at their own booths, and finally, all the players were holding their phones, playing Sanguosha and Fall Guys, at which point the developers were instantly dumbfounded.</p>
<p>What the heck!?</p>
<p>Ne... Nebula Games?</p>
<p>The two new games Chen Xu brought?</p>
<p>No need to queue to experience, just scan a QR code to download on your phone and play anytime, anywhere?</p>
<p>Is this even allowed?</p>
<p>Isn't that playing dirty!</p>
<p>And don't you Nebula Games players have your own exhibition area?!</p>
<p>(PS: Putting out a small bowl and sign: With just recommendation tickets and monthly passes, you can take this adorable author home~)</p>
