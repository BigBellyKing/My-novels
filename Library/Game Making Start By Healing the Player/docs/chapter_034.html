                <p>Chapter 34: What Does the Paper Rabbit Represent?</p>
<p>As Dong Zhen progressed, Johnny's memories moved from old age to his middle years.</p>
<p>Johnny stood by Liva's window. By this time, Liva was already terminally ill, and the platypus doll sat beside her bed.</p>
<p>The floor was also covered with paper rabbits.</p>
<p>'It's just enough. Even after paying for the surgery, the remaining money will be just enough... so don't worry,' Johnny said to Liva.</p>
<p>But Liva just looked at Johnny: 'A white lie... You think this is a white lie, don't you?'</p>
<p>'No, I'm sure we have just enough—' Johnny tried to explain, but was cut off.</p>
<p>'Don't say another word... I don't like it when you lie.'</p>
<p>'I've calculated our assets; I know the real situation.'</p>
<p>'Why are you trying to convince me to go against my own wishes?'</p>
<p>Liva looked very sad.</p>
<p>Johnny, on the other hand, seemed a little agitated: 'We need that money for your medical expenses, Liva!'</p>
<p>'I understand Anya is very important to you, but this... this is just too much!'</p>
<p>'I mean, she's not even—'</p>
<p>Liva interrupted again: 'Do you know what would make me happy?'</p>
<p>As Liva and Johnny conversed, Dong Zhen and the viewers in the live stream finally understood what this 'Anya' was.</p>
<p>In previous memory fragments, it was known from Johnny's words that Anya was something very important to Liva.</p>
<p>But what it was, remained completely unclear.</p>
<p>At first, Dong Zhen guessed it was the platypus doll, but now he had a new theory.</p>
<p>The 'Anya' was neither a platypus nor a person, but possibly the lighthouse situated by the cliff.</p>
<p>It seemed Liva could have been cured, but she insisted that Johnny use the money for her treatment to build a house and watch the lighthouse, stating that this would make her happy.</p>
<p>“What's going on? Is she crazy?! A house where she can watch a lighthouse is more important than her life!?”</p>
<p>Dong Zhen felt his head swimming with questions.</p>
<p>Too many questions flooded his mind.</p>
<p>At this moment, Liva in the game handed Johnny a paper rabbit.</p>
<p>It was the blue and yellow, two-colored paper rabbit.</p>
<p>'What is this?' Liva asked Johnny, her eyes full of hope.</p>
<p>Johnny was a little surprised, but still replied: 'It's a rabbit, just like the ones you made before.'</p>
<p>'And then?' Liva continued to ask.</p>
<p>'And then... uh...' Johnny was a bit at a loss: 'Well, it's made of paper.'</p>
<p>'And what else?'</p>
<p>'Its body is yellow, and the other parts are blue.'</p>
<p>'Good, what else?'</p>
<p>Liva seemed very eager.</p>
<p>But Johnny had no idea what Liva was trying to express, so he changed the subject, saying he had written a song and would play it for her.</p>
<p>This song was 'To Liva,' the one from before.</p>
<p>Liva laughed and teased, saying the name was really cheesy.</p>
<p>The memory timeline continued to advance, and now Johnny was troubled.</p>
<p>He was faced with a dilemma: whether to treat Liva, or continue building Liva's wish, a house next to the lighthouse.</p>
<p>Johnny in the game was making a painful choice, but Dong Zhen and all the viewers in the live stream, as well as Neil and Eva in the game, understood that in the end, Johnny followed Liva's wishes.</p>
<p>But why!?</p>
<p>Based on Johnny's conversations with his friends, Isabelle and Nicolas, several key pieces of information were revealed.</p>
<p>That is, Anya was indeed the lighthouse on the cliff, just as Dong Zhen had thought.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this lighthouse was where Liva and Johnny got married.</p>
<p>But it still didn't make any sense!</p>
<p>Why was Liva so fixated on this lighthouse?</p>
<p>And from their conversation, another crucial piece of information emerged.</p>
<p>That is, Liva might be suffering from some kind of illness, and folding paper rabbits seemed to be one of its symptoms.</p>
<p>But why was Liva so obsessed with that lighthouse?</p>
<p>And what exactly did these paper rabbits signify?</p>
<p>“What the heck, I really can't figure it out!” Dong Zhen's face was filled with confusion.</p>
<p>At the same time, bullet comments kept flooding the live stream.</p>
<p>'My monkey brain can't handle it anymore.'</p>
<p>'CPU overloaded!'</p>
<p>'Seriously, what does this paper rabbit represent?'</p>
<p>'I just feel like there's something seriously wrong with this game!'</p>
<p>'Hurry up, boss, advance the plot!'</p>
<p>'+1, I want to know what happens next!'</p>
<p>Clearly, the viewers in the live stream were equally curious about the game's subsequent plot.</p>
<p>They also wanted to see how the game would ultimately answer these questions.</p>
<p>As the memories continued to progress through time, Johnny and Liva both grew younger and younger.</p>
<p>In between, the two shared romantic embraces under the lighthouse named Anya, filled with aspirations for the future.</p>
<p>But the only perplexing thing was that Liva continued to fold paper rabbits, and would bring the blue and yellow rabbit to Johnny, asking: 'What is this?'</p>
<p>Recalling that Liva was still asking Johnny this question when she was seriously ill.</p>
<p>This only deepened the confusion.</p>
<p>“So, what <em>does</em> this rabbit represent?!”</p>
<p>“What the heck, I'm suffering!”</p>
<p>Dong Zhen scratched his head in exasperation, clearly tormented by curiosity.</p>
<p>And what kind of illness did Liva actually have?</p>
<p>Countless questions swirled in his mind.</p>
<p>Subsequent conversations with Nicolas and Isabelle revealed more about Liva.</p>
<p>That is, Isabelle suffered from the same illness as Liva.</p>
<p>It was this illness that made Liva's speech appear so strange, even somewhat incoherent, leaving people unable to understand what she truly wanted to express.</p>
<p>“So Liva suffers from a condition that prevents her from clearly expressing herself, and also has social anxiety?”</p>
<p>Upon seeing this, Dong Zhen also made a guess inwardly.</p>
<p>With this reason, all of Liva's previous peculiar behaviors could now be explained.</p>
<p>Why Liva kept asking Johnny about the rabbits, why Liva told Johnny to throw sandbags towards Anya, and then dangerously stood at the cliff edge to watch.</p>
<p>All of these had an explanation.</p>
<p>Because Liva, suffering from a mental illness, couldn't clearly articulate her thoughts, she could only use suggestive methods to convey her inner desires.</p>
<p>Understanding brought clarity, but new questions arose.</p>
<p>What did the rabbit truly represent, and why was Liva so fond of this lighthouse named Anya, even willing to give up her life for it?</p>
<p>Just because it was where she and Johnny got married?</p>
<p>That didn't make sense either!</p>
