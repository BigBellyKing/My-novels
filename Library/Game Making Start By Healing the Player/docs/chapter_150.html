                <p>Chapter 149: While Others Play It Takes Two, We Cross Swords (Fifth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>There were quite a few solo players like Song Ren.</p>
<p>Originally, many players were somewhat interested in <em>It Takes Two</em>, but due to the high barrier of needing two players, they chose to observe for now.</p>
<p>But they soon discovered something: whether from live streaming platforms, video platforms, or player communities.</p>
<p>This game was completely different from <em>Overcooked</em>, which Chen Xu released last year.</p>
<p>First was the sheer volume of game content.</p>
<p>The cartoon art style, combined with two-player co-op, easily led players to prejudge it as an independent game or a small-scale, low-cost production.</p>
<p>But <em>It Takes Two</em> was completely different; its scale and content were comparable to some blockbuster titles.</p>
<p>More crucially, all the content shown in Chen Xu's previous promotional trailers were not just grand promises but were genuinely reflected in the game.</p>
<p>Different scenes paired with different special abilities, along with various cinematic animation effects in the game, made players feel like they were watching a game movie.</p>
<p>And the experience was different from last year's <em>Overcooked</em>, where everyone started happily, then got intensely into it, eventually leading to arguments that turned the chaos into 'breakup kitchen'.</p>
<p>The content currently showcased by <em>It Takes Two</em> was, however, too heartwarming.</p>
<p>This was mainly related to the game's content.</p>
<p><em>Overcooked</em> purely focused on tacit cooperation.</p>
<p>If cooperation failed and tacit understanding couldn't be achieved, feelings of blame would naturally arise. If one couldn't control themselves, it would easily lead to arguments.</p>
<p>But <em>It Takes Two</em> was completely different.</p>
<p>In this game, it also featured puzzles and operational aspects. In such a situation, if both parties were clumsy, there was no need for one to criticize the other; everyone would just laugh and play together.</p>
<p>And if one person was more skilled while the other struggled a bit.</p>
<p>Then through the split-screen mode, they could still understand exactly where the other party had issues.</p>
<p>Unlike <em>Overcooked</em>, where everyone thought they were right and the other person was wrong.</p>
<p>Once the problem was understood, they could naturally teach patiently, thereby deepening their affection, friendship, and bonds.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the game's story and level design were excellent for shifting players' emotions.</p>
<p>This included the Book of Love in the game, specifically responsible for stirring up various 'drama'; to some extent, it also drew a lot of player attention.</p>
<p>With a common goal, arguments naturally became rare; there was more working together with one heart.</p>
<p>After the game launched, especially on some live streaming platforms, many streamers, due to the game drought, made arrangements to play <em>It Takes Two</em>.</p>
<p>The various humorous and entertaining broadcast effects also made many players who hadn't planned to buy the game unable to resist opening their wallets.</p>
<p>As for how solo players should find teammates?</p>
<p>Naturally, they would frequent various game forums and communities to look for them.</p>
<p>For a time, major forums were flooded with similar friend-seeking posts.</p>
<p>'Looking for a good-tempered friend who can be online for long hours to play <em>It Takes Two</em> together!'</p>
<p>'Looking for a partner, gender neutral, hoping for a good temper and long online hours. I'll provide the game, you provide the person?'</p>
<p>'I'll provide the game, you provide the person. Enjoy <em>It Takes Two</em> all weekend. Interested, PM me!'</p>
<p>Originally, many players couldn't experience this game because they were alone.</p>
<p>But under the allure of the game, they began searching for playmates.</p>
<p>Many players then discovered that they weren't the only ones who were alone.</p>
<p>There were also quite a few players with similar experiences who, for various reasons, could only play games alone.</p>
<p>At this moment, many players who had previously felt lonely realized they weren't so alone after all.</p>
<p>If there was anything that made them feel something was off.</p>
<p>It was that on the community forums, many players who had experienced <em>It Takes Two</em> and raved about it were all in male-female pairs.</p>
<p>Either married couples or boyfriends and girlfriends.</p>
<p>But looking back at the players searching for teammates, they were uniformly a bunch of grown men.</p>
<p>For <em>It Takes Two</em>, others were playing in pairs, but when it came to them, how did it become 'Male Bonding Takes Two' or 'crossing swords'?</p>
<p>However, whether it was 'It Takes Two' or 'Male Bonding Takes Two'.</p>
<p>One point was universally shared.</p>
<p>That was, after players experienced the game, they were completely amazed by its various level designs.</p>
<p>Especially as the story progressed bit by bit, the entire game's content was incredibly rich.</p>
<p>Aside from various mini-games, the game also showcased gameplay in many other ways.</p>
<p>Each theme had its corresponding special items.</p>
<p>For example, after the Tree level, when May and Cody arrived in the room, they were captured by a space ape and taken to a space scene.</p>
<p>Here, the two of them acquired new items.</p>
<p>May obtained gravity-defying shoes, while Cody acquired a belt that could enlarge him.</p>
<p>Coupled with these two brand new items, the space scene presented players with a wonderful, dreamlike experience, almost like time-space teleportation.</p>
<p>However, from this point, the game's story finally introduced an intense conflict.</p>
<p>Cody and May in the game, having been transformed from humans into puppets, naturally found it hard to accept.</p>
<p>Originally, they wanted to ask their daughter how they could change back.</p>
<p>But they discovered that their daughter seemed unable to hear or see them at all.</p>
<p>At this point, Cody believed they had been subjected to a spell, and that their daughter Rose's tears were what had turned them into puppets.</p>
<p>Therefore, if they could just make their daughter Rose cry again, perhaps they could transform back into humans.</p>
<p>And this was why Cody and May encountered obstruction from the space ape.</p>
<p>What left a deep impression on players was a line from the space ape—'You only make her cry!'</p>
<p>To make it even more convincing, the space ape even pulled out a recorder.</p>
<p>To make Rose cry, Cody and May immediately hit it off, deciding to go to their daughter's toy castle.</p>
<p>They would destroy her beloved toys, so she would cry heartbrokenly.</p>
<p>“How can these parents be like this, it’s too much!” Wang Han exclaimed, unable to help herself as she looked at the story, having returned home after hotpot to continue playing <em>It Takes Two</em>.</p>
<p>Destroying her beloved daughter's toys to make her cry sadly, combined with the earlier performance of the space ape, was deeply ironic.</p>
<p>“But from a story perspective, it’s understandable. After all, they turned from humans into puppets, and their daughter didn't react at all when they spoke to her,” Zhang Yi said, scratching his head.</p>
<p>“That’s true,” Wang Han nodded, considering Zhang Yi’s words.</p>
<p>“But I think communication is more important. This reminds me of when I was little; my mom sold all my collected cards as junk, and I cried for ages because of it!” Zhang Yi sighed.</p>
<p>“You were so miserable then! My childhood was so happy; my parents never threw away my toys randomly,” Wang Han said with a triumphant smile.</p>
<p>“This is the importance of communication and mutual understanding!” Zhang Yi stated.</p>
<p>“Indeed,” Wang Han agreed.</p>
<p>“So, you absolutely must not throw away my figures and models in the future!” Zhang Yi chuckled.</p>
<p>Wang Han: …………</p>
<p>So that’s what you were waiting for!</p>
<p>“Give me a break! When have I ever thrown away your figures? I even bought you the glass display cabinet!” Wang Han said exasperatedly.</p>
<p>“Hehe, hurry up and see how we clear this level! Let’s watch the story, watch the story!” Zhang Yi quickly said, laughing as he changed the subject.</p>
<p>Two updates first, two more before 12 AM.</p>
