                <p>Chapter 323: The White House – Fallen (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Clicking on the video, Zhang Yi's vision was first plunged into darkness, then the Nebula Games LOGO appeared.</p>
<p>This was a standard opening.</p>
<p>But the next moment.</p>
<p>A sound reached Zhang Yi's ears.</p>
<p><em>Swoosh</em>... it sounded like something falling, then... <em>Boom!</em> a huge explosion.</p>
<p>This was immediately followed by rapid gunfire, screams, shouts, and more explosions.</p>
<p>In the darkness, enhanced by the VR gaming pod's stereo sound, Zhang Yi was instantly immersed in the atmosphere of war.</p>
<p>Even though the screen was still dark, Zhang Yi was already certain.</p>
<p>This was a game completely different from <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>.</p>
<p>Because in <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, while there were explosions and gunfights, they were mostly indoor combat. But with this <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, even though the visuals hadn't appeared yet, the sound effects alone made him feel an atmosphere called war.</p>
<p>“Move! Move! Quick!”</p>
<p>“Support! Requesting fire support!”</p>
<p>“Attack! Attack!”</p>
<p>“R—P—G!”</p>
<p>“I’m hit!”</p>
<p>“Fire! Fire!”</p>
<p>“2 o’clock, requesting supp...”</p>
<p>Amidst the cacophony, the darkness before Zhang Yi's eyes finally lifted.</p>
<p>It was replaced by a blur.</p>
<p>Promotional video content presented from a first-person perspective?</p>
<p>The sound was a bit noisy, and his vision was also a bit blurry.</p>
<p>Then a soldier, who had been lying on the ground, slowly stood up.</p>
<p>But the next moment, before he could react.</p>
<p>A bullet instantly pierced his head.</p>
<p>At this point, the classic bullet time sequence appeared. Accompanied by the bullet and blood, the camera followed the bullet's trajectory, slowly rising.</p>
<p>“Oh my god!” As the bullet stretched, Zhang Yi was completely stunned.</p>
<p>What did he see?!</p>
<p>This battlefield was actually the White House!</p>
<p>America's most iconic administrative building, the White House, located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C.!</p>
<p>And the tattered Stars and Stripes flag, all indicated that the White House had fallen!</p>
<p>This was absolutely insane!</p>
<p>In an instant, Zhang Yi's eyes widened.</p>
<p>Countless soldiers moved through a hail of bullets and explosions. In the dark night, heavy rain poured down, but it couldn't extinguish the flames burning from the explosions.</p>
<p>The once magnificent White House was now in ruins and rubble.</p>
<p>In the sky, a fighter jet strafed the enemies outside the White House, its fire spitting relentlessly, drawing a fierce line across the air.</p>
<p>But at this moment, a roar came: R! P! G!</p>
<p>With sparks and a fiery trail, a rocket hit the fuselage directly. Accompanied by a thunderous explosion and the brilliant firelight of the night.</p>
<p>In the air, a Blackhawk falls!</p>
<p>The entire White House was completely engulfed in the flames of war, with only the tattered Stars and Stripes still fluttering.</p>
<p>The White House – Fallen!</p>
<p>“Damn it! This is so freaking awesome!”</p>
<p>With wide eyes, Zhang Yi cried out.</p>
<p>With the panoramic view and stereo sound of VR, the entire atmosphere of war was vividly displayed.</p>
<p>Of course, the most crucial part was the setting!</p>
<p>It was absolutely insane!</p>
<p>Who could have imagined that Chen Xu would pull off such a crazy scene in this game called <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>?!</p>
<p>The White House falls!</p>
<p>My god!</p>
<p>It's absolutely insane!</p>
<p>Zhang Yi roared in his heart, but goosebumps had already risen all over his body from excitement.</p>
<p>Putting everything else aside, just this scene of the White House falling was enough to thrill him.</p>
<p>A definite buy!</p>
<p>There's nothing more to say!</p>
<p>This <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> is definitely a must-buy game!</p>
<p>As Zhang Yi was excited, the video continued to play.</p>
<p>“Why did you do this?! Where did you get the nukes?”</p>
<p>A man with a mustache and a boonie hat used a set of skilled hand-to-hand combat techniques on an enemy, slamming him to the ground and beating him severely.</p>
<p>“Who is it?!”</p>
<p>“Who! Tell me! His name!”</p>
<p>Looking at the beaten enemy on the ground, the officer with the boonie hat had a cold expression.</p>
<p>However, the person tied to the chair, even though his consciousness was blurred from the beating, still didn't utter a word. At this moment, the camera zoomed in.</p>
<p>His expression was one of fear.</p>
<p>Then the phone next to him rang.</p>
<p>“Sir, his phone is ringing.”</p>
<p>The soldier handed the phone to the captain.</p>
<p>After answering the call, the officer with the boonie hat said nothing, turned, and shot the enemy he had just interrogated.</p>
<p>“Sir, who was that?” the soldier next to him asked, confused.</p>
<p>“Zakhaev... Imran Zakhaev.” Throwing the phone away, the officer with the boonie hat seemed to fall into a memory.</p>
<p>As the words faded, the scene on the screen gradually disappeared.</p>
<p>The next moment, the camera moved into the sky, a God's-eye view overlooking the land.</p>
<p>This was a city engulfed in war.</p>
<p>Countless attack helicopters and tanks and armored vehicles were evacuating.</p>
<p>But at this very moment, a dazzling flash of light erupted from the city.</p>
<p>A huge explosion sounded, followed by a mushroom cloud rising.</p>
<p>Dust filled the sky, and a visible shockwave spread outwards from the epicenter.</p>
<p>Countless buildings instantly collapsed, helicopters in the sky, armored vehicles and tanks on the ground, all fell or were directly overturned and exploded.</p>
<p>As the dust settled, the central area of the city was a massive crater.</p>
<p>The city was nuked!</p>
<p>“My god!” Zhang Yi swallowed, having already guessed when the mustachioed officer interrogated the enemy.</p>
<p>But he never expected such a scene to actually appear. Was this part of the game's story?</p>
<p>No way?!</p>
<p>The scene flashed, and countless armored divisions and fully armed soldiers slowly advanced in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Outside Earth, an EMP missile was launched into space, causing a space station to disintegrate, and astronauts screamed in panic.</p>
<p>At Champ de Mars, countless soldiers desperately resisted enemy armored tanks and attack helicopters, and amidst the bombing, the Eiffel Tower, which had stood tall, collapsed into the Seine River.</p>
<p>In the dark night, amidst lightning and heavy rain, a cruise ship sailed on the sea, and a special operations team left no armed militant alive on board.</p>
<p>An exhilarating snowmobile chase across vast snowy terrain.</p>
<p>Amidst a hail of bullets and explosions, a chase with tanks through the city, the once prosperous city turned into ruins after being ravaged by artillery fire.</p>
<p>Cars on the streets exploded and burned, engulfing the city in flames.</p>
<p>Assault boats on a turbulent river facing helicopters.</p>
<p>Frantically fleeing drone bombings in a mountain town.</p>
<p>Almost every imaginable intense action sequence was vividly displayed in this promotional video.</p>
<p>Finally, with the launch of two nuclear missiles, the game's name officially appeared.</p>
