                <p>Chapter 117: You Do It Then!</p>
<p>Exited the game, created a new character.</p>
<p>Let the character '123' be a thing of the past, and the brand new character 'aaa' would become a new star, carrying the flame of hope.</p>
<p>This time, Zhang Yi didn't bother with detailed character customization. Because the Knight class inherently comes with a set of armor and a sword and shield, his head was directly covered by the helmet. This way, his masterful character customization wouldn't be visible anyway, so he simply skipped it. As for the burial gifts, the branch he chose before might have some special use, but he wasn't clear about it and would have to figure it out later. But one thing he was certain of was that it was absolutely useless against Gundyr the Ash. So this time, Zhang Yi and Wang Han thought about it and chose the Life Ring, which boosts HP. After all, when you don't know what other items do, choosing equipment that increases your health is always the right choice!</p>
<p>Skipping the opening cutscene, Wang Han, sitting in front of the computer, felt a sense of peace watching 'aaa' in the game, clad in armor and wielding a sword and shield. An inexplicable confidence surged within her! Along the way, just like before, she dealt with the Hollows one by one. Then she picked up the pulse for focus, lit the first bonfire, ran beside the jumping platform, jumped onto the coffin, and retrieved the white item, a wedge-shaped stone fragment of unknown use. As for the Crystal Lizard on the other path, Wang Han currently had no intention of bothering it. After all, every wrong has its perpetrator, and it wasn't that Crystal Lizard that tormented her. Her main target now was still Gundyr the Ash. Passing through the stone gate, she entered the courtyard.</p>
<p>In the newly restarted save file, Gundyr the Ash was still kneeling as before. The only change was the bloodstains in the courtyard, visible from all directions. Wang Han once again observed the death animations of other players. They were mostly similar, but one thing made Wang Han a little nervous: she noticed quite a few players wearing knight armor among them. Some other players had died horribly, because on one side of the courtyard were piled gravestones and candlelight, and on the other was a bottomless cliff. Through the bloodstain phantoms left by other players, Wang Han saw many players rolling their way to the cliff edge, only to be swept away by something. This made Wang Han decide to keep a little distance from the cliff during the battle. Being beaten to death by Gundyr the Ash wasn't shameful; after all, it wasn't the first time. But being killed by the environment? That would be truly embarrassing. After all, the arena wasn't some narrow path, but a rather large courtyard.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Wang Han controlled 'aaa' to step forward and pull the Coiled Sword from Gundyr the Ash's chest. After drawing the Coiled Sword, Wang Han didn't immediately retreat to create distance. Instead, she swung the long sword in her hand at Gundyr, watching the stamina bar's numerical drop, familiarizing herself with the rhythm of offense. As the long sword struck Gundyr, black-purple blood splattered out. “This BOSS isn't even awake yet, what's the point of attacking now? Aren't you just wasting stamina?” Zhang Yi, beside her, grumbled. “Can't I just get a feel for it and sharpen my blade? Besides, I'm watching my stamina bar!” Wang Han retorted. However, the next scene left Wang Han astonished. Because by the time Gundyr the Ash fully stood up, its UI health bar had already been depleted somewhat. “Oh my god, you're a blind cat that stumbled upon a dead rat!” Zhang Yi exclaimed, astonished that such a thing was possible. “What do you mean 'blind cat stumbled upon a dead rat'? This is called understanding the game through experience!” Wang Han snorted. Although she hadn't known about this mechanism before doing it, it didn't stop her from bragging.</p>
<p>It's well-known that a player's IQ drops when they're showing off, so Wang Han's triumph didn't last long. ‘Thump!’ A muffled sound emanated from the speakers on the desk. Still engrossed in her self-praise, Wang Han didn't notice that Gundyr the Ash had already awakened. Its halberd slammed heavily onto the ground, sending her flying. “Something’s wrong! Didn't I put on armor?! This damage!” Wang Han's eyes widened as she watched 'aaa' fly backward. What did she see? Why did a third of this health bar just evaporate! Although it was indeed more resilient than the previous Deprived. But the critical point was that it only went from being able to withstand two hits to three! What's the difference?! Watching her health bar drop and Gundyr the Ash still advancing menacingly, Wang Han felt her worldview shatter in that instant. Was wearing this armor completely pointless then?</p>
<p>However, the BOSS opposite her clearly wouldn't give Wang Han much time for lament. What seemed like a slow, measured pace instantly closed the distance, and Gundyr the Ash's halberd swung over again like a fierce tiger descending from the mountain. This time, Wang Han instinctively raised her shield to block, but after making the move, she immediately regretted it a little. Because earlier, when Zhang Yi played as the Deprived against this BOSS, he also raised his shield. But the outcome was exceptionally tragic. Not only did his stamina bar drop rapidly, but more importantly, the tiny broken wooden shield couldn't block attacks at all; it merely reduced damage. As for the damage reduction, it was roughly from 100 to 50. Originally two hits to die, after raising the shield it became four hits. However, the next scene brought Wang Han an unexpected delight. Because the shield in front of her perfectly blocked Gundyr the Ash's attack. Not a single drop of blood was lost! “Invincible! So this is the cheat code for clearing the game!” After being struck twice consecutively, and seeing her character take no damage, Wang Han's face was filled with joy.</p>
<p>Her joy clouded her mind, making her completely oblivious to her stamina bar. Her shield was still up, and her words were not yet finished. Gundyr the Ash in the game suddenly charged forward, delivering a double-combo horizontal sweep with its halberd. Her already low stamina bar was instantly depleted. The character in the game stumbled, falling into a stunned state, then Gundyr's right hand extended forward. Wang Han watched as her character in the game was impaled by Gundyr's halberd and flung into the air, like a broken doll. At the same time, her health plummeted to rock bottom. 【YOU DIED】, transitioning from crimson to black and white, still those familiar three words. Wang Han fell silent.</p>
<p>“You're not doing well! This game's stamina bar is quite important. Without stamina, it's like having no health. Although blocking with a shield takes no damage, it depletes stamina twice as fast as rolling. And weren't you supposed to parry? Why are you only blocking and not parrying?” Zhang Yi, beside her, commented on the recent battle. The only thing that left him speechless was that, although she chose the Knight, he felt like the defense hadn't improved much. To illustrate with an example, the original Deprived was like soft tofu, and now, choosing the Knight and wearing armor, she just became firm tofu. Although the latter was a bit harder, they were both still tofu, the kind that shatters upon impact. Sitting on the stool, Wang Han's face darkened as she listened to Zhang Yi's 'hindsight' analysis: “You do it then!” “Alright! Let me show you what I can do!” Zhang Yi sat back down in the chair, a blueprint for the upcoming battle against Gundyr the Ash already forming in his mind.</p>
