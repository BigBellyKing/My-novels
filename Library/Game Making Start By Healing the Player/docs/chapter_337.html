                <p>Chapter 336: Is Captain Price Really Gone? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Ten days ago, Zhang Yi, whose liver ached slightly from the anger caused by "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare," uncharacteristically stood his ground.</p>
<p>Since the release of "Overcooked," he had washed dishes for over a thousand days.</p>
<p>But today, he stood firm; he wasn't washing these dishes anymore!</p>
<p>As for the reason, it was naturally because he didn't want to wait another second.</p>
<p>Although his liver ached from anger, that was due to the deaths of Gaz and Brother Griggs, and Nebula Games pulling a cliffhanger.</p>
<p>Regarding the game itself, he was incredibly excited.</p>
<p>He might curse 'Chen Xu Old Geezer' with his mouth, but the money in his wallet still had to be handed over.</p>
<p>Entering the game, what first appeared was not new game footage.</p>
<p>Instead, it was a flashback.</p>
<p>In the recruit training camp, Captain Price listened to the recruits' introductions and grumbled to his teammate next to him: "Soap? What kind of ridiculous codename is that?"</p>
<p>In a square in the Middle East, Al-Asad, wearing a red beret, staged a coup, shooting the president of a small country.</p>
<p>And in the video footage, Zakhaev also appeared, but players didn't recognize him before, so they had no reaction upon first seeing him.</p>
<p>In a city in the Middle East, a mushroom cloud rose into the sky, taking the lives of thirty thousand people.</p>
<p>During the operation, Young Zakhaev swallowed his gun and committed suicide when faced with capture.</p>
<p>Zakhaev, grief-stricken by the loss of his son, activated and launched missiles equipped with nuclear warheads.</p>
<p>Price, Gaz, Soap, and Griggs chased and fought Zakhaev on a bridge, eventually killing him.</p>
<p>In the Ukrainian mountains, the newly formed Task Force 141 fell into a trap, and Price covered the rear, his fate unknown.</p>
<p>Scene after scene from the past unfolded before the players, and then the timeline subtitle appeared—[Five Years Later]</p>
<p>For players who had played the game, these plot points and content were naturally clear.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu had, after all, released "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare" as a trilogy, just like in his previous life.</p>
<p>So, there would inevitably be some players who didn't buy the first part, choosing instead to buy the second or third.</p>
<p>Including such fragmented flashback narratives in the game could also help players better understand the story's plot.</p>
<p>Zakhaev was dead, but the even more insane Makarov had appeared.</p>
<p>Without the slightest hesitation, Zhang Yi directly selected the normal difficulty.</p>
<p>He had already tried Hardened and Veteran before.</p>
<p>Now, he genuinely felt a bit out of his depth.</p>
<p>As for Recruit difficulty, he felt it was too easy.</p>
<p>For players who hadn't played FPS games, Recruit difficulty might be just right.</p>
<p>But for a veteran FPS player like him, normal difficulty was the perfect "water temperature."</p>
<p>'No matter how fast appearances change, the essence of things is always eternal.'</p>
<p>'Rules change, players change, but power will always fall into someone's hands.'</p>
<p>'We fought side by side with the Russians, but in the end, there was only hostility between nations.'</p>
<p>The anti-American wave, war plans, insane leaders, and volatile international situation created an immense sense of tension.</p>
<p>Against this grand backdrop, the camera moved to Phoenix Base in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Today was recruit training day, and Sergeant Foley had been tasked by General Shepherd to select a soldier with a clean record and excellent qualities to join Shepherd's command.</p>
<p>The player character was a Private First Class in the 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment: Joseph Allen.</p>
<p>The first mission was called 【Daily Life (Mission)】, but it was just a simple new player tutorial. As for why Zhang Yi knew this:</p>
<p>A system prompt appeared, indicating that the player's VR had played the first part, and asked if he wanted to skip the new player tutorial.</p>
<p>Of course, if there was no save file, then passing this tutorial level would be mandatory by default.</p>
<p>Since he already knew it was a tutorial level, Zhang Yi figured it would be basically the same as the previous installment, so he directly chose to skip it.</p>
<p>Moreover, he still had many questions in his mind.</p>
<p>Not just whether Captain Price was still alive, but also why he had become this Ranger Private First Class instead of the previous Soap.</p>
<p>Or was it going to continue with multi-line narration as before, where he played as Joseph Allen here, and later became Soap?</p>
<p>Zhang Yi speculated, and after choosing to skip the new player tutorial level, an achievement notification popped up.</p>
<p>【Daily Training: Sometimes the purpose is more than just training】</p>
<p>Looking at this achievement prompt, Zhang Yi didn't think much of it.</p>
<p>This was a rather unique point about games under Nebula Games.</p>
<p>That is, there were various achievements and trophies in the game.</p>
<p>Many players with a collecting urge would collect various achievements, and after collecting them all, they would receive a platinum trophy.</p>
<p>Even on the Nebula Games platform, there were many game developers and designers who specifically made games with easily obtainable trophies.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Yi himself didn't dwell on it.</p>
<p>After finishing the daily training, Allen was immediately dispatched to the front lines.</p>
<p>It was a seamless continuation of the "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare" experience from before, with an incredibly intense battlefield atmosphere and experience.</p>
<p>And of course, there were also highly reliable teammates.</p>
<p>For example, Shepherd from the previous installment would pull the player up, loudly reminding them that this was a battlefield.</p>
<p>The Ranger squad would provide cover for you, and Captain Dunn would even rescue you from a hail of bullets without regard for his own safety.</p>
<p>They were all excellent teammates.</p>
<p>Especially his superior, Shepherd, who held him in very high regard.</p>
<p>Allen: "Sir, how do I look?"</p>
<p>Shepherd: "Excellent. Just like the enemy. You're perfect for this undercover mission."</p>
<p>Allen: "The target is Makarov, right?"</p>
<p>Shepherd: "Makarov? He's not worthy of being a target. Just a mad dog biting everywhere for money. Memorize the details of your undercover identity; your life depends on it."</p>
<p>Shepherd: "Finally, welcome to Task Force 141, comprised of the world's most elite soldiers."</p>
<p>Allen: "It's an honor, General! When can I meet the other teammates?"</p>
<p>Shepherd: "They are currently on a mission."</p>
<p>After a CG animation ended, the scene shifted to a snowy mountain.</p>
<p>Heavy snow fell, and on a thousand-meter-high cliff, a man with ice hanging from his beard and wearing windproof goggles was squatting, smoking a cigar – the type his former captain loved most.</p>
<p>【Cliffhanger (Mission)】</p>
<p>【Day Two, 07:35:40】</p>
<p>【Roach - Sergeant Gary Sanderson】</p>
<p>"Time's up, we need to go, Roach." The smoking man flicked his cigar off the cliff with a familiar gesture, stood up, and turned his head to say.</p>
<p>It was then that Zhang Yi finally recognized who the man in front of him was.</p>
<p>"Holy cow! Soap! Now Soap is my captain?" Zhang Yi was utterly stunned.</p>
<p>And this Gary Sanderson he was playing now, wasn't he a member of the previous Operation Croaker?</p>
<p>So, Captain Price was really gone?</p>
<p>And Soap had replaced Price as the captain of Task Force 141?</p>
