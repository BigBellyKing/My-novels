                <p>Chapter 137: Only a Storm Can Topple the Great Tree? FNNDP! (Seventh Update, Requesting Subscriptions)</p>
<p>On Shark TV, a streamer named Mr. Qin, affectionately called Old Qin by his fans, was live streaming.</p>
<p>The content of his live stream was naturally Dark Souls.</p>
<p>He got the game right when it launched.</p>
<p>At first, like most ordinary players, he was intimidated by the game's various insidious traps and high-difficulty settings.</p>
<p>However, compared to most streamers, he clearly belonged to the technically skilled kind.</p>
<p>He was among the first batch of players to clear Dark Souls.</p>
<p>Moreover, he didn't just stream; he also produced strategy guides on video websites.</p>
<p>In his words, the purpose of strategy guides was to allow all ordinary players to clear the game.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the explanations for Dark Souls in his strategy guides were very thorough, including detailed information on dealing with BOSSes, elite mobs, and map levels, which earned them high click-through rates on video websites.</p>
<p>However, after a while, they suddenly stopped appearing.</p>
<p>"No slacking off, no slacking off, I'm not that kind of person who slacks off. It's being made, it's being made, you'll see the new strategy guide episode soon," Old Qin said, entering the Dark Souls game interface, indicating he wasn't slacking off.</p>
<p>"You all know what strategy guides are for. They're mainly for rookies to better understand Dark Souls, and more importantly, to help players whose skills aren't up to par successfully clear the game. That's the meaning of a guide, isn't it? And Dark Souls is quite a complex game to make guides for, so they're coming out a bit slowly, but I can only say they'll be out soon," Old Qin said, opening Dark Souls.</p>
<p>Since the random mode and normal mode were not coexisting, he needed to create a new save file.</p>
<p>Old Qin skillfully created a new save file and then glanced at the creation interface.</p>
<p>There wasn't much difference from before; it was still about character selection, birth, and burial gifts.</p>
<p>After thinking, Old Qin chose to start as a Knight. The biggest advantage was that regardless of luck, he'd at least have a set of equipment he could use.</p>
<p>Of course, choosing Deprived also had its benefits: the balanced stats meant he could maximize his early-game combat prowess based on the items he acquired.</p>
<p>As long as his luck was good, the Deprived would actually be the most useful class in this mode.</p>
<p>For burial gifts, Old Qin thought about it and still chose the Flame Gemstone.</p>
<p>Because this would at least guarantee the lowest fault tolerance rate.</p>
<p>As for Life Rings or similar.</p>
<p>When it's time to die, you die.</p>
<p>After casually customizing his character, Old Qin entered the game, skipping the opening cutscene directly.</p>
<p>After all, he had seen it countless times.</p>
<p>After skipping, Old Qin didn't see the game interface in front of him, but rather several options.</p>
<p>[Randomize Items Only]
[Randomize BOSSes Only]
[Randomize All Enemies]
[Randomize Items &amp; BOSSes Only]
[Randomize All]</p>
<p>"If it's random, then it has to be completely random!" Old Qin didn't hesitate much and directly selected [Randomize All].</p>
<p>Soon after selecting, a Knight climbed out of the sarcophagus.</p>
<p>However, at this point, Old Qin noticed something: the souls in the bottom right corner weren't 0 as in the original version.</p>
<p>Instead, it showed he started with 30,000 souls, enough to level up 15 times in the game.</p>
<p>Coupled with the setting he had seen mentioned in the update earlier, players didn't need to level up with the Fire Keeper but could choose to level up at the bonfire.</p>
<p>This was clearly to give players some extra fault tolerance at the start of the game.</p>
<p>"These souls, I feel like they've become a burden!"</p>
<p>Not moving forward immediately, Old Qin, who had just woken up in the Cemetery of Ash, was somewhat speechless.</p>
<p>The bullet comments in the live stream room were filled with cheers.</p>
<p>To the right, directly ahead, the Hollow that originally served as a target for players had now become a majestic Black Knight.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Hollow in front of the fountain sculpture that focused on the Estus Flask, which players called the "Hollow before the Pulse," had turned into a plump Winged Knight.</p>
<p>If it were a 1v1, Old Qin felt that with his skill and the Knight's starting damage, he could totally take them on.</p>
<p>The key was that he <em>could</em> defeat them, but not by standing still; he needed space for movement.</p>
<p>Now? These two guys were so close, and unlike the original Hollows, they weren't sleeping. Attacking one would inevitably draw the aggro of the other.</p>
<p>Starting 1v2, and against a Winged Knight and a Greatsword-wielding Black Knight? Who could handle that!</p>
<p>Moving forward, Old Qin led the Black Knight on a detour, then rolled to create distance and ran into the small path to the right of the spawn point.</p>
<p>In this dead-end, the original mode had an item that granted 200 souls, "Soul of a Deserted Corpse."</p>
<p>Since all items were randomized, normal story items like the Estus Flask would definitely still be Estus Flasks, but these souls might not be.</p>
<p>"Give me a weapon! A weapon! A Great Machete, Dark Sword, Black Knight Greatsword, even a decent straight sword would be fine!" Because the Black Knight was fast approaching from behind, Old Qin didn't bother with praying gestures; he just simply rolled on the ground once.</p>
<p>Picked up item: Broken Straight Sword!</p>
<p>"What does this even mean!?" Old Qin was speechless.</p>
<p>He got this as his first randomized item? Could he even play with this?</p>
<p>The bullet comments in the live stream room erupted in laughter: "Haha, didn't you ask for a straight sword?"</p>
<p>"It's a weapon! And it's a straight sword, just like you wanted, no problem!"</p>
<p>"If you don't pray before drawing, that's what you get for lacking sincerity!"</p>
<p>Looking at the bullet comments, Old Qin's mouth twitched: "It's fine, there'll be more chances later. There are quite a few items to collect in the Cemetery of Ash."</p>
<p>As he spoke, Old Qin controlled his character to perform several consecutive rolls to evade the Black Knight and move forward.</p>
<p>As for the Estus Flask by the plump guy, he didn't pick it up.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the enemies in the Cemetery of Ash in randomized enemy mode were bizarre and diverse.</p>
<p>There were Jailers from the Irithyll Dungeon, Mimics in standing mode, Lothric Knights, and ordinary sewer rats.</p>
<p>Most of them were not easy to deal with.</p>
<p>Adhering to the strategy of avoiding fights if possible, Old Qin ran towards the Crystal Lizard's cave.</p>
<p>In the first playthrough, there was another soul to pick up there.</p>
<p>If he randomized into a weak enemy, he'd show them a thing or two.</p>
<p>Ignoring the "Turn back" message on the ground, Old Qin passed through the path to the Crystal Lizard's cave.</p>
<p>Inside the originally very spacious Crystal Lizard cave, a massive monster was squatting motionlessly.</p>
<p>The Stray Demon from the broken bridge at the top of Farron Keep.</p>
<p>"What the heck!"</p>
<p>He looked at the terrain, then at the location of the white glowing item, and Old Qin decisively turned back.</p>
<p>Relying on his legendary rolling skills, Old Qin arrived at the first bonfire.</p>
<p>However, he didn't choose to level up immediately but continued forward.</p>
<p>Because there were two more collectibles: one was the original Firebomb, and the other was a Titanite Shard.</p>
<p>But on the small path to collect the Firebomb, seeing a Lothric Spear Knight and a Great Axe Serpent-Man, Old Qin fell silent once more.</p>
<p>"It's fine, there's still one last hope."</p>
<p>He ran to the edge of the cliff, pressed the space bar, and jumped onto the sarcophagus.</p>
<p>At this point, Old Qin noticed there were many in-game messages on the ground; he hadn't noticed them earlier when being chased by the Black Knight.</p>
<p>"Can you still see messages left by other players in random mode?" Old Qin wondered, opening one.</p>
<p>[Black Knight Shield]
[Wolf Knight Shield]
[Great Machete]
[Red Tearstone Ring]
[Bloodlust]
[Soul of the Nameless King]</p>
<p>So many European Emperors?!</p>
<p>Looking at the messages left by other players, it was clear these were the items they had picked up.</p>
<p>This made Old Qin excited about what he might get.</p>
<p>He didn't pick it up immediately. Instead, he spun around a few times, performed the "Rest" gesture obtained when lighting a bonfire, and then Old Qin picked up the item on the ground.</p>
<p>Soul of a Fading Being!</p>
<p>"I'm spewing! You might as well have given me the original Titanite Shard!" Old Qin burst into tears.</p>
<p>Is this mode too unfriendly to African players? Can you even play with the items I'm picking up?</p>
<p>Looking at the souls in the bottom right corner, Old Qin immediately returned to the previous bonfire, spent all his souls on leveling up, emptying his reserves.</p>
<p>Then he bravely went towards the Stray Demon to pick up the item, risking his life.</p>
<p>Soul of Boreal Valley Vordt.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Old Qin finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>At least it wasn't useless trash anymore.</p>
<p>Next, Old Qin ran to the Firebomb's location to pick up that randomized item.</p>
<p>Battle Axe +4.</p>
<p>It was a weapon that came with the Warrior class, but it was +4!</p>
<p>"I hit the jackpot! A huge jackpot! Not only did I get an axe, but I also got a lot of reinforcement materials! I can feel it, my luck is back!"</p>
<p>"Let's go! Let's go see the BOSS. It's truly bitter first, then sweet! I have a premonition that this first BOSS will be very easy! Crystal Sage, Greatwood, Ice Dog, any one of them would be fine."</p>
<p>Old Qin, respawning at the bonfire, equipped the newly acquired Battle Axe +4, his former gloomy expression completely gone.</p>
<p>But after pushing open the BOSS room door, he fell silent.</p>
<p>This BOSS in front of him was indeed very weak in the original game, but what about now?</p>
<p>'Lonely Lord of the Profaned Capital - Yhorm the Giant'</p>
<p>The BOSS's name and health bar appeared on the UI at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>"Only a storm can topple the Great Tree!"</p>
<p>"Only a storm can topple the Great Tree!"</p>
<p>Old Qin glanced at the live stream room; the screen was flooded with that one sentence, which was an official message left in the original game when facing this BOSS.</p>
<p>Because Yhorm the Giant, in front of him, was actually a story-kill BOSS; he could be easily defeated by using his exclusive weapon, the Storm Ruler, making his difficulty comparable to High Lord Wolnir for the easiest BOSS.</p>
<p>But now, where was he supposed to get the Storm Ruler from?!</p>
<p>"Will you be a coward for life, or a warrior for once, even if it means being shattered to pieces?"</p>
<p>Looking at the screen full of bullet comments, Old Qin fell silent for a moment, then took a deep breath and made a decision.</p>
<p>He didn't quit the game or start a new save file as the bullet comments suggested.</p>
<p>Instead, he switched the Battle Axe in his hands to two-handed mode, unleashed his weapon art War Cry, then switched back to one-handed mode and bravely charged forward.</p>
<p>'Foot Massage Technician No. 33, Mr. Qin, at your service!'</p>
<p>With one axe swing dealing over 50 damage, Old Qin's entire concentration was intensely focused.</p>
<p>This might be the most difficult Dark Souls battle he had ever faced.</p>
<p>However, one thing made him breathe a sigh of relief: although Yhorm the Giant in front of him had incredibly abnormal defense and HP.</p>
<p>His attack power, however, was clearly balanced.</p>
<p>Attacks only took three-quarters of his health.</p>
<p>This allowed for some fault tolerance in the battle; if he were to be one-shot, it would be truly too difficult.</p>
<p>But even so, with only three Estus Flasks, the fight was extremely challenging for him.</p>
<p>Axe swing by axe swing, he meticulously "trimmed" Yhorm the Giant's toenails.</p>
<p>Ten minutes, twenty minutes…</p>
<p>Yhorm the Giant, now in his second phase, attacked even more fiercely.</p>
<p>But his attacks were still perfectly nullified by expert rolling.</p>
<p>Yhorm the Giant's HP continuously dropped.</p>
<p>The durability of the Battle Axe in Old Qin's hand had been reduced by nearly half.</p>
<p>The dawn of victory was within sight.</p>
<p>Looking at Yhorm the Giant in front of him with only a sliver of HP left, Old Qin felt exhilarated.</p>
<p>Although the weather had turned cool, his clothes were still soaked with sweat as he sat in front of his computer.</p>
<p>"Who else! Who else?"</p>
<p>With a passionate roar, Yhorm the Giant in front of him crashed to the ground.</p>
<p>[Cinders of a Lord]</p>
<p>The quest item, Cinders of a Lord, was automatically obtained.</p>
<p>And after Yhorm the Giant's body dissipated, a white light remained on the ground, rather than Yhorm the Giant's soul directly entering the inventory as in the original.</p>
<p>Following the successful slaying of Yhorm the Giant, the bullet comments in Old Qin's live stream room instantly flooded the screen.</p>
<p>'666666!'</p>
<p>'Brother Qin is too strong!'</p>
<p>'Awesome! An axe can also chop down the Great Tree!'</p>
<p>'A true tough guy dares to face the giant's jade feet!'</p>
<p>'You're the tough guy!?'</p>
<p>Watching the various praising bullet comments and gifts in the live stream room, Old Qin in front of the computer let out a long breath. The fierce battle felt as if he had returned to the first time he encountered the game Dark Souls.</p>
<p>"Only a storm can fell a great tree? Bullshit!"</p>
<p>Looking at the white light on the ground, Old Qin said disdainfully.</p>
<p>"Next up is the happy and joyful Lucky Draw Segment!"</p>
<p>With a wide smile, Old Qin stepped forward to pick up the item.</p>
<p>Dung Pie!</p>
<p>Looking at the item that popped up on the screen.</p>
<p><em>Crack!</em></p>
<p>Old Qin seemed to hear something shattering in his ears.</p>
<p>Having not been defeated by Yhorm the Giant, this time he could finally no longer bear this cruel reality.</p>
<p>"I... I'll just start a new save file."</p>
