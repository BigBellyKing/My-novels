                <p>Chapter 379: Going to Lose Money Again (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>There aren't many days left until the Spring Festival, and Nebula Games has pretty much entered a more relaxed state, as preparations for the Spring Festival event content were largely completed in advance.</p>
<p>For the team, the subsequent DLC for <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> focusing on Marston has not yet been included in the development plan.</p>
<p>The main work at hand is the online content.</p>
<p>However, there isn't much left to do, as things like the manor-related gameplay have already undergone multi-directional testing based on previous themes and are largely perfected.</p>
<p>Remaining directions and events will be coordinated with the Spring Festival's site-wide game discounts.</p>
<p>It's the New Year, so there should be New Year's joy.</p>
<p>Weapon skins and boxes for <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>?</p>
<p>Discounted!</p>
<p>Weapon skins and boxes for <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>?</p>
<p>Also discounted!</p>
<p>Who wouldn't prepare some New Year's goods during the New Year?</p>
<p>This is him, a very conscientious designer.</p>
<p>A 300 Yuan game at a 50% discount means he loses 150 Yuan.</p>
<p>He loses 150 Yuan for every copy a player buys; just thinking about it feels like doing charity!</p>
<p>But there's no other way; doing an event always comes with certain responsibilities.</p>
<p>Of course, besides the various charitable discount events that are pushing Nebula Games towards bankruptcy, there's also an additional themed gift event.</p>
<p>During the development of <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, Chen Xu and his team also made some new moves.</p>
<p>These were the creation of some game-themed scenes.</p>
<p>And these themed scenes can be said to have significant collection value.</p>
<p>So Chen Xu's decision was not to sell them, but only to give them away.</p>
<p>To give a New Year's gift to the players who have always supported Nebula Games.</p>
<p>Anyone who has spent a cumulative total of 500 Yuan on the Nebula Games Platform will receive a VR themed scene of the Firelink Shrine from <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>Those who have spent a cumulative total of 1,000 Yuan will receive a VR themed scene of the Astera Settlement from <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>.</p>
<p>And those who have spent a cumulative total of 2,000 Yuan will receive a VR themed scene of Stormwind, the human capital from <em>Warcraft</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, if players haven't reached the spending threshold, he's also prepared a big gift for them...</p>
<p>That is, a VR themed scene of Mount Massive Asylum from <em>Outlast</em>!</p>
<p>But don't assume Nebula Games is being inhumane just because it's <em>Outlast</em>.</p>
<p>This will be a special New Year's edition of the Mount Massive Asylum VR themed scene.</p>
<p>The entire asylum will no longer have a gloomy and terrifying atmosphere, but will be filled with a joyful New Year's ambiance. At that time, Mount Massive Asylum will be brightly lit and adorned with festive decorations.</p>
<p>The NPC priest will go on stage to give a New Year's speech, and the Fat Uncle, Scissors Doctor, and the patients in the asylum will all be enjoying themselves harmoniously.</p>
<p>Of course, since it's a special New Year's edition, everyone will return to their duties after the New Year.</p>
<p>As for these themes, they are naturally preparations for the subsequent porting of games originally on the PC platform.</p>
<p>Porting all content is not something that can be completed in a day or two.</p>
<p>These themed scenes are mainly to add to the festivities for players and give them something to look forward to.</p>
<p>Incidentally, these themed game scenes also contain some playable content, which serves as a preliminary survey for players to see their performance and related operating habits in VR mode.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>Dark Souls</em> on PC, players mostly roll around on the ground when facing a BOSS.</p>
<p>But if it's made into VR mode, they have to consider whether to use a more immersive first-person perspective or a third-person over-the-shoulder perspective.</p>
<p>There's also the camera work in the game; you can't have the camera really rolling on the ground from a first-person perspective when a player rolls, or when facing a massive BOSS, can a player's first-person view truly only be focused on scraping calluses?</p>
<p>These things can also be previewed and investigated through the content in the VR themed scenes.</p>
<p>Of course, not all of them are ported games.</p>
<p>For example, the <em>Warcraft</em> themed scene will be Stormwind, a human capital city.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu has no plans to port <em>Warcraft</em> to VR, as RTS games are indeed not suitable for playing on VR platforms.</p>
<p>As for WOW, Chen Xu currently has no plans, because if he were to develop it, Chen Xu would certainly not be satisfied with merely restoring the quality of his previous life or just making the graphics better on the PC platform.</p>
<p>Given the current VR technology level, WOW would clearly be a huge challenge.</p>
<p>Because it needs to consider the situation of a sufficient number of players.</p>
<p>Moreover, in terms of map and content, the workload for WOW would be immeasurably larger than <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>.</p>
<p>After all, <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> only needs to create a few fictional states, but WOW involves the entire Azeroth.</p>
<p>Putting up a <em>Warcraft</em> VR theme now is simply because it's a relatively major IP for Nebula Games, and it also serves to accumulate some art resources and experience.</p>
<p>Including subsequent updates, Chen Xu will only consider truly bringing Azeroth to the Parallel World when the technology is sufficient.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>As the Spring Festival approached, many people were very happy.</p>
<p>After all, the New Year holiday had begun, and it was the longest holiday of the year.</p>
<p>Everyone was immersed in the festive atmosphere.</p>
<p>Many players also prepared various New Year's goods in advance.</p>
<p>Of course, compared to when online shopping wasn't convenient, many players are now more accustomed to purchasing their New Year's essentials online.</p>
<p>And it was at this time that Chen Xu's official Weibo account took the lead.</p>
<p>Players who were browsing online, wondering what to buy or what games to play for the New Year, immediately started discussing after seeing Chen Xu's official Weibo post.</p>
<p>“It’s here, it’s here! As expected, Nebula Games has another holiday sale this year!”</p>
<p>“Holy cow, Spring Sale, Summer Sale, Autumn Sale, Winter Sale, New Year's Sale, so Nebula Games Platform has sales events all year round!?”</p>
<p>“Don’t say anything, I just want to ask, is it good or not?!”</p>
<p>“It’s good, but my wallet can’t handle it!”</p>
<p>“This damn green discount, why does it have such magical power? My hand suddenly can’t control itself, no… my money!”</p>
<p>“Games that were originally over three or four hundred Yuan are now all under two hundred! Chen Xu is going to lose so much money he becomes the richest man!”</p>
<p>“Wait, brothers! There’s a new event this year!”</p>
<p>“Let me see… Holy cow, limited themes!?”</p>
<p>“500 for a <em>Dark Souls</em> VR theme, 1,000 for <em>Monster Hunter</em>, damn it, and it’s cumulative spending, meaning my previous spending counts too?”</p>
<p>“Wait, is there something wrong mixed into these VR themes? What the heck is a New Year's special edition Mount Massive Asylum?!”</p>
<p>Looking at Chen Xu's official Weibo post, players still immersed in the New Year's atmosphere were completely stunned.</p>
