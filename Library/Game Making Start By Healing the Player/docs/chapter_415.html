                <p>Chapter 414: Princess Zelda, Wait for Me, Link! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the quest location, Song Ren controlled Link to insert the Sheikah Slate into the mechanism.</p>
<p>Immediately after, the entire screen began to shake violently. The ground and mountains started to tremble intensely, and the Switch controller in Song Ren's hand also provided feedback through HD Rumble.</p>
<p>The game camera zoomed into the distance. Amidst the violent shaking, birds in the forest flew away in fright, and foraging squirrels hid in fear. Even the Bokoblins, infected by dark power, looked around nervously.</p>
<p>As the hillsides around the ruins ruptured, a tall tower slowly rose, and Link's position was on the platform at its apex. This tower soared past the dilapidated ruins, past the snow-capped mountains, finally becoming the highest point of the Great Plateau, offering an unobstructed view of everything around it.</p>
<p>And it wasn't just one; similar tall towers across Hyrule slowly ascended. As the entire cinematic ended, Link, who had fallen, stood up and looked around curiously. At the same time, the camera zoomed out to display the full scenery of the Great Plateau. At the top of the screen, 'Great Plateau Tower' flashed as a location introduction.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, as the device on the tower activated, a blue, liquid-like substance dripped onto the center of the Sheikah Slate. After successfully receiving data transmission from the Great Plateau Tower, opening the Sheikah Slate's map revealed that a section of the originally blank map was now displayed—though this was just the tip of the iceberg of the entire game world.</p>
<p>Standing at the top of the tower, Song Ren couldn't help but marvel. It was simply too beautiful; up close, he might not have perceived its full beauty. But when the camera pulled back, the unique animated art style of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was fully revealed to the players, presenting a distinct kind of beauty. Lush green grasslands and forests, pure white clouds complemented by warm sunlight—it was truly like a painting from a dream.</p>
<p>‘Remember... try to remember. You... have been asleep for 100 years.’</p>
<p>‘Once the monster regains its true power, the world will face its end.’</p>
<p>‘So, while there's still time, Link! You must hurry... hurry...’</p>
<p>While Song Ren was still marveling at the game's beautiful scenery, Princess Zelda's voice rang out in his ear once more. But it was already incredibly weak. From these lines, Song Ren had already understood the game's plot. Just as players online had speculated, it was a hero-saves-princess story. A powerful figure returns to save the world, complete with a memory loss trope. One could only say the protagonist truly lived up to his role. Everything was now in place; all that remained was action. And this was his forte!</p>
<p>“It's just saving a princess, a piece of cake! Didn't I rescue Princess Peach from Bowser before? Princess Zelda, huh? Just you wait for me, Link!” Playing games was all about immersion, and Song Ren's acting bug kicked in, making him shout inwardly. Of course, considering he was in a public coffee shop, he kept his exuberance in check.</p>
<p>Next, the mysterious old man he had encountered earlier flew over, piloting a paraglider. He briefly introduced Link to the game's worldview, further confirming Song Ren's suspicions. 100 years ago, a calamity named Ganon suddenly descended upon Hyrule, destroying the Hyrule Kingdom. For a century, the calamity's power had not vanished, instead lingering above the capital. To reach that calamity-shrouded castle, one had to leave the Great Plateau.</p>
<p>However, this Great Plateau was an isolated island on the continent, surrounded on all sides by cliffs. Jumping down from it would only result in being smashed to pieces, unless one possessed a paraglider like his. But to obtain the paraglider, Link would have to help him retrieve the treasures hidden within the shrines. Only then would he give the paraglider to Link.</p>
<p>Looking at the received quest, Song Ren was speechless. “So the rogue was right beside me all along! The world is about to be destroyed, and I, the hero, am going to defeat the Great Demon King and rescue the princess, yet now you want me to go find treasure.” Gazing at the quest he received from the mysterious old man, and a nearby shrine shimmering with dark red light, Song Ren couldn't help but grumble inwardly.</p>
<p>However, he also knew this was a common narrative pattern for this type of game. A slightly better version would have the old man offering an explanation later, calling it a trial and test for the hero. Something like, ‘Ah! Hero, you have gained my approval, and the great task of saving the world and the princess is now yours.’</p>
<p>However, after experiencing Super Mario Odyssey earlier, Song Ren didn't feel much disappointment now. That's because Super Mario Odyssey's plot wasn't exactly stellar either. Furthermore, combined with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's animated art style, a storyline that he would repeatedly criticize in a realistic art style felt surprisingly appropriate at this moment.</p>
<p>No choice but to go find the treasure. Arriving at the first shrine, Song Ren placed the Sheikah Slate into the mechanism on the circular platform, then entered the shrine. The closest first shrine was meant to teach Link, and by extension the players, how to utilize his Magnesis ability.</p>
<p>The so-called Magnesis was represented by a magnet symbol. Once selected, players could freely control any metallic object within range and move them as they wished.</p>
<p>The shrines were primarily for players to solve puzzles, using the abilities they learned to figure out how to open the path ahead. Grabbing iron blocks to push aside boulders blocking the way, grabbing iron plates to make bridges across impassable ravines, and using Magnesis to pull open large, closed iron gates.</p>
<p>“This Magnesis ability seems quite interesting!” Song Ren used Magnesis to drag a metal cube back and forth. To describe his current state in one sentence: ‘Is it fun? Do you know how to play? Never played before, right?’ Hmm... he really hadn't.</p>
<p>Although he knew this was merely a tutorial level designed to teach him how to use his abilities, it sparked considerable anticipation for what was to come. After playing around in place for over a minute, Song Ren properly proceeded to solve the shrine's puzzles.</p>
<p>The first shrine wasn't very difficult; he quickly completed it and obtained a Trial Certificate. A question that had previously bothered Song Ren was also answered. It turned out the game did have an upgrade system, but it wasn't the usual monster-slaying. Instead, it involved solving various shrines on the map, with each completed shrine yielding a Trial Certificate. Collecting four of these would allow him to pray before a Goddess Statue to exchange them for increased health or stamina.</p>
<p>After exiting the shrine, the mysterious old man spoke with Link again, promising to give him the paraglider once he had navigated to the other three shrines. 'Old rogue!' Song Ren grumbled inwardly once more.</p>
