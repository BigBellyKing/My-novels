                <p>Chapter 314: God Has Mercy, But FUZE Does Not (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>When Song Ren and his five teammates were ready for battle.</p>
<p>The Alpha-numeric squad, who had switched from defense to offense, seemed much more relaxed at this moment.</p>
<p>"Victory!" Pulse, who had been the unlucky one in the first match, was now smiling broadly.</p>
<p>Especially in the previous round, his Remote Charge had directly blown up three people, though one of them was his own teammate.</p>
<p>"But this game's maps are really confusing; I couldn't even find the bomb's location."</p>
<p>"It should be on the first or second floor. I went to the basement but didn't find it."</p>
<p>Sledge and Ash from the team spoke up.</p>
<p>"Don't tell me, this game is actually quite fun."</p>
<p>"Save the bragging for later, let's finish quickly, I'm about to eat."</p>
<p>Blackbeard and Buck from the squad also chimed in.</p>
<p>This round, the few of them played more relaxed. Of course, learning from Song Ren's painful lesson, they didn't choose to play with shields or anything similar.</p>
<p>The only Operator chosen by anyone was Pulse, who had been on defense earlier, picking FUZE, the same Operator the opponents had used last round.</p>
<p>"The enemy should be on the third floor, look, that panel has been replaced!" The former Pulse, now FUZE, sharply noticed the difference and alerted the team.</p>
<p>"Alright, we'll slowly advance indoors. You use the grappling hook to breach the window. We'll attack from both inside and out, letting them know what a real counter-terrorism force is!" Sledge, playing as the team's leader and the one who turned the tide earlier, said to the others.</p>
<p>With clear division of labor, four of them, led by Sledge, cautiously advanced towards the second floor, wary of anyone ambushing them.</p>
<p>They steadily pushed towards the second floor, and as for drones, they had clearly forgotten about them.</p>
<p>This is a common mistake for many new players transitioning from other games to <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>: they often neglect drone usage.</p>
<p>But if you were to say that new players don't prioritize information gathering, then as defenders, everyone, regardless of who they are, diligently watches the cameras.</p>
<p>They'd lie down on the ground, pull out their phones, and start watching the surveillance.</p>
<p>Joey in the Kids' Bedroom also gave a warning.</p>
<p>"They're coming up to the second floor!"</p>
<p>"Ready for battle! Joey, keep monitoring, don't alert the enemy! Today, the room stands, we stand; the room falls, we fall! We shall live and die with the mansion!" Song Ren said in a low voice.</p>
<p>All their gun barrels were aimed at the main entrance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, FUZE, acting alone, was having a blast. The three-armor, one-speed FUZE ran quite slowly, and his footsteps were incredibly loud, but he didn't care if he was heard; it would just divert the others' attention.</p>
<p>He shot his grappling hook onto the roof and slowly began to climb.</p>
<p>Soon, he reached the second floor. At this point, he was studying his Operator's ability.</p>
<p>It was his first time playing this Operator, and he still didn't know how to use him.</p>
<p>At this moment, the others had also reached the second floor. Although a bomb was in the workshop just across the wall, they, being unfamiliar with the map, had no idea.</p>
<p>Everyone's attention was drawn to the children's bedroom in front of them.</p>
<p>Inside the room, Joey stopped watching the cameras, knowing that the enemy was already at the door.</p>
<p>Outside, the Alpha-numeric squad had already aimed down sights, ready for battle.</p>
<p>"Soon, I'll smash the door with Sledge. Buck, prepare your flashbang. Whether we survive their blinding spray depends on our luck. Don't stop moving, even if you die, die inside the room!" Sledge outlined the upcoming assault tactics.</p>
<p>"Also, FUZE, you might have to suffer a bit, because you need to make the first move. Fire your weapon as a signal! The moment you shoot to attract their attention, you might get killed, but we'll rush in then to finish the clean-up." Sledge said.</p>
<p>"No problem!" FUZE hadn't even figured out his ability yet, but hearing his teammate's plan, he resolutely agreed to execute it.</p>
<p>It's just sacrificing himself! For the team's victory, he was willing!</p>
<p>"Get ready, I'm starting!" FUZE outside the room took a deep breath. However, he didn't choose a simple gunshot; instead, he planned to try a trick.</p>
<p>It was the breaching entry he'd seen in the promotional trailer; he hadn't tried it yet.</p>
<p>"I think it should be this ability?" Looking at the disc in his hand, he was a bit confused, but he didn't overthink it. After all, wasn't he just cannon fodder?</p>
<p>"Ready, I'm starting!" He jammed the item in his hand onto the reinforced panels, planted his feet on the wall, and FUZE looked excited.</p>
<p>For the VR version's breaching air-drop setting, Chen Xu had modified it to be different from his previous life; it didn't require using breaching charges.</p>
<p>One could directly perform a flying kick air-drop. While a flying kick couldn't break reinforced panels, it would trigger a corresponding action, and FUZE was now performing that action.</p>
<p>"Fire your weapon as a signal! We're waiting for you!" Sledge outside the room was ready for battle.</p>
<p>"Then, let's begin!! Ura!!!!!" Since FUZE was Russian, the FUZE player enthusiastically shouted an iconic line, feeling fully immersed.</p>
<p>He fired his weapon in mid-air while simultaneously pressing the remote control.</p>
<p>But the expected explosion didn't occur. Instead, there was a 'thump-thump-thump-thump-thump-thump...'</p>
<p>This made him pause.</p>
<p>Inside the room, Zhang Yi heard the thumping sound and suddenly panicked.</p>
<p>Damn it, he had played FUZE in the first round, and this sound was all too familiar.</p>
<p>But could FUZE's ability penetrate reinforced panels?!</p>
<p>"Run! The bombs are coming!" Zhang Yi shouted in alarm, controlling his character to stand up from a crouch.</p>
<p>At that moment, Sledge instantly breached the door, and four burly men burst into the room.</p>
<p>Influenced by that "Ura!", the Sledge player's dramatic flair kicked in the moment the door was breached.</p>
<p>Although the game didn't have public voice chat, it didn't stop him from performing!</p>
<p>"FBI! Open The Door!"</p>
<p>Accompanied by the spirited words, the four rushed into the room.</p>
<p>'Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p>
<p>[123 triggered friendly fire]</p>
<p>[123 killed himself]</p>
<p>[123 killed abc]</p>
<p>[123 killed qwe]</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>[Player 123's malicious behavior in the match has been detected. They have been kicked from the match and banned for 30 minutes as a warning. All Operators are requested to treat new players kindly, play harmoniously, and cherish their accounts.]</p>
<p>[Draw]</p>
<p>Compared to the previous life's setting where both sides gained 1 point for a draw, Chen Xu chose for a draw to award no points, maintaining the status quo as if the round hadn't happened.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, no one cared about the rare draw; everyone was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>FUZE nine kills?</p>
<p>No, FUZE ten kills!</p>
<p>The opponent was so ruthless they even killed themselves!</p>
<p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Outside the Internet Cafe, everyone who witnessed this scene burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Inside the game, with one teammate down, the four opponents fell silent for a moment and then all exited the game.</p>
<p>In a five-player premade mode, no random players would fill the match.</p>
<p>With no enemies left, Song Ren and his team directly won and proceeded to the final settlement screen.</p>
<p>However, at this point, Song Ren and his team no longer cared about winning or losing; only the shadow of that recent scene remained in their minds.</p>
