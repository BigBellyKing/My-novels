                <p>Chapter 433: I Was Born for Treasure, and I Must Seek My Treasure! (Please subscribe and vote for monthly passes)</p>
<p>Online, Atari has been relentlessly promoting itself since its announcement, with various leaks emerging endlessly.</p>
<p>Even when there were no more game content leaks, they started from behind the scenes. Game planners, level designers, even voice actors, and other miscellaneous figures took turns appearing.</p>
<p>It was then that some players following Nebula Games and Chen Xu's official Weibo account discovered that Nebula Games had finally made its move.</p>
<p>It was the familiar official Weibo-style promotion, with only a video attachment and one sentence on Chen Xu's official Weibo:</p>
<p>'I was born for treasure, and I must seek my treasure.'</p>
<p>Many players were already familiar with this text because it had been mentioned in the menu information they collected earlier.</p>
<p>What truly captivated players was the video.</p>
<p>Players, filled with excitement, immediately opened the video, and then everyone was stunned.</p>
<p>Are these graphics for real?</p>
<p>Watching the video's content, countless players' eyes widened.</p>
<p>'Nathan Drake, an insignificant little thief.'</p>
<p>As ruins collapsed, Nathan Drake lunged towards a gold coin engraved with a skull mark.</p>
<p>'Someone who would risk life and limb for a treasure.'</p>
<p>'I guess that's how everyone sees me.'</p>
<p>'And that's how I'm remembered.'</p>
<p>'But I'm not that kind of person.'</p>
<p>The next moment, the camera moved past the gold coin. Behind it, his brother Sam Drake was about to fall into the abyss. Nathan Drake lunged, trying desperately to grab Sam's arm.</p>
<p>'It's all destined, Nathan.'</p>
<p>Under a cross-river bridge, young Nathan and Sam looked at the neon city in the distance.</p>
<p>'You, me, us together, we're destined to find treasure.'</p>
<p>Next, they arrived at a cave. Holding torches and weapons, they activated a mechanism in a ruin.</p>
<p>'Paradise awaits those who prove their worth.'</p>
<p>Passing through the dark cave, Nathan Drake and Sam Drake gazed in awe at the distant sight. A valley covered in lush, green vegetation, with crumbling, dilapidated houses overgrown with green vines, told a story of countless years.</p>
<p>Distant, vaguely discernible buildings were submerged in water. It was incredibly spectacular and profoundly shocking.</p>
<p>'This is it, another treasure in my hands.'</p>
<p>Amidst flames, Nathan Drake looked at the coin with an island mark in his hand, his eyes complex. Beside him were countless gold and silver treasures. Nathan Drake then tossed the coin into the sky.</p>
<p>'How many chances have I thrown away... to return to a normal life?'</p>
<p>As the coin flipped, a series of images flashed by. In an office, Nathan Drake repeatedly stamped documents, his expression lifeless. At home, he held a plate, staring blankly at a painting on the wall.</p>
<p>'It took him a long time to get rid of this!'</p>
<p>'But this is what he wanted to do.'</p>
<p>Before setting sail, Sam and Sully were arguing.</p>
<p>'I was born for treasure, and I must seek my treasure.'</p>
<p>Riding a motorcycle, he sped wildly through the streets, facing armored vehicles like tanks. A series of gunfights, combat, and explosions ensued. From the city to the forest, then to the sea.</p>
<p>'I once promised I'd never do these things again in my life.'</p>
<p>Holding newly discovered clues, a visibly excited Drake pushed open the door and saw Elena, his expression instantly freezing.</p>
<p>'If you stop lying to me, then you shouldn't lie to yourself either,' Elena said, tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>Following this was a series of adventures with Sully, Elena, and Nathan Drake.</p>
<p>The scene returned to the house, where Nathan Drake remained silent.</p>
<p>'How long have we been looking for these treasures?'</p>
<p>'For a very, very long time...'</p>
<p>'No offense, but they just don't understand.'</p>
<p>A series of fragmented shots were edited together, finally returning to the burning treasure site.</p>
<p>The gold coin thrown into the sky slowly descended.</p>
<p>The firelight and the coin reflected Nathan Drake's face.</p>
<p>'So now only one question remains...'</p>
<p>'Is it all worth it?'</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>The entire promotional video finished playing.</p>
<p>All the players who watched the video became excited.</p>
<p>'Oh my god, this scene is incredible!'</p>
<p>'The graphics are explosive, is this for real?'</p>
<p>'Not just the graphics, but the game's scenes too, it's explosive throughout, with gunfights, combat, and explosions, feels like it never stops!'</p>
<p>'Exactly, exactly! Especially the explosions, they feel even more awesome than some movies!'</p>
<p>'How could it not be awesome? Haven't you seen the news? All the explosion scenes in the game were made using real-world models and then detonated!'</p>
<p>'Holy cow, that's intense?'</p>
<p>Many players were enthusiastically discussing it after watching the 'Uncharted' trailer.</p>
<p>So far, Nebula Games had only conducted two rounds of promotion. The first involved various Easter eggs integrated into the VR theme, revealing the game's setting and protagonist Nathan Drake's life experiences, including his discoveries of Shambhala, El Dorado, and Libertalia.</p>
<p>This time, it touched upon the game's gameplay content. A series of explosive scenes, car chases, gunfights, explosions, and various legendary treasure ruins were all present.</p>
<p>But this video actually released a lot of information about the game's content and story. Although the video didn't directly tell the entire game's story, it contained many fragments and dialogue.</p>
<p>Through these clips and dialogues, players could roughly infer the story outline. Clearly, 'Uncharted' is a story about adventure and family. Nathan Drake wants to find those legendary treasures. However, he is not like the great pirates of history, because what he yearns for is not the treasure itself, but the meaning of discovering treasure. Yet, he must also make choices between family and a stable life.</p>
<p>The overall narrative of 'Uncharted' could be felt just by watching the trailer: an explosive adventure interspersed with themes of family responsibility or romance.</p>
<p>Not only players, but even gaming industry designers were stunned by 'Uncharted's graphics. Although it was just a regular video and not a VR experience, its visual performance was definitely CGI-level. Furthermore, from the detailed presentation in the video, many designers felt only one thing: demanding!</p>
<p>While the loading technology of gaming pods had improved, it certainly helped with game graphics, but it shouldn't have improved this much! Had Nebula Games become even more insane, making players endure five or six minutes of loading before entering the game?</p>
<p>Many industry designers expressed shock. But then, based on the information released by Nebula Games, many industry designers showed expressions of realization and bewilderment. Why such outstanding visual performance? Because, judging by the content released for 'Uncharted', it turned out to be a thread-based game!</p>
