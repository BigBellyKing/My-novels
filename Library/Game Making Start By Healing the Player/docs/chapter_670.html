                <p>Chapter 669: The Answers Soon to Be Revealed (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Filled with rage, Zhang Yi fought his way to Comstock's mansion laboratory.</p>
<p>Although there wasn't any time limit or similar constraint in this particular level of the game.</p>
<p>Yet, thinking of Elizabeth who was still suffering, Zhang Yi wasn't willing to waste a single second.</p>
<p>After a fierce battle, the Siphon device, used to paralyze and restrict Elizabeth's abilities, was shut down.</p>
<p>Having regained her powers, an enraged Elizabeth immediately created a massive spatial rift.</p>
<p>On the other side of the spatial rift was a raging tornado, whose immense power instantly sucked in the researchers who had been tormenting Elizabeth.</p>
<p>“Holy cow, that's amazing!” Zhang Yi's eyes widened. He had always felt that Elizabeth was harmless.</p>
<p>The only time Elizabeth had killed someone in the game was when she killed Daisy, the leader of the Vox Populi, earlier.</p>
<p>In his impression, Elizabeth should be more of a support character.</p>
<p>But now, it seemed the power of this spatial rift was far greater than he had imagined.</p>
<p>Elizabeth herself might not possess such immense power, but she could harness the forces of nature.</p>
<p>For example, after opening a spatial rift, behind it could be lava or a storm.</p>
<p>Having successfully rescued Elizabeth and helped her get dressed.</p>
<p>Booker told Elizabeth that he had found a way to control the Songbird, and now he could take Elizabeth away from here.</p>
<p>Whether it was to Paris or anywhere else.</p>
<p>However, this suggestion was rejected by Elizabeth. The things she had experienced and witnessed in the sky city had given her a firm resolve.</p>
<p>‘I won’t leave, I’m going to find Comstock.’</p>
<p>‘Why?’</p>
<p>‘Look what he's done to me. I will never allow something like this to happen again.’</p>
<p>‘And then? Are you going to kill him?’</p>
<p>‘Booker, are you going to start lecturing now? You forgot, I understand you.’</p>
<p>‘I won’t let you kill him.’</p>
<p>‘Really, Booker? Then how will you stop me!’</p>
<p>Elizabeth, putting on her coat, looked resolutely at Booker in front of her.</p>
<p>Behind her, a space tore open, and a terrifying tornado raged there, combining with the lightning in the sky like the end of the world.</p>
<p>Facing such an Elizabeth, Booker, holding his gun, quietly said: “I’m not trying to stop you, I’m going to stop him for you.”</p>
<p>Hearing Booker’s words, Elizabeth retracted her powers. She understood what Booker meant.</p>
<p>Because Booker didn't want her to kill again, especially when the target was her father.</p>
<p>Although Elizabeth had no impression or emotional connection to this father whatsoever.</p>
<p>Then Booker and Elizabeth continued their journey, cutting down anyone in their path as they headed towards Comstock’s private airship.</p>
<p>After pushing open a door, they finally met the so-called Prophet Comstock.</p>
<p>But to Zhang Yi’s surprise, there wasn't the fierce battle he had imagined.</p>
<p>At this moment, Comstock was merely softly calling out to Elizabeth, like a benevolent old man.</p>
<p>‘Child, come here, come now, I won’t bite.’</p>
<p>‘Oh, my, you've grown so big.’</p>
<p>Facing Elizabeth, who walked over, Comstock took her hand.</p>
<p>‘Tell me, what exactly am I?’ Elizabeth asked, looking at Comstock before her.</p>
<p>Facing Elizabeth’s questioning, he merely continued speaking to himself, then looked at Booker.</p>
<p>‘Look at you… child, you're a mess, everything I’ve done was to keep you safe.’</p>
<p>‘DeWitt Booker, I was such a fool. I sent mighty armies to stop you, put you in a hail of bullets from on high, I tried everything to keep you from her, when all I really needed to do was simply tell her the truth.’</p>
<p>‘Ask him… child… ask him what happened to your finger, ask DeWitt Booker.’</p>
<p>‘Ask him! Ask this false shepherd!’</p>
<p>And when Comstock grew emotional and began to lay hands on Elizabeth, accusing Booker of being the true cause of all her suffering.</p>
<p>Booker in the game, unable to contain his rage, stepped forward and grabbed Comstock.</p>
<p>‘She’s your daughter, you beast! You abandoned her! Was it worth it? Did you achieve your goal? Tell me! Tell me!’</p>
<p>‘You imprisoned her for life, cut off her finger, and then blamed all this sin on me!’</p>
<p>The furious Booker held Comstock underwater until he drowned.</p>
<p>Dead?</p>
<p>The mastermind BOSS in the game died so easily?</p>
<p>Watching the now dead Comstock, Zhang Yi in the game was also a bit bewildered.</p>
<p>Even if a BOSS isn't necessarily strong, like the King of the Wild Hunt at the end of The Witcher: Wild Hunt, but there wasn't even a fight?</p>
<p>This minor character was defeated too thoroughly.</p>
<p>However, beyond that, what made Zhang Yi even more curious was the content within the game.</p>
<p>Elizabeth related to Booker?</p>
<p>The reason for Elizabeth's severed finger?</p>
<p>Elizabeth asked Booker, and Booker naturally claimed ignorance.</p>
<p>But at that very moment, Booker began to bleed from his nose.</p>
<p>At this point, Elizabeth seemed to understand something and said to Booker: “You did it, you just forgot.”</p>
<p>Nosebleed, did it but forgot? Extra memories conflicting with past memories, and Parallel Worlds?</p>
<p>Could it be?</p>
<p>Watching the game's plot, Zhang Yi, who suddenly realized something himself, had an incredible thought arise in his mind at that moment.</p>
<p>Could it be that the game's story was truly as he imagined?</p>
<p>Without further questioning Booker, the Vox Populi army attacked.</p>
<p>The two controlled the Songbird to repel the attack from the Vox Populi organization, then commanded the Songbird to completely destroy the Siphon machine.</p>
<p>At this moment, Elizabeth’s powers were completely unleashed. No one knew how many Parallel Worlds she had seen, no one knew what she had truly learned.</p>
<p>When the Songbird tried to attack Booker and her, Elizabeth, having completely unleashed all her powers, simply waved her hand.</p>
<p>Booker, she, and the Songbird were all teleported to another timespace.</p>
<p>A city located deep beneath the sea.</p>
<p>However, it appeared to have been ravaged by war. From the surrounding buildings and facilities, it was clear that this was a world no less magnificent than Columbia, the Sky City.</p>
<p>“So, could this be a new scene, a new map in the upcoming sequel?”</p>
<p>The mysterious underwater city before him greatly surprised Zhang Yi, especially since he already knew that, besides this game, BioShock Infinite.</p>
<p>Nebula Games would also launch the sequel to BioShock in half a month.</p>
<p>It must be said, this underwater city was simply too cool.</p>
<p>Although it didn't appear as prosperous as Columbia, the Sky City.</p>
<p>It was clearly a city ravaged by war.</p>
<p>So, what kind of scene and imagery would this mysterious underwater city have been like during its most prosperous period?</p>
<p>However, Zhang Yi's attention quickly returned to the game, because the various secrets within BioShock Infinite were about to be revealed.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi had a premonition that the questions that had plagued him would soon be answered.</p>
