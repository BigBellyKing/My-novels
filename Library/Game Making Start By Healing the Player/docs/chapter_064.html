                <p>Chapter 64: Promotional Interview</p>
<p>"Qin Yi, the rice is overcooked, and you're still chopping vegetables!"</p>
<p>"What do you want me to do? You said you'd wash the plates, but there isn't a single clean one to put food on. What else can I do but chop vegetables!"</p>
<p>"You're infuriating!"</p>
<p>"I'm just as infuriated!"</p>
<p>In the Nebula Games office, Zhao Zhuo, in charge of Level Design, and Qin Yi, in charge of Numerical Design, had the following conversation.</p>
<p>This was the fourth such incident arising from testing after the game's DEMO was released.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, is this game really for couples, meant to foster and nurture relationships?" Yang Xin looked at Chen Xu with a very strange gaze.</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue next to her didn't speak, but her head nodding like a woodpecker fully conveyed that she shared Yang Xin's thoughts.</p>
<p>"Ahem, of course, it's not just for couples. Friendships and brotherhood can also enjoy this game," Chen Xu summarized solemnly.</p>
<p>"The reason it's like this is simply that Qin Yi and Zhao Zhuo are both quite competitive," Chen Xu added.</p>
<p>"I just feel like something's not right," Yang Xin muttered, looking at the <em>Overcooked</em> game screen in front of her.</p>
<p>At first, she felt this game was genuinely universally loved.</p>
<p>But now?</p>
<p>She remained reserved, having tried it herself.</p>
<p>On easy difficulty and just to clear it, there wasn't much problem.</p>
<p>But aiming for three stars? Her blood pressure would instantly shoot up, and sometimes she couldn't help but get a little frustrated.</p>
<p>"Alright, Sister Xin, you and Senior Sister can keep an eye on the game's promotional video. I also need to accept a media interview."</p>
<p>Chen Xu said, changing the subject as he looked at the two who wanted to continue discussing <em>Overcooked</em> with him.</p>
<p>"Media interview?" Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue were a little surprised.</p>
<p>"It's an exclusive interview with Game Timespace, also in preparation for the new game's promotion," Chen Xu said.</p>
<p>Hearing this, the two realized.</p>
<p>After exchanging a few words with Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin, Chen Xu walked towards the office.</p>
<p>This interview, while ostensibly for the promotion of <em>Overcooked</em>, was also beneficial for him.</p>
<p>In fact, quite a few media outlets were genuinely interested in him.</p>
<p>After all, in the gaming industry, he still had some gap in recognition compared to those top-tier Game Designers and masters.</p>
<p>But at least within the independent game circle, the name Chen Xu still carried some renown.</p>
<p>"Teacher Chen, it's a pleasure to meet you! A great pleasure!"</p>
<p>Pushing open the office door, Wu Tian, an editor from Game Timespace, greeted Chen Xu with an excited expression.</p>
<p>From the moment he accidentally stumbled upon <em>Undertale</em> and experienced the shock it delivered,</p>
<p>he had actually been quietly following Chen Xu. And Chen Xu's subsequent works had not disappointed him.</p>
<p>The emotional impact brought by <em>To the Moon</em> made even tough guys cry, and as for <em>Outlast</em>...</p>
<p>While personally, he wasn't particularly fond of horror games.</p>
<p>But he had to admit, it was definitely an excellent horror game, one that could make even tough guys wet themselves.</p>
<p>It could be said that he had long admired Chen Xu as a Game Designer.</p>
<p>So, upon learning of the opportunity for an interview, he immediately applied to his editor-in-chief for this chance.</p>
<p>"No need to call me Teacher Chen, just call me by my name," Chen Xu said, feeling a bit awkward as Wu Tian called him Teacher Chen.</p>
<p>Although in his previous life, with the emergence of various rising stars, "Teacher Chen" and his glorious photos on his computer hard drive were no longer a big deal.</p>
<p>But in the photography industry, "Teacher Chen" was still considered a pioneering patriarch.</p>
<p>So, whenever someone called him Teacher Chen, Chen Xu always felt the title sounded a bit disreputable.</p>
<p>Wu Tian paused at his words, somewhat at a loss. After all, from his perspective, "Teacher" was just a respectful title, a perfectly normal way to address someone in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>"Uh... then, Mr. Chen, first of all, thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to accept our interview."</p>
<p>After thinking for a moment, Wu Tian changed his address. Although he didn't know why Chen Xu disliked the "Teacher" title, he couldn't just call him by his first name.</p>
<p>"Don't be so nervous and formal, we can just chat casually first," Chen Xu said with a smile, taking a bottle of Coke from a nearby box and handing it to the other person, then grabbing one for himself.</p>
<p>"Uh... alright... okay," Wu Tian replied, instinctively taking the bottle of Coke and placing it in front of him, looking at the smiling Chen Xu.</p>
<p>"Let's start by talking about <em>Undertale</em>. After all, the previous <em>Mirror (Game)</em> wasn't very convenient to report on. The main reason for developing <em>Undertale</em> was discovering a gap in the market for a certain type of game. Before that, meta-concepts appeared more frequently in novels and films, so I pondered why this model couldn't be applied to games. Furthermore, in terms of a sense of immersion, games hold a greater advantage."</p>
<p>"As for <em>To the Moon</em>? How it truly is, I believe countless players have already given their answers. For <em>Outlast</em>, I indeed developed it with immense passion, and from player feedback, it's clear they must have felt that as well."</p>
<p>"Players wanted it, and the market lacked similar games, so we made them. That's why I say I feel like a Warrior of Love; every one of our games is filled with a passion for players, a passion like a volcano about to erupt."</p>
<p>"The same goes for the new game; it too nurtures my 'love' for players."</p>
<p>A new game!?</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, Wu Tian's eyes lit up where he sat.</p>
<p>Finally, there was an eye-catching hot topic! Although he knew very well that Nebula Games' main purpose was probably also to promote its new game.</p>
<p>But at least there was a major scoop, and it would be an exclusive piece of news.</p>
<p>Wu Tian asked, filled with anticipation, "Mr. Chen, could you perhaps reveal a little information about the new game?"</p>
<p>"Of course. The new game will be a cooperative game suitable for all ages, and it will launch on February 14th, Valentine's Day."</p>
<p>"We hope this game can deepen the relationships between couples. And of course, if you don't have a partner, you can still team up with your good brothers, sisters, and friends to collectively experience and enjoy the beauty this game brings."</p>
<p>Chen Xu said, smiling and with great sincerity.</p>
<p>At the same time, Chen Xu also showed two pieces of <em>Overcooked</em> Concept Art.</p>
<p>Adorable Crocodile Chefs, Onion Kings, and Kevin the Dog, two chefs wearing chef hats in a bustling kitchen, everyone with smiling expressions.</p>
<p>To summarize in four characters, it was: harmonious and loving.</p>
<p>And four more characters: full of joy and warmth.</p>
<p>It made anyone feel the game was especially heartwarming, the kind that friends absolutely must play together.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>The interview wasn't particularly long, lasting less than 20 minutes.</p>
<p>With a smile as warm as a spring breeze, Chen Xu personally walked Wu Tian to the main entrance, watching him enter the elevator.</p>
<p>"Ah, young people!" Chen Xu sighed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, inside the elevator, Wu Tian, holding a recording pen and the unopened can of Coke,</p>
<p>had now come back to his senses. He recalled the entire interview process.</p>
<p>He felt a little dizzy.</p>
<p>Shouldn't he be the interviewer? Why did it feel like he had become a stenographer?</p>
<p>Looking at the recording pen and the Coke in his hand, Wu Tian fell into deep thought.</p>
<p>When did he lose control of the conversation?</p>
<p>It seemed to start with this bottle of Coke, didn't it?</p>
<p>"Well, at least it wasn't a total loss. Chen Xu's new game is definitely newsworthy, but I need to quickly come up with the press release!"</p>
<p>"I'll use 'The Transmission of Love' as the main title. And looking at the Concept Art for <em>Overcooked</em>, it feels incredibly heartwarming. It seems players with girlfriends will have a great Spring Festival this year!"</p>
