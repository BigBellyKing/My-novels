                <p>Chapter 775: Trash Game, Meh!</p>
<p>Compared to the original design of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>, Chen Xu did not intend to release DLC content related to gameplay systems in this installment. For instance, Blades like KOS-MOS and Herald, which were official 'cheats' in his previous life, wouldn't be directly obtained via mail. Instead, similar to Blades like Poppiba, a brand new Blade unlocking quest would be added, and players would only acquire the corresponding Blade after completing the quest. Other features, such as disabling monster aggro and custom difficulty, were directly integrated into the game itself by Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Players could choose corresponding modes based on their skill, including idiot-proof options like auto-battle and QTE completion if they couldn't grasp the combat system or simply wanted to enjoy the story. As for Zhang Yi, he didn't adjust the custom difficulty; he chose normal difficulty. As someone who considered himself an experienced gamer, Zhang Yi naturally wouldn't opt for auto-battle. Slowly figuring out the combat system in a traditional RPG is a significant part of the game's core enjoyment, a point Zhang Yi understood very well. So, he merely chose to enable the option for mobs to ignore aggro. After all, if he got stuck due to low level, or needed to kill mobs for quests, or farm materials, he could decide for himself whether to fight them. However, if he encountered countless mobs while exploring the map or progressing through the main story, he found it quite annoying.</p>
<p>But Zhang Yi, immersed in the game, was completely unaware that this feature only applied to regular monsters. In the world of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>, besides regularly spawning mobs, there were also Unique Monsters. These were the so-called field BOSSes. After being defeated, they would leave a corresponding gravestone for players to challenge repeatedly, and they possessed higher health and attack power than ordinary monsters. And in the Gormott Province, a grassland brimming with life, the species were incredibly diverse. There were small rabbits with single-digit levels, as well as Scaled Beefalo, Wolfkin around level ten to twenty, crabs around thirty to forty, and a ninety-plus level Ancient Tyrannosaurus and an eighty-plus level Gorilla.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, with the 'no encounter' feature enabled, strolled cheerfully across the vast grasslands of Gormott Province. Behind him, on a giant branching tree, a Gorilla swung leisurely and appeared right behind him. Aggro was drawn, and the thrilling battle BGM began. The next second, Zhang Yi saw a red damage number, -8621, float above Rex's head. Then the screen went black, and he returned to his last checkpoint.</p>
<p>“What the heck! What in the world! Where the hell did that gorilla come from?!”</p>
<p>Resurrected, Zhang Yi looked utterly bewildered. He never expected to be attacked so suddenly while admiring the beautiful scenery of Gormott Province. He was just a poor little guy under level 10, with a maximum HP of less than 1000. Did this Gorilla Bro hit him for thousands of points with one punch?</p>
<p>In reality, Zhang Yi wasn't the only one beaten to death by the Gorilla; almost every player who first ventured into the vast Gormott Province in <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em> suffered at its hands. As an elite monster, unlike some creatures that simply wander idly within their territory, this one was different. This black Gorilla was like a king patrolling its domain, moving from the trees to the plains and back again after a stroll. Its aggro range was enormous, and many players also ended up being ganged up on and beaten to death by accidentally attracting other monsters' aggro while fighting.</p>
<p>After respawning, Zhang Yi was much more cautious on his next trip to Gormott Province. Upon entering Gormott Province, he soon progressed to a new segment of the story, and its development wasn't too far off from Zhang Yi's expectations. Because Nia was a wanted criminal, Rex and Nia were defeated by a Blade named Brighid. Nia was captured and thrown into a jail, while Rex and Pyra escaped with the help of a Nopon named Tora. This was clearly one of the protagonist's party members. After a series of quests, he learned Nia's whereabouts and also helped Tora create an Artificial Blade, Poppi.</p>
<p>However, what Zhang Yi cared about most wasn't the plot, but the meme-worthy characters and humorous points in the game, which he found incredibly entertaining. Tora, who was determined to become a Driver, struck Zhang Yi as a typical otaku. His design for Poppi was also maid-themed. Although he pretended not to be that kind of person, the various maid outfits in his wardrobe immediately exposed his true nature.</p>
<p>“Trash game, meh! He’s absolutely right!” Zhang Yi gritted his teeth, looking at the arcade machine in Tora’s house.</p>
<p>Although compared to torturous mini-games like <em>Getting Over It</em> that he had played before, this was a minor inconvenience. But this was a game within a game! The clumsy controls and harsh hit detection drove Zhang Yi to frustration. The even more critical point was that this mini-game was a top-down scrolling game, requiring the player to control a small character to sneak to the very bottom, retrieve a treasure chest, and then return the same way. And if he died midway, there would be no reward, which made him gnash his teeth in frustration. Especially Tora's final line, which resonated deeply with Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>In reality, Chen Xu had made some adjustments to this arcade game. Firstly, the drop rate was slightly higher, and secondly, the Blade Bonding System unlock score for Poppi was slightly reduced. Furthermore, not all development parts were obtained solely through the arcade game; later, they could also be acquired by farming crystals in the Challenge Arena and then exchanging them. However, the current Zhang Yi was clearly oblivious to all of this. Right now, he was still playing the 'trash game' in front of him, suppressing his irritation.</p>
<p>As for the reason, he discovered that playing this game would also drop Core Crystals. He already knew the purpose of Core Crystals. They could be used to summon Blades. The system had previously given him a Core Crystal, and he had pulled a dark-skinned female Blade, which greatly disappointed him. And now, by completing missions within Tora's arcade game, he could also acquire crystals. His luck seemed pretty good; after a few rounds, he even acquired three common Core Crystals and one rare Core Crystal. Including the common treasure chests he'd found across various map locations that didn't require Field Skills to open, he now had 4 rare crystals and 10 common crystals. But, should he open them?</p>
<p>Zhang Yi looked at the crystals in his inventory, wanting to open them but also wanting to save them. It wasn't to accumulate enough for a 'ten-pull,' as the Blade Bonding System in the game clearly stated that ten consecutive pulls wouldn't increase the odds. The only point he considered more carefully was that, according to the tutorial, whoever opens the Core Crystal must use the Blade. And Tora, who had just joined his party, couldn't open Core Crystals, clearly implying that only Poppi could be developed for him. So he wanted to wait until Nia was rescued to open Core Crystals, letting Nia open some too. After all, Nia was also a main character; she shouldn't miss out on what she deserved.</p>
