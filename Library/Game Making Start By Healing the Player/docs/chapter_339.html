                <p>Chapter 338: Price, Return! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>The airport incident was merely a catalyst.</p>
<p>Regardless, war had broken out.</p>
<p>Russia's air force directly bypassed America's outer defenses and reached the West Coast.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the modules that Roach and Soap had retrieved earlier had already been cracked by the Russian army.</p>
<p>This allowed Russia's air force to bypass America's air defense facilities, and by the time it was discovered, it was already too late.</p>
<p>Instantly, the entirety of Washington was engulfed in war.</p>
<p>Task Force 141, along with some Russians who wished to avoid war,</p>
<p>all understood that Makarov was the true mastermind, but they lacked sufficient evidence to convince the world to intervene and end this war that should never have happened.</p>
<p>Thus, Task Force 141 could only trace the bullets left at the airport to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, hoping to obtain clues from an arms dealer collaborating with Makarov.</p>
<p>From this moment, the most classic dual-line narrative of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare unfolded simultaneously.</p>
<p>In Washington, facing the Russian army's offensive, players would take on the role of James Ramirez, a member of the Ranger Regiment.</p>
<p>They would join Sergeant Foley in a counterattack.</p>
<p>The battle was incredibly brutal, almost a meat grinder.</p>
<p>One second, a comrade beside him was reminding him to take cover; the next, a stray bullet pierced his neck.</p>
<p>All you could do was watch him die in front of you.</p>
<p>This impact was far more intense than any movie or TV series.</p>
<p>It was another war scene, but after the previous No Russian airport massacre level, what Zhang Yi felt at this moment was not excitement, but a sense of cruelty.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, with Task Force 141, players followed Roach's perspective, continuously investigating Makarov.</p>
<p>During this time, they couldn't get a handle on Makarov's movements.</p>
<p>Especially in the level called Slum, Zhang Yi fully experienced the local 'hospitality'.</p>
<p>It was comparable to the Hollows in Undead Burg.</p>
<p>In the Slum, all the houses had huge elevation differences; you never knew where the enemy would attack from.</p>
<p>Front, back, left, right, above, below—it was an all-around assault.</p>
<p>Moreover, the buildings here were very chaotic, and 'black guns' (ambush shots) often appeared from unknown corners.</p>
<p>Even playing on normal difficulty, Zhang Yi felt a bit dizzy.</p>
<p>He couldn't even imagine how difficult this level would be on veteran difficulty.</p>
<p>Of course, it wasn't without reward; here, Roach met another teammate from Task Force 141.</p>
<p>It was Ghost - Simon Riley, from the previous Operation Kingfish.</p>
<p>Several times, when Roach was heavily surrounded in the Slum, Ghost stepped forward to help him break the encirclement and cover his retreat.</p>
<p>And this good teammate was the perfect example of someone who was ruthless and spoke little.</p>
<p>Black sunglasses, a skull mask, tactical headphones—he was an accurate shot, handsome, and even understood hacking technology, though he was a bit slow when cracking things.</p>
<p>Under a hail of bullets, they caught the target and, using a 'friendly' method of electroshock therapy, persuaded him.</p>
<p>Finally, Soap and the others obtained a crucial piece of information.</p>
<p>A prisoner, Code 627, was being held in the Gulag.</p>
<p>This individual was someone Makarov desperately wanted to eliminate but was powerless to touch.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Soap and Roach were instantly stunned.</p>
<p>“Holy cow, how could such a formidable existence be out there?”</p>
<p>They immediately decided to go to the Gulag prison to investigate this Code 627 prisoner, to see if they could get any information about Makarov.</p>
<p>Moreover, an enemy of their enemy was a friend; since this person was so formidable, perhaps he could become a great asset to them.</p>
<p>The entire island's defenses were exceptionally tight.</p>
<p>After riding in an attack helicopter and using automatic rifles to clear all the guards outside the castle-like prison,</p>
<p>Roach, Soap, Ghost, and other Task Force 141 members charged straight in.</p>
<p>As the team's tech expert, Ghost began hacking into the prison's security system.</p>
<p>But as mentioned, while Brother Ghost was handsome, his hacking skills were a bit slow when it came to cracking things.</p>
<p>So, Roach could only let Soap proceed first to the underground armory.</p>
<p>It was a cramped terrain, with enemies attacking from two long corridors around them.</p>
<p>The difficulty was no less than that of the previous Slum level.</p>
<p>Thus, Zhang Yi very honestly switched to Recruit mode.</p>
<p>As an excellent veteran of modern warfare, what was needed was not sharp marksmanship or agile movement,</p>
<p>but a big heart capable of judging the situation.</p>
<p>Given the current difficulty, Recruit mode was clearly more suitable for him.</p>
<p>As for not playing on Recruit difficulty?</p>
<p>Who said that? He certainly didn't!</p>
<p>Roach, Soap, and the accompanying Task Force 141 members broke through little by little.</p>
<p>At the same time, this sparked some curiosity in Zhang Yi's mind about the target of this operation.</p>
<p>Who exactly was this Code 627 prisoner, this 'big shot'?</p>
<p>Carrying this doubt, he controlled Roach, following Soap, and delved deeper inside.</p>
<p>After blowing up a wall, amidst the dust and smoke of flying bricks and stones,</p>
<p>an agile figure appeared. Although his hands were bound by chains, his movements were remarkably swift.</p>
<p>He cleanly dispatched a guard in front of him, then delivered a flying kick to the stomach of Roach, whom Zhang Yi was controlling.</p>
<p>He raised the shotgun in his hand, ready to fire.</p>
<p>But the next moment, the figure suddenly lowered his weapon.</p>
<p>“Roach?”</p>
<p>A familiar voice sounded in Zhang Yi's ear.</p>
<p>“Holy cow! Captain Price! Captain Price isn't dead!”</p>
<p>Instantly, Zhang Yi was overwhelmed with joy.</p>
<p>The person before him was none other than Captain Price, whose fate had been unknown since Operation Kingfish.</p>
<p>Chen Xu had also slightly altered this part of the storyline.</p>
<p>In his previous life, in this part of the story, Captain Price didn't know Roach, but recognized Soap.</p>
<p>The main reason was that the Operation Kingfish storyline was a player-completed narrative, which, although later officially recognized,</p>
<p>the game had already been made by then, making changes impossible.</p>
<p>But now that Chen Xu had turned Operation Kingfish into a level, it was naturally impossible to make such a mistake. After all, how could Captain Price not recognize his own soldiers?</p>
<p>Looking at Captain Price, who had his signature mustache and appeared somewhat haggard in his prison uniform, Zhang Yi was extremely excited.</p>
<p>Because Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was a game that allowed players to empathize with NPC characters.</p>
<p>He had deep feelings for Roach, Soap, Ghost, and Captain Price.</p>
<p>Now, seeing Captain Price, who had been missing for so long, alive, he was also very emotional.</p>
<p>Soap in the game felt the same, but as a soldier, he didn't lose his composure; he simply picked up the M1911 pistol, which had once symbolized and witnessed their bond of life and death.</p>
<p>“Captain Price, welcome back.”</p>
<p>“This belongs to you… Captain!”</p>
<p>There were not many words, but that single sentence conveyed Soap's inner excitement.</p>
<p>At this point, the main protagonist group of Task Force 141 was reunited, except for Allen, who tragically only survived three levels.</p>
