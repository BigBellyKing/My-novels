                <h3>Chapter 659: Elizabeth (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h3>
<p>After the first promotional trailer for BioShock went live, players eagerly discussed it but couldn't glean much information.</p>
<p>After all, it was too short. However, just as many players were 'criticizing' Mr. Chen for being Riddler-like, something unexpected happened.</p>
<p>Just half a month later, Mr. Chen released a second promotional trailer, and this time, it revealed much more information.</p>
<p>In this trailer video, all the promotional CGI used actual in-game footage.</p>
<p>Clearly, this was to inform players that these were in-game real-time demonstrations.</p>
<p>Enveloped in clouds, the colossal sky city of Columbia was displayed before countless players.</p>
<p>The magnificent sky city, the azure sky with textured white clouds, was like a fairy tale world.</p>
<p>Amidst the countless white clouds, massive airships slowly glided forward.</p>
<p>The white clouds in the sky seemed within reach, a dreamlike scene.</p>
<p>All these cities floated in the air, connected by massive chains.</p>
<p>In the distance was a huge island with an angel-like statue.</p>
<p>But the next moment, the scene in the video suddenly shifted.</p>
<p>The sound effects also became eerie.</p>
<p>A dark color palette, and splashing blood.</p>
<p>'The prophet's seed shall sit on the throne…'</p>
<p>'And in a sea of fire, before the masses, he shall appear.'</p>
<p>The war scene from the first trailer flashed by, then instantly switched to the dreamlike Columbia sky city.</p>
<p>The scenes constantly shifted: battles, beautiful scenery, ominous palaces, a world engulfed in war…</p>
<p>Unknown narration, Elizabeth's voice, and Booker DeWitt's voice.</p>
<p>'The false shepherd shall come to lead the lamb astray.'</p>
<p>'Who are you?'</p>
<p>'I can get you out!'</p>
<p>'Your shepherd's crook is long bent, your path is crooked.'</p>
<p>'What will you pay?'</p>
<p>Booker and Elizabeth gazed into the distance from an airship.</p>
<p>The distant Columbia sky city looked like a fairy tale wonderland.</p>
<p>'We'll find Comstock.'</p>
<p>The next moment, bloody and eerie scenes appeared.</p>
<p>'I will stop him and set her free.'</p>
<p>In a dark dungeon, Elizabeth's pained voice could be heard, as if she were being tortured.</p>
<p>'This outcome will be bloody!'</p>
<p>'Comstock! Tell me what you're doing?'</p>
<p>'Return to your hallowed ground!'</p>
<p>'Elizabeth!'</p>
<p>The screen faded to black, then returned to the vast ocean, a boat carrying Booker towards a lighthouse.</p>
<p>'Bring us the girl, and the debt will be repaid.'</p>
<p>Amidst the pouring rain, the scene gradually disappeared.</p>
<p>'Deal's off! Hey, deal's off! Did you hear me? Deal's off!'</p>
<p>Elizabeth, with her arms crossed, looked at a distant department store, her face full of bewilderment and helplessness.</p>
<p>'Booker, are you afraid of God?'</p>
<p>'No, I only worry about you.' (Due to translation issues, an early Chinese localization of the game translated this as 'I only fear you,' misinterpreting the meaning.)</p>
<p>Accompanied by a peal of thunder.</p>
<p>In the wilderness, Elizabeth looked directly into the camera, a distant storm raging as if it were the end of the world.</p>
<p>With another flash of lightning and thunder, the screen instantly plunged into darkness.</p>
<p>The game title “BioShock” appeared at the end.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous promotional video, this CGI animation showcased more content.</p>
<p>This included in-game combat scenes and more environmental displays.</p>
<p>Even aspects of the game's story were further revealed.</p>
<p>Groups of players seemed to transform into archaeological researchers, meticulously studying and analyzing information related to this game called BioShock.</p>
<p>Some video websites even featured numerous dedicated analysis videos.</p>
<p>However, one thing was certain: although BioShock's art style appeared cartoonish,</p>
<p>The game's content was anything but cartoonish.</p>
<p>This was fully demonstrated in the promotional trailer.</p>
<p>Eerie scenes, dark color tones, and splashing blood.</p>
<p>Corpses in wheelchairs and people tied to wooden planks being torn apart by crows all showed that this game indeed contained some rather violent content.</p>
<p>This was not a so-called family-friendly cartoon theme park game.</p>
<p>In addition, according to information released on the official Weibo account, this BioShock would be released in two parts.</p>
<p>Just like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare back then.</p>
<p>“By the way, everyone, do you think this game will be similar to The Last of Us? Old man with a loli? Except Joel was escorting Ellie, while this Booker DeWitt here is supposed to take Elizabeth away.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I noticed that too! And the second trailer had some clues, hinting at the photo in the wooden box at the beginning, and the word ‘囚禁者’ (prisoner) written on it.”</p>
<p>“Also, judging from the dialogue on the small boat in the first trailer, Booker must have accepted some deal, the content of which should be to take Elizabeth away. Later, he might, after experiencing some things with Elizabeth, take her and eliminate both factions.”</p>
<p>Players discussed animatedly, and of course, besides these, players had many other questions.</p>
<p>What did the shepherd represent, and who was Comstock?</p>
<p>Players at home and abroad debated intensely.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Chen showed no intention of explaining the external discussions; instead, he continued with BioShock's content development.</p>
<p>The entire game's art style adopted a blend of Victorian and visual art design, enhanced with cartoon rendering, presenting a steampunk world.</p>
<p>This cartoonish style gave the game's expressive power a greater leaning towards the detailed performances of Broadway theatre, differing somewhat from the narrative style of realism.</p>
<p>Central City, Monument Island, Soldier's Field, Finkton, and Plaza of Zeal—Mr. Chen and his team meticulously designed each area.</p>
<p>In his previous life, BioShock Infinite moved countless players not only with its excellent story but also with its extremely demanding attention to detail.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Chen also aimed to present a vivid and lifelike Columbia to players.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the story's presentation, BioShock Infinite in his previous life was, after all, developed many years after the first game.</p>
<p>Therefore, some content in the first game actually conflicted with the Burial at Sea DLC later in Infinite.</p>
<p>So here, Mr. Chen would also incorporate some interconnected clues as foreshadowing, to deliver an even more shocking revelation when the truth was finally unveiled.</p>
<p>And, of course, there was the most crucial aspect: the portrayal of Elizabeth.</p>
<p>While players outside were still discussing,</p>
<p>Mr. Chen was strolling with Elizabeth through Columbia.</p>
<p>Well… to be more precise… he was testing the game's AI performance.</p>
<p>The actress for Elizabeth in the game was a renowned stage actress from Broadway.</p>
<p>This was intentional on Mr. Chen's part, because compared to ordinary actors, BioShock Infinite's cartoonish art style itself had a touch of the absurd. Thus, the more dramatic stage performances of a theater actress complemented the game's content perfectly.</p>
<p>'Booker! This is the women's restroom!'</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked at Mr. Chen, or rather, the in-game Booker, with an angry expression.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen just chuckled.</p>
<p>In the game, Elizabeth could react accordingly to different player actions.</p>
<p>Walking too fast, walking too slow, or missing some items.</p>
<p>Elizabeth would provide feedback for all these actions.</p>
<p>At the same time, Elizabeth's dialogue in the game was incredibly extensive.</p>
<p>To present a lifelike AI character to players, it clearly required a massive accumulation of details, not just a simple AI logic.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen walked around Columbia City twice with Elizabeth, checking all the details before exiting the game.</p>
<p>“How is it, Mr. Chen?” Qin Yi, who was in charge of this section, asked excitedly.</p>
<p>Evidently, the performance of Elizabeth they had created also greatly impressed him.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen smiled and nodded: “Very good, but pay attention to more meticulous details. We need players to feel that Elizabeth is not just a simple AI, a simple NPC teammate, but their reliable companion.”</p>
<p>During a segment of the game's story, players would briefly lose Elizabeth and adventure alone.</p>
<p>At this point, the goal was to make players experience the sudden loneliness and realize how important Elizabeth was to them.</p>
<p>And to make players feel that way, Elizabeth absolutely needed to hold a certain weight in their hearts.</p>
<p>This weight required players to fall in love with the character.</p>
<p>Finally, when something unexpected happened to the character, that profound sadness could be fully imprinted in the players' hearts, becoming an unforgettable memory.</p>
