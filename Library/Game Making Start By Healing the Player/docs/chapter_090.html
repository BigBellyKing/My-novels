                <h2>Chapter 90: Exploding Popularity</h2>
<p>On the very day <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Sanguosha</em> launched on the Nebula Games platform,</p>
<p>countless players immediately began downloading them.</p>
<p><em>Sanguosha</em> is a free-to-play game, so there’s no harm in downloading it.</p>
<p>While <em>Fall Guys</em> is a buy-to-play game, its adorable cartoon-style and highly entertaining gameplay mode</p>
<p>have made many players anticipate it. There’s also a crucial point:</p>
<p>During the gameplay Expo, <em>Fall Guys</em> was also available for free trial play, though only for one day.</p>
<p>But it was still free to play!</p>
<p>Whether it's a good fit or not, players could download and experience it first.</p>
<p>If it was fun, then they would just buy it.</p>
<p>Moreover, based on the previous situation with <em>Overcooked</em>, Nebula Games’ own games sold on its platform also enjoyed certain discounts.</p>
<p>At the same time, given the level design characteristics of <em>Fall Guys</em>, many players had already guessed that the game would most likely support the Workshop feature in the future.</p>
<p>Compared to the Steam platform in his previous life, the Workshop feature launched by the Nebula Games platform has not yet caused a huge stir in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>This is mainly because the platform alone cannot make it happen; it also requires the participation of players and developers.</p>
<p>However, for players who have experienced the joy of the Workshop, it is highly anticipated.</p>
<p>Currently, <em>Overcooked</em> on the Nebula Games platform can still reach a peak of 100,000 concurrent users daily.</p>
<p>Much of this success is attributed to the Workshop.</p>
<p>Although <em>Overcooked</em> on other platforms can also use it, it's a bit more troublesome.</p>
<p>Soon, the first-day download numbers for <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Sanguosha</em> were released.</p>
<p><em>Sanguosha</em> surpassed 1.2 million, while <em>Fall Guys</em> reached an astonishing 3.1 million.</p>
<p>These figures shocked many industry insiders in the gaming world.</p>
<p>Although <em>Sanguosha</em> is permanently free, and <em>Fall Guys</em> was free for that day, coupled with the popularity from the gameplay Expo,</p>
<p>such numbers were still unexpected by many.</p>
<p>What’s more crucial is that this was still solely based on the Nebula Games platform!</p>
<p>This essentially brought several million new users to the Nebula Games platform.</p>
<p>While the stickiness of these users might be considerably discounted,</p>
<p>these numbers are truly terrifying.</p>
<p>Compared to NetDragon, TengHua, and the official game store, which boast hundreds of millions of player users at every turn, and some secondary channel providers with tens of millions of users, Nebula Games’ figures naturally cannot compare.</p>
<p>But for an independent game platform to have so many users is simply defying the heavens!</p>
<p>And from the current data, the potential of <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Sanguosha</em> has clearly not been exhausted; it's still continuously climbing.</p>
<p>The rest is just to see how far they can go.</p>
<hr />
<p>The related data for <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em> clearly made a large number of Game Designers envious.</p>
<p>On the forums of some industry designers, besides those expressing admiration and optimism, there were also no shortage of designers who were pessimistic.</p>
<p>'Isn't it too early to say that <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Sanguosha</em> will be successful?'</p>
<p>'Yeah, although they have considerable popularity and topicality, <em>Sanguosha</em> is a free game, and its main monetization method relies on in-app purchases. As for <em>Fall Guys</em>, it's currently a one-day limited free-to-play period, so the true sales figures are still unknown.'</p>
<p>'Exactly. Whether they succeed still depends on two subsequent factors: retention rate and payment data. Saying they're popular now might be too arbitrary.'</p>
<p>'Precisely. If even one of those figures is poor, both games will still flop.'</p>
<p>However, these types of designers are by no means the mainstream.</p>
<p>There will always be some people who wish for others' failure, or who are happier seeing others stumble and fail than seeing themselves succeed.</p>
<p>As for the direct audience of the games, ordinary players have a completely different mindset.</p>
<p>They simply find these two games novel and interesting.</p>
<p>As recent trending games, after Chen Xu made them available, many streamers on various live streaming platforms also chose <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Sanguosha</em> for their broadcasts.</p>
<p>However, <em>Fall Guys</em> effectively supplanted <em>Sanguosha</em> in an overwhelming manner.</p>
<p>From a player's perspective, <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em> each have their own unique characteristics. Since they are essentially two different types of games, it's hard to say which is better or worse.</p>
<p>But for streamers and video creators, there's quite a difference.</p>
<p>That is, <em>Fall Guys</em> offers a much better viewing experience than <em>Sanguosha</em>.</p>
<p>So, various live streaming platforms and video websites are filled with all kinds of <em>Fall Guys</em> live streams and videos.</p>
<p>Both players and streamers/video creators have also discovered a common characteristic:</p>
<p>Playing <em>Fall Guys</em> truly brings a lot more joy.</p>
<p>Although the game also has plenty of blood pressure-raising moments.</p>
<p>For example, some players choose to act maliciously, extending their evil little hands to grab you just before the finish line, preventing you from entering and causing your elimination.</p>
<p>Instantly, the Fall Guys characters transform into Grabbers.</p>
<p>But unlike <em>Overcooked</em>, where arguments can easily break out, <em>Fall Guys</em> largely fosters a spirit of unity against external forces.</p>
<p>This also means that while there are frustrating moments,</p>
<p>the level of enjoyable atmosphere is completely different.</p>
<p>This type of variety show obstacle course game is currently one of a kind.</p>
<p>It has brought players a refreshing experience.</p>
<p>The internet is filled with the laughter and cheer of players.</p>
<p>Major <em>Fall Guys</em> community forums are mostly dominated by socially-oriented posts.</p>
<p>Players are looking for others to join them for voice chat while playing.</p>
<p>This is because the game's initial impression on players is simply too much fun.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <em>Sanguosha</em>, despite seemingly being overshadowed by <em>Fall Guys</em> in terms of popularity,</p>
<p>has community forums filled with all sorts of strategy guides.</p>
<p>Because currently, everyone is still learning how to play, and in terms of content depth, <em>Sanguosha</em> is also more profound.</p>
<p>Therefore, strategy guides analyzing card effects and general skills are quite popular among players.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also some interesting sharing posts.</p>
<p>The game has only just launched on the Nebula Games platform.</p>
<p>But many unlucky souls have already created some memorable moments.</p>
<p>'I want to ask, is it because I didn't buy a <em>Sanguosha</em> skin that I feel the system is targeting me? Why can't my Zhen Ji see black cards, and my Da Qiao has no diamond suit?'</p>
<p>'What are you talking about? My Zhuge uses Lightning and Observe Stars to strike himself. Who's unluckier than me?'</p>
<p>'Oh, come on, at least your generals can still trigger their skills. I played Sun Shangxiang with four female generals on the field and didn't draw a single weapon card from beginning to end! I basically played a vanilla character!'</p>
<p>Online, both <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em> players are chatting happily.</p>
<p>For a time, the player base was filled with a joyful atmosphere.</p>
<p>Under Chen Xu's official Weibo account, many players also left messages, saying they had wronged Chen Xu, and that the Warrior of Love truly lived up to his name.</p>
<p>Although both games have unlucky and blood pressure-raising scenarios, most situations are still cheerful and entertaining.</p>
<p>Some players even suggested that if <em>Fall Guys</em> had been released on Valentine's Day, it would have been even more perfect.</p>
