                <p>Chapter 84: Game Trial</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, the players present immediately erupted.</p>
<p>After all, the content revealed in just a few short sentences was truly astonishing.</p>
<p>Two games would have mobile versions, available for direct download and trial during the exhibition.</p>
<p>Besides that, there was also a grand finale.</p>
<p>To be honest, most players didn't pay much attention to the grand finale.</p>
<p>After all, it was just empty talk, and although Nebula Games had made a few popular games,</p>
<p>they weren't big titles, so people couldn't get too excited.</p>
<p>The key point was, did this mean they could experience the games without queuing?</p>
<p>Suddenly, everyone noticed that the large screen at Nebula Games' booth had begun playing promotional videos of the games.</p>
<p>At the same time, a huge QR code was displayed on it, clearly for players to scan and download.</p>
<p>Players gathered in front of the Nebula Games booth at the venue all took out their phones and started scanning the QR code to download.</p>
<p>After all, didn't everyone come to the game exhibition to try out new games from various companies?</p>
<p>Now, with a game that could be directly experienced by just scanning and downloading, without having to queue, everyone naturally rushed to try it.</p>
<p>Among them, most male players prioritized scanning and downloading <code>Sanguosha</code>.</p>
<p>After all, compared to the overly Q-style cute <code>Fall Guys</code> on the other side, <code>Sanguosha</code>'s art style was clearly more appealing to them.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Three Kingdoms itself is a household name IP, inherently possessing a certain appeal.</p>
<p>As for many female players, it was the opposite; the adorable <code>Fall Guys</code> clearly interested them more.</p>
<p>Of course, it wasn't universally so; there were also male players with a maiden's heart who chose to play <code>Fall Guys</code> first, or female players who preferred to try <code>Sanguosha</code>.</p>
<p>Besides, some players still queued up specifically to experience the difference with the PC version.</p>
<p>At the same time, some players chose not to play on their phones, but instead played with physical cards offline.</p>
<p>After all, playing board games face-to-face feels more engaging.</p>
<p>Because they arrived relatively early, Zhang Yi and his group secured a spot in the first batch of players.</p>
<p>All five of them queued for <code>Sanguosha</code>, having noticed from some introductions that it was playable with five people, which was their exact group size.</p>
<p><code>Sanguosha</code> could be played by five people together, which was their exact number.</p>
<p>As for <code>Fall Guys</code>, it could accommodate up to four people in a team, and non-team matches would scatter them, so they decided to try <code>Sanguosha</code> first.</p>
<p>Another point was that they had a bit of psychological trauma.</p>
<p>After all, they had previously experienced what Chen Xu described as "easy, pleasant, harmonious, and loving."</p>
<p>Although from the art style, the game indeed gave off that impression.</p>
<p>But Zhang Yi always had a premonition that the actual experience might be completely the opposite.</p>
<p>The few of them didn't choose to play with physical cards, but opted to try the PC version.</p>
<p>After all, it was much more convenient, and according to the staff's introduction.</p>
<p>With physical cards, they could only read the text rules themselves, while the digital game version had a new player tutorial mode, allowing them to better understand the game.</p>
<p>After a simple opening CG, they entered the game screen.</p>
<p>For <code>Sanguosha</code>'s opening CG, Chen Xu didn't create anything overly flashy or animated.</p>
<p>It was just a simple comic strip, showcasing the generals in <code>Sanguosha</code>.</p>
<p>After all, this was a board game.</p>
<p>After entering the game, the opening was an endgame battle.</p>
<p>The player played as the Lord, and the general was Liu Bei.</p>
<p>"The voice acting is great! And the visual representation isn't bad either!"</p>
<p>Zhang Yi exclaimed in a low voice.</p>
<p>He had never touched card games.</p>
<p>Well, if <code>Dou Dizhu</code> counted, then he had played one.</p>
<p>But in <code>Sanguosha</code>, some details could still be felt.</p>
<p>For example, when an "Attack" card successfully hit in the game, accompanied by the deduction of red hearts representing the health bar, and a dynamic feedback of blade flashes hitting the general's portrait, it all felt very impactful.</p>
<p>Moreover, the in-game sound effects and feedback were also very well done.</p>
<p>When health was deducted, the general's portrait would also be stained with blood, and when health became low, the general's portrait would even show wounds.</p>
<p>Clearly, the card portraits in the game were not just a single image.</p>
<p>Intact, injured; according to different states, there were corresponding visual representations.</p>
<p>And different Equipment cards also had different special effects.</p>
<p>This made a regular card game feel exceptionally engaging.</p>
<p>The game continued.</p>
<p>With the simple tutorial mode, players basically just followed the system prompts.</p>
<p>The main purpose was to let players understand the game's basic operations and related card functions.</p>
<p>After all, <code>Sanguosha</code>'s main gameplay revolved around its card battle rules.</p>
<p>If the system guidance in this area wasn't well-executed, players would find it difficult to understand where the fun of the game lay.</p>
<p>Similarly, the large screen in the <code>Sanguosha</code> area of the exhibition booth was also displaying Zhang Yi and his group's gameplay experience.</p>
<p>This allowed players waiting in line to understand the game, and everyone was whispering and discussing <code>Sanguosha</code>'s performance.</p>
<p>"It's a bit like <code>Dou Dizhu</code>!"</p>
<p>"This is much more complex than <code>Dou Dizhu</code>!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, and I feel like playing as the Spy is so hard; others have two people, but he's just one."</p>
<p>"You can't say that. Think about it, whether it's the Lord or the Rebel, whoever you help gains an advantage. Isn't that exciting?"</p>
<p>"What if both factions attack you?"</p>
<p>"Then whoever attacks me first, I'll help the other side take them out!"</p>
<p>"It feels like the Spy's main role is to control the field. Whether eliminating the Loyalist or the Rebel, the other player must cooperate with the Spy, or they'll lose directly."</p>
<p>"The Spy's victory reward should be better then."</p>
<p>"Exactly, one versus four!"</p>
<p>"Look, the Lord has an extra skill! And an extra health point!"</p>
<p>Although they could also download and play themselves, some players still chose not to experience it personally, but instead watched the game's performance on the large screen.</p>
<p>The overall rules of <code>Sanguosha</code> were not difficult to understand; this new player tutorial was simply to let players know the basic content.</p>
<p>For example, factions, and basic operations like "Attack", "Dodge", "Peach", Equipment cards, and attack range provided by horses.</p>
<p>As for more advanced operations, such as generals' skills and synergies, "Cross the River and Demolish the Bridge" and "Take a Goat in Passing," and taking away an opponent's unjudged "Indulge in Pleasure and Forget Home" and "Lightning" cards, these were placed in subsequent side tutorials.</p>
<p>For the exhibition experience, these contents didn't need to be released.</p>
<p>After the official version launched, players could obtain generals and a permanent skin as rewards by completing these side tutorials.</p>
<p>This could be considered the "three-pronged approach" of online multiplayer games.</p>
<p>Giving rewards to attract players to complete quests, letting players understand the game through quests, and receiving rewards to keep players in the game.</p>
<p>This routine was practically overused by mobile games in his previous life.</p>
<p>Things like "100 free pulls at launch", "60 free pulls at launch", "give away orange cards, gold cards at launch" — these were all basically this model.</p>
<p>And it even spawned an industry chain named "starter accounts."</p>
<p>There were specialized studios that created a bunch of accounts, relying on these free pulls, and then sold the accounts based on luck.</p>
<p>However, it must be said that this method was indeed very effective.</p>
<p>At least in the early stages of a game, it held a very strong appeal for players.</p>
