                <p>Chapter 214: Expectations for a Beautiful Future (Sixth update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>After selecting Single-Player Mode, what appeared before Wang Han was first a character selection.</p>
<p>The default male character looked like Steve, while the female character looked like Alex.</p>
<p>However, custom character customization was available.</p>
<p>Wang Han took a look; although it was a pixel style game, and the character's head was also a block.</p>
<p>But the distinctions for eyes, eyebrows, mouth, and nose were quite detailed.</p>
<p>She didn't use the original Steve and Alex character models.</p>
<p>Wang Han re-customized a character for herself, then named it 'Master Builder' and entered the game.</p>
<p>After all, she had seen some promotional content for Minecraft before, and this game seemed to involve building houses.</p>
<p>Although she wasn't sure how to play yet, she figured it was best to pick a name first.</p>
<p>After all, having a good name was already half the battle won.</p>
<p>She had even thought of Zhang Yi's name; it would be Foreman.</p>
<p>Her Master Builder would design the houses, and someone else would be needed for construction.</p>
<p>Thinking this to herself, after entering the game, a UI Pop-up Window appeared, prompting her to choose a game mode.</p>
<p>It was divided into 'Creative Mode' and 'Survival Mode'.</p>
<p>However, upon seeing that the so-called Creative Mode was equivalent to Invincible Mode, Wang Han quickly made a decision: "I'll try Survival Mode first. That sounds like it would be more challenging."</p>
<p>'Detecting your first entry into Survival Mode, would you like to learn some essential basic knowledge?'</p>
<p>As Wang Han confirmed her choice, and a World Seed was generated, allowing her to enter Minecraft, a Notification Pop-up appeared.</p>
<p>This was triggered every time a new account entered the game, primarily providing basic explanations about Minecraft so players could understand how to play in Survival Mode, as well as some basic operations.</p>
<p>For example, how materials are collected and how to craft tools.</p>
<p>Although Minecraft is a sandbox game, it is arguably the most free sandbox game.</p>
<p>But freedom doesn't mean no new player tutorial is needed; it doesn't need to be overly long, but at least some basic concepts and operations still need to be introduced to players.</p>
<p>Wang Han thought for a moment and chose 'yes'.</p>
<p>Next came the official gameplay segment; following the system's instructions, Wang Han performed some simple operations.</p>
<p>Moving forwards, backwards, left, and right, as well as jumping and running.</p>
<p>It was very simple, with nothing particularly special about it.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the game, the UI wasn't very complex either.</p>
<p>It was mainly concentrated at the bottom of the screen, with the Item inventory at the very bottom.</p>
<p>It was currently empty.</p>
<p>Above the Item inventory, on the left, were red hearts, representing the game's health.</p>
<p>On the right was a big chicken leg, representing the game's hunger level.</p>
<p>There was also something similar to an experience bar, but the game didn't seem to have content for leveling up and adding attributes, which made Wang Han a bit confused.</p>
<p>But if she didn't understand, there was no need to overthink it; she would just play first.</p>
<p>"Next up, I'll go chopping down trees to collect wood. Sure enough, no matter what game it is, the saying 'to get rich, first chop down trees' is a golden rule."</p>
<p>Wang Han sighed with emotion and prepared to chop down two trees according to the prompt.</p>
<p>She surveyed her surroundings; she was currently standing on a hill, and the entire hill was made up of countless blocks stacked together.</p>
<p>There were many trees on both the hill and the plains, and in the distance, she could see an ocean.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Wang Han ran towards the trees.</p>
<p>Arriving in front of a tree, she pressed the left mouse button, and then she saw the pixelated character's right hand in the game chopping down trees back and forth at a ridiculously fast speed.</p>
<p>The right hand kept chopping back and forth, and at the same time, the block being chopped in the game quickly showed net-like cracks, and then suddenly broke apart and scattered on the ground, turning into very small blocks.</p>
<p>Controlling the character to walk over it, the small block then entered his inventory.</p>
<p>And a wooden icon option automatically appeared in the item bar below.</p>
<p>From the item bar, Wang Han selected wood, and then tried clicking the right mouse button on the ground, and saw a standard cube appear before her.</p>
<p>"So this is how building things in this game works!"</p>
<p>"Each of these grids is the unit range for building."</p>
<p>Looking at the cube of wood that appeared before her, Wang Han instantly understood the basic building rules in Minecraft.</p>
<p>"The next step is to turn wood into planks, and then make a crafting table."</p>
<p>"Then I can begin my building journey. What's so impressive about building houses in Creative Mode? Watch me build Lothric Castle in Survival Mode!"</p>
<p>Turning the wood she had into four planks, and crafting a crafting table and placing it down, Wang Han was full of fantasies about her future building journey.</p>
<p>"Hmm, now I can craft more things. Sticks can be combined with planks to create more tools."</p>
<p>Wang Han looked at the system prompt, and a realization dawned on her.</p>
<p>She wasn't entirely unfamiliar with this concept.</p>
<p>Just like in Don't Starve, many things needed to be crafted.</p>
<p>For example, chopping trees required an axe, while in Minecraft, one could chop trees and dig dirt bare-handed, but only for trees, dirt, and gravel.</p>
<p>If it was stone and coal, it was possible, but it would take a considerably longer time.</p>
<p>Using the wood in her hand, she crafted a crafting table, and then, using the crafting table, she made tools like a wooden axe and a wooden pickaxe.</p>
<p>Immediately, another UI Pop-up Window appeared in the game.</p>
<p>"Huh! Is the new player tutorial already over? Is this game that simple?"</p>
<p>Looking at the pop-up window, Wang Han was surprised to find that the game's new player tutorial had already ended.</p>
<p>It couldn't really be called 'over', as it still reminded her what to do next.</p>
<p>And there were also some text prompts.</p>
<p>In reality, this was also Chen Xu's deliberate intention.</p>
<p>To let players understand how Minecraft is played, and also to realize that various items originally needed to be crafted.</p>
<p>This was pretty much sufficient.</p>
<p>In addition, the game also had a built-in crafting recipe book.</p>
<p>Of course, in the crafting recipe book, Chen Xu didn't directly put all the items in front of the players.</p>
<p>It mostly contained only the recipes needed in the early stages.</p>
<p>For example, torches, beds, and doors.</p>
<p>As for some more advanced ones, players still needed to gradually discover and unlock them in the game.</p>
<p>"When night falls, monsters will appear in the game, so you need a house and a bed. Sleeping in bed at night allows you to instantly pass the night. If you don't have a bed, you'll have to wait slowly."</p>
<p>"Health and hunger level, just like in Don't Starve, are managed by eating."</p>
<p>Combining this with the recently appeared UI Pop-up Window prompt, Wang Han quickly understood a basic rule in Minecraft.</p>
<p>"Let's chop some wood first and build a house before night falls."</p>
<p>Wang Han quickly made a decision.</p>
<p>As for beds and such, she saw that they required wool and planks to make.</p>
<p>Wool naturally came from sheep.</p>
<p>But she also looked around, and other than trees, she didn't see any sheep creatures at all.</p>
<p>She did see some pigs, so she swiftly killed several pink piggies and harvested some meat, so at least she wouldn't go hungry.</p>
<p>Of course, it might also be because she hadn't traveled too far yet.</p>
<p>However, for Wang Han, the most pressing task was still chopping down trees and building a house.</p>
<p>The goal of Lothric Castle was too grand; it was better to start by making a cozy home.</p>
<p>After all, grand ambitions always started with small steps.</p>
<p>Carrying beautiful expectations, Wang Han took her axe and began chopping down trees.</p>
<p>Once she had gathered one or two hundred pieces of wood, she could then find a good spot to build a cozy little nest.</p>
<p>Looking at the continuously increasing number of wood in her Item inventory, and the durability consumed by her wooden axe, a joyful smile also appeared on Wang Han's lips.</p>
<p>She hadn't even thought why she didn't mine some stone and first craft a stone axe to increase efficiency.</p>
<p>Because right now, only one thing was on her mind, and that was what kind of house she wanted to build.</p>
<p>Would it be Simple European style, or Classical European style, or perhaps Traditional Chinese style and Postmodern style?</p>
<p>One more chapter, before 12 AM.</p>
