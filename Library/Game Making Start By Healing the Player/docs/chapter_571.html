                <p>Chapter 570: Conquering Fear (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Song Ren had initially thought Ethan would suffer greatly in this escape game, but the outcome was unexpectedly easy.</p>
<p>“This is truly thrilling and exciting!” Song Ren exclaimed with emotion.</p>
<p>This escape game reminded him of the scene in the previous <em>Resident Evil</em> where he played games with the Baker family.</p>
<p>The difference was that this time, there wasn't much horror, but more thrilling excitement.</p>
<p>Continuing forward, Song Ren soon encountered a mysterious plump man who called himself the Duke. The other party seemed to already know Ethan and his purpose.</p>
<p>However, this wasn't a crucial story NPC, but a merchant.</p>
<p>Here, players could upgrade their equipment, purchase new firearms, and resupply ammunition.</p>
<p>“Quite unique!”</p>
<p>Looking at the merchant before him, Song Ren fully stocked up on bullets and other supplies.</p>
<p>The firearms with dozens of rounds gave him an indescribable sense of security.</p>
<p>As he stepped towards the ancient castle, he was about to face the first BOSS: Lady Dimitrescu.</p>
<p>He hadn't even walked two steps into the room when Song Ren saw Ethan captured by the noblewoman and Lady Dimitrescu's three daughters.</p>
<p>Afterwards, a dramatic vampiric scene unfolded, from which the conclusion was clear.</p>
<p>That is, the Bat Lord from the previous cutscene corresponded to Lady Dimitrescu.</p>
<p>But it had to be said that in this level, Ethan's perspective when looking at Lady Dimitrescu was simply invincible.</p>
<p>Especially the scene where she grabbed his arm to drink his blood; it truly made him feel no fear at all, but rather a little excited.</p>
<p>Vampires, werewolves, firearms, plus a medieval castle, and some religious elements.</p>
<p>When all these elements combined, the entire game became full of fun and wasn't as terrifying as its predecessor.</p>
<p>Although for some true horror game enthusiasts, this was a relatively major flaw.</p>
<p>But for ordinary players, they simply felt incredibly satisfied.</p>
<p>This could be seen from the major live streaming and video platforms.</p>
<p>After <em>Resident Evil</em> launched last year, even with the Double Eleven event, not many players tried it, including streamers.</p>
<p>There was no other way; they simply didn't dare!</p>
<p>But this time with <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, many people cautiously went in for a try, and though they were startled midway, the more they played, the more satisfying it felt.</p>
<p>Especially after entering the castle, facing the models of Lady Dimitrescu's three daughters and Lady Dimitrescu, they completely lost control.</p>
<p>And here, it transitioned into the classic hide-and-seek segment of <em>Resident Evil</em>, with the young ladies constantly playing hide-and-seek with Ethan inside the castle.</p>
<p>However, even though Ethan had many bullets here, he couldn't inflict any damage on the young ladies.</p>
<p>Logically, players should have felt the terror of being hunted down here.</p>
<p>However, many Lewd Person players not only felt no fear but even deliberately sought out the young ladies, just to close the distance and let them get closer.</p>
<p>Due to the exquisite in-game modeling, even though the young lady's face was covered in blood, she possessed a sickly beauty that made it impossible for players to restrain themselves.</p>
<p>Of course, if they hadn't seen the scene where Lady Dimitrescu's three daughters transformed into flies at the beginning, many might even have entertained the bold thought that if one was brave enough, even a female ghost would take maternity leave.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this interior part of the ancient castle, even some of the basement scenes, was adequately lit, rather than being pitch black.</p>
<p>This not-so-grim design allowed players to fully enjoy the game, and even those who were timid could persevere and even had the presence of mind to turn all the red areas on the map blue, accomplishing the feat of complete collection.</p>
<p>On Shark TV, in the familiar utility room, Sun Yixie, wearing a hood and headphones, was experiencing <em>Resident Evil Village</em> accompanied by a few friends.</p>
<p>Ever since he was scared senseless by <em>Outlast</em> back then, he had sworn never to play horror games again.</p>
<p>But as an instigator expert, he sometimes got himself involved by instigating others. Shaving his head and the double nudity at West Lake, although not entirely nude as he still wore underwear, never making empty promises was also one of his characteristics.</p>
<p>This time, he was essentially unwilling to play <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, but he had inadvertently caused trouble by instigating, though thankfully, the company of his friends gave him considerable courage.</p>
<p>However, once he actually started playing, he realized that the game wasn't as grim as he had imagined.</p>
<p>Although there were still some scary parts while playing, it was at least much better than the psychological trauma <em>Outlast</em> had given him back then. In fact, the gunplay and collecting elements were even a bit fun.</p>
<p>However, he was currently a little vexed.</p>
<p>“What the heck! Which way do you want me to go?! Do you want me dead?!”</p>
<p>Looking at the young lady who suddenly appeared before him, Sun Yixie felt a bit frustrated.</p>
<p>He had tried before; shooting her had no effect at all, only wasting a lot of his bullets.</p>
<p>Chased by the young lady the whole way, Sun Yixie felt a bit lost and panicked in the dungeon.</p>
<p>Until he reached the kitchen corridor.</p>
<p>“Hey... this hint? Can I break the window?” In the corridor, Sun Yixie noticed something different.</p>
<p>The windows were sparkling, seemingly prompting the player to hit them.</p>
<p>This was also one of the changes Chen Xu had made.</p>
<p>In the original <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, most of the plot passively triggered cutscenes. For instance, this vampiric young lady was defeated when Ethan, resisting, accidentally hit a window, allowing the cold wind to pour into the room, freezing Lady Dimitrescu's three daughters and killing them.</p>
<p>However, in this game, players could actively break the windows.</p>
<p>Of course, the feedback varied with different difficulties. For example, on the easiest difficulty, there were clear prompts, appearing as sparkling highlights.</p>
<p>On hardcore difficulty, however, it relied solely on the player's own judgment, or repeatedly passing through the kitchen corridor to trigger the cutscene.</p>
<p>Watching the vampiric young lady pursue him, Sun Yixie tried firing a shot at the window.</p>
<p>Bang! The window shattered instantly, and an icy, biting wind surged in from outside, carrying shards of ice.</p>
<p>A scream erupted from the vampiric young lady's mouth, and she stumbled, clearly taking significant damage from the cold.</p>
<p>'You foolish mortal!' Screaming and brandishing her scythe, the vampiric young lady lunged at Sun Yixie.</p>
<p>“Hey... I can hit her!” After shooting twice with his pistol, Sun Yixie was surprised to find that he could now inflict damage on her. This immediately weakened his initial fear a little more.</p>
<p>“Damn it! I'm giving you a big one! How do you like that?!” Sun Yixie immediately switched weapons, swapping his pistol for a more powerful shotgun.</p>
<p>He fired and shouted, dispelling the fear in his heart: “How do you like that?!”</p>
<p>As Ethan fired his shots, the vampiric young lady, besieged by the cold, grew increasingly stiff, uttering sounds of anger and terror: 'Ah... my body... it's breaking apart!'</p>
<p>“Damn it! How do you like that?! Come on, you! I'll blast you to death! Damn it!” Completely immersed in the game's atmosphere, Sun Yixie ignored the dialogue entirely, single-mindedly blasting the vampiric young lady in front of him with his shotgun.</p>
<p>Finally, losing her life force, she shattered into pieces with a crash, leaving behind only a body crystal.</p>
<p>At this moment, the bullet comments in Sun Yixie's live stream room all exploded.</p>
<p>A flurry of question marks appeared, and his friends accompanying him in the voice channel were also utterly stunned.</p>
<p>‘Holy crap, Brother Sun, what are those wild remarks?!’</p>
<p>‘So this is lust overcoming fear?’</p>
