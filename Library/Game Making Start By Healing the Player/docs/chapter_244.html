                <p>Chapter 243: Preparing to Head to the New World! (Fifth update, please subscribe for monthly passes)</p>
<p>On Chen Xu's and Nebula Games' official Weibo accounts, a message was posted that day.</p>
<p>The content was very simple: 'Preparing to head to the New World!'</p>
<p>Countless players who had long grown impatient were already excited just by seeing this one sentence.</p>
<p>"It's here, it's here! It's finally here!"</p>
<p>"I wonder what the gameplay of this game will be like!"</p>
<p>"Haha, I have a feeling it's going to be a bit exciting!"</p>
<p>"Heading to the New World! Going to hunt Elder Dragons, I want to be the Azure Star!"</p>
<p>With excited hearts, countless players clicked on the video.</p>
<p>First, a black screen appeared, followed by Nebula Games' game LOGO, and a very prominent Nebula Games Platform logo.</p>
<p>Then came the main part of the video.</p>
<p>A gentle breeze blew, rustling the grass and trees.</p>
<p>In a silent ancient forest, a Hunter, carrying a Great Sword on his back, walked through vines into the tranquil depths of the forest.</p>
<p>It was an island, where giant arbors and vines formed an ancient jungle.</p>
<p>Strange creatures and lush green plants were everywhere, with dangling vines and dense, verdant grass.</p>
<p>Guided by Scoutflies glowing with green light.</p>
<p>The Hunter continued to delve deeper into the forest.</p>
<p>Plants, birds, beasts.</p>
<p>Nothing seemed connected to anything in the real world.</p>
<p>Clearly, this was a brand new world, where everything was unrelated to reality.</p>
<p>After arriving at a Great Jagras's Den.</p>
<p>The Hunter began to run outwards, simultaneously using an item in hand to attract the prey's attention.</p>
<p>As the Jagras in the den got up one after another, the Hunter quietly hid in the tall grass nearby.</p>
<p>Only after all the Jagras had dispersed did the Hunter continue searching for information.</p>
<p>Finally, after traversing the complex forest, the Hunter found his prey.</p>
<p>A colossal creature resembling a Tyrannosaurus Rex.</p>
<p>The camera gave it a close-up, and the subtitles appearing next to it also let players know its name: Anjanath.</p>
<p>The Hunter donned a Ghillie Mantle, resembling green leaves, and cautiously approached the Anjanath.</p>
<p>Finally seizing an opportunity, the Hunter attacked the Anjanath, brutally striking its head with his Great Sword.</p>
<p>But it didn't cause very effective damage; instead, it enraged the colossal beast.</p>
<p>Letting out an earth-shattering roar, the Anjanath, having located the Hunter, charged ferociously.</p>
<p>But all of this was already within the Hunter's calculations. The Hunter showed no panic watching the charging Anjanath, performing two rolls on the ground to get away.</p>
<p>The Anjanath, which had been charging, was instead caught by a Vine Trap and slammed to the ground.</p>
<p>The Anjanath on the ground constantly thrashed its limbs, trying to break free, while the Hunter seized this chance to relentlessly unleash damage with his Great Sword.</p>
<p>As the Hunter's Great Sword hacked and slashed, the Anjanath quickly became covered in wounds. However, instead of weakening, the injured Anjanath grew even more frenzied.</p>
<p>The Anjanath, having broken free from the vines, continuously attacked the Hunter, who for a moment found it difficult to parry.</p>
<p>Although the Hunter seemed to be at a disadvantage, he was as unperturbed as before. While dodging the Anjanath's attacks, he observed his surroundings.</p>
<p>Finally, traversing forests and canyons, the Hunter lured the Anjanath to the territory of another monster—a Rathalos.</p>
<p>The behemoth on the ground and the flame-spitting Rathalos in the sky immediately clashed.</p>
<p>The Hunter from before had by now cautiously disengaged from the battle.</p>
<p>He took out a Flare from his person and fired it into the sky.</p>
<p>The scene switched: three Wingdrakes appeared in the sky.</p>
<p>And flew towards the outside of the forest.</p>
<p>A moment later, the three Wingdrakes returned the way they came.</p>
<p>Below the Wingdrakes, three Hunters carrying Long Swords were clinging to claws and rushing towards them.</p>
<p>As the Three Longsword Heroes descended from the sky, leaving three dashing figures behind.</p>
<p>The camera then returned to the Rathalos's camp, where the Anjanath and Rathalos were still fighting.</p>
<p>The Hunter, by now hidden far away, pulled out a Folding Stool and a Portable Grill from somewhere unknown, and was seriously engaged in roasting meat.</p>
<p>At the same time, the game's title appeared in the center of the screen.</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter: World</em>!</p>
<p>Then, accompanied by a roar from the Rathalos, a burst of flames erupted from its mouth.</p>
<p>The next moment, a line of text appeared in the center of the screen: Demo version available on August 1st.</p>
<p>Then, amidst the joyful BGM, the Hunter finally cooked the meat in his hands.</p>
<p>The golden, crispy roasted meat was even dripping with oil.</p>
<p>As the Hunter heartily devoured the food.</p>
<p>Another line of text appeared in the center of the screen: <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> officially launches on August 7th.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>The newly revealed promotional trailer immediately thrilled the players.</p>
<p>Before this, many players had all sorts of speculations about the game.</p>
<p>But those were just speculations.</p>
<p>Now, the appearance of this promotional video made many players incredibly excited.</p>
<p>If it were a promotional video from another game developer, players might not be so thrilled, but this was Nebula Games!</p>
<p>Every promotional video they released was essentially consistent with the actual content; it could entirely be considered real actual gameplay demonstration.</p>
<p>That's why players were so excited.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this video basically showcased the gameplay and complete ecosystem of <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>.</p>
<p>In terms of environment, <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>'s main setting was a dense forest, with monsters primarily consisting of dragon-like creatures.</p>
<p>Secondly, within the game, <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> also showcased its gameplay.</p>
<p>Searching for prey and hunting, it could be said to be quite complete.</p>
<p>Another aspect was the combat system.</p>
<p>It mainly focused on cold weapons, but looking at the attack patterns in the game, it didn't seem like the simple Basic Attack in <em>Dark Souls</em>; there appeared to be more complex move combinations, similar to input commands in fighting and action games, and players could also use environmental traps to attack monsters.</p>
<p>One could even perform a "borrowed knife to kill" move, letting other monsters help deal with the prey.</p>
<p>Finally, the appearance of Wingdrakes carrying three Long Sword teammates represented the game's online multiplayer gameplay.</p>
<p>As for the roasting meat in the game, it indicated that the game also had some mini-game elements, not just hunting.</p>
<p>Of course, the most thrilling point for players was the direct announcement of the launch date at the end of the promotional video.</p>
<p>Moreover, just like with <em>Minecraft</em> before, players could also download a demo version.</p>
<p>However, a slight difference was that, according to the introduction, this demo version was only for players to understand the game, and anyone could download it.</p>
<p>It was clearly meant to let players understand more clearly what kind of game <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> truly was.</p>
<p>If it suited their taste, they could pre-order directly; if not, then so be it.</p>
<p>(End of Chapter)</p>
