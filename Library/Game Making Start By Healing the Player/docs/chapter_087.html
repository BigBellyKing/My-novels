                <p>Chapter 87: Who's this Pink Idiot?</p>
<p>As the game officially began, 60 Fall Guys characters frantically rushed forward.</p>
<p>Because each round has a time limit and a qualification threshold. Once the number of qualifiers or the time limit is met, players who haven't reached the finish line will be eliminated.</p>
<p>So everyone wanted to reach the finish line as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this round called 'Door Dash' featured a series of gates on the path forward, some real, some fake. So it was quite a test of luck.</p>
<p>Some players crashed directly into gates, while others successfully found the correct ones.</p>
<p>With someone leading the way, players following behind naturally swarmed through the already open gates.</p>
<p>Adding to that, the game also had a grabbing mechanic. The scene was chaotic for a time.</p>
<p>Outside the exhibition, a group of players holding their phones couldn't help but shout.</p>
<p>“Hey, bro, stop pulling me! Stop pulling me!”</p>
<p>“Which big bro is this Pineapple Head? You're practically pulling my pants off!”</p>
<p>“Why are all these gates pushing into this one spot?”</p>
<p>“Let me through! Don't block me!”</p>
<p>On the field, countless Fall Guys characters of various colors squeezed together, pushing into one gate, afraid of falling behind.</p>
<p>This reminded many players of their own university days. When they first entered as freshmen, not knowing where to order takeout from backdoor spots, they all dutifully went to the cafeteria.</p>
<p>Every time the last class ended, students from various buildings would swarm towards the cafeteria. It really looked a bit like this scene!</p>
<p>Those who hadn't matched into a game, or those still standing in front of the Nebula Games exhibition area, were filled with joy.</p>
<p>“Haha, I'm dying of laughter, just now a Hot Dog Head bro got squeezed right off!”</p>
<p>“This feels so fun!”</p>
<p>“The physics engine makes these Fall Guys feel like springy rubber!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, and that wall-climbing animation is just hilarious.”</p>
<p>“No, I have to play it myself too.”</p>
<p>“Let's team up and play!”</p>
<p>“Team play doesn't seem very useful in this game; everyone relies on their own skills.”</p>
<p>“It's still somewhat useful. There are team rounds later, and teamed players who survive until then will be on the same side.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see! That's pretty good then.”</p>
<p>Players at the Nebula Games exhibition area, watching the Fall Guys screen on the big display, couldn't resist opening their phones to matchmake a round themselves; they were really itching to play!</p>
<p>At the same time, in the exhibition areas of other surrounding developers, many players were drawn by the commotion here and turned their heads. Some even just found an empty spot in another exhibition area, pulled out their phones, and started playing Fall Guys, simply because there were too many people at the Nebula Games exhibition.</p>
<p>This made the staff of other game developers' faces darken.</p>
<p>At this point, the first round of Fall Guys at Nebula Games' exhibition also entered a heated stage.</p>
<p>With fewer than ten spots left, people were about to be eliminated.</p>
<p>“Old Zhang! Rush! I'll hold the others back for you!” Song Ren, who had successfully matched into this round at the Nebula Games exhibition, looked at the two Hamburger Head Fall Guys next to him and the number representing the last qualification spot, finally making a decision.</p>
<p>“Let go! Let go! Old Song, you're grabbing me!” When the sinister little hand grabbed one of the Fall Guys, Zhang Yi, holding his phone next to him, was filled with despair, causing the surrounding players to cast curious glances.</p>
<p>Instantly, someone recognized Zhang Yi and Song Ren, after all, the scene of Zhuge Observe Stars using Create Something from Nothing in the Sanguosha area was still fresh in everyone's memory.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chen Xu, who was focusing on the game, had this moment captured on screen and displayed on the big monitor.</p>
<p>“Clearly, that was a moment of fraternal affection. With only one spot left, the teammate wanted to eliminate a competitor to help his friend reach the finish line.”</p>
<p>“He declared with determination: 'Live on with my share!'”</p>
<p>“However, it's a bit of a pity that he grabbed his own teammate.”</p>
<p>After entering the elimination settlement screen at the end of the round, the team identifier finally appeared, Chen Xu concluded, noting that the two were teammates.</p>
<p>The spectators also burst into laughter. This truly confirmed the saying: 'It's not terrifying to have god-like opponents, but it is terrifying to have pig-like teammates!'</p>
<p>But among the players currently in the game, many had their eyes light up. The recent maneuver seemed to have opened a new door for them!</p>
<p>This Fall Guys game, it seems, could have a different approach to gameplay!</p>
<p>Wang Han, standing next to Song Ren and Zhang Yi, looked at the two of them speechless.</p>
<p>“You guys are something else,” Wang Han said, completely speechless.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi didn't speak, just cast a resentful gaze at Song Ren beside him.</p>
<p>“My bad, brother!” Song Ren said, slightly embarrassed, taking the blame.</p>
<p>And as the game progressed, the Nebula Games exhibition area was filled with various sounds of despair.</p>
<p>Even some players who hadn't successfully matched into a game let loose due to the atmosphere.</p>
<p>If one were alone, in such a crowd, it would naturally be too embarrassing to shout out loud. But when everyone was doing it, it was a completely different experience.</p>
<p>Especially when players got to the special rounds of Jump Club and Block Party in the game, the volume of shouts grew even louder.</p>
<p>Because in these two rounds, players needed to jump to avoid obstacles and a rapidly spinning platform, while the available space for movement would shrink. This created countless victims.</p>
<p>Some players who discovered unique tricks would, when they couldn't avoid an obstacle themselves, extend their sinister little hands to grab other players. Instantly, the Fall Guys transformed into Grabbers.</p>
<p>“Awesome!”</p>
<p>“Fantastic!”</p>
<p>Beside Wang Han, Song Ren and Zhang Yi had transformed into her cheerleaders.</p>
<p>At this very moment, Wang Han had thrillingly but safely advanced to the final round, a level called 'Hex-A-Gone'.</p>
<p>It must be said, she was actually a little nervous at this point.</p>
<p>This round, according to the description, wasn't hard to understand. The floor tiles players stepped on would disappear, causing them to fall to the next layer.</p>
<p>Excluding the players' starting position, there were eight layers of floor. Falling through the eighth layer would lead players into the slime below, eliminating them.</p>
<p>Therefore, one needed to stay on the floor for as long as possible. After all other players were eliminated, victory would be achieved. Simply put, outlast everyone else, and you win.</p>
<p>“Can't stick with other players, or else they'll step on my tiles and make them disappear!” Wang Han concluded.</p>
<p>After all, this round perfectly illustrated the saying: 'Walk someone else's path and leave them with no path to walk.'</p>
<p>However, Wang Han soon discovered a little trick: if she just walked, the path disappeared too quickly. But if she jumped to increase her airtime, couldn't one step become two?</p>
<p>At this moment, Chen Xu, who was providing commentary, also noticed this detail.</p>
<p>“This Hot Dog Fall Guy seems to be up to no good! Sure enough! He's approaching the Pineapple Head Fall Guy! The sinister little hand reached out.”</p>
<p>“The two are in a stalemate and started to fall! Oh no, both are eliminated!”</p>
<p>“Let's look at the other contestants, hmm, this pink Fall Guy has a good idea!”</p>
<p>“By using jumps to slow down their fall, because jumping provides airtime, theoretically, it should be much slower than other contestants who are just walking.”</p>
<p>“It just seems like this pink contestant isn't very familiar with the controls; a mistake! They took a big tumble and fell directly to the last layer!”</p>
<p>Chen Xu was providing commentary here.</p>
<p>Over by Wang Han, Joey, who had just exited a game with her headphones on, happened to hear Chen Xu's commentary. Coupled with the image on the LCD screen of a pink character jumping and missing, then falling three layers directly into the final honey, it completely amused her.</p>
<p>“Haha, this one in pink is so dumb! Jumping like that! Hey, what are you two looking at?” Joey asked, baffled, seeing Song Ren and Zhang Yi next to her, one looking up at the exhibition hall ceiling, the other looking down at the floor.</p>
<p>“That pink-clad idiot you're talking about is me!” Wang Han said, expressionless.</p>
<p>Joey: …………</p>
<p>On stage, Chen Xu wasn't planning to continue commentating indefinitely. For the first two rounds on the first day of the exhibition, his appearance to warm up the crowd and maximize the game's buzz was sufficient.</p>
<p>Handing the microphone to the designated host, Chen Xu looked at the excited players below the exhibition stage and smiled contentedly.</p>
<p>The players' reactions to Fall Guys and Sanguosha made him very satisfied. Clearly, these two games, while not necessarily divine, had at least captured the attention of countless players for now.</p>
<p>And this was only the beginning of the exhibition!</p>
