                <p>Chapter 30: Who Did I Offend?</p>
<p>'This is the most brutally slandered the Joker has ever been!'</p>
<p>'Honestly, the Joker brings joy to people, but what about Teacher Zhong?'</p>
<p>'Upstairs, hasn't Teacher Zhong brought us enough joy already?'</p>
<p>'233333, thanks to Chen Xu for introducing me to Teacher Zhong. Whenever I'm down, I just look at Teacher Zhong's past quotes and I cheer right up.'</p>
<p>'But seriously, I'm still curious about what Chen Xu's new game actually is. I just have a bad feeling about it!'</p>
<p>'Could he really be getting ahead of himself?'</p>
<p>'Hard to say, but given Mirror (Game) and Undertale, I'm still going to wait and see for myself.'</p>
<p>'Ten-plus days feels very dubious.'</p>
<p>Following Chen Xu's official Weibo account post, many players who had been following him since Mirror (Game) and Undertale began discussing it enthusiastically.</p>
<p>However, the general consensus was a lack of optimism.</p>
<p>After all, the development time was simply too short.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>In contrast to the heated discussions among players, the industry, and the media,</p>
<p>Inside NetDragon's Jianhuolei Studio, a Game Designer looked at the news online, his hands trembling.</p>
<p>Meng Zuo, the lead designer of Jianhuolei Studio, was currently developing a sci-fi game called Galaxy Heroes.</p>
<p>His main goal was this year's Sci-Fi Game Design Competition.</p>
<p>Being under NetDragon sounded impressive.</p>
<p>But in reality, there were too many internal project teams, and Jianhuolei Studio, which he led, was just one of them.</p>
<p>Moreover, not every project team received tens of millions or hundreds of millions in development funds.</p>
<p>A few million Yuan was already considered a medium-sized project within NetDragon.</p>
<p>For Meng Zuo, targeting this Sci-Fi Game Design Competition meant hoping to secure the top spot.</p>
<p>This would help him elevate his standing in the gaming industry and within NetDragon, granting him access to better resources and project development funds.</p>
<p>Everything had been going smoothly, but then Chen Xu suddenly announced he would also be making a sci-fi game and participating in the same competition, completely disrupting Meng Zuo's plans.</p>
<p>It wasn't because he was overly wary of Chen Xu.</p>
<p>In fact, his view was the same as many others: Chen Xu couldn't possibly make anything substantial in such a short amount of time.</p>
<p>But the crucial point was that the explosive popularity of Mirror (Game) and Undertale had undeniably boosted Chen Xu's traffic through the roof.</p>
<p>For countless game media outlets, Chen Xu was synonymous with traffic!</p>
<p>And for players, the hype around Undertale hadn't completely subsided, so Chen Xu's every move was still intensely watched.</p>
<p>As for Zhong Mei's sarcastic remarks, in a way, they also contributed to Chen Xu's traffic.</p>
<p>So, this was incredibly awkward!</p>
<p>His brainchild, Galaxy Heroes, had a dedicated budget allocated specifically for promotion.</p>
<p>And implementation had already begun.</p>
<p>But now?</p>
<p>All the damn buzz had been stolen!</p>
<p>There was nothing he could do. Although NetDragon was a leading major channel provider in the country, and they were a studio under NetDragon,</p>
<p>the channel side was handled by the operations department, while they were a separate development working group.</p>
<p>The operations department wasn't generous enough to sacrifice their own performance to help them out.</p>
<p>Want to use NetDragon's channel for promotion?</p>
<p>'No problem, seeing as we're all colleagues and part of the same family, we'll give you a 1% internal discount.'</p>
<p>'What? No money?'</p>
<p>'If you don't have money, why bother us?'</p>
<p>'Get lost!'</p>
<p>'Coming to us with no money, do you think our metrics don't matter?'</p>
<p>Looking at the trending news online, such as 'Chen Xu's New Game to Enter Sci-Fi Game Design Competition' and 'Games Are Not Child's Play, Has Chen Xu, Creator of Undertale, Become Overconfident?',</p>
<p>Meng Zuo felt his heart tremble.</p>
<p>He barely had any promotional budget to begin with, and now it was all wasted!</p>
<p>"Who did I offend?!" Meng Zuo clutched his chest, his face contorted in agony.</p>
<p>Looking at Chen Xu's previous hype-generating official Weibo account posts with Zhong Mei, Meng Zuo momentarily wanted to @ Chen Xu, express his disdain for the new game, and perhaps initiate a clash between two armies to boost his own and his new game's presence.</p>
<p>But he stopped himself, not because he thought he would lose, but because he was different from Zhong Mei.</p>
<p>After all, although Zhong Mei's Hapai Culture &amp; Sports was small, just an Independent Game workshop, he was still the BOSS.</p>
<p>But what about him? He was a Game Producer under NetDragon. If he dared to jump out and confront Chen Xu, he'd be completely screwed.</p>
<p>After all, he would have no just cause. In ancient times, even rebels would declare the court corrupt and incompetent, asking, "Are kings, nobles, generals, and ministers born with special blood?"</p>
<p>If he directly jumped out to confront Chen Xu, it might feel good at the moment, but serious trouble would follow.</p>
<p>Apologizing would be a minor issue; he feared that the players' hatred for NetDragon would be transferred onto him, and he would also end up being the Scapegoat for other departments within the company.</p>
<p>Then others would earn piles of Money, while he'd face various disciplinary actions – that would truly be heartbreaking to hear and see.</p>
<p>Having his buzz stolen was already terrible; if he also ended up carrying a huge Scapegoat, it would be utterly unbearable.</p>
<p>But now?</p>
<p>He felt awful!</p>
<p>What made it even worse was that Meng Zuo knew Chen Xu, the unwitting instigator, was completely unaware of the situation, and hadn't even intentionally targeted him. This only fueled his indignation.</p>
<p>How unjustly he was suffering!</p>
<p>While it's true that a gentleman's revenge is never too late, and he couldn't blame Chen Xu entirely, there was still a connection.</p>
<p>So, in that instant, he had already started picturing in his mind exactly how he would act when the time came.</p>
<p>"You stole my promotional buzz, so in the Sci-Fi Game Design Competition, let's let our games do the talking!"</p>
<p>"Although I feel you might not even pass the review, I still hope you win one of the last-place awards, so you can also be invited by the Game Department to the offline awards ceremony."</p>
<p>"Then, in front of countless players, Game Department leaders, and game media, I will definitely give you a ruthless handshake, and then smile and say 'I've heard much about you,' and praise how excellent your new game is!"</p>
<p>Gazing with envy at the trending headlines about Chen Xu, Meng Zuo took a deep breath, closed the webpage, and deeply immersed himself in his fantasies.</p>
<p>Red carpet, media, handshakes, speeches—a month from now, that would be his perfect day of revenge!</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>In the Nebula Games office, Chen Xu was still unaware that someone had already begun fantasizing about how to get revenge on him.</p>
<p>During this period, he had been incredibly busy, on one hand overseeing the development progress of To the Moon, and on the other, conducting recruitment interviews.</p>
<p>Chen Xu had basically posted relevant recruitment information on various forums and communities within the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Under the prestige of Undertale, it must be said that it did attract many Gaming Industry Professionals.</p>
<p>The problem was, too few of them met Chen Xu's expectations.</p>
<p>After reviewing all the applications, Chen Xu sighed: "Ah! It's hard to find good people!"</p>
<p>The plan for the development department was to hire another art assistant to help distribute some of the workload between himself and Ruan Ningxue.</p>
<p>At the same time, they needed to hire a Numerical Designer and a Level Designer.</p>
<p>Yet, for these three positions, no promising candidates had been found yet.</p>
<p>Just then, there were two knocks on the office door. Chen Xu answered, and the door was pushed open. A middle-aged man in his thirties walked in.</p>
<p>Zhang Yida, Nebula Games' Marketing Manager, was responsible for game promotion and related business affairs.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, have the contact details for the relevant personnel been finalized?" Zhang Yida asked, a mix of admiration and hesitation on his face.</p>
<p>"Yes, go ahead and contact them directly," Chen Xu nodded with a smile.</p>
<p>After a brief chat with Zhang Yida, the other man left the office.</p>
<p>Chen Xu, meanwhile, refocused his attention on his computer to continue developing content for To the Moon.</p>
