                <p>Chapter 640: This Hammer Looks Cool, It'll Be Mine Soon! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Inside the graveyard, the five people exchanged glances.</p>
<p>Things were a bit more unexpected than anticipated.</p>
<p>“Everyone, don’t be discouraged. We’re doing early-game progression here. The main reason we wiped this time was that we were too greedy and rushed in. We’ll take it slow from now on.” Song Ren looked at everyone and summarized their party wipe experience.</p>
<p>The main reason they wiped was pulling too many monsters at once.</p>
<p>The healing couldn't keep up with the tank's damage absorption and aggro, and the DPS couldn't eliminate the excess monsters quickly enough, ultimately leading to the party wipe.</p>
<p>Now that they understood, if they didn't get greedy and just played it safe, Song Ren felt it shouldn't be too big of a problem.</p>
<p>“But it feels very different from typical MMORPGs. It demands quite a high level of team chemistry. If we had just communicated more earlier instead of bragging, it would have been fine.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, especially the aggro mechanism. Neither the DPS nor the Healer can just blindly output damage.”</p>
<p>As they did their corpse run, they also discussed their recent experience.</p>
<p>They had personally experienced a party wipe, even though they hadn't even seen the BOSS.</p>
<p>This made Song Ren and the others realize the difference in dungeons in World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>Firstly, players would need to understand the monsters, terrain, and other aspects of the dungeon. It felt a bit like a memorization game.</p>
<p>In reality, regarding the difficulty of World of Warcraft dungeons, Mr. Chen Xu hadn't deliberately adjusted it to be lower or higher.</p>
<p>However, due to differences in operation mode and game platform types, it was actually somewhat simpler compared to its previous life.</p>
<p>But at the same time, it also had some slight complexities.</p>
<p>Although the game now had voice chat and numerical statistics, allowing players to coordinate better, with the VR platform as the carrier, the game's terrain combined with the operation mode made it, at least for players researching terrain and monster distribution, not as easy as in its previous life.</p>
<p>Corpse run, eat bread, drink water, then continue.</p>
<p>Song Ren didn't immediately pull monsters, but instead gave a pre-battle speech to boost everyone's morale.</p>
<p>“No big deal, how can early-game progression of a dungeon not involve a party wipe?”</p>
<p>“The important thing is to know why we wiped, learn from our mistakes, and make progress.”</p>
<p>“This time, let's try to fight them one by one. Anyway, we're not competing with anyone for a speedrun.”</p>
<p>“'See success or failure, life is bold and free, just start over again.' We've only wiped once!”</p>
<p>“All successful masters are made from corpse runs. Every dungeon cleared for the first time is supported by countless corpses.”</p>
<p>“Do you see the white bone remains on the ground before we entered the dungeon entrance?”</p>
<p>“Who are those people? Those are players who died directly at the dungeon entrance without even getting in. The fact that we can enter the dungeon already makes us better than many players.”</p>
<p>“So, come on, everyone!”</p>
<p>Song Ren waved his weapon, looking at everyone with rising and falling intonation.</p>
<p>“Please give it a rest! Be careful this time, repairing equipment costs a lot of money.” Zhang Yi, beside him, mercilessly interrupted.</p>
<p>“Ahem… once we clear this dungeon, we’ll significantly upgrade and go from poverty to wealth.” Song Ren coughed lightly twice.</p>
<p>This time, Song Ren and the others were much more cautious, pulling monsters one by one.</p>
<p>As long as they didn't pull too many like before, it was generally fine.</p>
<p>Even if they sometimes accidentally pulled an extra one, it was still within their acceptable limit.</p>
<p>“Although the efficiency is slow, it's so much easier!”</p>
<p>“Step by step, cautious and careful, it doesn’t feel that hard.”</p>
<p>Song Ren chatted with Zhang Yi and the others.</p>
<p>They slowly lured one monster at a time, constantly paying attention to aggro, preferring to deal damage slowly rather than exceeding aggro.</p>
<p>Although it was slower, the progress was exceptionally smooth, and it wasn't mentally taxing, just time-consuming.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the environment inside the Deadmines was very friendly to Miners.</p>
<p>From the outside to the inside, it was almost entirely mines in a straight line, and there were no other players or Miners to compete with, so the Mining experience was excellent.</p>
<p>“I wish I had learned Mining earlier. These are all humanoid monsters, so I can’t skin them.” Zhang Yi, looking at Wang Yifan, couldn't help but sigh, banging his pickaxe against the iron ore.</p>
<p>“What's there to be envious about? Just a Miner! I learned Blacksmithing and also Engineering in Stormwind! All your ore is mined for me!” Song Ren chuckled.</p>
<p>Looking at Song Ren’s proud expression, Wang Han thought for a moment and then said, “Old Song, have you ever considered something? Your ore is mined for you, but the money you earn is for the Miners?”</p>
<p>Song Ren, who had just snapped back to reality, froze for a moment.</p>
<p>It seemed that way, indeed!</p>
<p>When he looked at the descriptions earlier, Blacksmithing and Engineering both seemed quite expensive!</p>
<p>Could he, a Warrior, afford it?</p>
<p>“Old Song, you can’t just take the ore for free, you have to pay! The lowest market price is fine.” Wang Yifan put away his pickaxe and coughed lightly.</p>
<p>Song Ren: ………………</p>
<p>Feeling the floor suddenly getting a bit hot, Song Ren controlled his character to jump twice in place, then moved forward while changing the subject: “Oh, how annoying! Let's go quickly, see what the BOSS of this dungeon looks like? Why is there a big iron door here?”</p>
<p>Passing through a small mine tunnel, what appeared before them was a tightly shut large iron door.</p>
<p>As the Tank of the team, Song Ren cautiously advanced and then pushed the door open.</p>
<p>“Eh… just three monsters?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s the BOSS!”</p>
<p>“This BOSS is so ugly, and he’s not even wearing clothes, is he being a pervert?”</p>
<p>“That hammer looks so powerful, I wonder if it can drop!”</p>
<p>Looking at the BOSS behind the door, they hadn't attracted aggro yet.</p>
<p>No one rushed to attack, instead, they observed for a moment.</p>
<p>Before them was a large fat man named Lakzo, with two Level 16 Defias Sentinel henchmen beside him.</p>
<p>And it seemed these two monsters, unlike the squishy henchmen they encountered before, were not so easy to deal with, being the BOSS’s minions.</p>
<p>“I wonder if I can tank the BOSS and these two henchmen?” Song Ren looked at the distant BOSS and the two small monsters, feeling a bit worried.</p>
<p>“I think you should be able to. This is only the first dungeon, Mr. Chen won't make it too hard. Your equipment is quite decent with our subsidies, at least you don't have to sell equipment to learn skills. The average Warrior's treatment certainly isn't as good as yours, Old Song. If you can’t tank it, how would random pick-up teams get through?” Zhang Yi said.</p>
<p>“You have a point. Are you ready? We’re going in! Also, I’ll apply for Loot Rights later. That hammer clearly looks like it’s for a Warrior, it should be a blue hammer. Later, I’ll show you what a Lucky King’s luck is like!” Song Ren looked at the large hammer in Lakzo's hand with some anticipation.</p>
<p>“Are you sure? You've always had terrible luck in games.” Zhang Yi expressed doubt.</p>
<p>“Hmph, I'll show you what a Lucky King is later!” Song Ren huffed.</p>
<p>A hammer? Looks cool and powerful?</p>
<p>But sorry, it’s going to be his soon!</p>
