<p>Chapter 167: Just a Bit Hard on the Heart (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>May 7th, with only four days left until the expo, all players were eagerly anticipating the arrival of the gameplay Expo.</p>
<p>Some players who followed Chen Xu, constantly refreshing his official Weibo account in hopes of catching a glimpse of game news, actually found a post on his official Weibo.</p>
<p>"Test DEMO 'Silent Hill PT' is now available on the Nebula Games Platform. Interested players can download and experience it for free."</p>
<p>Many players hadn't yet processed the news.</p>
<p>What was going on?</p>
<p>Hadn't Chen Xu just finished It Takes Two? And shouldn't he be actively developing the Dark Souls Prequel during this time?</p>
<p>Why had he suddenly released a DEMO?</p>
<p>Could it be a new game?</p>
<p>But that didn't seem right; if it were a new game, shouldn't it be called an Experience DEMO instead?</p>
<p>What the heck was a Test DEMO?</p>
<p>Many players were very curious.</p>
<p>Carrying this curiosity, after clicking into the Nebula Games Platform and reading the introduction, many players fell silent for a second or two, then clasped their hands in a gesture of farewell!</p>
<p>Because, damn it, it turned out to be a horror-themed DEMO.</p>
<p>To this day, many players still vividly remembered Outlast, created by Chen Xu back then.</p>
<p>Even now, some streamers who haven't played it or can't find good live streaming programs will choose to stream Outlast, with videos of them getting scared silly having consistently high click rates on major video platforms.</p>
<p>And now, this 'Silent Hill PT' was another horror game?!</p>
<p>However, after carefully reading the introduction, many people's curiosity was piqued once more.</p>
<p>The introduction clearly stated that this was not a complete game, nor was it a game trailer.</p>
<p>Simply put, this was a Test DEMO, provided to the Game Department for testing the latest VR equipment.</p>
<p>Besides the domestic gameplay Expo, the hottest news recently was basically about the new type of VR equipment.</p>
<p>Overseas, they had already started various boasts, aiming to establish a preconceived notion that they were incredibly impressive.</p>
<p>Originally, the domestic side had been silently developing, but with the overseas situation, they clearly couldn't remain indifferent.</p>
<p>Currently, they had also released some related parameters externally.</p>
<p>For ordinary players, it was just something to watch, not knowing when it would be released, and for a period after its launch, it would clearly be a luxury for average players, who could at most go to a VR experience store to try it out.</p>
<p>However, for game industry designers, none of this was surprising news, including the fact that the Game Department had previously invited some cutting-edge domestic designers to participate in the DEMO testing program.</p>
<p>This information had actually already circulated and been reported by some media outlets.</p>
<p>It now seemed that Chen Xu had also participated in the development!</p>
<p>This immediately sparked heated discussion among both the gaming community and designers.</p>
<p>"Chen Xu finished developing the Test DEMO so quickly? Is he just phoning it in?"</p>
<p>"Why bother? The Game Department didn't force him, and doesn't Chen Xu still have the Dark Souls Prequel to develop? If he didn't want to participate, he would have directly refused. I bet it's just a small Test DEMO."</p>
<p>"No, I heard this DEMO is very rich in content and really scary!"</p>
<p>"Scary? How scary could it be? It should be terrifying with the highly immersive experience of the new VR, but how scary can a PC version be?"</p>
<p>"Honestly, those who doubted Outlast before are already 'lying in little boxes'."</p>
<p>"Exaggerating! Outlast is a complete game, this is just a DEMO, the meaning is completely different, okay?!"</p>
<p>"Speaking of which, stop focusing so much on 'Silent Hill PT'! It's just a DEMO, shouldn't we all be more concerned about the Dark Souls Prequel? Chen Xu made 'Silent Hill PT' during this time, doesn't that mean the development progress of the Dark Souls Prequel has most likely been temporarily shelved?"</p>
<p>"Damn, now that you mention it, it really seems that way! So, at the gameplay Expo, can we still play the demo?"</p>
<p>"You ask me, who should I ask? Besides, Chen Xu and his team didn't seem to say there would be demo content at the gameplay Expo, just that they would bring new news."</p>
<p>"I can't take it anymore! I'm going to die without Dark Souls!"</p>
<p>"Bro, if there's no Dark Souls to play, didn't Mr. Chen bring us a beta DEMO? We can use it to maybe catch a glimpse of the new VR!"</p>
<p>"Overthinking it. The PC version and VR will definitely have different experiences. Maybe the VR version is terrifying, but on PC, there won't be much feeling."</p>
<p>At Nebula Games, Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, Qin Yi, and others, also watching the online player discussions, looked at the comments with complex expressions.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, I feel like your title as 'Warrior of Love' will probably be impossible to shake off in the future," Yang Xin lamented.</p>
<p>"Exactly!" Ruan Ningxue nodded.</p>
<p>Everyone had initially been quite curious about the Silent Hill PT DEMO sent to the Game Department for testing the new VR equipment.</p>
<p>But they couldn't experience the VR version. Now, using previous data to develop the PC version, they finally experienced that oppressive sense of fear.</p>
<p>While it certainly couldn't compare to the VR version, it was precisely this that made them feel even more hair-raising.</p>
<p>"Well, there's nothing for it. This is also for the players' sake. You all agree that 'Silent Hill PT', even though it's just a DEMO, has excellent content, right? With such outstanding Level Design and puzzle content, wouldn't it be a loss of a hundred million if players couldn't experience it?" Chen Xu said with a smile, then added, "Besides, look, haven't the players already thought of a reason for us not having a Dark Souls Prequel demo at the gameplay Expo?"</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, everyone present was speechless for a moment.</p>
<p>"And if players respond well, I think we might consider releasing a more complete 'Silent Hill' on the VR platform in the future, rather than just a DEMO without much content," Chen Xu said, stretching.</p>
<p>More complete?! And on the VR platform?</p>
<p>Was he tearing off his amiable mask and completely indulging himself?</p>
<p>Wouldn't that mean sending off as many players as they had?</p>
<p>Nebula Games could directly switch careers and become a killer company!</p>
<p>As everyone fell silent.</p>
<p>Before the gameplay Expo, the main theme of the gaming industry had already emerged: piercing screams!</p>
<p>In countless homes, players experiencing 'Silent Hill PT' all let out agonizing screams, like pigs being slaughtered.</p>
<p>Although there was indeed a significant difference between the PC version and the highly immersive VR version.</p>
<p>Compared to Kojima's PT in his previous life, due to the Parallel World's technology, Chen Xu was able to make the graphics more realistic, and graphics are a crucial core element for horror games. This made the PC version's performance and sense of immersion slightly stronger than the original.</p>
<p>As a result, most players who experienced it were turned away by Lisa's first turn-around jump scare.</p>
<p>A small number of others were scared away by Lisa's terrifying glimpse through the gap in the bathroom door.</p>
<p>There was nothing they could do; it was just too scary, they couldn't endure it!</p>
<p>Compared to Outlast back then, even though this was just a DEMO, many players found it even scarier.</p>
<p>It was clearly just a game, but playing it felt like experiencing it with their lives.</p>
<p>If the PC version was already this terrifying.</p>
<p>How scary must the original VR version, used for testing, be?!</p>
<p>Many players, though they had never met the testers, felt some sympathy for them after experiencing the PC version of 'Silent Hill PT' themselves.</p>
<p>And on forum communities, these players huddled together for warmth, discussing animatedly.</p>
<p>"Damn it, who said this DEMO wouldn't be too scary before? I'll give you a buff!"</p>
<p>"Yeah! Unlike Outlast, which had shocking moments everywhere, in this DEMO, I only encountered one shocking moment. The whole time it was just an oppressive atmosphere, but precisely when that shocking moment appeared, my fragile little heart just couldn't take it anymore!"</p>
<p>"The baby crying in the bathroom and the female ghost knocking on the door truly scared the living daylights out of me!"</p>
<p>"The scariest part is that the game's graphics are too good! What the heck is Chen Xu doing spending so much money on a DEMO?! Scared my dad to death!"</p>
<p>"When the female ghost turned around and asked me for a kiss, I was so damn scared my mouse flew off!"</p>
<p>And on live streaming platforms, many streamers were even more on the verge of breakdown.</p>
<p>Because streaming Outlast before, if you followed the story and weren't too scared to quit, it was still quite easy to clear the game.</p>
<p>Moreover, new scenes at least gave them some comfort, knowing that entering a new scene meant being one step closer to clearing the game and being free.</p>
<p>But 'Silent Hill', as a DEMO, according to the introduction, only had a playtime of about half an hour, but the crucial point was that this game was primarily focused on puzzle content!</p>
<p>If they couldn't solve the puzzles, they would be stuck forever, looping in the house, playing house with Lisa!</p>
<p>But you know what, if you're with Lisa, you get a wife, a child, and a house all at once. Isn't that quite tempting?</p>
<p>The only drawback is, it's a bit hard on the heart.</p>
