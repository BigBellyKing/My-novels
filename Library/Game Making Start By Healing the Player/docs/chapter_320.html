                <p>Chapter 319: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>In Nebula Games' conference room, everyone was holding their first post-New Year meeting. The others were also discussing the content of this meeting. Just then, Chen Xu walked into the conference room, and everyone fell silent. Chen Xu looked at everyone and said, “I believe you’ve all heard about it, right? Regarding the competition between Zeus and Huanyu, just like other domestic game developers, we will use Huanyu as the prototype for developing our new work. Without further ado, let’s take a look at our new project.”</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (Cinematic Storyline [Level Design], Multiplayer, Fictional War)</p>
<p>Looking at the title displayed on the large screen, everyone present was a little curious. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, this was clearly the name of the new game project. And just like the subtitle, it should be set against a modern warfare theme. However, after seeing some of the tags below, many people became curious. Multiplayer, fictional war—these were relatively easy to understand. It simply meant the game had a multiplayer mode and was set in a fictional war. But what did 'Cinematic Storyline' and the specially highlighted 'Level Design' mean? Looking at the title, everyone felt a bit strange.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, are we also going to acquire an IP?” someone asked curiously during the Q&amp;A session. After all, the most talked-about recent event was Atrai's 'Storm Action'. And according to Chen Xu, although it wasn't explicitly stated, with one game launching on the Zeus platform and the other on the Huanyu platform, it was clear they were heading for a competition. In this situation, were they also going to buy a major IP?</p>
<p>However, Qin Yi, Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, and others who had previously discussed it with Chen Xu knew that this wasn't the case. “Of course not, we're creating our own IP,” Chen Xu said with a smile, shaking his head. “This new game project will be a bit different from what you might expect; we need to create a linear FPS game.” “As for 'cinematic,' you can understand it as making the game like a movie, giving it a cinematic feel, with the rhythm and presentation of a Hollywood blockbuster.” Chen Xu spoke slowly, looking at everyone.</p>
<p>The Call of Duty series, in his previous life, became the number one IP in FPS games. It could be said that it all started with the Modern Warfare title. So, what kind of impact did the Modern Warfare series have on the Call of Duty brand? Firstly, in terms of single-player storyline, the Modern Warfare series was arguably a peak for Call of Duty. Unlike Half-Life, which pioneered FPS narrative, and Halo, which distilled 30-second bursts of excitement, Modern Warfare was more about showcasing a cinematic feel. Cinematic games, in this Parallel World, didn't yet have a precise concept; many game designers simply aimed to make the game's graphics better. But cinematic games are far from that simple and can generally be divided into three types. The first type is the use of a one-shot camera like in New God of War, and in-game homages, such as a segment in Little Nightmares 2 where players traverse a corridor, clearly paying tribute to Roman Polanski's classic thriller Repulsion. This is an application of cinematic technique, aimed at providing players with a more immersive experience. Then there's interactive cinematic gameplay, with Detroit and Heavy Rain being typical examples. Finally, and the mode used by more games, is presenting a movie-like experience through game content: Uncharted's broad narrative threads, The Last of Us's near-perfect camera work, and Metal Gear's seamless camera transitions. Coupled with the audiovisual experience and level design, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was simply perfect. Most FPS players only realized, starting with Modern Warfare, that FPS games could offer an experience akin to watching a blockbuster movie. The camera work and the pace of the storytelling could easily be viewed as a major film. What was even more outstanding was that it wasn't just about cinematic plot content, but about cinematicizing the levels players experienced. Each game in the Modern Warfare trilogy had several unforgettable classic level designs. Especially the flashback level titled 'All Ghillied Up,' which was revered as a classic by countless players. Of course, besides the excellent storyline, what allowed Call of Duty to become an annual multi-million selling franchise was its multiplayer mode. Killstreaks, abundant items, and a tense, exciting, fast-paced experience. This directly laid the core foundation for the entire COD series' multiplayer gameplay. The sole purpose of everything was to give players a satisfying experience.</p>
<p>Excellent single-player storyline, outstanding multiplayer mode. These were Chen Xu's main reasons for choosing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. As for Black Ops, while also excellent, especially with characters like Reznov, who were memorable to countless players, some levels were quite sensitive, and censorship was a serious issue, so Chen Xu temporarily didn't consider it.</p>
<p>Before the project began, Chen Xu also explained some of the settings within Call of Duty: Modern Warfare to everyone. As an FPS game, the most important aspects were the shooting feel and related actions within the game. While the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare series was outstanding in terms of plot, level design, and pacing, from a current perspective, there were still many details that needed improvement. For example, a richer action system. Chen Xu referenced the rebooted Modern Warfare from his previous life; although IW's demonization of Russians in the plot was a bit extreme, the foundation of the rebooted Modern Warfare itself was quite excellent. “We've actually applied some cinematic storytelling in It Takes Two.” “But in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's single-player storyline, we need to go even deeper.” Looking at everyone, Chen Xu also briefly outlined some important points for the game. One difference from other FPS games was in the plot. Modern Warfare uses multi-threaded narration. Players don't play as a fixed protagonist or a fixed faction. Instead, the story of the entire Modern Warfare is presented from multiple perspectives. Furthermore, the game deeply portrays teammates beyond the player-controlled protagonist. In-game teammates are genuinely helpful to players, not the kind of useless teammates who just shout '6666' and then drag you down. Interaction and the sense of reliability amidst a hail of bullets and explosions make players feel that their teammates are flesh and blood. Especially in his previous life, many players didn't even clear high-difficulty modes on their own. They relied on NPC teammates to get through. In the area of NPC teammates, this was precisely one of Nebula Games' strengths. Nebula Games couldn't claim to be world-class in other technologies. But in AI performance, they were in a league of their own. And compared to previous AI performance, Zhong Yue and his team had made new progress during this period. Of course, the R&amp;D cost was also significant. As for the plot of the entire Modern Warfare series, Chen Xu planned to develop all three parts of the trilogy together. The Modern Warfare plot in his previous life was quite outstanding. Unexpected suspense and twists, with an overall atmosphere leaning towards darkness and despair. The entire Modern Warfare story was not a hymn to heroes, but a brutal tale of military power interests and sacrifice. However, in terms of plot, if any single part of the trilogy was taken alone, its main story progression wasn't long, not even exceeding 10 hours. Such a length was simply too short for a major title. But considering the trilogy's timeline and the switching of various characters, forcibly merging them might even lead to a sense of fragmentation. So, Chen Xu ultimately decided to make three separate games, but these three parts would be released as a bundle. Players could choose to buy any single part or purchase all three directly as a bundle. As for multiplayer mode, players who purchased any single part could play online.</p>
