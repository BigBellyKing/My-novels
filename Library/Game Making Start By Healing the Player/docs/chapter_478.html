<p>Chapter 477: Little Sister! Time for Your Shot! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Zhang Yi controlled Ethan in the game, striding forward.</p>
<p>The first time he came to this scene, it was through Huanyu VR.</p>
<p>Back then, he was trembling, taking one step and looking back with every other. While others could clear this game segment in less than 20 minutes, he dragged his feet for almost an hour, unable to finish. Eventually, his curiosity about the game led him to call his wife to play the PC version together, and even then, he was quite frightened at first.</p>
<p>But now, his heart was completely devoid of fear, just like Ethan in the game, who grew from a small programmer into a Hand Sanitizer Warrior.</p>
<p>Outside the game, he too had undergone a transformation.</p>
<p>Leaving the basement and arriving at the second-floor attic was the same corridor where he had 'broken up' with Mia.</p>
<p>The illusions reappeared, scene by scene: Mia frantically stabbing him with a knife, while Evelyn screamed from behind.</p>
<p>'Kill him, Mama!'</p>
<p>Without an ounce of fear, he casually circled a couple of times, then calmly washed his hands to replenish his health.</p>
<p>Mia's knife turned into a screwdriver, and the illusion of her pinning him to the wall reappeared.</p>
<p>'Since you don't want to be my Daddy, then you can just die!'</p>
<p>Mia approached, holding a chainsaw, and Evelyn's voice grew increasingly sharp.</p>
<p>'Now it's Mama's turn to kill you!'</p>
<p>Evelyn's rampant laughter echoed in his ears.</p>
<p>Everything before his eyes was an illusion created by Evelyn, which indirectly confirmed the players'猜测: Ethan, too, could no longer be considered a normal person; like Mia, he had also been infected.</p>
<p>This time, Ethan chose not to harm Mia. Instead, he wound his way around and found Evelyn.</p>
<p>Seeing Ethan, who had found her, the little girl-shaped Evelyn laughed aloud.</p>
<p>'You'll be one of us eventually! Then maybe you'll behave a little!'</p>
<p>Facing the arrogant Evelyn, he just looked at her coldly.</p>
<p>'You wish!'</p>
<p>Then Ethan pulled a syringe from his pocket. Inside the syringe was the agent, [E-Necrotoxin], capable of suppressing Evelyn's abilities.</p>
<p>'No! Don't bring that thing near me!'</p>
<p>Evelyn looked at the syringe in Ethan's hand with immense fear, instantly darting to the second floor.</p>
<p>At the same time, Mia, wielding a chainsaw, lunged at Ethan again.</p>
<p>Ignoring Mia, he took a hit from the chainsaw, turned, and ran towards the attic.</p>
<p>Mid-way, he didn't forget to wash his hands to recover some health.</p>
<p>On the second floor, Evelyn used her powerful psychic control to prevent Ethan from approaching her.</p>
<p>'Get away!'</p>
<p>'No! No!'</p>
<p>'Stay away from me!'</p>
<p>Evelyn screamed repeatedly, her powerful psychic energy constantly driving Ethan back.</p>
<p>However, how could Ethan retreat now, facing Evelyn?</p>
<p>He got up from the ground again and again, grabbing the nearby walls, Ethan arduously dragged his feet forward.</p>
<p>Finally!</p>
<p>In the lull of her last scream, Ethan reached Evelyn.</p>
<p>Ethan in the game grabbed Evelyn's head, forcefully plunged the syringe into her neck, and injected all the medicine inside.</p>
<p>“Little sister! Time for your shot!”</p>
<p>Ethan in the game had no dialogue at this moment, but Zhang Yi shouted, extremely excited.</p>
<p>As the green medicine was injected into Evelyn's body.</p>
<p>The surrounding environment flickered twice, then blurred, and finally shattered.</p>
<p>Before Ethan was a white-haired old woman in a wheelchair; this was Evelyn after her body had aged.</p>
<p>Evelyn, sitting in the wheelchair, slowly raised her head to look at Ethan, black liquid streaming from her eyes as if she were crying.</p>
<p>'Why… why… why don't you all like me?'</p>
<p>'It hurts… it hurts… it really hurts!'</p>
<p>Evelyn's wailing echoed in his ears. Combined with the information he had collected about Evelyn earlier, Zhang Yi was filled with anger at this moment.</p>
<p>Of course, this anger was directed more towards the 'Alliance' company, which had never made an appearance but was mentioned in the files.</p>
<p>If one were to speak of innocence, Evelyn, as a bioweapon, was indeed innocent, but it was undeniable that she had harmed countless people.</p>
<p>Including the controlled Baker family, everyone's hands were stained with much blood, regardless.</p>
<p>But the biggest mastermind was not Evelyn, but that Alliance.</p>
<p>Especially from some of Lucas's remaining information, it could be deduced that the Alliance had long known everything here, but had done nothing to observe the effects of the bioweapon.</p>
<p>Amidst Evelyn's wails, she and her wheelchair eventually melted into a black, viscous, tar-like liquid.</p>
<p>Then, the molten liquid rapidly began to spread and split.</p>
<p>Soon, a huge fungal patch formed under Ethan's feet, and on the original warehouse walls, the fungal liquid began to coalesce, finally forming a grotesque, giant human face.</p>
<p>Evidently, the now uncontrolled Evelyn had transformed into a monster.</p>
<p>Just like Jack Baker before, when Ethan had 'greeted' his father-in-law with a chainsaw, and later, as he, Zoe, and Mia prepared to escape by boat, Jack Baker mutated into a monstrous entity, forcing Ethan to use a serum to repel him and then choose between Mia and Zoe.</p>
<p>Evelyn was now the same, and even more terrifying.</p>
<p>Without time to think, Zhang Yi looked at the starting BOSS battle and decisively switched weapons.</p>
<p>He used whatever weapon dealt the most damage.</p>
<p>He attacked continuously, but it seemed to cause no damage to Evelyn at all.</p>
<p>He kept shooting and dodging, but eventually, he made a mistake. In that moment of distraction, Ethan was sent flying far away by the mutated Evelyn.</p>
<p>The old mansion itself couldn't withstand the immense power and began to crumble.</p>
<p>The monster before him frantically destroyed its surroundings, clearly having completely lost its sanity.</p>
<p>However, thanks to this, the monster didn't immediately attack Ethan, giving him a moment to catch his breath.</p>
<p>But just as that thought arose, the mutated Evelyn's sharp tentacles directly pierced Ethan's calf.</p>
<p>Although it wasn't the VR version, Zhang Yi felt that sense of shock through the screen.</p>
<p>But more than that, it was a feeling of despair. How could such a monster be killed?</p>
<p>Just then, the sound of helicopter blades reached his ears. In the distance, two attack helicopters flew towards Ethan. He could vaguely see a blue, umbrella-like symbol on the helicopters.</p>
<p>Immediately after, a box was dropped from one of the attack helicopters. Inside the box was a massive handgun, like a hand cannon.</p>
<p>“Use this!”</p>
<p>A steady voice came from the smartwatch.</p>
<p>Controlling Ethan, he struggled to climb towards the handgun. Grabbing the hand cannon-like weapon from the ground, Zhang Yi aimed at Evelyn and fired directly.</p>
<p>The specialized bullets hit the mutated Evelyn, causing black liquid to spurt out.</p>
<p>Unlike before, when she showed no reaction to regular bullets, Evelyn now let out a painful wail.</p>
<p>Accompanied by the painful wail, Evelyn threw Ethan away. She was then about to swing her mutated, tentacle-like limb at Ethan, but at this critical moment.</p>
<p>The mutated Evelyn visibly began to calcify, then collapsed into a pile of fragments.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Zhang Yi, like Ethan in the game, let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Finally… it's over!</p>
<p>Then, the helicopter in the sky gradually descended. A soldier took off his helmet and extended his hand to Ethan.</p>
<p>“I’m Redfield, glad we found you.”</p>
