                <p>Chapter 333: Task Force 141 (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Zhang Yi stared blankly at the game screen, still reeling.</p>
<p>The emotional impact the game had on him was simply too strong.</p>
<p>His comrades, who had fought alongside him all this way, were just gone.</p>
<p>Actually, some comrades had already sacrificed themselves earlier in the American campaign.</p>
<p>During the battle to encircle Al-Asad, West was hit and killed while operating a Stinger missile.</p>
<p>But compared to Gaz and Griggs, that scene wasn't as shocking as this one.</p>
<p>Gaz had been with him since the very first cargo ship mission. And during several missions in between, it was Brother Gaz who risked his life to save him. Finally, when facing the exploding oil tanker, it was the tough guy Griggs who pulled him out of danger, only to die directly in front of him.</p>
<p>He especially remembered that before their last action mission, Gaz had even made plans with Griggs and the others to go drink dark beer together, with Gaz generously offering to pay for all the drinks in London.</p>
<p>But now?</p>
<p>After all was said and done, only Captain Price and Soap were left from the entire SAS squad!</p>
<p>What the heck was this!</p>
<p>What kind of plot was this!</p>
<p>In an instant, Dark Souls came to Zhang Yi's mind: Siegward of Catarina, who bravely faced death after fulfilling his promise to an old friend; Patches, who left and never returned; the Crestfallen Warrior, who died in the New Londo Ruins; and the White Spider Maiden...</p>
<p>It was all so full of despair, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was no different; you never knew who would die next.</p>
<p>In the end, only Captain Price and Soap survived the entire ordeal.</p>
<p>Looking at the final screen, Zhang Yi couldn't help but sigh with emotion.</p>
<p>But the next moment, he froze.</p>
<p>Because at the very end of the game, there was even an easter egg level.</p>
<p>Just like the news broadcast when Soap and Captain Price were airlifted to safety in the attack helicopters, this news broadcast narration introduced players to what happened later.</p>
<p>After Zakhaev's death, the extremist organizations in the Russian Federation were not eliminated; instead, they became even more rampant.</p>
<p>Various power struggles ensued, and Zakhaev was even hailed as a hero by some factions. People not only erected a memorial statue for him but also named a new airport after him.</p>
<p>The emergence of various extremist terrorist organizations led to an increasingly grim international situation.</p>
<p>SAS, the Marine Corps, and other multinational military departments jointly established a new unit.</p>
<p>Task Force 141.</p>
<p>Captain Price was appointed as the leader, and Soap was no longer a rookie. He became a co-captain of Task Force 141, and his military rank was promoted to Captain.</p>
<p>As the narration ended, the game screen before Zhang Yi went dark.</p>
<p>“<em>Report the details of this operation.</em>” A man lighting a cigar appeared and asked. His military uniform style and rank revealed his status: a three-star Lieutenant General in the U.S. Army.</p>
<p>The character's name appeared next to him: Shepherd.</p>
<p>“<em>Who is Kingfish?</em>” Soap asked an irrelevant question.</p>
<p>“<em>You'll be told later. First, tell me the details of this operation, from the beginning.</em>” Shepherd took a light puff from his cigar and exhaled smoke.</p>
<p>The screen went dark.</p>
<p>[Operation Kingfish]</p>
<p>[October 8, 2013]</p>
<p>[Ukraine - Krkonoše Mountains]</p>
<p>[Captain Soap MacTavish]</p>
<p>“<em>Task Force 141, entering the waiting area!</em>” Captain Price led Soap and others through the jungle.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Yi noticed a few new faces in the team.</p>
<p>[Ghost - Simon Riley]</p>
<p>[Roach - Gary Sanderson]</p>
<p>Especially the team member named Ghost, who wore a mask and looked very terrifying.</p>
<p>“<em>We've spotted four patrol guards on the roofs of the barracks on the east and west sides.</em>”</p>
<p>The next moment, the screen switched to a hilltop, where a person in camouflage was aiming a sniper rifle, and another was observing with binoculars.</p>
<p>[Sandman]</p>
<p>[Frost]</p>
<p>The two code names appeared.</p>
<p>Following a brief exchange, the sniper used an M82 to shoot and kill the four patrol guards. Then, with artillery support from ‘Phantom 6-4’ and an ‘AC-130’ in the sky, Soap, Captain Price, and others stealthily approached the camp. They took the opportunity to eliminate some stubborn resistance and stormed into the building containing the intelligence.</p>
<p>This operation fully demonstrated the combination of modern warfare, modern weapons, and ground troops.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi controlled Soap, Captain Price, and two other members codenamed Roach and Ghost, as they attacked together.</p>
<p>“So these are the new teammates of Task Force 141?” Although Zhang Yi was still immersed in the sad atmosphere of his fallen comrades, he was also curious about the subsequent plot.</p>
<p>In this level, there were no difficulty options; everything seemed to be pre-set.</p>
<p>And it wasn't particularly difficult. At least, compared to the previous infiltration mission where he controlled Captain Price and Captain MacMillan, this Operation Kingfish was relatively easy.</p>
<p>After eliminating most of the armed militants, Soap and the others reached the target building.</p>
<p>After a brief CQB, they pushed into the main room, used a breaching round to blow open the door, and then used a flashbang to eliminate the armed militants inside.</p>
<p>But the four who rushed in were horrified to find the walls covered with various documents about Zakhaev International Airport, as well as a group photo of the original SAS squad.</p>
<p>In the photo, except for Captain Price and Soap, all other members' faces had a red cross drawn over them.</p>
<p>“<em>Bomb! Get out!</em>”</p>
<p>Captain Price, realizing something was wrong, immediately shouted.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, controlling Soap, had just left the room when a huge explosion sounded, and the building behind them collapsed.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this operation was a trap from the start!</p>
<p>The operation was terminated, and then came the familiar escape sequence. Six team members broke through to an evacuation point in an open field.</p>
<p>Phantom 6-4 was ordered to shell the pursuers but was shot down by an infrared-guided missile.</p>
<p>But just as they reached the escape point, like Captain MacMillan before, Soap was directly wounded in the leg by a rocket-propelled grenade.</p>
<p>However, with the open plain and endless enemies, the situation was much more difficult than before. Seeing this, Captain Price immediately told Roach and Ghost to take Soap onto the plane, while he chose to stay behind and cover their retreat.</p>
<p>“<em>You need to evacuate immediately!</em>”</p>
<p>The order came as they boarded the rescue plane.</p>
<p>“<em>No! Stop, we have a brother still behind!</em>” Roach stepped forward and shouted at the pilot.</p>
<p>“<em>Our orders are to take off immediately.</em>” The pilot said while starting the engine.</p>
<p>“<em>We cannot abandon any comrade!</em>” Ghost's muffled voice stated firmly.</p>
<p>The people on the plane fell into a brief disagreement.</p>
<p>But in the end, Captain Price, still outside the plane, gave his last command.</p>
<p>“<em>Take off immediately, evacuate!</em>”</p>
<p>The moment his words fell, Captain Price was hit by a bullet on the grass and fell.</p>
<p>Innumerable enemy soldiers swarmed him.</p>
<p>At this point, the camera returned to the armory.</p>
<p>Shepherd put down his cigar: “<em>Is that all?</em>”</p>
<p>“<em>Who is Kingfish!?</em>” Soap clenched his fists and slammed the table.</p>
<p>“<em>He is Kingfish, the target you were supposed to capture and kill in this operation.</em>”</p>
<p>Facing Soap's questioning, Shepherd took a file from beside him and pushed it in front of Soap.</p>
<p>It showed a photo and the person's name – Makarov.</p>
<p>And at this moment, Zhang Yi was completely bewildered.</p>
<p>What was going on?!</p>
<p>Captain Price was gone?!</p>
<p>(End of Chapter)
