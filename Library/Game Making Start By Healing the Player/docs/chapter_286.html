                <p>Chapter 285: Keyboard Spewing Milk Card (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>In Nebula Games' break area, Chen Xu, who had just walked out of his office, heard a group of people gathered around the large screen, discussing animatedly.</p>
<p>"They're all so amazing! This player named Guadi hasn't lost a single match yet! These Orcs are too strong!"</p>
<p>"This seems to be an overseas player, with a Ranked score as high as 2710, currently ranking first."</p>
<p>"This player named Ma Tongge is also really strong! He's only ever lost to Guadi. His hand speed is simply exaggerated!"</p>
<p>"Yeah! His triple-line operations are a bit excessive. While harassing with the Blademaster, he can still do other things at the same time."</p>
<p>Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, Lin Tao, and others were all watching the big screen in the break area.</p>
<p>It was displaying the Golden Monthly Tournament being held on Shark TV, which was currently in its third week, with the final day of the group stage underway.</p>
<p>Chen Xu, who happened to walk into the break area and overheard their conversation, couldn't help but show a speechless expression: "Isn't this just normal operation for high-level players? You guys should be paying attention to the tactics they're using in the game."</p>
<p>Chen Xu didn't know what to say to these four people whose combined Ranked scores were less than 2000.</p>
<p>After all, a new account's default Ranked score was 500 points.</p>
<p>Triple-line operations are indeed quite difficult.</p>
<p>But if one wants to play professionally, dual-line operations are a basic skill. If you can't even master that, then don't bother with a professional career.</p>
<p>"Ahem… Mr. Chen, where there are masters, there are noobs; where some gain points, others lose them. So why can't I be the one losing points?" Qin Yi, sitting there, coughed twice and said, in response to Chen Xu.</p>
<p>"You're full of sophistry," Chen Xu replied, exasperated. They've given up.</p>
<p>"But Mr. Chen, regarding racial balance, are the Orcs perhaps too strong? I see many players already have opinions!"</p>
<p>"That's right! Players are protesting all over the community forums, many people feel that Orcs are too powerful."</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah, Mr. Chen, everyone online is saying that Orcs are too strong, and Night Elves and Undead are too weak. Should we strengthen them, or weaken Orcs and Humans?" several people chattered.</p>
<p>"What's going on?" Chen Xu paused for a moment; he hadn't really paid much attention to this area.</p>
<p>Regarding Warcraft, Chen Xu knew that perfect balance was an impossible feat.</p>
<p>For example, FPS games always have so-called 'cop maps' and 'terrorist maps', and in his previous life, MOBA games always had overpowered heroes and 'sewer' heroes (underperforming ones).</p>
<p>RPG games, in particular, could never achieve so-called balance, hence the saying, "one version, one god."</p>
<p>Yet, Chen Xu had tried his best to balance the stats of different races in Warcraft.</p>
<p>At least at this stage, Chen Xu felt that Warcraft wouldn't need significant adjustments for a long time, at most some minor numerical corrections.</p>
<p>And in his previous life.</p>
<p>Night Elves, Orcs, Humans, and Undead – players of different races had all won championships in major tournaments.</p>
<p>In the early days, Orc King Grubby popularized the widely considered weak Orcs with his masterful triple-line operations.</p>
<p>There was Sky, the inaugural Human 'Tower-Holding Heavenly King', who deciphered and invented countless tactics; Moon, the 'Moon Demon' who played Night Elves to perfection and was called the 'Fifth Race'; and later TED, the 'Ghost King' who won the first Undead championship.</p>
<p>Even in the later stages of Warcraft, after Sky, infi took defense towers to the extreme, even surpassing him, earning the title 'Human and Tower United', along with 120, the new generation's Ghost King.</p>
<p>Chen Xu dared not claim absolute balance, because no game designer could ever say their game was truly absolutely balanced, even in his previous life.</p>
<p>But in Chen Xu's view, Warcraft had clearly achieved relative balance.</p>
<p>Now, players were questioning its balance?</p>
<p>Chen Xu opened his official Weibo account and the game's community forum.</p>
<p>At this moment, the game forum and his official Weibo were flooded with messages from many players.</p>
<p>"Orcs are too strong!"</p>
<p>"Undead, Night Elves, and Humans are crying in the bathroom. Half of the players in the Golden Monthly Tournament are Orcs!"</p>
<p>"Actually, I had this feeling when playing Ranked matches. Orcs are too fierce in the early game; those Grunts are incredibly tanky. One Grunt can take on two of mine!"</p>
<p>"That's right, that's right, Orcs really need to be nerfed!"</p>
<p>"Chen Xu, say something!"</p>
<p>"Let's just call it Orc Supremacy!"</p>
<p>Watching the various messages online, Chen Xu frowned slightly.</p>
<p>Orcs too strong?</p>
<p>It's worth noting that Orcs might seem like a simple race, but in reality, they are not suitable for beginners. For example, the Tier 2 units of Orcs – Grunts, Wolf Riders, Spirit Walkers, and Kodo Beasts – all require micro-management; otherwise, they often block each other.</p>
<p>Looking at some of the online information, Chen Xu largely understood the situation.</p>
<p>The main reason was still the current players' lack of understanding of Warcraft.</p>
<p>For beginners, Orcs are tough and durable. Forget about complex operations; everyone just builds units, selects them all, and A-moves them across the map.</p>
<p>In such situations, facing the early-game Orcs' starting Tauren Chieftain's Aura and mass Grunts, many beginners find it difficult to cope.</p>
<p>For some skilled players who understand the basic gameplay, the Orc playstyle and mechanics are relatively straightforward compared to other races, which also fits the Orcs' positioning.</p>
<p>This led to other racial players not yet developing corresponding tactics.</p>
<p>Additionally, there were some other special elements. For example, Chen Xu watched relevant match replays, and the player named Guadi had truly strong micro. Although Chen Xu felt his tactical understanding wasn't great (which is a matter of experience), he simply overpowered his opponents through sheer execution.</p>
<p>In this situation, with the top-ranked player being Orc, naturally, many players aiming to climb the ranks assumed Orcs might be stronger. More and more people played Orcs, which indirectly accelerated the evolution of Orc tactics.</p>
<p>This naturally created a crushing advantage over other races, leading to this seemingly unbalanced situation.</p>
<p>Of course, there were other factors, such as the fueling of internet trolls; otherwise, this imbalance wouldn't have been exposed in this way.</p>
<p>However, this actually made Chen Xu breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>"No need to change the stats. The game's balance is fine; it's just something I overlooked a little," Chen Xu said, shaking his head at everyone.</p>
<p>"Control the current public opinion, don't let the enemy continue to cause trouble. Also, later, have Lin Rou contact Shark TV. We'll clarify it just like we did with The Last of Us," Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>???????</p>
<p>Just like with Monster Hunter?</p>
<p>Upon hearing Chen Xu's words, everyone was stunned.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen... Mr. Chen, how do you plan to prove it?" Qin Yi, who had a slight guess, asked tentatively.</p>
<p>"How else to prove it? As game designers, we prove it with data, ordinary players wouldn't understand it."</p>
<p>"At that time, I'll play each race myself, and then players will have an intuitive understanding, won't they?" Chen Xu stated as a matter of course.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, everyone was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>That logic was sound, but what if he lost?</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, do you mean we should hire actors? That wouldn't be good, would it?" Ruan Ningxue thought of something and said awkwardly.</p>
<p>"Where did you get that idea? I mean to discuss with Shark TV and see if we can arrange an exhibition match for me to play against those professional players. Besides, so what if I lose? I'm a game designer, not a professional player." Chen Xu looked at everyone's expressions, feeling a bit speechless.</p>
<p>Looking at their faces, Chen Xu didn't explain further, just smiled and turned to leave.</p>
<p>His goal wasn't actually to beat professional players; it was mainly to have a channel to prove that the current professional players and top-ranked players essentially represented the pinnacle of Warcraft's skill.</p>
<p>Using them to demonstrate that there was no problem with Warcraft's balance was the most effective and direct method.</p>
<p>Moreover, he had watched these professional players' operations. Some of them indeed had incredibly abnormal micro, but in terms of understanding game tactics, these players were clearly inferior to him at this stage, after all, the various tactics and playstyles of Warcraft in his previous life had evolved over more than a decade.</p>
<p>Adding to that, Chen Xu's own abilities were genuinely not bad. In this situation, apart from talents like Guadi, Chen Xu felt that some ordinary Warcraft masters, trying to beat him purely through micro, might not necessarily succeed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he had a special item.</p>
<p>It was perfect for this occasion.</p>
<p>'Keyboard Spewing Milk Card (Self-Participation Only): After use, your in-game actions will become incredibly outlandish, accompanied by the commentator's predictions, bringing a significant amount of positive attention to the game. (Sometimes, spewing milk from your keyboard isn't a bad thing.)'</p>
<p>Watching the item in his inventory, Chen Xu smiled slightly.</p>
