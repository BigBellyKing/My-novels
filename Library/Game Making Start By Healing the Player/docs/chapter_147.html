                <p>Chapter 146: Gaming Experience (Second update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)</p>
<p>As time progressed day by day, many players who followed <em>It Takes Two</em> began to anticipate its release.</p>
<p>During this period, Nebula Games also conducted some pre-launch promotional warm-up for <em>It Takes Two</em>.</p>
<p>After all, in terms of scale, this was currently Nebula Games' second largest game, second only to Dark Souls.</p>
<p>Although currently, neither players nor industry insiders and media following the game believed this at all.</p>
<p>But the necessary promotional campaign still had to be conducted.</p>
<p>Moreover, the promotional costs for <em>It Takes Two</em> were significantly lower than last year's <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>This was mainly because there hadn't been many excellent games in the gaming industry recently, leaving players in a game drought. Any seemingly good game could garner significant attention.</p>
<p>Furthermore, game media outlets, lacking major news, were also reporting extensively on any games that looked decent.</p>
<p>Before the New Year, Chen Xu had practically swept the Game of the Year award ceremony, so his new work naturally became a focal point.</p>
<p>All these factors combined directly led to <em>It Takes Two</em>, despite being a game with high technical requirements, receiving considerable attention.</p>
<p>This was truly a matter of favorable timing and geographical advantage.</p>
<p>As for human factors, that naturally referred to Nebula Games' loyal fan players.</p>
<p>Unlike ordinary players who were skeptical about the quality of <em>It Takes Two</em>.</p>
<p>For fans of Nebula Games and Chen Xu, there was only one word: Buy!</p>
<p>In a certain community in the Imperial Capital, Wang Han was already prepared.</p>
<p>Both computers were logged into the Nebula Games Platform, just waiting for the game to unlock for purchase.</p>
<p>As for Zhang Yi, observing his girlfriend's expectant look, his expression was very subtle.</p>
<p>He recalled the unequal treaty signed a year ago.</p>
<p>Because of a game called <em>Overcooked</em>, he had been washing dishes for a year.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he still had absolutely no resistance to games produced by Nebula Games.</p>
<p>Whether it was <em>Mirror (Game)</em>, known only to Nebula Games' two-year veteran fans, or last year's incredibly shocking <em>Dark Souls</em>, he loved them all.</p>
<p>To be honest, he was quite looking forward to <em>It Takes Two</em>, which was about to unlock.</p>
<p>Because from the promotional video, the playable content seemed very rich.</p>
<p>"It's unlocked, it's unlocked! This game is huge! It's almost as big as <em>Dark Souls</em>!" Wang Han immediately purchased the game the moment it unlocked, looking surprised at the download interface that popped up.</p>
<p>Although games aren't necessarily better the larger their size, and this also related to compression technology.</p>
<p>However, since both <em>It Takes Two</em> and <em>Dark Souls</em> were produced by Nebula Games, there was naturally no so-called compression technology issue.</p>
<p>This left only one answer.</p>
<p>That <em>It Takes Two</em>'s scale was definitely no smaller than <em>Dark Souls'</em></p>
<p>This instantly filled Wang Han with anticipation.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, on the other hand, sobered up after a brief moment of anticipation. Looking at the screen in front of him, he silently repeated a phrase in his mind.</p>
<p>'Impulse is the devil!'</p>
<p>He absolutely couldn't act on impulse; he definitely couldn't get carried away when playing this game later.</p>
<p>Otherwise, let alone the dishes, he'd have to wash the clothes from now on!</p>
<p>Although from all current information, <em>It Takes Two</em> appeared to be a completely different genre from last year's <em>Overcooked</em>.</p>
<p>But Mr. Chen was renowned, and the official Weibo account had made such mysterious claims, plus <em>It Takes Two</em> itself was a game requiring two-player cooperation.</p>
<p>Whenever he thought of this, Zhang Yi's mind would recall how utterly he got carried away playing <em>Overcooked</em> back then.</p>
<p>And how loudly he had promised to be a good dishwashing man.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi silently repeated the slogan three more times. Just then, Wang Han next to him prompted, "Hurry, the game has downloaded, quickly enter the game, I'll invite you directly."</p>
<p>"Okay, I'm coming," Zhang Yi nodded, then entered the game.</p>
<p>After a brief Nebula Games Logo appeared, the game screen loaded.</p>
<p>The scene was set in a yard resembling a farm.</p>
<p>Cody, who had come out to throw out the trash, conversed with May, who was driving and holding a briefcase.</p>
<p>The couple's relationship had broken down; they were about to get divorced.</p>
<p>Even over trivial daily matters, they complained and argued with each other, each feeling that the other couldn't understand them or comprehend the immense inner pressure they were under.</p>
<p>The two continued to argue in the yard.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rose, their daughter, watched the two below from the windowsill with a sorrowful expression, holding two dolls and expressing her wish. Clearly, she hoped her parents would stop arguing.</p>
<p>At this moment, the screen froze.</p>
<p>Looking at the frozen screen, Rose held two dolls, one male and one female.</p>
<p>Cody was a clay doll, and May was a wooden doll.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi and Wang Han, having seen the promotional video, were not unfamiliar with them.</p>
<p>On this frozen interface, the UI selection that appeared was clearly for them to choose their respective characters.</p>
<p>"Are there any differences between these two characters?" Wang Han asked with some curiosity.</p>
<p>"Of course there are differences!" Zhang Yi chimed in.</p>
<p>"What differences?" Wang Han asked.</p>
<p>"Didn't you notice? One's a male and one's a female, one's clay and one's wood," Zhang Yi said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Wang Han looked at Zhang Yi with a speechless expression.</p>
<p>How could she not know that?</p>
<p>Seeing Wang Han's expression, Zhang Yi stopped messing around and shared his conjecture: "Didn't Chen Xu's official Weibo and the promotional video show demonstrations? The two characters have special abilities in the game and need to cooperate with each other. It feels like the male and female characters' special abilities are different."</p>
<p>"Ah, I see!" Wang Han suddenly realized.</p>
<p>However, since they didn't know what special abilities the two characters had, they each chose based on gender.</p>
<p>Wang Han chose May, and Zhang Yi chose Cody.</p>
<p>After confirming their character selections, the game screen went black for a moment.</p>
<p>After about one or two seconds, the visuals and audio reappeared.</p>
<p>But instead of immediately entering the game, a cutscene began to play.</p>
<p>At the dining table in the living room, facing their daughter Rose.</p>
<p>Cody and May finally told Rose that they were getting divorced.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Rose appeared unfazed on the surface, simply taking her little elephant toy back to her room.</p>
<p>But the next moment, she took the dolls representing her dad and mom, climbed out the window, and went to the utility room.</p>
<p>Under the table in the utility room was a red book titled 'Book of Love'.</p>
<p>'Dr. Hakim, you absolutely have to help me... they need to be together.'</p>
<p>'Look, it says here: [Love requires effort], see?'</p>
<p>'You both have to put in the effort, you can't just give up like this.'</p>
<p>'Mom, Dad, I hope you can become friends again.'</p>
<p>Looking at the dolls representing May and Cody in her hands, Rose's tears fell.</p>
<p>After a brief darkness, the scene cut back to the two doll-like figures.</p>
<p>Cody and May awoke from their sleep in horror, discovering they had turned into a wooden doll and a clay figure.</p>
<p>At this point, the personified Book of Love, Dr. Hakim, appeared and briefly explained the general situation.</p>
<p>However, while seemingly introducing the current predicament to May and Cody, it was clearly meant to introduce the game's situation to the players sitting in front of their monitors.</p>
<p>"It feels just like watching an animated movie!" Wang Han exclaimed in admiration.</p>
<p>"Yeah, and the surrounding scenes in this game are so exquisite," Zhang Yi nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Having entered the game, he looked at the surrounding environment with great surprise.</p>
<p>If judged solely on visual representation, <em>It Takes Two</em> certainly couldn't be considered top-tier.</p>
<p>However, unlike realistic games, <em>It Takes Two</em> adopted a cartoon art style.</p>
<p>Coupled with relatively refined modeling, it made the surrounding scenes quite dreamlike.</p>
<p>Especially since players controlled clay and wooden puppet characters, this feeling of having shrunk actually created a unique visual experience.</p>
<p>Wooden floors, table legs, and cardboard boxes.</p>
<p>All now appeared enormous. This contrast and novelty brought about by the change in scene scale made playing <em>It Takes Two</em> incredibly enjoyable for all players.</p>
