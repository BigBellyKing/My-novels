                <p>Chapter 234: New Game Plans (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>For twenty-four hours, countless eyes were fixed on the performance of the Nebula Games Platform. After all, everyone wondered whether games from studios other than Nebula Games could achieve good results on its platform.</p>
<p>This was a matter of concern for all industry designers, as well as for major channel providers.</p>
<p>And at noon the next day, Chen Xu publicly released the previously compiled data online.</p>
<p>Excluding games under Nebula Games itself, the best-selling game was a new title called <em>Demon and Deity</em>, developed by a small but well-known independent game studio in China.</p>
<p>It's a side-scrolling action game. The main gameplay involves players acquiring various skills and corresponding buffs as the game progresses. There are two branching paths in the game, and the player's choice of skills, buffs, and story decisions ultimately determines whether they follow the Demon Route or the Deity Route.</p>
<p>This game was priced at 48 Yuan and sold 112,000 copies on its first day, making it the highest-selling game launched on the Nebula Games Platform on its debut.</p>
<p>Coming in second place was a simulation game called <em>The Vagrant</em>, where players take on the role of a vagrant and strive to improve their lives. Because it supports multiplayer online play and is particularly suitable for live streaming, it's a game driven by live broadcasts. Although its player ratings were inferior to <em>Demon and Deity</em>, it still achieved an impressive 71,000 sales on its first day.</p>
<p>Additionally, there were some other older games with good sales, such as a text-based adventure game called <em>Love Dreamland</em>, brought by a small channel that joined the Nebula Games camp.</p>
<p>With its excellent character development and story, it also achieved 31,000 sales on its first day.</p>
<p>The release of this data caused a stir among many game industry developers.</p>
<p>Previously, many game designers hesitated to join the Nebula Games Platform primarily because they worried that while it might seem promising, players on the platform would still only buy Nebula Games' own titles.</p>
<p>But now, all the data clearly indicated that the soil of the Nebula Games Platform was perfectly healthy.</p>
<p>Admittedly, some games performed poorly, but that was due to their quality.</p>
<p>Even if these games were released through TengHua and NetDragon, they would mostly perform the same unless heavily promoted.</p>
<p>The designers who had been wavering were now all excited, scrambling to release their games on the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>They wanted to seize the opportunity presented by the initially smaller number of games to secure better recommendation slots.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the major channel providers were filled with lamentations, yet helpless.</p>
<p>Because at this time, Nebula Games had an incredibly strong foundation.</p>
<p>With <em>Minecraft</em> soaring in popularity, there was no way to undermine them.</p>
<p>Of course, there was an even more important reason: the Game Department itself had reposted Chen Xu's official Weibo post.</p>
<p>Although there was no public statement, the implications were clear.</p>
<p>And a week later, major game channels also successively announced their content changes.</p>
<p>They changed from the original 50-50 split, or even channel 70% and developer 30%, to developer 70% and channel 30%.</p>
<p>Even so, many game developers still chose to leave.</p>
<p>Clearly, with the emergence of the Nebula Games Platform, the era where 'channels were king' no longer existed.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Online, the storm continued to brew. Both players and industry designers were still discussing the Nebula Games Platform and the channel turmoil.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu had been quite relaxed during this period.</p>
<p>Within Nebula Games, there would be a subsequent hiring plan. After all, with Nebula Games transitioning into an open platform, the cost of maintaining the in-game community had significantly increased.</p>
<p>While most customer service for refunds, community maintenance, and Workshop reviews could be outsourced, Nebula Games itself still needed to conduct the final review.</p>
<p>Pondering these matters, Chen Xu took a glass of Coke and went to the lounge area.</p>
<p>Upon Chen Xu's arrival, Ruan Ningxue and the others in the lounge, uncharacteristically not building dark rooms in <em>Minecraft</em>, were gathered together chatting. Seeing Chen Xu, Ruan Ningxue excitedly said, "Mr. Chen! Other designers in the gaming industry are now calling us Dragon Slayers!"</p>
<p>The rest of the employees echoed her sentiments.</p>
<p>Clearly, the immense impact of the Nebula Games Platform on the entire gaming industry made it difficult for them to suppress their excitement.</p>
<p>“Alright, everyone quiet down. 'Dragon Slayers' is just a title; listen to it, but don't take it too seriously. Perhaps we have indeed changed some of the existing conditions in the gaming world, but you must remember one thing: for us, creating more interesting games is the most important thing. Building a platform is only to ensure we don't have to concern ourselves with the channels' demands,” Chen Xu said, his expression a little more serious as he looked at everyone.</p>
<p>In reality, his words were half-true.</p>
<p>Chen Xu disliked the domestic channel platforms, but he didn't intend to completely dismantle them.</p>
<p>Because, to some extent, channels were still very necessary; they provided a platform for designers who lacked promotional capabilities.</p>
<p>However, the original 50-50 split, or even the platform 70% and developer 30% revenue share, was clearly abnormal.</p>
<p>But did platforms not need to make money?</p>
<p>The answer was, of course, no.</p>
<p>So Chen Xu had no intention of doing charity work.</p>
<p>The 25% commission rate was something Chen Xu had thoroughly discussed with his internal team.</p>
<p>Under this revenue share, Nebula Games still made a profit.</p>
<p>And as game sales increased, the profits would only grow.</p>
<p>Chen Xu's objective, from beginning to end, was not to eliminate all channels, but rather to provide a better choice for more game designers.</p>
<p>He now had resources, capability, and his own needs, so he stepped forward.</p>
<p>It was that simple.</p>
<p>“Alright, everyone, don't look so serious. Make games happily, then take your bonuses happily. Don't overthink it,” Chen Xu said with a smile, looking at everyone.</p>
<p>“Also, weren't you all curious about what our next new game would be?”</p>
<p>“Now, I’ll give you a hint: the new game will utilize our latest AI technology,” Chen Xu said with a smile, looking at everyone.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, everyone's eyes widened with curiosity.</p>
<p>“Utilize new technology? When will Mr. Chen's new game be developed?!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah! What genre will it be?”</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and the others were all very curious.</p>
<p>Although Chen Xu had already said so, it wouldn't be long before a meeting for project approval would be held.</p>
<p>After all, before announcing the Nebula Games Platform's transformation, Chen Xu had also hinted that their development plans for the upcoming period would involve large-scale games.</p>
<p>But if he hadn't mentioned it, it would have been fine. Now that he did, it was like being tickled—they couldn't hold back their anticipation!</p>
<p>“Alright then, I'll reveal a bit more: the theme of the new game will be hunting.” Chen Xu said, a meaningful smile on his face, as he turned and left.</p>
