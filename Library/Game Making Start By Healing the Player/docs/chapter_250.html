                <p>Chapter 249: This is a Hack-and-Slash Game! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Looking at the numerous small Jagras corpses on the ground, Zhang Yi meticulously collected materials.</p>
<p>Although it was just a demo, and progress wouldn't be carried over, only the character customization data would. Yet, Zhang Yi still collected all the materials on the ground one by one.</p>
<p>This was a gaming habit of many years. It didn't matter if it was useful, or if it wouldn't be used even when clearing the game or even if the game was shut down. As long as it could be collected, especially the kind that could be collected easily, it had to be stored in his inventory.</p>
<p>Unless the inventory and storage box were full, he wouldn't even think about discarding any material, no matter what kind. Frugality was an excellent virtue every gamer should possess.</p>
<p>"My health bar is so resilient! There's no difficulty at all!"</p>
<p>Looking at more than half of his health bar, Zhang Yi had too many feelings. Ever since he started playing the <em>Dark Souls</em> series, his concept and impression of a health bar had become a bit blurry, to be honest. But now, in <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, he finally rediscovered this familiar health bar.</p>
<p>"It's just a bit unusual not to see the monster's health bar."</p>
<p>In the game, Zhang Yi also noticed. It seemed that to give players a more immersive hunting experience, <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> provided damage numbers, but a monster's health bar was nonexistent. Instead, there was an electrocardiogram-like display.</p>
<p>After completing the mission and returning to Astera Settlement, Zhang Yi wasn't in a hurry to do new quests. Instead, he opened the voice channel and started boasting to his friends.</p>
<p>"Old Song, have you guys finished your mission? This monster doesn't feel like enough of a fight at all!" Zhang Yi said with emotion in the voice channel.</p>
<p>Immediately, Song Ren's voice came through.</p>
<p>"Of course we did! Longsword is a powerful weapon! One Spirit Roundslash cuts down a bunch! But it's true, it's not enough of a fight, it's just not satisfying!" Song Ren also sighed with emotion.</p>
<p>"Exactly, exactly! My hammer is super powerful! Charge up and then a Windmill Attack, these dragons just die while spinning!" Wang Han was also very satisfied with the weapon she chose.</p>
<p>"Dual Blades are awesome! Super fast attack speed! And the Demon Dance in Demon Mode is like chopping vegetables and dicing meat!" Joey added.</p>
<p>"The Bow is also very strong! One charged Dragon Piercer is one dragon! The damage is too high! This hunting game has basically turned into a shooting game for me!" Wang Yifan also chatted in the voice channel.</p>
<p>"<em>Monster Hunter: World</em> really feels like a Musou hack-and-slash game this time! I wonder if there will be difficulty options later. Although it's very satisfying to hack-and-slash now, I have to admit I miss the slightly more challenging and difficult gameplay of <em>Dark Souls</em>." Zhang Yi sighed a little in the voice channel.</p>
<p>Despite getting tormented until he was dizzy when playing <em>Dark Souls</em>, he had to admit that the exhilarating feeling after defeating a powerful enemy was something he had never experienced in any other game until now. And while <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> felt really good to play, it always seemed to lack a little something. It lacked a bit of a challenge, and these dragons were so fragile that fighting them wasn't quite satisfying!</p>
<p>It wasn't just Zhang Yi and his friends; many players online felt the same way. After entering the game and experiencing the charm of the New World, and then engaging in their first battle, players, regardless of the weapon they chose, had only one feeling: utter delight! The gaming experience was pure hack-and-slash!</p>
<p>Fighting monsters was completely stress-free, and it even felt like it ended before they had their fill. Of course, some players chose weapons like the Hunting Horn or Insect Glaive, and while the damage might have been a bit 'touching' (low), it was still very easy.</p>
<p>At the same time, because the Palico mechanic was present in the game, players discovered upon entering the game that these adorable little cats were not just hunters' pets, but true companions who could fight alongside the hunters.</p>
<p>In battle, the Palicos always drew the monster's aggro, and players only needed to endlessly output damage from behind the monster. Besides combat, players could also wander around the jungle, fish by the river, gather materials, search for monsters, and so on.</p>
<p>The overall feeling the game provided was very comfortable. This made many players feel that just exploring for a bit, an hour and a half had already passed since the mission began. On major community forums, players who hadn't even finished the demo content and had just completed the first quest were already posting to share their experiences.</p>
<p>"<em>Monster Hunter: World</em> is so much fun!"</p>
<p>"Yeah! This health bar is too tough, monsters barely scratch me!"</p>
<p>"And the damage is super high! Three hits on a Jagras, is this a hack-and-slash hunting game?"</p>
<p>"I think so! And according to some content released by the game, it's mainly about challenging various dragons, farming materials, and crafting equipment. And grinding games are usually hack-and-slash, right?"</p>
<p>"Haha, that's great! I was originally going to wait and see, but now it feels like I can buy it!"</p>
<p>"This game feels perfect for retirement! It seems quite relaxing."</p>
<p>"Exactly, exactly! I saw in the game you can gather and catch bugs. I wonder if you can fish. Hunting with friends, enjoying the scenery, fishing, and gathering herbs – it's so chill!"</p>
<p>"+1, it feels like a very casual retirement game. Plus, the weapons in the game correspond to classes. If you get tired of one weapon, you just switch to another and craft completely new equipment."</p>
<p>"By the way, what do you all think is the strongest weapon?"</p>
<p>"Definitely the Longsword! Foresight Slash and Helm Breaker are super cool!"</p>
<p>"Great Sword is fierce too! Three-charge slashes instantly kill everything!"</p>
<p>"Tch, the Hammer disagrees! Tornado Destroys Parking Lot!"</p>
<p>"Stop it, Charge Blade is invincible! Sparks flying and flashing all the way!"</p>
<p>"Insect Glaive is not convinced! Aerial spiral 360, one glaive, one Kinsect, red, white, and yellow lights all ablaze, unparalleled in the world!"</p>
<p>"The Hunting Horn just smiles without speaking. Self-buffing BGM, who else has that? Every move has a melody, every blow has power. One sorrowful song, where in the world can I find a true friend!"</p>
<p>Players excitedly shared their experiences on forums and in group chats. This game was clearly much friendlier than most people had imagined. Although the actual operation was certainly not as impressive as their boastful words suggested. More often than not, it was still about Longsword Helm Breaker hitting the ground, Great Sword's three-charge slashes hitting air. Charge Blade Super Amped Element Discharge being mashed randomly, and Dual Blades Demon Mode cringey dancing in place. However, many players completely ignored these shortcomings, as the dragons in this game were truly weak. Missing a hit? What's the big deal? Just stab them a couple more times, and the damage would all come back, wouldn't it? For a time, <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>'s related community forums were filled with an atmosphere of "It's so good!"</p>
<p>Of course, a small handful of players stated that this was only the early game, and they didn't know what would happen later. But these were ultimately a minority, and they were quickly drowned out by the joyful chatter of the general hunters. Many players who had previously been waiting and watching, seeing more and more videos and shared experiences from other players, couldn't help but download the demo. After experiencing the exhilarating thrill of the hunt, they all unhesitatingly chose to pre-order.</p>
