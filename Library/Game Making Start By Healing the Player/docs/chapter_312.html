                <p>“Haha, this FUZE is so satisfying! I declare him my main Operator!”</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was also excited. At first, he thought his Operator was a bit clumsy. He was slow, and his shield seemed a bit super weak compared to the Flash Shield and large shield that other Operators had as skills. But he didn't expect his skill to be so powerful; a series of thump-thump-thumps against the wall directly blew people sky-high. The damage was invincible! The game experience was excellent!</p>
<p>“Gather! Gather! We’re forming a train! Old Zhang, you cover the rear, don’t let them sneak attack our backsides!” At this moment, as a professional counter-terrorism captain, Song Ren immediately issued the command.</p>
<p>The opposing team had clearly rotated back to defend from the Gym, Laundry Room, and Side Warehouse. Because no one really knew how to play at this stage, the walls in the rooms were mostly reinforced or left untouched. No one thought to break down walls that obstructed rotations to allow teammates better support, so after the heartbeat alert, his other teammates had only just arrived.</p>
<p>Da-da-da-da-da-da……</p>
<p>A volley of gunfire, yet against the large shield held at the front, these bullets caused no damage at all. Wang Yifan was a little flustered seeing the glass on the large shield appear shattered.</p>
<p>But as the enemies fired frantically, he relaxed. The large shield only looked like it was about to break, but in reality, it was incredibly sturdy, showing no signs of breaking at all. Moreover, he didn't need to release the shield and counter with his pistol. His teammates behind him occasionally seized opportunities to peek out, using him as a mobile cover to shoot. The only thing that made Wang Yifan a bit uncomfortable was that he had to keep holding the large shield, or it would retract. His arm was getting sore.</p>
<p>“Go, go, go! Form a triangle! Large shield covers the front, Flash Shield covers the side, Old Zhang, you play freely, Joey, you also play freely!” Song Ren laughed heartily, arrived at the bomb site, and deployed the defusal device. All that was left was to wait for time to run out.</p>
<p>All five of them huddled together at the bomb site, leaning against the wall to the left of the large garage. It was a perfect corner, with IQ and Sledge, who had no defensive capabilities, protected in the middle. The large shield faced the Laundry Room and the Central Kitchen stairs, which was the enemy's main firepower output point. The Flash Shield faced the Small Garage, preventing anyone from sneaking over from the Gym. At the same time, FUZE, holding his shield as his primary weapon, faced outwards, worried about someone sneaking in from outside.</p>
<p>Although if a defending player ran outside the defensive area, attacking players would be alerted to their position, the area above the garage was a restaurant, and one could jump down from the window. If a defender subtly moved to the second floor and suddenly jumped down, that surprise attack could truly break their Thomas the Tank Engine Iron Barrel Formation, so constant vigilance was necessary.</p>
<p>“We got this!” Song Ren beamed.</p>
<p>“Old Song, it looks like our match is being broadcast!” Wang Yifan, who was next to him, noticed something.</p>
<p>“Broadcast? What’s going on!?” Song Ren was a bit confused. Rainbow Six Siege didn't have a spectator system like Warcraft, or perhaps it hadn't been enabled yet! There was no such thing as broadcasting high-tier matches.</p>
<p>“It’s being broadcast within the internet cafe! A notification just popped up saying we were chosen as lucky customers and got a 50% discount.” Wang Yifan said.</p>
<p>“You mean everyone in the internet cafe can see our amazing plays!?” Zhang Yi and the others were stunned. The fight had been too intense; unlike Wang Yifan, who just held up his shield and pushed forward, they hadn't noticed.</p>
<p>“Ugh, so annoying! Soon enough, people will probably want to ask us for gaming tips again.” Song Ren sighed dramatically, but secretly he was delighted. However, Song Ren was actually right about this. Because of their plays, outside the private rooms, other players waiting for a spot were captivated by their performance in this round. In the main hall, a group of people were thoroughly amused.</p>
<p>‘These guys really have something!’</p>
<p>‘Yeah! And that large shield, it’s practically invincible!’</p>
<p>‘I wonder when there’ll be a spot, I really want to play!’</p>
<p>‘Don’t even think about it for now. I’ve been to all the other internet cafes, and there are no spots. I might as well satisfy my craving by watching this big screen.’</p>
<p>‘It feels like this round is already won!’</p>
<p>‘Yeah, there are only three defenders left, and they don’t have grenades. Bullets hitting the shield don’t even deal damage!’</p>
<p>Not just the ordinary players outside the internet cafe, but Song Ren and his teammates in the game also felt that victory was assured. They had already started bragging.</p>
<p>“This is what you call professional! Without a doubt, we are a professional team!”</p>
<p>“Exactly, no need to engage in a gunfight with them. We’ll just hide behind the shields and let them shoot all they want.”</p>
<p>“But we need to be careful. When the bomb defusal countdown is almost over, they’ll probably make a desperate all-in push.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, if they dare to come, we’ll make sure they die!”</p>
<p>Song Ren’s side was filled with laughter and joy. The defenders, however, were a bit desperate. In the voice channel, they had already started assigning blame.</p>
<p>“Ugh! My bad, I just died easily.” Said Doc, who had been killed by FUZE’s Cluster Charge earlier.</p>
<p>“What do we do now? Should we rush them?” Rook, holding an MP5, was a bit frustrated. This tactic was simply disgusting. That large shield took no damage at all! And time was almost up.</p>
<p>“I should have placed my traps in the garage.” Kapkan also said, annoyed.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, there’s still a chance.” At this moment, Bandit on the defending team noticed a detail. Before this, facing the attackers’ large shield, Kapkan and Rook had both brought impact grenades, which explode and deal damage upon contact with an object. And the Chicago Mansion map was a rather special one; most of its structures were made of wooden walls, which could be destroyed in the game.</p>
<p>“You two keep firing in turns to draw their attention, whether we succeed depends on this push!” With very little time left until the explosion, Bandit started running towards the central kitchen stairs, heading to the second floor. Rook and Kapkan, the two Operators, also fired frantically, drawing Song Ren and his team’s firepower.</p>
<p>“The gunfire has already weakened.”</p>
<p>“But this timer is a bit slow!”</p>
<p>“It should be, after all, attacking is too easy in this game, they have to give the defenders some hope.”</p>
<p>Song Ren and his teammates were laughing and joking, completely unaware that danger had quietly descended.</p>
<p>At this moment, Bandit, who had reached the first-floor restaurant, was also a bit nervous. He wasn't sure if it would work. Because he had just discovered something: the garage ceiling had been blown open. And directly above Song Ren and his team was the restaurant. This meant that the garage could be seen from the restaurant. The entire Rainbow Six Siege map was three-dimensional. Plus, his Operator had chosen a gadget called a Remote Charge when he spawned. Any player who had played FPS games knew what that thing was. Its power was incredibly immense! He just didn't know how effective it would be in Rainbow Six Siege. But right now, it was the only method he could think of.</p>
<p>“Shoot, help me cover my footsteps and draw their attention!” Bandit shouted in the voice channel. The next moment, Rook and Kapkan fired frantically, switching to pistols when their primary weapons ran out of ammo. Meanwhile, Bandit on the second floor had quietly made his way to the ceiling. As qualified FPS players, Song Ren and his five teammates fully demonstrated one characteristic: they never looked up. Taking a deep breath, Bandit chose not to shoot people, but instead pulled out a Remote Charge and dropped it through a gap in the rebar on the second floor.</p>
<p>Song Ren and the others, still bragging, saw a dark, blocky object, beeping, fall from above. It landed right in the center of their group.</p>
<p>“What the heck is this dark-colored thing?”</p>
