                <p>Chapter 391: The Grand Promises Can Actually Be Eaten! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>As Chen Xu's words fell, he didn't keep them in suspense any longer.</p>
<p>Soon, scene after scene played on the big screen. In a cramped kitchen, two people cooperated seamlessly, chopping, cooking, and serving dishes. A group of little characters, like Fall Guys characters, pushed and shoved each other, vying for a crown at the top. Cody and May, transformed into puppets and clay figures. The Undead kneeling on one knee before a bonfire. Hunters in Astera Settlement, grabbing onto Wingdrake feet, heading towards the New World. Besides these, there were also works from many third-party game developers.</p>
<p>The audience below was all quite surprised. Of course, if Dark Souls and Monster Hunter: World were to launch on Switch, there would likely be a considerable amount of time involved, and there might be a graphics downgrade. After all, although the Switch developed by Chen Xu in this Parallel World has higher hardware capabilities than in his previous life, the visual presentation of Dark Souls and Monster Hunter: World is also stronger than in his previous life.</p>
<p>Watching the images on the big screen, many players exchanged whispers and discussions, with quite a few showing excited expressions. It Takes Two, Overcooked, and Fall Guys were already ported, with explanatory prompts below. As for Monster Hunter: World and Dark Souls, many veteran players shared a knowing smile. Here it comes! The familiar 'making grand promises' segment! The game isn't here yet, but the video comes first.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu's subsequent words quickly surprised many players. “On Switch, we will gradually port some classic games, but at the same time, there will also be brand new exclusive games specifically adapted for Switch.” Games specifically designed for the Switch handheld console!? Everyone revealed astonished expressions. So, the so-called new games were actually developed exclusively for Switch? Having seen various animal mascots at the exhibition, many players were already mentally prepared. But upon hearing Chen Xu's words, everyone was still surprised, because these so-called new games would be Switch exclusives, not launching on PC or VR platforms! However, this also made many curious: what kind of exclusive games would they be? After all, Chen Xu's intention was clearly to attract players to buy the Switch with the appeal of exclusive games.</p>
<p>“Regarding the type of new games, I believe everyone is quite curious. First up is Animal Forest, a must-play for tough guys.” As Chen Xu spoke, the players present stirred. As gamers, there were many male players at the exhibition. And what man wouldn't consider himself a tough guy? “A must-play for tough guys!” Upon hearing Chen Xu's words, all the players present became excited. But as the video played, the originally excited players froze. “Mr. Chen, tell us, is this really a must-play for tough guys? Is this a game tough guys should be playing!?” Many players in the audience were bewildered. But soon these players came to their senses; this was clearly a playful joke. Just like when Mr. Chen called himself a Warrior of Love and was teased for it.</p>
<p>This game, Animal Forest, was clearly Mr. Chen playing a unique, official meme.</p>
<p>However, aside from the bewildered male players, some female players were extremely excited and surprised. Because this art style was simply delightful! All sorts of cute little animals, utterly adorable!</p>
<p>“Next up will be a platformer game with a rather special gameplay style: Super Mario Odyssey! Modern, desert, forest, ocean... you'll play through more than ten different themed scenes, and this game also supports two-player co-op mode.” As the Animal Forest promotional video finished playing, a new video began on the big screen, introduced by Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Cheerful music sounded in the exhibition area, and a huge hat airship appeared on the screen. 'Above Princess Peach's Castle...' a line of subtitles appeared. Then, Bowser, a spiky great turtle wearing a suit and a white top hat, appeared on the screen. Facing him was Mario, the plumber in a red hat. The two were locked in fierce combat on the deck of a castle resembling an airship, but Mario was clearly no match for Bowser.</p>
<p>'Haha! This is the end!' Bowser threw his white top hat, hitting Mario squarely. Princess Peach, nearby, reached out her hand in worry. Looking at Mario's red hat that had fallen at his feet, Bowser stepped on it. 'I, the Great King, am going to marry Princess Peach!' 'Aren't you upset? Mario!' 'Hahahahaha...' Coupled with Bowser's slightly chuuni lines, it was clearly the classic story template of a dragon kidnapping a princess and a hero rescuing her. It's just that this hero named Mario... honestly, he was quite different from the heroes most players imagined.</p>
<p>Amidst Bowser's booming laughter, the screen went dark. What followed was a series of fast cuts, revealing a myriad of exotic worlds with distinct characteristics to all the players. The Metro Kingdom, with its modern urban backdrop. The vibrant Wooded Kingdom. The Seaside Kingdom, with its beaches and oceans. Besides these, there were also the Sand Kingdom, the Snow Kingdom, and more...</p>
<p>“Of course, I believe everyone is already eager to personally experience these two games and the special features of the Switch,” “On-site, we have prepared ample equipment for everyone to personally try out the games.”</p>
<p>As the video finished playing, Chen Xu announced another piece of news that excited all the players. “Holy cow! There's actually a trial play segment!” “Did I hear that right?! This... this isn't just making grand promises!” “It's back! Everything's back! I can actually eat this cake!” “Stunned!” “Stop talking, hurry up and get in line!”</p>
<p>Many veteran Nebula Games players were completely stunned at this moment. This immediately brought back memories for many players who had attended the first Nebula Games exhibition. Back then, Nebula Games was also a huge sensation! At that time, Sanguosha and Fall Guys truly stole the show at the exhibition. However, that was the only time. By the second Nebula Games exhibition, there was no trial play segment. What, you say there was 'The one with the big hammer' the second year? Can that even be called a game, damn it?! That was a low blood pressure treatment device! Now, after several years, Nebula Games' exhibition trial play segment is back!</p>
<p>Previously, some players weren't overly excited about the promotional videos for Animal Forest and Super Mario Odyssey. The main reason was that they felt a bit too childish. Although whether a game is fun or not can't be judged solely by its promotional trailer and can only be known by playing it, and all players trusted Nebula Games' reputation. The problem was, they weren't sure they'd get to play it. Naturally, most players weren't that interested. But now, everyone unexpectedly realized that this exhibition actually offered a chance to 'eat the cake.' This instantly stirred everyone's emotions.</p>
