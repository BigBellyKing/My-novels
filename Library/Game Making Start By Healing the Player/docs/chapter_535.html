                <p>Chapter 534: You Scumbag, Bad Dad! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Song Ren, in the game, wore a depressed expression.</p>
<p>He had thought there would be something quite enjoyable.</p>
<p>But it turned out to be this kind of act?</p>
<p>This game was simply too misleading.</p>
<p>The pleasant inn in Novigrad was for relaxation. The White Orchard village part was very serious, seemingly a grave plot about parents searching for their daughter. Upon reaching Velen, he let loose a little, but there was only the single maiden, Keira.</p>
<p>However, upon arriving in Novigrad, all pretense was completely stripped away. Not to mention the two small taverns that allowed Geralt to relax after his witcher tasks, there was Sasha, an NPC in the big gambling den that every Gwent player must clear, and Triss, whose old flame was rekindled. One could say that players deeply felt that The Witcher: Wild Hunt was indeed a very serious RPG game.</p>
<p>And when they reached the Skellige Isles, that very night, players truly understood what unicorn play tasted like. Furthermore, on the island, there was an Iron Maiden quest, and after defeating the target named Jutta, Geralt began to unbuckle his pants that very evening.</p>
<p>Three fixed partners across three regions, and one partner each from Gwent and fist-fighting.</p>
<p>Now, it was finally time for the final decisive battle. Before contending with the King of the Wild Hunt, rumored to be the most powerful and possibly most terrifying BOSS ever faced, it made sense to consider a three-way tango, given The Witcher: Wild Hunt's previous performance. It was perfectly logical!</p>
<p>But who could have imagined that the ending would be one where everything was lost?</p>
<p>“Lust blinds one's judgment!” Song Ren couldn’t help but sigh with regret.</p>
<p>Then again, when facing both Yennefer and Triss at the same time, who could bear to refuse?</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>At this point, the game's ending had reached its climax. Players, following the White Wolf, had experienced enough. The final battle against the Wild Hunt was also entering its concluding stage.</p>
<p>Following Avallac'h's hint, Ciri charged directly into battle. Song Ren found this segment of the story incredibly satisfying to play. As a story character in the game, one who didn't require player cultivation, Ciri was incredibly powerful, one-shotting Wild Hunt soldiers with a single strike. Coupled with her spatial displacement ability, it was super cool.</p>
<p>Of course, this might also be related to the game difficulty he was playing, but either way, it was simply satisfying.</p>
<p>However, the protagonist of the game was still the White Wolf, Geralt. When facing the Wild Hunt Navigator, it was Geralt who truly stepped forward.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous Wild Hunt generals, the Caranthir before him was clearly a mage, causing Song Ren a lot of trouble. Especially with his spatial displacement ability, fighting him was very difficult, and his damage was also very high.</p>
<p>But in the end, his White Wolf still proved superior, stabbing the powerful enemy before him with a single sword stroke.</p>
<p>Next, it was time for the true formidable foe, the King of the Wild Hunt, Eredin.</p>
<p>On the battleship, Lord Crach an Craite of the Skellige Isles, who had come to assist, died tragically under Eredin's sword.</p>
<p>Geralt was instantly enraged, using all his combat skills to fiercely battle Eredin.</p>
<p>However, Song Ren's expression quickly became subtle.</p>
<p>If you say Eredin was weak.</p>
<p>His appearance had the true vibe of a big BOSS. Upon his entrance, accompanied by frost, a mask, and armor, Song Ren was reminded of the Lich King's image. Moreover, the BOSS's attack power and damage were also very high.</p>
<p>But if you say he was strong, his New Year's Greeting Swordplay, which was essentially a rage burst, left the Wild Hunt utterly helpless. Aside from occasionally dodging those seemingly cool but completely missable skills, it felt like there was no difficulty at all!</p>
<p>After several rounds, interspersed with a few spatial displacements due to the Wild Hunt's power, the King of the Wild Hunt still died ignominiously under Song Ren's New Year's Greeting Swordplay.</p>
<p>One trick is enough to get by anywhere. Song Ren didn't know how the King of the Wild Hunt before him became the leader.</p>
<p>In a word: weak!</p>
<p>While Song Ren was still lamenting in the game, Eredin revealed crucial information: Ciri had been taken by Avallac'h.</p>
<p>Just as the White Wolf was astonished, the elven teleportation tower ruins on the island suddenly activated. A colossal power surged skyward, and the World Gate was about to open again. A new Conjunction of the Spheres was imminent.</p>
<p>Seeing this, the White Wolf had no time to concern himself with the dying Eredin. Instead, he and Yennefer, braving the falling frost and meteor shower, rushed to find Ciri.</p>
<p>Upon arriving, they found that it was indeed Avallac'h activating the gate.</p>
<p>However, the next moment, Ciri appeared from the side.</p>
<p>She calmly told Geralt that she was going to leave this world again and enter intertwining timelines, using the power of the Elder Blood to stop the spread of the White Frost. This was her ability, her responsibility.</p>
<p>“How do you know how to save the world, you fool? You're just a witcher.”</p>
<p>As Ciri walked into the teleportation gate, Song Ren fell silent for a moment.</p>
<p>Yes, Geralt was just a witcher. How could he save the world?</p>
<p>From beginning to end, the game had revolved tightly around the key core of 'choice'. Every choice had consequences, with gains and losses; there was no perfect ending. So, would Ciri eventually return?</p>
<p>‘Once you return, we’ll continue drinking in the tavern, just like at Kaer Morhen.’</p>
<p>Song Ren was filled with anticipation.</p>
<p>But as the subsequent plot unfolded, he was stunned.</p>
<p>Ciri, who had stepped into the Gate of White Frost, did not return!</p>
<p>Yennefer and Triss also left!</p>
<p>Only the White Wolf remained, going to Velen to seek revenge on the last witch, and then sitting alone in his house, clutching his medallion, while outside, monsters seeking revenge on the White Wolf filled the area?</p>
<p>What kind of ending was this?!</p>
<p>Song Ren's mentality collapsed!</p>
<p>He had thought there would be some kind of twist, such as Ciri returning at the last moment.</p>
<p>But the ruthless reality told him: no!</p>
<p>“No! What the hell kind of ending is this?!” Song Ren was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Still a bit bewildered after quitting the game, Song Ren opened his phone and sent a message to Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>“Old Zhang, have you finished the game? What was your ending?” Song Ren asked.</p>
<p>Not long after, Zhang Yi replied: “Living a secluded rural life with Yennefer, and Ciri became the Empress of Nilfgaard. But actually, I'd rather Ciri be a witcher. Anyway, I'm reloading a save to play for a new ending!”</p>
<p>“Oh, and you, Old Song?”</p>
<p>This meant the game didn't only have bad endings, and Ciri could survive?</p>
<p>Song Ren immediately breathed a sigh of relief. However, after seeing Zhang Yi's reply, he thought for a moment and typed: “Oh, I live a secluded rural life with Triss, and Ciri also became the Empress of Nilfgaard. But I think this option is actually pretty good. After all, as the Emperor of Nilfgaard, Ciri has greater power and can use it to change the world, making the entire Witcher world develop in a better direction.”</p>
<p>“What the hell are you bragging about?! Do you think I haven't seen your achievement trophies? Single Dog and Dead Wolf ending! You scumbag, bad dad! (smirk.jpg)” Zhang Yi replied the instant Song Ren's message was sent, clearly having pre-typed it and just waiting to send.</p>
<p>“Damn it! You knew and still asked on purpose!” Song Ren was rendered speechless.</p>
