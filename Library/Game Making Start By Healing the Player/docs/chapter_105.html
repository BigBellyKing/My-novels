                <p>Chapter 105: Tears</p>
<p>After Karl's family of three reunited, the screen went black for a brief moment.</p>
<p><strong>[Marie, who had not heard from Emile, finally received a letter from her father a few weeks later.]</strong></p>
<p>A sorrowful BGM slowly started playing, and the camera moved to the cell where Emile was imprisoned.</p>
<p>The cell door opened, and an officer walked in to tell Emile that his time had come.</p>
<p>Here, Emile was in rags, with shackles on his feet.</p>
<p>There were no prompts; he could only keep moving forward.</p>
<p>At this moment, Liuliu, in front of her computer, had a terrible premonition.</p>
<p>Along the way, none of the soldiers showed contempt for Emile.</p>
<p>As Emile passed, they would salute, take off their hats, or turn their heads, unwilling to look at him.</p>
<p>Even if the player, controlling Emile, stopped walking, the soldiers and officers escorting him would not grow impatient; instead, they would wait patiently in place for him.</p>
<p>There was no forceful urging or shoving, just a quiet wait for Emile.</p>
<p>Accompanied by the melancholy piano music, Emile's narration slowly began with his footsteps.</p>
<p><strong>[Dear Marie, for me, the war is over. There are no regrets in my heart. I have witnessed too many horrors.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I hope fate will be kinder to you.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Though our days are so short, my life has been filled with happiness. I have only gratitude.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I have been so blessed, especially thankful to heaven for bringing you into my life.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[This letter is my last.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I have been found guilty by a military tribunal for killing an officer.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Though I never intended to kill him.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[War drives men mad.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Though I disappointed Karl, I know my sacrifice was not in vain.]</strong></p>
<p>As Emile walked on, soldier after soldier took off their hats in salute.</p>
<p>Freddie was among them, looking at Emile, who was about to walk to the execution ground, he took off his hat with a sad expression.</p>
<p>Memories of the past resurfaced one by one.</p>
<p>The dog, Anna, Karl, and his daughter and grandson.</p>
<p><strong>[I fought for my country and my freedom, and I upheld my dignity.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Since fate has brought us to this parting of life and death here,]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Then I pray we will reunite in heaven someday.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Please continue to pray for me.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Forever loving you — Dad.]</strong></p>
<p>Standing before the cross used for judgment, Emile's face held only serenity, not fear.</p>
<p>The screen gradually faded into darkness.</p>
<p>'Bang!' A gunshot, followed by the sound of a body falling to the ground.</p>
<p>The next moment, a mournful melody played, and the scene shifted to a graveyard.</p>
<p>Under the setting sun, an endless expanse of wooden crosses lay before them, and in the distance, the flag of France fluttered in the wind.</p>
<p><strong>[Though their bodies have long turned to dust, they will forever live in people's hearts.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[We must cherish these memories and never forget.]</strong></p>
<p>Finally, before Emile's grave, the dog, Karl, Marie, and their son stood silently.</p>
<p>With this, the entire game officially concluded.</p>
<p>And Liuliu, in front of her computer, was now completely in tears.</p>
<p>Her eyes red from looking at the ending screen, she pulled a tissue from beside her and gently wiped them.</p>
<p>"Emile... Emile never knew before he died that Karl wasn't actually dead. He still felt he had let Karl down," Liuliu's voice was slightly choked.</p>
<p>She hadn't not played tragic games before.</p>
<p>In fact, just last year, <em>To the Moon</em> had presented countless players with a poignant yet beautiful love story.</p>
<p>But the core of <em>To the Moon</em> was different from that of <em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em>.</p>
<p>To describe it in one word, it was 'heavy'.</p>
<p>There was no overtly emotional plot, just a gradual, insidious process, slowly eroding the softest parts of players' hearts through subtle groundwork.</p>
<p>What it showed was too cruel, making players feel a profound weight.</p>
<p>In Emile's final testament, there was no complaint about his own fate.</p>
<p>There was only love for his family and no regrets about his life.</p>
<p>Unlike some grand-scale war games, <em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em> didn't feature flashy content.</p>
<p>Nor did it use hyper-realistic graphics to depict the brutality of war.</p>
<p>Instead, it brought players closer to families torn apart by war and to those who had been tormented by it.</p>
<p>This had an even greater impact than stunning visual graphics.</p>
<p>And Emile was merely a microcosm of countless individuals.</p>
<p>One could even say that Emile and Karl in the game were already quite fortunate.</p>
<p>But precisely because of this, the cruelty of war and its profound weight were felt even more keenly.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>It wasn't just Liuliu; all players who completed <em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em> were utterly in tears.</p>
<p>Because the game had too many moments that could genuinely move them to tears.</p>
<p>One moment Emile befriended a German officer, and the next, that officer was blown up.</p>
<p>And the search and rescue dog had just reunited with its original owner, only for that owner to be killed by an explosion.</p>
<p>Karl's family of three had just reunited, but Emile was about to walk to the execution ground to be executed.</p>
<p>There were many such instances in the game where just as your heart warmed, it was instantly stabbed.</p>
<p>It wasn't just the plot; it was also the overall presentation of the game.</p>
<p><em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em> wasn't a large game in terms of scope; the entire playthrough was only about three hours long.</p>
<p>In terms of sales, <em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em> wasn't initially very high, as it was a small-scale game and also part of a Game Design Competition, so many players were still waiting to see.</p>
<p>However, the game's overall score soared through the roof, reaching an impressive 9.8 points.</p>
<p>Thanks to this exceptionally high rating, <em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em> quickly began to spread among the gaming community.</p>
<p>Player reviews and related discussions also increased rapidly.</p>
<p><strong>'Chen Xu always knows how to fool us! This game once again showed us what a "Warrior of Love" means. It was supposed to be a heartwarming game, but after playing it, I was completely bewildered!'</strong></p>
<p><strong>'Although I really want to punch Chen Xu, I have to admit, by the end I was really in tears, the ending was genuinely moving!'</strong></p>
<p><strong>'At first, I was skeptical about how such a small-scale game could convey anti-war sentiment, but I have to say, Chen Xu achieved it!'</strong></p>
<p><strong>'There has never been a good war, nor a bad peace!'</strong></p>
<p><strong>'There is indeed a "Valiant Heart" in the game, but unlike another English translation of the subtitle, "The Great War," a war born of politics and self-interest can never be linked to greatness!'</strong></p>
<p>Of course, there were also some players who didn't like this style, as it's difficult to satisfy all tastes, and player preferences vary significantly.</p>
<p>Chen Xu couldn't possibly create a game that was all-encompassing and catered to every player's taste.</p>
<p>However, compared to the diverse preferences of players, the industry's game media uniformly gave the game extremely high praise.</p>
<p>(There's one more update later, please give this inexperienced author some recommendation votes and Monthly Passes, sob sob sob...)</p>
