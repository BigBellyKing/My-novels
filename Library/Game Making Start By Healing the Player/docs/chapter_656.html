                <p>Chapter 655: Max Level is Just the Beginning (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>After a considerably long journey, the first batch of players, who logged in for many hours daily, had already reached max level.</p>
<p>These players were filled with emotion, realizing that unlike other games where hitting max level means reaching the end, in World of Warcraft, there was still an immense amount of content they hadn't even touched.</p>
<p>Leaving other things aside, the first highlight was the side quests in various regions.</p>
<p>Across the vast world of Azeroth, countless side quests in every region awaited players to complete and explore. Among them were many tasks offering good rewards and featuring classic storylines.</p>
<p>Beyond that were the different playstyles.</p>
<p>Upon reaching max level, players could finally fully appreciate the charm of each class. This even spawned many memes. For example: 'I'm a Arms Warrior, fighting with a fan, cooldown a minute and a half, spin and I'm done.' 'Charge + Release Soul, that's a warrior's romance.'</p>
<p>Of course, more players were busy grinding dungeons to improve their combat prowess. To get a single set of equipment, players would often turn the world upside down with their grinding.</p>
<p>And there was also a major problem that spanned from the start of the game to max level: money!</p>
<p>Although a trading house was later opened where players could trade with each other, for instance, buying time cards and having other players purchase them with gold, most players still wouldn't sell time cards or buy them with gold.</p>
<p>Money remained a big issue, and many players would save up to buy the thousand-gold mount, which was no small expense. Of course, Warlocks and Paladins were quite happy at this point, as their class quests allowed them to obtain their exclusive thousand-gold mounts directly. This was a significant advantage for Warlocks and Knights, though the materials weren't cheap either.</p>
<p>As for multiplayer raid dungeons, they remained something only the top tier of players could access.</p>
<p>After completing the quests related to Onyxia, many players immediately went to challenge Onyxia, only to be utterly crushed, naturally. After repeated attempts and wipes, many players realized that this was likely beyond their current capabilities.</p>
<p>As for other dungeons, like Molten Core, it didn't mean they were easy. Even compared to its previous life, voice coordination and numerical viewing had made things much more convenient, somewhat reducing the difficulty. However, game mechanisms were the most crucial aspect of World of Warcraft's dungeons.</p>
<p>Many teams raiding Molten Core, let alone the final BOSS, didn't even know at first that they needed to stack fire resistance to reduce the difficulty. As a result, they were repeatedly thrashed by the two gatekeepers right at the entrance.</p>
<p>And after finally passing the trial of the gatekeepers, they discovered that these two guys weren't even BOSSes. And this was just the beginning of their tribulations. For instance, the five Molten Hounds in Molten Core had a special mechanism: they had to die simultaneously within a limited time, otherwise, they would endlessly resurrect.</p>
<p>Even so, those who endured such suffering were mostly the elite players in the game. Because at this time, most mainstream players were still running dungeons like Stratholme, Scholomance, and Blackrock Spire. But even these were extremely arduous, often requiring a bit of luck; perhaps with a good team, they could clear it, but with less reliable teammates the next time, they'd be stuck.</p>
<p>And unlike previous dungeons, many high-level dungeons in the later stages were locked. Players needed to complete some prerequisite quests to obtain the key to open the dungeon gates.</p>
<p>Moreover, the method to acquire this key was very tedious. Of course, not getting the key was also an option, as long as there was a Rogue player with Lockpicking trained to 300. Just like Mages who gave out bread and water in the early days were called 'master mages' by people walking down the streets, a Rogue player with Lockpicking trained to 300 would never have to worry about finding people to take them into dungeons, as long as they weren't too bad. They would typically be called 'master rogues'.</p>
<p>The rich content in the game allowed both top-tier and casual players to find unique enjoyment.</p>
<p>In his previous life, countless MMORPGs bore the shadow of World of Warcraft. And countless MMORPGs launched attacks, challenging World of Warcraft's status. Yet, over a decade later, in the hearts of many players, Azeroth and World of Warcraft remained the greatest MMORPG. This was due to World of Warcraft's unique ingenuity in its early days.</p>
<p>Although it was an online game, World of Warcraft put immense effort into its various zones and dungeons in its early stages. Take Blackrock Depths, for example; the development team crafted it into a massive underground dungeon world. It wasn't designed merely as a resource-farming instance; it contained extensive side quests and numerous routes. It even showcased the background and related worldview of the Dark Iron Dwarves, aiming to present their cultural life to players within that zone.</p>
<p>As for players' complaints about this map and zone, it wasn't that it wasn't excellent, but rather that some details weren't handled well. Specifically, there wasn't enough guidance, causing many players' biggest problem in Blackrock Depths to be getting lost. So, like the Blackrock Depths dungeon, Chen Xu added more guidance content compared to its previous life. Players uninterested in the Dark Iron Dwarf culture could simply run the dungeon and acquire resources. But players interested in the story behind it and the Dark Iron Dwarf culture could complete side quests and follow small clues to learn the story of Blackrock Depths' establishment. At the same time, efforts were made to prevent players from getting lost by adding numerous route guides.</p>
<p>Regarding the versions, based on World of Warcraft's content from his previous life, from Classic to Wrath of the Lich King, just this content alone would be enough for World of Warcraft to sustain updates for two to three years. Moreover, with the current player base and the continuous influx of new players, it could be said that World of Warcraft could maintain considerable vitality during this period.</p>
<p>What remained was to operate it steadily and not pull any stunts. At the same time, Chen Xu could temporarily shift his focus somewhat from World of Warcraft, at least no longer needing to constantly monitor it.</p>
<p>At this moment, Song Ren looked at the video Zhang Yi sent him, his face lined with dark thoughts. 'What the heck? Who recorded this?' 'And what kind of tribute is this? If it's a real tribute, can't they use some positive material?'</p>
<p>The video showed footage of him loudly shouting and entering Fuhua Jian just a short while ago. However, in the video, right after his original sentence, a line was directly added: 'I am Leeroy Jenkins!' The short, one-minute video looked absolutely demonic!</p>
<p>Even more crucially, this video inexplicably went viral. Luckily, his ID and relevant guild name were pixelated. Otherwise, he reckoned his days in the game wouldn't be peaceful. The only issue was that there were quite a few people in the know, and he suspected the nickname 'Leeroy Jenkins' would stick with him for a long time.</p>
