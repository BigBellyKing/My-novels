                <p>Chapter 550: Carnival Site (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Here, Chen Xu and the Nebula Games team were visiting all aspects of the theme park.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, players were utterly bewildered. Although there was only one day left, this last day was the hardest to endure, and countless players' expectations had soared to their peak.</p>
<p>This was true for both overseas and domestic players.</p>
<p>'Argh, argh, argh... I've waited so long that the flowers have withered! I'm overseas, if I adjust my computer's timezone, can I unlock the Carnival faster?'</p>
<p>'Bro, I think you definitely have a problem!'</p>
<p>'It's so hard; every day is a torment, especially knowing about bits and pieces of news regarding new games.'</p>
<p>'I wonder what kind of surprises Mr. Chen will bring us at the direct presentation this time?'</p>
<p>'Don't even get me started, I look at the two promotional images Mr. Chen released earlier several times a day.'</p>
<p>'And what did you get from them?'</p>
<p>'Of course I got something! The more I looked, the more I saw two words: Idiots!'</p>
<p>'Isn't that the truth? If there weren't any prior news, it would be fine, but now we're desperate!'</p>
<p>'Such torment! But the park opens tomorrow, which brings me a little comfort.'</p>
<p>'Comfort my foot! Did you forget? The direct presentation is only on the last day, which means for the first two and a half days, only true Lucky Kings can be happy!'</p>
<p>'Holy cow, you're right!'</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>Players discussed in waves, and time flew by to the day the Nebula Games theme park opened.</p>
<p>The weather was quite nice. Although it was already September, the temperature wasn't high, and many people were still wearing long sleeves.</p>
<p>Both domestic and international players were all excited.</p>
<p>And the players who could come here were basically all loyal fans of Nebula Games.</p>
<p>The players on site were also discussing animatedly.</p>
<p>"So many people!"</p>
<p>"Indeed, we have to queue for such a long time!"</p>
<p>"Actually, it looks long, but with everyone in order, it's quite fast, and it's not just this one gate."</p>
<p>"I wonder if Mr. Chen will show up?"</p>
<p>"Didn't you see the schedule? Mr. Chen will only appear at the direct presentation on the last day."</p>
<p>"And what about that app thing?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, just download the APP from the official website. All the attractions and evening entertainment schedules are there. By the way, buddy, why aren't you in line yet?"</p>
<p>"Line? I don't have a ticket! You guys with tickets, hurry up and go!"</p>
<p>"I don't either..."</p>
<p>"These tickets are only for Lucky Kings; I'm one of the Unlucky Streak..."</p>
<p>"So all of us here are the ticketless ones?"</p>
<p>"Exactly! If they had tickets, who'd be here shooting the breeze with us? They'd definitely be in line already!" As he spoke, one of the bros pointed to the long queue in the distance.</p>
<p>Turns out, all those on their side were people without tickets.</p>
<p>Of course, they weren't the only ticketless ones; many local players, when they had time, even if they hadn't won tickets and couldn't enter the theme park, still came over. They figured, might as well come join the fun if they had nothing else to do; it's pretty good.</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>Compared to the ticketless players who came to watch the excitement at the main entrance, the players who had already entered the park were full of surprises throughout their visit.</p>
<p>Because there were so many familiar things there.</p>
<p>Queuing was required upon entering the park, but once inside, there was no need to queue; visitors could move freely.</p>
<p>The entire park was more like a small town, and players could explore on foot. There were also different tram services every 15 minutes at various points for visitors to ride.</p>
<p>Of course, unless they were genuinely too tired to walk or for other reasons, most people chose to walk.</p>
<p>Because at various points in the theme park, there were some truly surprising sights.</p>
<p>"Haha, a Creeper at the house entrance, that's too scary!"</p>
<p>One visitor exclaimed, looking at a sculpture in the Minecraft area. It was an exquisite small house, but at its entrance stood a Creeper.</p>
<p>Any player who had played Minecraft would instantly smile knowingly at this scene, their minds already envisioning the subsequent events.</p>
<p>"And this Overcooked! Plates dropping everywhere, haha, just looking at this scene, my blood pressure is rising!"</p>
<p>"What the heck! Why is the Big Hammer Game here too!"</p>
<p>As they advanced, players found surprising elements in every area.</p>
<p>Liva and Johnny sat on a log, gazing at the moon.</p>
<p>The Onion Knight sat on the ground, raising a wine glass, and the Sun Knight spread his arms, praising the sun.</p>
<p>Upon entering the main boulevard of the theme park, there was also a spectacular performance.</p>
<p>Accompanied by falling flower petals, a band appeared.</p>
<p>Mario mascots led the way, followed by a specially built stage float, on which Pauline was giving a unique concert.</p>
<p>Watching this scene, the players and visitors present erupted in a thunderous cheer, joining in with Pauline's performance.</p>
<p>And that wasn't all for the park; the initial cartoon zone was more for viewing and photo opportunities for players.</p>
<p>In the central area, players encountered some of Nebula Games' famous IPs. The attractions here were also different from the earlier ones, allowing players to participate firsthand.</p>
<p>For example, in the Monster Hunter: World area, players would embody real Hunters, donning specialized clothing and wielding specialized tools. Simultaneously, there were specially designed holographic projection scenes where players could use these specialized tools to inflict damage on colossal dragons.</p>
<p>If there was a drawback, it was that these items were a bit heavy, with the clothing and weapons together weighing nearly seven catties.</p>
<p>In the Sanguosha area, players could engage in a holographic card duel using specially designed equipment.</p>
<p>The generals and cards from the game would 'materialize' under the holographic projection.</p>
<p>Of course, in addition to these exciting attractions, there were also some projects in the park that left players somewhat speechless.</p>
<p>These were the Resident Evil and Outlast experience zones, located in more secluded corners.</p>
<p>While Resident Evil and Outlast were undeniably essential points when discussing Nebula Games, why were their gameplay methods based on a haunted house format?</p>
<p>The only thing that offered some relief to many players was that the number of entrants wasn't limited to a single person.</p>
<p>Yet, even so, various screams could still be heard from players who entered out of curiosity.</p>
<p>Even in the bustling, noisy park, players near these two attractions could still hear the heart-wrenching screams emanating from within.</p>
<p>Consequently, some players who had originally thought, 'Since we're already here, why not try it?' quietly turned and walked away.</p>
<p>Can't play it, can't play it... this attraction is truly unplayable!</p>
