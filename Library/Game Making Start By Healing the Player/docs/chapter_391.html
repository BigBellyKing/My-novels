                <p>Chapter 390: Surprised Players (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>The weather on the day of the gameplay Expo was quite good, and the temperature wasn't very high.</p>
<p>As in previous years, this year's gameplay Expo was once again bustling with people. Not only players from Modu, but also many from out of town, had specifically rushed over to see the new games from various companies at the expo.</p>
<p>At the ticket check-in at the expo's entrance, many players gathered together, discussing amongst themselves.</p>
<p>“Unlike before, Nebula Games actually has its own independent exhibition area this year!”</p>
<p>“Of course! Nebula Games is on a completely different scale now compared to a few years ago. Not to mention anything else, just the content Nebula Games released last year would be enough to fill an entire exhibition area.”</p>
<p>“Stop talking about last year, I’m more curious about what Chen Xu will bring this time. I heard rumors about a new handheld console and new games, but I don’t know if it’s true.”</p>
<p>“It shouldn't be that fast, right? After all, it’s only been half a year.”</p>
<p>“You never know. Nebula Games isn't starting from scratch, after all. Wasn't iQue originally an old domestic handheld console manufacturer?”</p>
<p>“I’m really not interested in handheld consoles. I’m more concerned about whether Nebula Games will bring anything new this time.”</p>
<p>“Actually, NetDragon Games and TengHua Games are pretty good too! Especially TengHua Games’ previous Chaotic Heroes series, their first attempt at an open-world game is quite intriguing!”</p>
<p>“And NetDragon Games isn’t bad either. Shadow Operations: The Wilderness, based on the previously released information, looks really exciting, and the scenery is absolutely stunning.”</p>
<p>Before entering the expo, many players were engaged in various discussions. However, the main focus was essentially on three points: Nebula Games, NetDragon Games, and TengHua Games.</p>
<p>Many players were unsure what Nebula Games had brought this time, because neither Chen Xu’s official Weibo account nor Nebula Games’ official Weibo account had announced any content beforehand. But NetDragon Games and TengHua Games, who had previously engaged in an intense promotional battle, had certainly built up a lot of anticipation among players.</p>
<p>However, these factors mainly appealed to ordinary casual players. Loyal fans of each game developer, on the other hand, wouldn't think so much. Their first stop would always be their favorite developer's exhibition area.</p>
<p>“What the heck is this!? It’s all dolls!”</p>
<p>“So cute!”</p>
<p>“Huh! I think I’ve seen that red-hatted, big-nosed character somewhere before!”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that the Mario guard from Stormwind in the VR Warcraft theme before?!”</p>
<p>Many players who came to the Nebula Games exhibition area were completely stunned. Other game developers’ exhibition areas were either uniformly filled with long-legged showgirls that kids couldn't help but stare at, or they featured various cool cosplay and dazzling lights.</p>
<p>But here at Nebula Games, the hall was filled with the very lighthearted piano music 'Welcome Horizons'. This was also the main theme background music for Animal Forest when entering the island. Combined with the various dolls at the expo, it made players feel as if they had entered a cartoon amusement park.</p>
<p>“It feels just like the first time we came to Nebula Games!” said Zhang Yi, holding Wang Han’s hand, having taken time to come with his friend.</p>
<p>“Yeah! The first time we came, I think it was all Fall Guys dolls,” Wang Han nodded and said. As loyal fans of Nebula Games, they naturally wouldn't be absent.</p>
<p>“But I thought there would be some news about Red Dead Redemption or the VR version of Warcraft,” Song Ren said with some regret. After all, Stormwind had already appeared in the VR theme before.</p>
<p>Not only Song Ren and his friends, but this scene also attracted many casual players, especially a good number of female players.</p>
<p>“This developer called Nebula Games, all their games are so heartwarming!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah! So Overcooked (Chinese title) and Fall Guys are actually from this game developer.”</p>
<p>“Look… that raccoon is so adorable!”</p>
<p>Some female players who were drawn over discussed with pleasant surprise. Listening to these players, Song Ren was silent for a moment.</p>
<p>Heartwarming? Right, Outlast, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Red Dead Redemption, Dark Souls, and that one game, the source of frustration, Getting Over It — these games are <em>so</em> heartwarming. To this day, Song Ren still couldn't forget his legs turning to jelly from Outlast, nor the brain-numbing frustration he felt the following year at the gameplay Expo as one of the first players to try Getting Over It.</p>
<p>Just then, a wave of cheers suddenly erupted from the direction of the main stage in the distance. Many players wondered what had happened. But once they got closer, their questions were answered. Amidst the crowd's cheers, Chen Xu walked onto the stage from backstage, carrying a black box in his hand.</p>
<p>Taking the microphone, Chen Xu smiled and said, “Good morning, everyone!”</p>
<p>As his words fell, many players in the audience also waved back and shouted.</p>
<p>‘Mr. Chen, it's not morning anymore! It's already past nine!’</p>
<p>‘Mr. Chen, are there any new games?!’</p>
<p>‘Mr. Chen, is this new game content?!’</p>
<p>There was a noisy clamor, with all sorts of questions, making it very lively.</p>
<p>Chen Xu waved his hand, signaling for everyone to quiet down. With the help of the staff, the players quickly settled down.</p>
<p>“Today’s expo content mainly consists of two aspects, which I believe everyone has already guessed.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, it’s Nebula Games’ new handheld console, and new games.”</p>
<p>As Chen Xu's words fell, the previously quiet crowd became excited once again. There had indeed been some rumors circulating online before, but many players were skeptical. However, now that it came from Chen Xu's mouth, the meaning was completely different. And judging by Chen Xu’s tone, the handheld console was already made? The crowd discussed animatedly, and then a picture appeared on the large screen.</p>
<p>Chen Xu silently placed the box on the table and opened it. The Switch, with its classic red and blue coloring just like in his previous life, appeared in the players' view. Everyone in the audience wanted to get closer for a clear look, while other players who had come upon hearing the news stood on the periphery, stretching their necks and standing on tiptoes to look at the big screen.</p>
<p>“It’s much smaller than I imagined!”</p>
<p>“But it feels quite a bit larger than a phone; it definitely won't fit in a pocket.”</p>
<p>“Of course, it’s a handheld console after all. If the screen is too small for gaming, it doesn’t feel satisfying. This size feels just about right.”</p>
<p>“Exactly, it’s a handheld, not a phone. And playing on a phone touchscreen is nowhere near as comfortable as playing with a controller.”</p>
<p>The audience discussed animatedly.</p>
<p>“This handheld console is named Switch. Currently, the prototype only comes in blue and red, but of course, there will be more color schemes in the future. For now, let’s focus on its features.”</p>
<p>“And for those taking photos, remember to turn on the beauty filter later; it’ll make the pictures look a bit better,” Chen Xu joked, looking at the audience, then briefly introduced some aspects of the Switch before him. Of course, a dedicated Direct-style press conference would be held later, but Chen Xu wouldn't attend that one; he would leave it to the marketing department.</p>
<p>“This handheld console is called Switch. Its screen itself is touch-operable, though this function is mostly used for entering account passwords.”</p>
<p>“When playing normally, you use this…” As he spoke, Chen Xu pointed to the red and blue controllers. “These are controllers specifically developed for the Switch. When playing alone, they attach directly to the console like this.”</p>
<p>“But if you want to play with your boyfriend, girlfriend, or good buddy, then you can…”</p>
<p>Chen Xu smiled, pressing the two small circular buttons on the Joy-Con. The two controllers were instantly detached.</p>
<p>“That’s right, it can be split into two controllers, and it also features a motion-sensing gyroscope, a built-in microphone, and HD Rumble technology.” As Chen Xu spoke, a game screen soon appeared on the display, one that players were not unfamiliar with. It was footage from It Takes Two. In the game, Chen Xu wielded two controllers, controlling May to whack moles with a hammer, and gently swung a Joy-Con to make hits in mini-games. He also performed some special operations through simple button presses and controller swings. Everyone watching was very surprised.</p>
<p>“That looks kind of interesting!”</p>
<p>“So it’s got motion control gameplay!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s completely different from the original style. It feels like playing those old arcade VR games.”</p>
<p>Many players in the audience were astonished. Actually, It Takes Two wasn't the absolute best game for this pairing, but it was excellent for demonstration purposes, because it allowed players to more directly experience the difference between playing on the Switch and on a PC.</p>
<p>“In addition, there are some special features. With the dedicated dock, it can connect to a monitor and support up to 2K resolution,” Chen Xu continued with some demonstrations.</p>
<p>“The entire body uses a new type of plastic material, preventing deformation due to overheating, and also making the whole device lighter.” Chen Xu briefly introduced some of the Switch's construction and materials. Of course, another key point for using the new plastic was lower cost.</p>
<p>“Finally, there’s one more point everyone is quite concerned about: the games.”</p>
