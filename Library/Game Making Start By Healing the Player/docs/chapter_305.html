                <p>Chapter 304: Promotional CG Released (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>In the center of the conference room, Chen Xu explained some related concept settings.</p>
<p>The settings for attackers and defenders, and three different gameplay modes: Bomb, Hostage, and Secure Area.</p>
<p>There was also a PVE Terrorist Hunt Mode, including a tutorial arrangement for new players.</p>
<p>After all, Rainbow Six Siege itself is a very hardcore game.</p>
<p>Some basic content and game concepts still needed to be clear to players.</p>
<p>Of course, considering that tutorial content might be slightly more tedious than regular gameplay, coupled with player psychological feedback, the simplest method for tutorials was to use reward-based onboarding.</p>
<p>Operator cosmetics and weapon skins would serve as incentives for players.</p>
<p>As for the monetization model, compared to RTS games which are harder to set up a monetization system for, FPS games are much easier.</p>
<p>Besides that, regarding Operators, players would need to use Renown to unlock them after entering the game, just like in the previous life.</p>
<p>However, for starter Operators, players could freely choose six out of the ten available.</p>
<p>Of course, the unlock conditions for Operators were more lenient than in the previous life; there wouldn't be situations where early hardcore players needed tens of thousands of Renown to unlock one.</p>
<p>The initial 10 Operators could be unlocked for 1500 Renown each, while subsequent new Operators would cost 5000 Renown.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this was to help players better understand the game's settings and familiarize themselves with each Operator's skills and characteristics.</p>
<p>Avoid situations like this: your Fuze teammate is "thump-thump-thumping" into a room, and as a teammate, you rush in without a second thought.</p>
<p>The core fun of the game, map mechanisms, weapon system attachments, and so on.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>After the Rainbow Six Siege meeting concluded, the team began their respective tasks.</p>
<p>Qin Yi and NetDragon's technical team began adjusting the feel of weapons and actions for the VR aspect.</p>
<p>At the same time, they also experimented with subsequent physical effects, as physical feedback is very important in Rainbow Six Siege.</p>
<p>Because inside the rooms, most of the scenes and walls can be destroyed.</p>
<p>Demolition... no, fortification and destroying wooden walls to open up an attack route, this is a core gameplay element of the game.</p>
<p>As for the maps, the important aspects were various routes and planning for destructible environments.</p>
<p>Chen Xu would simply sketch them out, and then Ruan Ningxue and her team would produce the art assets.</p>
<p>And the game's background would be handled by Yang Xin's team.</p>
<p>After the game meeting concluded, the entire team entered a state of efficient operation.</p>
<p>Meng Zuo, who had just attended the meeting, was still a bit bewildered.</p>
<p>Looking at Lin Rou, Chen Xu's assistant, Meng Zuo, who had just walked out of the conference room, was still a little dazed.</p>
<p>He paused, then looked at Lin Rou beside him and finally spoke: "So... this is how you Nebula Games develop games!?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Teacher Meng, is something wrong? Isn't this how game development works?" Lin Rou asked, a little puzzled.</p>
<p>"Nothing, you go on with your work," Meng Zuo said, momentarily speechless.</p>
<p>Isn't this how game development works? What's wrong with it?</p>
<p>This is absolutely damn wrong!</p>
<p>There was no confusion, no arguments, and the game's gameplay was remarkably complete; it seemed only the subsequent data content hadn't been finalized.</p>
<p>But this data aspect, while not simple, wasn't that difficult either.</p>
<p>Because the game's mechanisms and architecture were sound, the numerical design just needed continuous adjustments.</p>
<p>One could only say, as expected of Chen Xu.</p>
<p>At this moment, Meng Zuo couldn't help but sigh with emotion.</p>
<p>Having worked in games for so long, it was truly his first time seeing such a situation.</p>
<p>And as he was sighing, Chen Xu, who had just finished explaining some matters to Qin Yi and the others, turned and came over.</p>
<p>"Teacher Meng, for what's next, I might need to ask NetDragon for some help," Chen Xu said with a smile, looking at Meng Zuo.</p>
<p>"What is it?" Meng Zuo asked, snapping back to attention.</p>
<p>"For the version aimed at ordinary players, there aren't many issues, but for the military aspect, we still need a specialized consultant to make the game's performance more realistic," Chen Xu told Meng Zuo.</p>
<p>If they were to search, Nebula Games' current capabilities could naturally find one.</p>
<p>But NetDragon had a ready-made workforce, so it would be a waste not to use it.</p>
<p>"That's not a problem, NetDragon has specialized consultants for this," Meng Zuo nodded in response.</p>
<p>It wasn't just NetDragon; major domestic and international developers involved in FPS games generally hired professional consultants.</p>
<p>After receiving Chen Xu's request, NetDragon's actions were very swift. There was no need for face-to-face meetings; video communication would suffice.</p>
<p>And based on communication with the relevant consultants, Chen Xu also made some content adjustments and weakenings to in-game skills, to achieve a more realistic representation in the military version.</p>
<p>Not to mention Fuze's "thump-thump-thump," taking Ash's breaching round as an example, in reality, this type of weapon rarely sees use because it can easily cause friendly fire to attacking personnel and hostages, making the situation even more chaotic.</p>
<p>Also, Pulse's heartbeat sensor, while existing in reality, cannot accurately pinpoint locations.</p>
<p>So Chen Xu also made some modifications to these elements to make them more aligned with reality.</p>
<p>As for being completely identical to reality, that would be difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>After all, at its core, it's still a game.</p>
<p>So it still had to revolve around the inherent Rainbow Six Siege gameplay mode.</p>
<p>However, in terms of details and perspective, the consultants provided a considerable number of suggestions.</p>
<p>This also saved Chen Xu a lot of effort.</p>
<p>Thus, under Chen Xu's leadership, the development of Rainbow Six Siege proceeded smoothly.</p>
<p>Of course, facing countless players eagerly anticipating the game.</p>
<p>Chen Xu and NetDragon felt that they couldn't let these players wait anxiously, knowing nothing but a codename called R6.</p>
<p>Therefore, under these circumstances, a promotional CG trailer for Rainbow Six Siege, jointly created by Nebula Games and NetDragon, was officially released.</p>
<p>This made countless players cheer with joy.</p>
<p>"Finally, there's new news!"</p>
<p>"Rainbow Six Siege, what a strange game title!"</p>
<p>"It's a counter-terrorism game!?"</p>
<p>"Damn, it feels a bit different, the style seems completely unlike previous counter-terrorism games!"</p>
<p>"This seems to be Nebula Games' first VR game!"</p>
<p>"Nonsense, aren't the Bow and Heavy Bowgun in Monster Hunter: World shooting weapons? Have you forgotten Mirror (Game)? Who was with you, shooting through all those countless dark nights?"</p>
<p>"F***! You guys can even make suggestive jokes on this broken road!?"</p>
<p>"Damn it, the wheels are practically on my face!"</p>
<p>"Stop with the nonsense, I'm more curious about what Chen Xu can do with a counter-terrorism game, after all, there are quite a few games in this genre!"</p>
<p>Filled with many doubts, countless players clicked on the CG video.</p>
