                <p>Chapter 203: Industry Discussion (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>The META game concept in Undertale, developed by Chen Xu, opened up a new line of thinking for many Game Designers in the industry.</p>
<p>Afterward, the Independent Game scene also saw a surge in META game popularity.</p>
<p>The second time was with the release of Overcooked (Chinese title) and Fall Guys, whose cooperative and variety show-style gameplay also greatly inspired many Game Designers.</p>
<p>However, the subsequent Dark Souls and It Takes Two also provided much inspiration to many Designers.</p>
<p>Namely, the lack of excellent two-player co-op games, and that players' acceptance of hardcore games was higher than imagined.</p>
<p>Yet, in terms of the games' own gameplay and settings, they offered little reference for many Game Designers.</p>
<p>This was because of the overall quality improvement, and many small studios and independent game designer teams simply couldn't bear the cost risks.</p>
<p>But now, the emergence of Don't Starve, and its so-called sandbox game type, made many Game Designers' eyes light up.</p>
<p>Although, so far, all Game Designers still hadn't fully grasped the core concept of Don't Starve or the concept of sandbox games.</p>
<p>For example, what exactly were Don't Starve's success points: was it the survival gameplay, the collecting and building gameplay within the game, or other hidden reasons?</p>
<p>However, it was undeniable that this type of game, like Don't Starve, was completely worth trying.</p>
<p>Because it had a most fundamental element: Don't Starve was not a big-budget production.</p>
<p>Judging from Don't Starve's art assets and final product scale, it was clearly a standard independent team game.</p>
<p>And small-scale production meant low trial-and-error costs.</p>
<p>Moreover, from an overall external framework perspective, many Designers felt that replicating Don't Starve's success was far easier than Dark Souls'.</p>
<p>This was because Don't Starve's theme was very clear: it simulated a rich sandbox world and allowed players to better survive in it.</p>
<p>The only question was how to achieve this in other sandbox games.</p>
<p>On a certain industry forum, many renowned independent game designers and designers from some second and third-tier companies were discussing Don't Starve's pros, cons, and future directions.</p>
<p>"It feels like sandbox games are a very promising direction!"</p>
<p>"Nebula Games Platform seems to be rising. Based on the currently announced sales, first-month sales will likely be around 4 million, and that's just for Nebula Games' single platform!"</p>
<p>"Let's not talk about Nebula Games Platform; it has nothing to do with us. Let's discuss Don't Starve's sandbox gameplay."</p>
<p>"Actually, I feel Don't Starve has given a relatively clear direction: clear objectives combined with rich elements. If you think about it, Don't Starve's main theme is survival, and all designs revolve around this 'survival' objective. So, I think a sandbox game should have a relatively large map, coupled with a core thematic gameplay, but without restricting players."</p>
<p>"Exactly, if you replace survival with something else, this principle is completely feasible. For example, if the game's theme is treasure hunting, with various tombs distributed throughout the game world, and we don't restrict players' exploration paths for these tombs, adding some randomness—that feels like a type of sandbox game."</p>
<p>"Precisely, Don't Starve's tech tree could be completely replaced by a skill tree. For a treasure-hunting sandbox game, for instance, each time a player finds a new treasure, they could associate the acquired item with the skill tree to learn new skills."</p>
<p>Inside the forum, Game Designers from all walks of life were discussing what the true focus of sandbox games should be.</p>
<p>Each Designer had their own corresponding ideas.</p>
<hr />
<p>In Nebula Games' rest area, Ruan Ningxue was also playing Don't Starve, with Yang Xin and others watching behind her.</p>
<p>In this save file, Ruan Ningxue had successfully lived for over sixty days, and the season was summer.</p>
<p>"Xiaoxue, your base must be the biggest in the whole company!"</p>
<p>"That's right, that's right. Sister Xue, how long did you grind for?"</p>
<p>The people standing behind Ruan Ningxue said.</p>
<p>There were all sorts of traps, fenced-in Pig Houses, and chests for storing supplies.</p>
<p>And countless rows of Berry Bushes and other crops.</p>
<p>Many dog teeth traps were also placed at the entrance of the home base.</p>
<p>The entire home base was completely surrounded by grass walls.</p>
<p>"Still not enough!" Ruan Ningxue said with a smile.</p>
<p>While chatting with Yang Xin and the others, Ruan Ningxue also checked her dog teeth traps.</p>
<p>Because the Hounds were about to attack her.</p>
<p>But what could that do? She had so many dog teeth traps.</p>
<p>However, when the pack of Hounds appeared and she saw a few red figures among them, Ruan Ningxue's expression changed: "Oh no, I forgot to refuel the fire extinguisher!"</p>
<p>"What happened? Weren't all the Hounds killed?" Yang Xin, who was responsible for story mode, didn't know the monster characteristics, and she herself hadn't survived more than 20 days in the game, so she found Ruan Ningxue's reaction strange.</p>
<p>But the next moment, she understood.</p>
<p>After the red Hound died, a ball of flames appeared in its place.</p>
<p>Then, with Ruan Ningxue's ashen face, the large fire began to spread.</p>
<p>Pig Houses, Berry Bushes, saplings... until the large fire consumed two-thirds of the base's area.</p>
<p>The burning structures, the scorching flames, horizontally and vertically, screamed 'despair'.</p>
<p>Yang Xin and the others standing behind them also shook their heads in lament.</p>
<p>And this tragic scene was, in fact, something most players had encountered in Don't Starve.</p>
<p>Dying from some accident was fine; after all, death ends all troubles. The truly tragic thing was having one's base reduced to nothing due to some unforeseen accident.</p>
<p>In such a situation, it perfectly demonstrated what it meant for it to be better to die than to live.</p>
<p>"I'm not playing anymore, I'm tired..." Watching the still-burning screen, Ruan Ningxue silently exited the game using Alt+F4.</p>
<p>"This game is always full of surprises, just like life," Chen Xu said with a smile, having just arrived at the rest area to take a break and witnessing Ruan Ningxue's complete mental breakdown.</p>
<p>A very philosophical statement, but everyone present rolled their eyes.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Chen, recently many Game Designers in the industry have been discussing our Don't Starve and the topic of sandbox games. It feels like a large wave of sandbox games is about to erupt!" Qin Yi said, recalling something, to Chen Xu.</p>
<p>"I've been paying attention, but their focus is a bit off," Chen Xu nodded, then shook his head.</p>
<p>"Their focus is off?" Hearing Chen Xu's words, everyone showed curious expressions.</p>
<p>"What do you all think is the core point of sandbox games?" Chen Xu asked.</p>
<p>"Survival and freedom?"</p>
<p>"No, I think it should be collecting and survival in equal measure."</p>
<p>Everyone discussed amongst themselves.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu didn't wait for them to summarize and directly continued his answer: "Creation! That is the core of sandbox games."</p>
<p>"Creativity, from which exploration derives, is the core gameplay of sandbox games. Simply put, it's about letting players use the resources and materials provided by the game to create what they want, and then use what they've created to explore a vaster world," Chen Xu said, looking at everyone.</p>
<p>From Chen Xu's perspective, based on his previous life, the current discussions in the game industry all had some truth to them, but none were entirely correct.</p>
<p>Instead, they leaned more towards being a part of the elements of box garden games and open-world games. As for sandbox games, although Don't Starve gave players a strong survival objective, its core philosophy was indeed creation arising from survival.</p>
<p>Survival was merely a strong objective to keep players from feeling lost.</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu's words, everyone looked as if they understood a little but not entirely.</p>
<p>"You'll understand what I mean when the next game is developed," Chen Xu chuckled.</p>
<p>Next game?</p>
<p>Everyone got excited.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, already?" Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin were both shocked.</p>
<p>After all, Don't Starve had only launched less than two weeks ago!</p>
<p>"Compared to Don't Starve, the development cycle for the new project will be longer. For the next few months before the New Year, our work will focus on the new game. Of course, I'm just letting you know now; if you have any questions, you can raise them during the meeting. For now, everyone's main task is to manage Don't Starve's MOD operations well and simultaneously develop subsequent DLCs," Chen Xu stated.</p>
