                <p>Chapter 375: Players in Uproar (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Gazing at the morning sun and that one deer, Song Ren, who had always considered himself a tough guy, a stark contrast to his name, was now utterly choked with sobs, fully demonstrating what it meant for a tough man to cry.</p>
<p>Throughout the game, when Arthur was diagnosed with tuberculosis, Song Ren was merely shocked. Moreover, this news only came in the mid-to-late stages of the game, and as the story progressed, Song Ren felt he had prepared himself for anything. He believed he wouldn't be emotionally overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Yet, in the short ending sequence, which lasted less than half an hour, he was emotionally overwhelmed three times in a row. The first was the scene of Arthur riding his beloved horse to the camp, accompanied by a flashback and sentimental background music, which immediately brought tears to his eyes. The second was during Arthur's escape, when his beloved horse left him forever, and Arthur tenderly stroked his horse – that scene also completely broke Song Ren down. And finally, Arthur handed his cowboy hat to Marston, staying behind alone to quietly die on the cliff. Three consecutive emotional breakdowns.</p>
<p>Although the game hadn't truly ended, switching instead to John Marston, implying there was more to come, Song Ren no longer cared at that moment, or at least, not for now.</p>
<p>The storyline of Red Dead Redemption was incredibly long. During this time, Song Ren hadn't gone fishing, hunting, or played Texas Hold'em. Aside from occasionally helping strangers he encountered on the road, he had primarily focused on advancing the main quest. Even so, he had spent nearly 40 hours.</p>
<p>The subsequent gameplay would clearly be from John Marston's perspective, revealing to players the ultimate fate of the Van der Linde gang, the gang Arthur had dedicated his entire life to, after Arthur's death. However, Song Ren had completely lost his patience. He eagerly exited the game and then opened Chen Xu's official Weibo account, because his resentment was practically overflowing.</p>
<p>"What about the promised good ending?" Along the way, he had actively helped anyone in distress and greeted everyone he saw on the street. He had literally completed "Wilderness Greetings." His honor value was full before his death, all because he wanted to achieve a good ending. But in the end, Arthur lay on a cliff, watching his last sunrise – was this the so-called good ending?</p>
<p>It wasn't just Song Ren; many players, after experiencing this storyline, logged onto Weibo and @-mentioned Chen Xu. After dozens of hours playing as Arthur and experiencing so much in the Western world, it could be said that most players had developed an emotional connection with the character. But for it to end like this, it truly felt like a heart attack!</p>
<p>Chen Xu's official Weibo account was filled with players discussing the ending.
"I swear I've fucked a Chihuahua five times over, is this what they call a good ending?"
"I feel like I've been screwed over too. I thought the ending would be Arthur and Sadie forming a team, or perhaps him retiring to the countryside with Mary, but in the end, Arthur died on a mountaintop!"
"Damn it, at least you died on a mountaintop watching the sunrise. I chose the option to get the money, and in the end, Micah stabbed me to death with a knife!"
"Don't even talk about being stabbed to death by that dog Micah; you must have done all sorts of bad things!"
"I chose to go into the cave for the money in the end, and then watched the sunrise at the camp."
"Stop talking about it, we all died anyway. One was killed by that dog Micah, the other died watching the sunrise."
"I can tolerate anything, but being killed by that dog Micah? That's intolerable!"</p>
<p>"Damn it! Just thinking that Micah and Dutch are still alive in the end, I can't stand it!"
"+1! Knife in hand, kill Micah!"</p>
<p>Below Chen Xu's official Weibo, the players' reactions were nothing short of an uproar. Before this, many players had subconsciously assumed there would be two different endings in the game: a good ending where Arthur lived and retired from the outlaw life, and a bad ending involving death. Even when Arthur contracted tuberculosis, players were still fantasizing that in a good ending, Arthur could live out his golden years peacefully.</p>
<p>Although tuberculosis was a terminal illness, with good care, he could at least live for many more years. However, they never expected that the game actually had four endings, and in all of them, Arthur would ultimately face death. Two of these were high-honor endings after doing good deeds: helping John Marston escape, Arthur would fight Micah and then die watching the sunrise. Choosing to go into the cave for money would also lead to being ambushed by Micah, fighting him, and then quietly dying while watching the sunrise. But the bad endings made many grit their teeth, as Arthur would either be shot in the head by Micah or stabbed to death with a knife. Especially when Micah plunged the knife into Arthur's back, many players felt it wasn't Micah stabbing Arthur, but Chen Xu stabbing them.</p>
<p>………………
Inside Nebula Games' office, with the New Year not far off and most of the online mode-related work already completed, everyone in the team was relatively relaxed at this stage. In the lounge, Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and Qin Yi sat beside Chen Xu, each holding their phones and tablets, scrolling through players' comments online.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, look at this fan-made comic strip a player drew for you online!" Ruan Ningxue chuckled, turning her tablet sideways. Chen Xu, leaning back in his chair, glanced at it and was instantly speechless. The title of the work was 'Warrior of Love,' but the content of the drawing...</p>
<p>The first panel showed a cartoon version of Chen Xu wearing a cowboy hat, dressed as a Western cowboy, pulling a revolver from his pocket. The second panel depicted the Dead Eye mode from Red Dead Redemption, but this time, many more people appeared before the drawn Chen Xu. Upon closer inspection, they were Johnny and Liva from To the Moon; Emile from Valiant Hearts: The Great War; Soap, Ghost, Roach, and others from Task Force 141; in addition to a series of games Chen Xu had developed, such as Outlast, Silent Hill, and Dark Souls. Below, different attributes were also marked: for example, To the Moon, Valiant Hearts, and Call of Duty were marked as magic damage; Dark Souls and Monster Hunter were marked as physical damage; while Outlast and Silent Hill were marked as true damage.</p>
<p>Turning to the third panel, which featured Overcooked and It Takes Two, it was directly labeled as a "dimension-reducing strike." In the fan art, Chen Xu directly broke the fourth wall, aiming his revolver at the player in front of the computer.</p>
<p>"What does this show? It shows that my love for players is profound, and players' love for me is also profound. Have you ever seen other game designers become the subject of secondary fan creations by players? It's unique in the gaming industry!" Chen Xu lightly coughed and said. At this point, he didn't bother saying that players misunderstood him too deeply. After all, within the company, they were all "their own people," and he figured no one would believe that line of reasoning after so many years.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, Yang Xin and the others pursed their lips. "Bluffing, keep bluffing."</p>
<p>"But I should still respond to the players; after all, this commotion is making my little heart a bit flustered," Chen Xu sighed, opened his official Weibo, and posted a message. "Please savor it quietly; I believe the final ending will satisfy everyone." After sending it, Chen Xu stopped looking.</p>
<p>(End of Chapter)
