<p>Chapter 781: And So the Boy Met the Girl</p>
<p>Controlling Rex and his party as they rushed towards the location of the final Aegis, Song Ren’s mind was still replaying Nia's performance in the illusion from before.</p>
<p>It was truly tragic; the game constantly persecuted Nia.</p>
<p>But thinking about it the other way, there's always a cause for every effect, right?</p>
<p>Look at how Pyra/Mythra, the Aegis of the Sky, appeared, and then look at you, Nia, with your tomboyish short hair and yellow robes.</p>
<p>If you had revealed your Blade form from the start, there wouldn't have been any fuss about the Aegis of the Sky!</p>
<p>Song Ren was filled with emotion, and in the game, Rex, Pyra/Mythra, and the others had already arrived at the Aegis's hangar.</p>
<p>The system's prompt also confirmed his guess: this was the final battle of the game.</p>
<p>The Aegis mech was level 70, but because Song Ren had been grinding for quite some time during the game, the group, led by Rex, had already reached nearly level 80. Combined with a very obvious level suppression in the game and the fact that he wasn't playing on Extreme difficulty, this Aegis mech wasn't even as tough as that gorilla in Gormott.</p>
<p>Facing Rex, who was truly in sync with the Aegis of the Sky and linked to the power of the Conduit, Malos, even with the Aegis, was no match.</p>
<p>Before his final demise, Malos finally understood the meaning of his existence. He had been indoctrinated with the idea of destroying the world by Maipeni, who hated the world after losing his mother, and unconsciously, Malos had come to accept him.</p>
<p>'If only I had met you sooner, perhaps I would have seen all sorts of worlds...'</p>
<p>His Core Crystal shattered, Malos lay on the ground, looking up at the sky.</p>
<p>'If I were your Driver.' Looking at Malos on the ground, Rex felt a profound sadness.</p>
<p>Although they had faced many enemies along the way, everyone had their own hardships. However, the mistakes had been made, and they all paid the price with their lives.</p>
<p>But if there had been no Maipeni, could all of this have changed?</p>
<p>He couldn't forgive Malos, and he couldn't forgive Jin either.</p>
<p>Yet, the inherently kind Rex couldn't help but wonder what Malos would be like now if his Driver hadn't been Maipeni.</p>
<p>Would this world have become better?</p>
<p>'Hah, kid, don't say such disgusting things... My Driver was that guy, but even so... it wasn't bad.'</p>
<p>With Malos's death, the massive fluctuations from the battle caused the World Tree to begin collapsing, and if the World Tree sank, the entire Alrest would be destroyed.</p>
<p>As everyone panicked, Pyra/Mythra bit her lip and told them the solution was in the control room five floors below.</p>
<p>But as Rex and the others rushed downstairs, Pyra/Mythra also called out to Azurda and Poppi. She injected her power into Azurda's Core Crystal, restoring his strength, and told Poppi her wish.</p>
<p>It was only then that Rex and the others, who had rushed to the door, realized something was wrong. This wasn't the control room; it was the harbor!</p>
<p>There, Pyra/Mythra had already blown up the bridge, severed the life-sharing link that connected their destinies, and passed her complete Core Crystal to Rex.</p>
<p>'You alone, you'll be fine now, right...?'</p>
<p>As the World Tree collapsed, Pyra/Mythra, beyond the broken bridge and its many obstacles, had vanished.</p>
<p>Watching this, Song Ren curled his toes in apprehension.</p>
<p>"What does this mean!? What does this mean? Mr. Chen, you're going to make us suffer again!?"</p>
<p>Seeing this scene, Song Ren remembered the content from the previous PV.</p>
<p>Isn't this that very scene from before?</p>
<p>Really sticking to your original intentions, huh!?"</p>
<p>Listening to the game's theme song, accompanied by the scrolling credits and the epilogue scene fragments, Song Ren sighed softly.</p>
<p>The Conduit had vanished from this universe, and the world would be reformed.</p>
<p>The Cloud Sea disappeared, continents and oceans reappeared, and the Titans merged with the land to form new continents.</p>
<p>Without the protection of the gods, the fragile yet resilient newborn humans faced their true test.</p>
<p>But Rex, standing on Azurda, hadn't noticed that a single spark, falling gently from the distant sky, silently landed on the Core Crystal in his hand.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the Core Crystal in his hand burst forth with green light. Accompanied by dazzling radiance, two figures slowly appeared in front of Azurda—Pyra and Mythra.</p>
<p>Seeing Pyra and Mythra suddenly appear, everyone's faces lit up with surprise. Poppi, the mech girl, happily rushed over and hugged Pyra and Mythra.</p>
<p>Rex, still dumbfounded, was nudged by his companions from behind and walked towards Pyra and Mythra.</p>
<p>The next second, the screen before Song Ren turned black.</p>
<p>【And So the Boy Met the Girl】</p>
<p>This was truly the end. The darkness receded, returning to the game's initial main menu.</p>
<p>And then, Song Ren was astonished to find that the main menu's background had changed.</p>
<p>It was the grassland where Rex first met Pyra, only this time Mythra was also by Rex's side, in addition to Pyra.</p>
<p>After about ten seconds, Pyra, Mythra, and Rex on the main screen turned around, and everyone showed surprised expressions, raising their hands in greeting.</p>
<p>From a distance, Nia ran over and embraced everyone.</p>
<p>"This story... it's really good. Finally, no more suffering," Song Ren couldn't help but exclaim.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>The ending of 'Xenoblade Chronicles' also sparked countless discussions among players, or rather, the characters in the game sparked heated discussions among players.</p>
<p>As for the game's plot, it's a very pure classic shonen anime-style story.</p>
<p>It was only because it was a Nebula Games production that many players felt a pang in their hearts when Malos bid farewell to Rex.</p>
<p>But setting aside Mr. Chen's so-called 'aura of love,' the ending of 'Xenoblade Chronicles' wasn't entirely unexpected. More impactful, perhaps, was the shock delivered by the game's world-building.</p>
<p>Compared to the story, it was the individual characters in the game that left a deeper impression on players.</p>
<p>There was Mòrag, whom Poppi called completely unfeminine; Zeke, the unlucky chuuni patient; Tora's family, three generations all hentai; Rex, the simple and kind boy who always pushed forward; and Pyra/Mythra, who feared her own power and couldn't face herself.</p>
<p>However, some players expressed different opinions about the ending. Some argued that if the ending had been a tragedy, with Pyra/Mythra not returning, the overall scope of the story would have risen slightly, at least it wouldn't be so 'clichéd'.</p>
<p>Of course, after these players voiced their suggestions, they were immediately attacked by other players.</p>
<p>After all, how could they not suffer a few 'knives' from Mr. Chen's games every year?</p>
<p>Finally, there was a game with a happy reunion ending, and the protagonist also had a good outcome, yet some still wanted to persecute the protagonist.</p>
<p>If you really want to persecute someone, go persecute Nia!</p>
<p>Reading this, for players who loved Nia, there was only a feeling of being utterly bewildered.</p>
<p>Yet, they couldn't say a word.</p>
<p>During the time 'Xenoblade Chronicles' was online, many memes also circulated.</p>
<p>For example, Tora's family, three generations all hentai, and 'Uncle Black welcomes you'...</p>
<p>But nothing could ever shake Nia's position.</p>
<p>From the very first encounter with Zeke and her calling him 'turtle-head', to later even adding a line to Nia's actions at the time: 'Take your Pyra and get lost!'.</p>
<p>It could be said that the persecution never stopped. Later, the line in Spirit Crucible, 'I love Nia and everyone (else)', became a classic iconic scene.</p>
<p>Some players even directly renamed Nia. What's Nia's full name? Of course, it's Nia-Haiyou Dajia.</p>
<p>As for the combined sword technique that increased endurance, and the 'loser'-like dialogue in the illusion, they pushed Nia's persecution to the extreme.</p>
<p>However, even with all this, players still didn't stop persecuting Nia.</p>
<p>On the main menu after clearing the game, which originally showed Nia happily reuniting with Rex and Pyra/Mythra, some players directly chose to rewind the playback.</p>
<p>And so, it became a scene where the four were originally together, and then Nia was directly sent away by Rex, Pyra, and Mythra. What's more, as she was being sent off, Rex and the others even waved goodbye, making the scene extremely comical.</p>
