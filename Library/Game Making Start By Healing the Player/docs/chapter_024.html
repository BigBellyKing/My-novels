                <p>Chapter 24: Clearly, It's the Players' Love! (Please recommend, collect, and vote for monthly tickets)</p>
<p>It had been quite some time, but Jiang Ping still hadn't recovered from the Genocide Route ending.</p>
<p>He still only half-understood the game's story. But that wasn't important; what mattered was the intense oppression he felt right now.</p>
<p>The Genocide ending truly made him feel terrible. Yes, he regretted it.</p>
<p>It was just like when he played <em>Mirror (Game)</em>; at first, he was full of enthusiasm, but then, after finding it dull, he began to regret why he had even started the game.</p>
<p>Now, after completing <em>Undertale</em>'s Genocide ending, he felt the same way.</p>
<p>No matter what, having played through the Genocide ending, he truly regretted it.</p>
<p>He missed the scenes of laughing with his friends in Pacifist Mode, watching Undyne burn down the kitchen, seeing Papyrus tell his terrible jokes, and eating Toriel's pie.</p>
<p>“Let's create a perfect save file again and put a proper end to this game.”</p>
<p>Recalling everything in his mind, Jiang Ping took a deep breath and reopened the game.</p>
<p>He wanted to play through the perfect Pacifist Ending once more.</p>
<p>With his previous experience, Jiang Ping was very skilled this time.</p>
<p>He remembered many of the monsters and simply chose the correct dialogue options.</p>
<p>Finally, after defeating Asriel and watching the sunset, a faint smile appeared on Jiang Ping's face.</p>
<p>No matter what, everything was now in the past.</p>
<p>However, the very next moment, the scene in the game left him completely stunned.</p>
<p>In the dead of night, the protagonist was sleeping in their room.</p>
<p>Just then, the door was gently pushed open. Toriel came in with a cream cinnamon pie, placed it softly on the floor, and then closed the door.</p>
<p>It looked incredibly warm and cozy, but the next second, the seemingly sleeping protagonist suddenly sat up from the bed.</p>
<p>It was Chara's face, with a bizarre and evil expression.</p>
<p>The next moment, that sinister and evil laughter echoed through his headphones.</p>
<p>Leaving the room, a black and white photo appeared. It was a group picture of the protagonist and their friends from the Underground.</p>
<p>But now, everyone except the protagonist had a blood-red cross marked over their heads.</p>
<p>Immediately, the game screen vanished.</p>
<p>Sitting in front of his computer, Jiang Ping's eyes were wide open.</p>
<p>Having only previously looked at guides on how to unlock the Genocide ending, he finally understood why the author of that post had advised against playing the Genocide ending, warning that one would regret it.</p>
<p>He also finally understood the meaning of some of the enigmatic phrases he'd seen in the positive game reviews earlier.</p>
<p>【When did <em>this world</em> become yours to command?】</p>
<p>Chara's words from before seemed to echo in his ears once more.</p>
<p>Jiang Ping stared blankly at the <em>Undertale</em> interface on the screen.</p>
<p>He had already grasped the profound meaning of this game—or rather, its ‘malice’!</p>
<p>Like most games, you harm the monsters, then delete your save, start a new one, and continue to live happily ever after with them, pretending as if nothing just happened?</p>
<p>Haha, what kind of joke are you playing? Don't dream about it!</p>
<p>It's like a mirror; once broken, even if mended perfectly, cracks will still remain.</p>
<p>Since you've already chosen to slaughter those monsters, how could it possibly let you live happily ever after with them again?</p>
<p>In the dead of night, that corrupted save file you deleted earlier returns like a lingering ghost, tearing apart your self-proclaimed peace and happiness.</p>
<p>Finally, that eerie laughter and the black-and-white photo.</p>
<p>Although not a single word was spoken, Jiang Ping felt an immense sense of irony.</p>
<p>It was a mockery directed at him, sitting in front of the computer.</p>
<p>It was as if someone was shouting into a megaphone right next to his ear.</p>
<p>‘Stop pretending, you hypocrite!’</p>
<p>Couldn't all of this be changed?</p>
<p>Jiang Ping looked at the closed game and pursed his lips.</p>
<p>He logged into the <em>Undertale</em>-related game community.</p>
<p>As he expected, besides posts discussing the game's content, characters, and story,</p>
<p>there were also many inquiries about the very problem he was facing.</p>
<p>‘Big shots, does anyone know how to return to the good ending?’</p>
<p>‘Same here, same here, tons of requests! I impulsively played the Genocide ending, and I regret it. I want to go back to the past!’</p>
<p>‘Even though it feels like I'm fooling myself, I still want to go back to the past!’</p>
<p>‘Deleting the game, registering a new account to buy the game with an alt account—none of it works!’</p>
<p>Seeing the countless posts, Jiang Ping felt a little better.</p>
<p>After all, he wasn't the only one.</p>
<p>Searching through various posts, Jiang Ping finally found an accurate answer.</p>
<p>‘The corrupted game save directly overwrites the cloud save and system files, so you need to tackle it from two sides: directly reinstall your operating system, then register an alt account and buy <em>Undertale</em>. That way, it'll be a brand new game. Of course, don't log in with your old account, or it will detect it and turn back into a corrupted save!’</p>
<p>So that's how it is!</p>
<p>Jiang Ping suddenly understood and quickly made a decision.</p>
<p>Of course, he wasn't going to reinstall his operating system. After all, he had saved a lot of 'learning materials from teachers' on it, and some of them no longer had fast download speeds online.</p>
<p>Moreover, he had always used his C drive for everything, never partitioning his hard drive.</p>
<p>So, reinstalling the system was out of the question.</p>
<p>Knowing the principle, he could just buy the game again on another computer.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>In Nebula Games' office, Yang Xin had an excited look on her face.</p>
<p>“It's broken 500,000! And it's been less than half a month!”</p>
<p>On the computer in front of Yang Xin, the cumulative sales of <em>Undertale</em> across various game stores were displayed.</p>
<p>After its word-of-mouth explosion, major platforms had basically placed <em>Undertale</em> on their front-page recommendation lists.</p>
<p>As for the official platform, because its recommendation mechanism relied on big data and was relatively inefficient, even if it were to be featured, it would generally be next week.</p>
<p>Of the current 500,000 sales, seventy percent came from third-party platforms.</p>
<p>“However, it seems quite a few players have contributed a second sale!” Chen Xu said, looking at the backend data, equally surprised.</p>
<p>Because he noticed that many of the purchase records indicated that <em>Undertale</em> was the first game bought by those accounts.</p>
<p>“Exactly, many players, out of curiosity, played the Genocide ending. As a result, to feel better about themselves, they chose to buy a second copy,” Yang Xin said, clearly more concerned about this game than Chen Xu.</p>
<p>“Isn't that just burying one's head in the sand?” Ruan Ningxue, standing nearby, commented.</p>
<p>“How is this burying one's head in the sand? Clearly, it's the players' immense love for our game,” Chen Xu mused, then concluded.</p>
<p>“First, let's release the sales figures to add more fuel to the game's popularity.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Chen Xu also logged into his official Weibo account.</p>
<p>Thanks to the previous hype and the overwhelmingly positive reviews for <em>Undertale</em>, his official Weibo account followers had finally surpassed 300,000.</p>
<p>It couldn't compare to renowned game producers with millions of followers, but at least he had gained some recognition.</p>
<p>Of course, more importantly, there was finally a more detailed introduction beneath the small lightning bolt icon.</p>
<p>‘Game Producer, Representative Work: <em>Undertale</em>’</p>
<p>Before, there was only the small lightning bolt icon, followed by just five characters: '游戏制作人' (Game Producer).</p>
<p>After all, while <em>Mirror (Game)</em> had explosive sales, its genre was quite niche!</p>
