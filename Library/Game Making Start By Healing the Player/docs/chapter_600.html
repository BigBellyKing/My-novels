                <p>Chapter 599: This is more assassin-like than an assassin! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>As the game continued to progress, Li Yue also began to experience more of the game's core gameplay content.</p>
<p>First off, it was the supplies. In the game, Joel originally planned to leave the quarantine zone's blockade line with Tess. However, they happened to encounter an attack by the resistance group, the Fireflies, which led to a complete lockdown of the entire quarantine zone. As a result, Tess and the others had no choice but to take an alternative route, a secret hideout belonging to their smuggler network. Here, players would unlock the inventory system for supplies, but Li Yue could clearly feel that this system was primarily designed to enhance immersion. The resources provided were simply too scarce. A backpack, a pistol, a gas mask, and a pathetic four bullets. It could be said that resources were extremely limited, even worse than the initial stages of the earlier <em>Resident Evil</em>. Clearly, resource management would be a core aspect of <em>The Last of Us</em>. If players didn't deliberately scavenge for bullets and other items, the in-game bullets would barely be enough. This further solidified Li Yue's previous thoughts. Besides being a resource management mechanic, the scarcity of supplies was even more importantly meant to allow players to immerse themselves in the game's setting. With scarce resources and an apocalyptic backdrop, what kind of story was this game actually telling? And what did Sarah's death in the prologue signify? If Sarah wasn't the girl from the previous promotional trailer, then how did Joel meet the girl named Ellie?</p>
<p>Carrying these doubts, Li Yue controlled Joel and Tess as they continued forward. This part of their journey still felt like a tutorial. For example, finding a way out was almost like another form of puzzle-solving, similar to <em>Uncharted</em>, or rather, many games use this mechanic. In each scene, players had to find items that could help them reach the path ahead, or cooperate with Tess to climb to higher ground. Players could also collect resources to craft tools or upgrade firearms. The gameplay itself could be described as very traditional; for any player who had experienced similar games, there was no difficulty in understanding or grasping how to play. There were both positives and negatives to this. The good aspect was that players didn't have to overthink the gameplay, allowing them to focus more on the story. The downside was that if the game's narrative experience wasn't outstanding, this traditional gameplay could become a point deduction. After all, Li Yue was participating in this game review, so he was playing the game while simultaneously contemplating the pros, cons, and reasons behind various game settings.</p>
<p>Although the gameplay leaned towards the traditional, the character development, at least so far, had left a deep impression on Li Yue regarding Joel’s companion named Tess. Her past was unknown, but her personality was clearly showcased through these puzzle levels. She was a trustworthy, tough woman, capable of even grabbing Joel with one hand and pulling him up a step, demonstrating her significant strength. As they moved forward, dialogues with Tess along the way also revealed more of the game’s background to the players. The virus in <em>The Last of Us</em> was known as the Cordyceps fungus. This was a spore-based virus that essentially parasitized humans. It could make infected individuals progressively stronger, even evolving into Clickers, who lost their sight but gained enhanced hearing. However, the infection process was extremely painful and incurable, so many infected individuals often chose to end their own lives. Furthermore, infected beings, if they died and reached a certain stage, would release spores from their bodies. If normal people absorbed too many of these spores, they would also become infected, necessitating the use of gas masks in certain areas.</p>
<p>In the secret passage used by smugglers like Joel, Joel and Tess encountered another smuggler during their advance. However, the man was in a dire situation; his gas mask was broken, and he was pinned to the ground by a metal cabinet, unable to move. Seeing Joel and Tess, the smuggler begged for their help. But with his gas mask already destroyed, he clearly faced only one outcome: becoming an Infected. At this point, players could only do two things: leave him to his fate, or give him a 'bullet', helping him find a better release.</p>
<p>Advancing further, they faced the game's combat levels. However, it was different from what Li Yue had expected. <em>The Last of Us</em>' combat system was quite unique: more realistic, and more tense. In the game, these initial infected are called Runners. Just like their name suggests, these infected are very agile, and typically several are found in one area. Once attracted, they will swarm you. Therefore, players need to use stealth to avoid them or covertly assassinate them. Of course, infected in the game are also divided into common and special types. Common infected can be eliminated directly through stealth assassinations. However, some special elite monsters require the use of the equipment crafting system to create switchblades to kill them. Additionally, there are interactive items on the ground like bricks, bottles, and steel pipes that can be picked up and used as temporary weapons. This aspect is somewhat similar to <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, where various weapons dropped on the ground can be used. Of course, besides these most distinctive points in the game, there was also the Listen Mode. Upon entering Listen Mode, Joel would slowly crouch down, and then, as if gaining x-ray vision, he could perceive the enemies' locations based on their movements. Naturally, there was a certain distance limit. Coupled with the silent assassination system and the scarce resources, the game's combat system became self-evident. It aimed for players to adopt assassination and stealth methods for gameplay. When you think about it, this was quite reasonable. After all, this was an apocalyptic setting, and Joel was just a slightly stronger smuggler, not an Assassin Master like Ezio or Altaïr.</p>
<p>Li Yue, in the game, tried both stealth and Musou-style gameplay. The stealth combat system went very smoothly. But trying to go 'Musou-style' with a brick, even on normal difficulty, led to him being taught a lesson by a group of Runners. If there were only one or two, Joel might be able to fight them off with a brick. But the crucial point was that other Runners in the game would immediately come to their aid upon hearing any commotion. At that point, if Joel couldn't escape, he was basically dead.</p>
<p>“This feels even more like an assassin game than <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>!” Li Yue carefully snuck through the zombie-infested building, sighing with emotion inwardly. While <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> offered stylish assassination gameplay, it could also be played as a single hidden blade conquering the world. But in <em>The Last of Us</em>, at least for now, trying to conquer the world with just one gun and one brick felt a bit too optimistic.</p>
<p>However, despite the sentiments, the combat system itself wasn't bad. The Listen Mode, akin to x-ray vision, and stealth assassination gameplay weren't particularly novel. But combined with the apocalyptic setting, scarce resources, and unlimited makeshift weapons like bricks, it perfectly conveyed the thrilling and tense atmosphere of a post-apocalyptic world. At least when he was just playing, he hadn't even thought about anything outside the game.
