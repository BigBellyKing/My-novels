                <p>Chapter 609: The Chef Shoved the Flatbread Directly into Their Mouths! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>“A purely story-driven interactive cinematic game?”</p>
<p>“Three artificial androids as protagonists?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, this game…”</p>
<p>In the conference room, looking at the design draft Chen Xu provided, Qin Yi, Meng Zuo, and the others were all surprised.</p>
<p>Initially, when they heard Chen Xu talking about Artificial Intelligence discussions, they thought it would be an FPS and action-adventure type of game.</p>
<p>After all, robot rebellion, then humanity rising up to fight back, and then revealing deeper content—isn't that the mainstream for such sci-fi themes?</p>
<p>But clearly, the genre of this Detroit: Become Human was completely different from what they had imagined.</p>
<p>“As I said before, it’s more of a practice for new operating modules, including how to most accurately capture player information and the feedback from various in-game options. That’s what Detroit: Become Human is designed to do,” Chen Xu told the group.</p>
<p>For him, Detroit: Become Human was primarily about the new technology’s operating methods.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Online, the buzz surrounding The Last of Us had completely cooled down.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, projects supported by new technology from various game developers became a hot topic.</p>
<p>As news about new games from different developers trickled out, even without any concrete revelations, it still attracted a lot of player attention.</p>
<p>After all, unlike before, the new technology offering a different kind of game operating experience was indeed something many players were incredibly interested in.</p>
<p>Besides the games currently under development, performance reviews of various models of domestic and international equipment from device manufacturers also captivated many players.</p>
<p>However, what left many players puzzled was how Nebula Games managed to keep so quiet.</p>
<p>Not a single crumb of news was revealed.</p>
<p>It could be said that many players were stomping their feet in impatience.</p>
<p>After all, as a developer known for making grand promises, when there was news, they usually had to wait a long time, let alone now when not even a hint of anything had been seen.</p>
<p>But this time, it was genuinely different from before.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>In Nebula World, Song Ren logged into the game as usual, preparing to grind a bit in Bloodborne.</p>
<p>Compared to Dark Souls, Bloodborne had now become his favorite new obsession.</p>
<p>As for why?</p>
<p>Because Bloodborne had a special mechanic: Chalice Dungeons.</p>
<p>After defeating the Blood-starved Beast BOSS, Chalice Dungeons would unlock. Also, many veteran players had specifically created dungeons where one could farm Blood Echoes and gems.</p>
<p>So, in the game, he could quickly build up a fully developed character.</p>
<p>On a new first playthrough account, he would max out all attributes to 99, fill all gem slots for damage, and experience the thrill of hitting 9999 with one strike.</p>
<p>You might ask, what's the point of that?</p>
<p>Song Ren could only say, it was extremely fun.</p>
<p>However, today when he logged into Nebula World, he noticed something different.</p>
<p>His in-game butler, Chloe, was behaving a little unusually.</p>
<p>Every player entering Nebula World had a common NPC butler: Chloe.</p>
<p>A blonde beauty, whom players could freely dress up.</p>
<p>Previously, Chloe's behavior, though seemingly lively, had a somewhat robotic quality.</p>
<p>But now, Song Ren found it to be a little different.</p>
<p>‘We’ve been together for a while, and I’ve been wondering… are we friends?’</p>
<p>As Song Ren entered Nebula World, preparing to use the portal to start Bloodborne and experience the stress relief of a max-level veteran invading a newbie village, Chloe, the young lady standing at the entrance, tilted her head and asked.</p>
<p>“Eh… brand new dialogue!” Song Ren seemed a little surprised.</p>
<p>He had noticed when he logged in earlier that Nebula World had a big update.</p>
<p>So, this was an update for Chloe, but there was no list of changes.</p>
<p>Song Ren was a little puzzled, but he quickly responded.</p>
<p>“Of course… we’re friends, of course.”</p>
<p>Listening to Song Ren’s answer, a faint smile appeared on Chloe’s face.</p>
<p>He wasn’t sure if it was an illusion, but Song Ren felt that Chloe’s smile seemed more lifelike now.</p>
<p>Chloe always maintained a smile before, but now?</p>
<p>How to put it?</p>
<p>He felt she possessed more of a human touch.</p>
<p>‘I agree. There’s no reason humans and machines can’t be friends, right?’</p>
<p>‘What I wanted to say is… well, I’m very happy you answered [yes].’</p>
<p>Chloe smiled happily.</p>
<p>‘Then, would you like to know our story… the story of androids?’</p>
<p>Looking at Song Ren, Chloe slowly retracted the smile from her face.</p>
<p>“Wait, Chloe’s story? The story of androids? Is this new game content?” Song Ren was suddenly stunned as something dawned on him.</p>
<p>‘Thank you… but please consider carefully. The life and future of androids are all in your hands.’</p>
<p>Accompanying Chloe’s words, a prompt box appeared before Song Ren.</p>
<p>[Detected device connected to signal controller. You can now enter the new world, Detroit: Become Human (Demo Version). Would you like to proceed?]</p>
<p>“Holy cow, it really is a new game!?” Song Ren was utterly shocked.</p>
<p>This was too fast!</p>
<p>This time, Nebula Games and Mr. Chen hadn’t just made grand promises!</p>
<p>While other game designers and developers were still researching how to implement new control schemes and what features they might have, Mr. Chen had already finished the game!?</p>
<p>It was well-known that Nebula Games and Chen Xu were famous for making grand promises.</p>
<p>And in recent years, those promises had become increasingly perplexing.</p>
<p>But now, without a sound, a new game was directly launched?</p>
<p>It was like the chef directly shoved the freshly baked flatbread into their mouths!</p>
<p>It was a little unbelievable, and even quite hot to the touch!</p>
<p>As a player who had enthusiastically bought the device at launch, only to find that there wasn't even an application, let alone a game, Song Ren immediately became excited after seeing the news about Detroit: Become Human.</p>
<p>The device wasn't bought for nothing!</p>
<p>Even if it was just a demo, he could still actually try it out!</p>
<p>The only question was what kind of game this mysterious title would be.</p>
<p>“Become Human”—did that mean the protagonists in the game weren't human?</p>
<p>And the setting of the story should be Detroit, as indicated by the title.</p>
<p>Song Ren was quite familiar with the city of Detroit.</p>
<p>Once known as the “Motor City,” it eventually went bankrupt.</p>
<p>Many dystopian films and novels would use this city as a prototype.</p>
<p>Looking at Chloe before him, Song Ren thought to himself while confirming the relevant options in Nebula World.</p>
<p>Difficulty? There was no need to even consider it; it would definitely be the easiest.</p>
<p>‘Ready. I will now lead you into the new world. Please remember: our destiny rests in your hands.’</p>
<p>As Chloe spoke with anticipation, Song Ren stepped forward, and everything around him began to transform into data.</p>
<p>Constantly reorganizing, shaping, separating, until the entire environment was completely replaced.</p>
<p>And finally, it settled inside a rising elevator.</p>
