                <p>Chapter 892: Jianghu Isn't Just About Fighting and Killing</p>
<p>It wasn't until the game returned to the main menu interface that Zhang Yi recovered his senses.</p>
<p>What's the most common thing for a game player to do?</p>
<p>Isn't it scavenging for items?</p>
<p>From the flowers and grass by the roadside, the stones, fish, and shrimp in and by the river, to the tables and cabinets of various NPCs—which adventurer hasn't meticulously explored them all?</p>
<p>Even though in some games, such acts of theft might lead to being wanted.</p>
<p>But in <em>this</em> game, what the heck, that's just too much.</p>
<p>Straight to exile to the frontier, and then game over?</p>
<p>However, upon reflection, Zhang Yi felt that the game's approach actually brought a sense of realism.</p>
<p>Why a sense of realism? On one hand, it's due to the game's meticulous reproduction of details, from textures and scenery to architecture, clothing, and even voice acting—everything is as accurate as possible.</p>
<p>Not to mention cities like Kaifeng and Hangzhou in the game, even the antagonist organization, the Anti-Heaven Alliance, has a significant background.</p>
<p>During the Song Dynasty, Go was in its golden age. The game's BOSS, Yi Zun, takes his name from Go (Yi), treating all things as his chess pieces. His four major chess pieces are also named after the Elephant, Rook, Guard, and General from Chinese Chess. Furthermore, various Go puzzles can be found throughout the game world.</p>
<p>Gambling games, Go and chess… a series of elements, integrating various details, ensure players don't feel disconnected and can easily become immersed.</p>
<p>As for the various complex side quests, although most are centered on detective work and puzzle-solving, they span from imperial nobles to rural commoners.</p>
<p>All sorts of cases allow players, in the role of Zhuge Yu, to experience the true reality of the game's setting.</p>
<p>Some cases are familiar to players, such as the Case of Chen Shimei's Execution involving Qin Xianglian and Chen Shimei, while others are minor street cases.</p>
<p>Through these familiar and unfamiliar cases, players also gradually come to understand the actions of the protagonist, Zhuge Yu.</p>
<p>As the son of Zhuge Wei, his father was upright and incorruptible but was framed and died in the imperial court.</p>
<p>Zhuge Yu, as the son, chose another path.</p>
<p>While villains who oppress the good are never few, and corrupt officials who aid evil are not uncommon.</p>
<p>Despite this, there are still good officials like Bao Zheng who uphold justice.</p>
<p>Therefore, through these cases, both familiar and unfamiliar to players, the game primarily showcases Zhuge Yu's character.</p>
<p>Xia (traditional Chinese hero) is not about violating laws with martial arts, but about pursuing justice and fairness—a value system.</p>
<p>Because of this, before meeting Bao Zheng, Zhuge Yu in the game always eradicated evil completely when facing villains. After understanding Bao Zheng's character, he would cooperate with other wrongdoers to capture them and send them to Kaifeng for Bao Zheng's judgment.</p>
<p>For many players, there's usually a peculiar habit: doing unconventional things.</p>
<p>The most noticeable feature is that no matter the game, most players have tried looking up from under a female character's skirt to see what they could find, or tried to actively attack NPCs.</p>
<p>For example, players can do this in games like <em>Dark Souls</em>, <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>, and <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, which makes these games feel very realistic to players.</p>
<p>However, this is also determined by the game's background.</p>
<p>Firstly, <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> don't have protagonists in the strict sense; whether they are good or bad depends entirely on the player.</p>
<p>As for Arthur Morgan in <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, he was also an outlaw initially, and his true good intentions only emerged after returning from Guarma.</p>
<p>Similarly, in <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em>, Geralt of Rivia had clear values from the start, so players couldn't control him to harm ordinary people.</p>
<p>As for <em>Assassin's Creed</em>, memory synchronization also restricted this aspect.</p>
<p>Likewise, in <em>Fate Seeker</em>, Zhuge Yu's restricted behavior also unconsciously gained players' approval.</p>
<p>Committing arson, petty theft—these things can be done.</p>
<p>But the price for doing them is to load a save file.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Nebula Games' first wuxia title, and the second next-gen VR work from Nebula Games—these titles gave <em>Fate Seeker</em> unique characteristics compared to other games.</p>
<p>Overseas, however, while <em>Fate Seeker</em> attracted some attention from international players, it remained relatively difficult for most to understand the game.</p>
<p>More players treated it purely as an action game, much like foreign audiences often view wuxia films as sci-fi films.</p>
<p>Although the game's quality and gameplay were excellent after Chen Xu's improvements compared to the original, <em>Fate Seeker</em> still fell short in terms of popularity.</p>
<p>For domestic players, however, none of these issues existed.</p>
<p>Its excellent quality, combined with a strong wuxia flavor and detective gameplay, not only immersed players but also sparked many interesting topics in player community forums and other places.</p>
<p>“Zhuge Cunfu challenges me… sorry, wrong channel.”</p>
<p>“Wang Situ, is that you?”</p>
<p>“Your testimony contradicts this evidence!”</p>
<p>“2333333, it really feels right! The game has far more problems solved by deduction than by fighting.”</p>
<p>“Honestly, I think it's very realistic. Jianghu isn't just about fighting and killing.”</p>
<p>“At first, I thought it was a wuxia game about quick justice and vengeance, but then I found it was a meticulously deductive reasoning game, and later I discovered it was also a comedy game!”</p>
<p>“Haha, exactly! The game has so many points to ridicule, especially after meeting Gongsun Ce's god-daughter, it's just full of them.”</p>
<p>“The only thing I'm relatively satisfied with is that in <em>Fate Seeker</em>, after romancing all the female protagonists, I finally don't have to be forced to choose just one.”</p>
<p>“Exactly! Ren Amamiya's regret from <em>Persona</em> is finally resolved. I guess it's truly an ancient setting.”</p>
<p>“Bro above, do you think it's <em>just</em> an ancient setting? Think about it carefully: what's Ren Amamiya's status, and what's my Zhuge Yu's status? You want to start a harem? Do you even have the capability? Be more realistic, first understand the concept of a harem.”</p>
<p>“Couldn't agree more! Although Ren Amamiya's appearance is unremarkable, my Zhuge Yu isn't bad either. You, Ren Amamiya, formed the Phantom Thieves to save the world, and I, Zhuge Yu, also dismantled the Anti-Heaven Alliance to save the nation. In terms of looks and ability, we're evenly matched. But in other aspects, Ren Amamiya, you're far behind! A country boy comes to the city to work in a coffee shop, and your only presentable connections are a former political senator, a current ordinary investigator, and the wealthy socialite Haru. And what about my Zhuge Yu's background and connections? A descendant of a prestigious family, a close friend of the great hero Zhan Zhao, connected to renowned righteous sects, and even the bosom friend of Lord Bao Zheng! A descendant of the Yang Family Generals, and the leader of the Cangmo Sect! Can your background even compare?”</p>
<p>“Damn! Now that you mention it, that actually makes some sense?!”</p>
<p>“Hehe, I don't care about all your messy stuff. I just want to know why Aunt Cai can't be romanced!”</p>
