Chapter 254: This Is Persecuting Us Long Sword Players! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

As *Monster Hunter: World* officially launched, countless players immersed themselves in the magnificent New World. The first thing many players did upon entering the game was naturally to invite their friends and hunt together.

For this part, Chen Xu also made some improvements compared to the original version. If friends were teaming up, the initiator could directly invite three other Hunters to their Astera Settlement, and then set off together. It wasn't like before, where each quest had to be accepted individually before inviting others. Of course, during a quest, sending a flare would still be accompanied by a Wingdrake making a spectacular entrance.

However, many players found that the team-up mode was a little different from what they imagined when they started fighting. "No! Sister Han, why did you aggro the BOSS?!" In the voice channel, Zhang Yi, who was hunting with Song Ren and the others, heard Joey's desperate voice. Joey, wielding Dual Blades against the Great Jagras, had just activated Demon Mode, rushed forward with a red glow, and unleashed a Demon Dance without a word. But the crucial part was that her first horizontal slash indeed landed, yet then Wang Han, who was holding a Hammer, smacked the Great Jagras's backside, and the Great Jagras immediately turned and ran towards Wang Han. Everyone then watched as Joey's Dual Blades continuously sliced through the air, like a cringey dance. Everyone: "..." Wang Han was also speechless: "You can't blame me! I don't control who the BOSS decides to attack." But no sooner had she spoken than the Great Jagras turned and charged, sending Wang Han's Hunter flying a good distance.

"Let me handle this! Let me show you the might of my Great Sword! Old Song, watch closely, see who's truly the number one weapon in the New World!" Zhang Yi roared, then charged forward with a Great Sword taller than himself. Standing before the Great Jagras, he immediately started charging. The Great Sword relies on pure momentum, small blade 50, great blade 100. Find... close eyes... charge, end battle! One swing of this sword, and you might die! With the first charge complete, the Great Sword, gleaming with charging light, smashed heavily onto the ground. Mud and water splashed up over a meter, and a small pit was dug into the earth. "Is that your Great Sword? Are you trying to make me die laughing!?" Song Ren, who hadn't made a move yet, finally couldn't hold back when he saw this. His laughter, like a barbell dropping, filled the voice channel. "Accident! That was an accident!" Zhang Yi also felt a bit awkward; he had just boasted, and then completely missed, how embarrassing! But primarily, Zhang Yi had noticed something in this multiplayer mode: the monsters were genuinely harder to hit.

In single-player mode, the Palico, while sometimes getting in the way, would generally stay by his side and not move much. The monsters would often stand still and let him hit them, sometimes drawing aggro, and sometimes making the monster act like a wooden dummy. But this was different in multiplayer mode with other players! Because when facing monsters, players would use rolling to dodge attacks. And this dodging naturally created distance from the BOSS, and when the person who drew aggro moved away, the BOSS would follow, leaving players using charged attacks in the awkward position of "hitting the ground."

"Stop explaining! Explanations are just cover-ups! Let me show you the prowess of a Longsword Hero! A single Long Sword and one person is a magnificent and ultimate performance, watch me show off!" Song Ren, carrying his Long Sword, honed his blade with a Whetstone nearby. Although his sharpness was full, what he pursued wasn't sharpness, but the sheathing animation after honing his blade. How dashing, how cool! This was him, a legendary Longsword Hero of the New World!

"Your Great Sword is no good! Watch my Hammer's spinning attack!" Wang Han, seeing Zhang Yi's "hitting the ground" earlier, also burst out laughing. She slowly charged her Great Hammer and ran towards the Great Jagras. At this moment, Song Ren, having completed his sheathing animation, finally made his move.

"Cut, cleave, diagonal slash, Spirit Roundslash!" Song Ren in the game shouted out each of his moves with a strong sense of immersion. The Longsword Hero in the game executed a very cool cleaving motion, filling his Spirit Gauge, followed by a Spirit Roundslash. And then... the three teammates who had just approached immediately fell to their knees. Wang Han, who was charging up her spinning attack nearby, was also stunned. A Spirit Roundslash, with the user as its origin, left nothing standing in its vicinity. "Holy cow! Old Song, your damn Long Sword is unbelievable!" Zhang Yi, who had just approached and was instantly flinched then sent flying by the Great Jagras, was bewildered. This included Joey, who was about to continue her Demon Mode cringey dance, and Wang Han, who was preparing to unleash her Great Hammer spinning attack. Only now did everyone realize that while *Monster Hunter: World* didn't have so-called friendly fire, attacking teammates could still interrupt their moves and cause flinching.

"Oh, don't worry about these details! You guys get out of the way and let me handle it! A single Long Sword is the ultimate performance, just watch me show off!" After successfully entering the Spirit Gauge State with a Spirit Roundslash, Song Ren struck a pose, preparing to unleash an explosive burst of damage with a very cool Helm Breaker. He performed two consecutive rolls to create distance from the Great Jagras, then activated Spirit Thrust. The Hunter in the game took a slight step back, gripped the Long Sword with both hands, and charged straight forward. *Whish!* The sharp blade pierced the Great Jagras's body. The Hunter then used the Great Jagras's body as a foothold, leaping up, and with the Long Sword held in both hands, swung it downwards in mid-air, like a falling meteor. And then... the Hunter in the game, holding the Long Sword, slammed it hard into the ground.

"Is that your ultimate Long Sword performance? Give it a rest!" Seeing Song Ren's sword strike empty air, Zhang Yi couldn't help but burst out laughing. "Accident, accident! Didn't you also miss your charged attack?! Hey! What are you guys doing? Stop slacking off! Come on and deal some damage with me, we've been fighting for ages and this dragon doesn't even have a scratch!" Song Ren, who was fighting the Great Jagras, turned his head and was dumbfounded. The three people behind him: one had taken out a capture net and was catching rabbits, another had pulled out a folding stool and a portable grill and was roasting meat, and the third had taken out a fishing rod and was walking towards the edge of the jungle, seemingly wanting to fish by the sea.

"Then stop using Spirit Roundslash!" Zhang Yi said to Song Ren, speechless. "Exactly! With your Spirit Roundslash, we can't even move!" Wang Han chimed in. "Couldn't agree more!" Joey agreed. "How can that be?! A Long Sword without Spirit Roundslash, how can I enter the Spirit Gauge State?! Even after a successful Foresight Slash, you still need to follow up with a Spirit Roundslash!" Song Ren protested, asking how that could possibly work. His Long Sword relied on Spirit Roundslash to enter the Spirit Gauge State; without it, wouldn't he be "scraping by" the entire time? Wouldn't he become a useless person?

"A Long Sword is a solo performance, Old Song, I'm rooting for you!" Zhang Yi chuckled. "The Long Sword, a symbol of strength, and the strong are always solitary!" Wang Han, holding her fishing rod, slowly shuffled her way out of the jungle. "Teammates? Those things are no longer needed. One Long Sword to conquer the New World!" Joey, who had successfully caught a rabbit, also sighed with emotion.

"No way! I won't use Spirit Roundslash anymore! Come and help me!" Looking at the three people in front of him, and then at the lively Great Jagras before him, Song Ren finally bowed to reality. Everyone chuckled as they fought the Great Jagras. The battle was relatively smooth; although the monster's health increased in online mode, with four people, if someone's health was low, they could simply retreat and drink a potion, which actually made it safer.

"I suddenly feel like four people teaming up to fight monsters isn't as efficient as when I play alone!" Zhang Yi couldn't help but sigh after the battle. "Why isn't it efficient? Don't you three have any self-awareness?! You're persecuting us Long Sword players!" Song Ren, representing the vast number of Long Sword players, shouted out his inner cry.
