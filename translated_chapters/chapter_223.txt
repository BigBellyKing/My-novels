Chapter 222: Official Launch (Seventh Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

While players were discussing online how the previous piano could have been made in *Minecraft*, three days passed again.

Chen Xu released another video.

The content of the video was very simple: 'How to Build a Fully Functional Calculator in *Minecraft*'.

Watching the calculator and its components, all meticulously constructed from pixelated blocks within the video, followed by demonstrations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Players, who originally thought the previous piano was exaggerated enough, now had to admit that there was no most exaggerated, only more exaggerated.

Calculators are not uncommon; many games even have built-in calculator items.

The key, however, is that those in other games are pre-programmed. In the *Minecraft* video Chen Xu released, this entire device was built by him!

Did this mean they could also build it themselves in the game?

From the release of the first video until now, the popularity of *Minecraft* was terrifyingly exaggerated. It could be said that it attracted the attention of the entire gaming industry.

Indeed, any player who was connected to the internet and regularly checked game communities would, more or less, know about this game.

"Holy cow, holy cow, is this a 'shenanigans' operation every three days?"

"This game can be played like this? I'm completely dumbfounded!"

"It seems the promotional trailer didn't lie at all! The only limit to gameplay is the player's imagination!"

"Absolutely explosive! I'm definitely going to make one myself someday!"

"Baby, don't brag, Mom's scared! That sheer volume looks terrifying to me; take a hundred years to build it!"

"Damn it, Boy Kid, get lost! Don't look down on me! Once I understand the principle, I'll definitely grind one out!"

"It's just too awesome. Building a calculator in the game, why not build a computer!"

Along with these four new videos, countless players expressed their amazement.

However, what players didn't know was that a computer could indeed be built in this game. If a player's computer specifications were sufficient, they could even play *Minecraft* within *Minecraft*.

Of course, such requirements were too high. But building a computer capable of playing Snake, inputting Chinese characters, and playing Minesweeper was certainly possible.

The reason it wasn't done was primarily because the demonstrations of the piano and calculator were already sufficient. These choices for promotional videos, besides showcasing *Minecraft*'s charm and potential to players, all had specific goals.

Naturally, Along the River During the Qingming Festival and the Forbidden City were meant to demonstrate the astonishing possibilities of *Minecraft*'s seemingly simple block-building gameplay. The subsequent piano performance and calculator were intended to show players the extent of Redstone technology within the game.

Similarly, for this fifth video, Chen Xu naturally had a specific directive: to make players understand that *Minecraft* was not just a block-building game, nor merely an adventure RPG.

Amidst the anticipation of countless players, the fifth video officially launched.

This time, the content displayed was an amusement park.

A series of complex tracks, with numerous pixelated characters enjoying the thrill of a rollercoaster ride.

The carousel and Ferris wheel in the southwest corner were in operation.

Concurrently, in the central area of the amusement park, there was a gigantic Redstone technology maze that irregularly transformed every so often, where countless pixelated characters were playing obstacle course mini-games.

On the water, there was also a mechanical race track, much like the variety show obstacle course of Fall Guys, with many players competing on it.

The gameplay remained *Minecraft*'s core mechanics, but through building structures and Redstone technology mechanisms, it presented a completely different gaming experience.

Players could play Hide and Seek, race on tracks, and there was even a circulating race car track where players, sitting on the carts, could shoot at moving targets with bows and arrows.

Amidst the exclamations and heated discussions of countless players.

The time arrived at New Year's Eve, the very last day of the year.

On this day, the video Chen Xu released was somewhat different from before. It wasn't about showing off skills or introducing fresh content.

Instead, it was a New Year's Celebration Video created using *Minecraft* content.

The video contained no new elements; it merely presented some altered content from previous videos.

In Along the River During the Qingming Festival, the banks of the Bian River were enveloped in a rich Spring Festival atmosphere, with fireworks blooming and river lanterns flowing.

It was still the Forbidden City, but this time it was filled with numerous NPC characters, bustling with life.

The piano was still playing, but it wasn't the melancholic 'To Liva'; instead, it was a cheerful New Year's song.

Finally, the video shifted to the amusement park. Amidst the fireworks, the camera zoomed in on the block characters in the amusement park, and at this moment, each block character displayed their respective names or codenames.

They were all Nebula Games employees.

………………

On the first day of the Lunar New Year, after New Year's Eve, *Minecraft* officially launched.

As for TengHua's *Voyage*, it finally chose to delay its release. The familiar excuse was given: they hoped to further polish the game, thus making the difficult decision to postpone the launch.

In the past, announcing a launch date and then delaying it would have certainly led to players showering them with criticism. But this time, it caused no stir.

Because all the players' attention was focused on *Minecraft*.

On the first day of the Lunar New Year, *Minecraft* officially unlocked.

…………

At Zhang Yi's home in the Imperial Capital, after visiting relatives and exchanging New Year's greetings, he, like most players eagerly anticipating the game after the previous video bombardments, immediately returned home to experience *Minecraft*.

His hands were itching!

Those previous videos had fully ignited his creative inspiration.

Logging into the game, Zhang Yi immediately noticed something: Wang Han, Song Ren, Wang Yifan, and Joey were all online.

"Everyone's here!?" Zhang Yi entered the voice channel and immediately heard a flurry of shouts.

"We were just talking about you! Old Zhang, haven't you two met each other's parents yet?" Song Ren chimed in.

"Visiting on the fourth! Hurry up and join the game, I'll pull you in. You wouldn't believe how beautiful and stunning it is! Mr. Chen actually built a dedicated server! We can actually visit the previous Along the River During the Qingming Festival and Forbidden City, and there are even scenes not shown in the videos!" Wang Han exclaimed excitedly.

"Wait, coming right now!" Hearing this, Zhang Yi also felt a surge of excitement.

He could actually experience it in the game?

That was incredible!

Clicking on the game, it required an update, and it was quite large. Fortunately, his home internet speed was fast.

After entering the game, Zhang Yi quickly realized that it was different from his previous experience!

For example, upon entering the game now, after the Nebula Games Logo faded.

The opening animation had changed.

Accompanying the slow rise of a sun on the eastern horizon.

Bathed in sunlight, the beach, green grass, verdant mountains, and forests appeared exceptionally beautiful.

Then, Steve walked on the beach, and the surrounding space constantly shifted. He traveled from the beach to the banks of the Bian River a thousand years ago, experiencing the scenery and local customs of that era.

In the next moment, he arrived at the magnificent Forbidden City.

Then, he rested briefly at the bonfire of the Firelink Shrine.

Following that, various scenes unfamiliar to Zhang Yi flashed by… After these fleeting glimpses, Steve arrived at an amusement park to play.

Finally, the sun slowly set, and the scene returned to the banks of the Bian River. Countless Kongming lanterns twinkled in the sky, forming the words "Minecraft."

Simultaneously, the game's UI interface had also changed; it was no longer the previous island, but a painted pleasure boat on the Bian River. Along the riverbank, corresponding options like 'Start Game' and 'Options' were displayed.

However, before he could finish looking, Wang Han sent him an invitation from his friends list, asking if he wanted to join her server.

Without hesitation, Zhang Yi directly accepted.

As the screen loaded to black, Zhang Yi was filled with anticipation.

He also had a plan.

He intended to learn from them.

He definitely couldn't recreate the entire Along the River During the Qingming Festival. But he certainly wanted to take a good look at the residential houses within it, and then build one himself!
