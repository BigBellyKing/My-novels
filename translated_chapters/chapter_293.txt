## Chapter 292: Complete Reversal (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

On the main stage of tonight's event, Brother Huang was truly starting to doubt himself.

“Brother Huang, it’s not too late to repent now; your prediction was a bit off!” Sun Yixie added fuel to the fire from the main stage, also expressing his surprise.

He was clearly astonished that the Human and Night Elf races could be played in such ways.

“This shouldn’t be!” Brother Huang was frustrated. He felt that what he said should have been entirely correct, but why did the results always turn out to be the exact opposite of what he expected?

“Brother Huang, do you admit now that Mr. Chen is a master player?” Sun Yixie pressed him.

“Oh, I’ve always admitted that Mr. Chen is a formidable Warcraft player, but as I said before, Mr. Chen still has a gap in detailed micro-management compared to professional players.” Brother Huang maintained that his view remained unchanged.

“However, there’s something to be said about the player on stage this time. If it were before, I’d definitely think Jiedong would win, but it’s different now.”

“To be honest, Jiedong and I know each other privately, and we have a pretty good relationship. But I still want to say that Jiedong is definitely a weakling among these people. I think that when Shu Ben and Satellite lost to Mr. Chen, it wasn’t due to a lack of technical skill, but rather a lack of strategy. But now, I just want to say that if Mr. Chen has any new strategies, Jiedong might not have an easy time.” Brother Huang sighed with emotion.

“Brother Huang, are you implying Jiedong will lose?” Sun Yixie asked.

“Evenly matched, both have a good chance. Although I feel Jiedong is a weakling, I still believe his raw skill in all aspects is stronger than Mr. Chen’s.” Brother Huang was now flip-flopping.

At this moment, the game began.

The map was TR, which is considered a rather unfavorable map for the Orc race.

This is because the large neutral creeps on the map are Sea Turtles, whose melee attacks deal additional reflected damage.

For the Undead, one could only say it was average.

After exchanging pleasantries at the start, Jiedong immediately sent a Peon to scout.

Although this match wasn't Night Elves or Humans, who knew what tricks the Undead might pull?

However, Jiedong quickly noticed something: Chen Xu was using a standard, default opening.

First, a Graveyard, then a Crypt, followed by an Altar of Darkness and a Ziggurat.

This was different from before!

Furthermore, the Undead race couldn't really employ a fast expand strategy, as it's currently recognized that the Undead are strongest on a single base.

Also, the Undead generally can't play defensively; typically, their strongest push comes at Tier 3, where they sell off all salvageable buildings like their base and Necropolis, mass producing units to 100 population for an all-in push. If they win, they win; if not, they lose.

Though puzzled, Jiedong proceeded with his development in an orderly fashion.

On the other side, Chen Xu was also using a mostly standard Undead playstyle, starting with a Death Knight.

However, the Ghouls produced by the Barracks were only used for chopping wood; the main unit type produced later was Crypt Fiends.

Leading the Crypt Fiends, he attacked a nearby neutral creep camp.

Chen Xu controlled the Death Knight to creep, constantly kiting the neutral creeps, taking no damage, and maintaining a decent efficiency.

After clearing the camp, his Death Knight reached Level 2.

The skill points were allocated to Death Coil and Unholy Aura, which was a normal allocation.

Mid-game, Chen Xu also encountered Jiedong’s Blademaster, who was also creeping.

He was chased and slashed a few times, but with the Unholy Aura, he had inherent health regeneration and movement speed.

The Blademaster and Orc Grunts were relatively slow and couldn't catch up, so the opponent didn't pursue further, instead returning to continue their development.

Chen Xu, likewise, continued to creep in an orderly fashion, while back at his base, three Ghouls were already chopping wood.

The base was also about to begin its Tier 2 upgrade.

The Ziggurat at his base had been upgraded to a Spirit Tower early on, and the buildings were placed cautiously to defend against harassment from the Orc Blademaster.

The early game was uneventful, with both sides developing without harassment.

This was considered a basic macro operation, yet it left many players, including the commentators, a bit bewildered.

After all, before this, whether it was the Night Elves' multi-expansion strategy or the Humans' Fire-Demon Tower rush, both were rather unconventional playstyles.

But now, the Undead were playing by the book!

………………

“Mr. Chen is playing macro with the Undead this game, a standard opening?” Brother Huang was a little disappointed; he had thought Mr. Chen would bring out something new this time.

“Is he going to play an orderly macro game? Then Jiedong is set! The Wolf Riders are already out, and Ensnare has been learned.” Brother Huang analyzed the battle unfolding on screen.

“Brother Huang, you’re already making a judgment!?” Sun Yixie merely recounted what was happening on the field, without making ‘professional’ analyses like Brother Huang.

“Of course! Mr. Chen here seems to be going for Crypt Fiends, likely due to concern about the Sea Turtles’ reflected damage during creeping, but there are also many disadvantages. Jiedong’s Wolf Riders are already formed, and they’re so fast that even with the Death Knight’s aura, they can’t be outrun!”

“And there was a brief probing skirmish earlier; although no units were lost, it was clear that Mr. Chen’s raw skill still had a bit of a gap!” Brother Huang quickly analyzed.

“Hey! Mr. Chen isn’t training a Lich here? And at Level 1, he didn’t put a point into Frost Nova but chose Frost Armor instead? Doesn’t that make his killing power even weaker?” Brother Huang noticed some differences.

In the game, Chen Xu's Death Knight leveled up alone for a while after Tier 2, not pulling out the second Lich to split experience.

So, at this point, the Death Knight had reached Level 3, with two points in Death Coil and one in Unholy Aura. The opposing Blademaster was only Level 2. Meanwhile, Chen Xu had already stockpiled 5 Crypt Fiends at his base.

Next, Chen Xu directly chose to upgrade his Crypt Fiends' attack upgrade.

Watching Chen Xu's actions, commentator Brother Huang was a bit taken aback.

Generally, the Undead’s second hero is most likely a Lich.

But they almost always learn the first skill, which is Frost Nova.

Because this is one of the highest burst damage hero spells in Warcraft.

Combined with the Death Knight’s first skill, Death Coil, it could usually deal three to four hundred damage to an opposing hero, which would be close to the kill threshold without items.

But why did Chen Xu have his Lich learn Frost Armor?

This left Brother Huang a bit perplexed.

“It must be Mr. Chen’s strategy, Jiedong might be in trouble!” Sun Yixie commented from the side.

“That shouldn’t be possible. Jiedong has two more Wolf Riders, and the Blademaster got some good items. The key is that with the Lich’s current skill allocation, it’s impossible to kill a hero.” Brother Huang analyzed the situation on the field.

“They’re about to clash! Jiedong is very aggressive here! The Wolf Riders are already pushing forward, charge, charge, charge!” Brother Huang analyzed the situation.

In the game, near the tavern in the middle of the map, Jiedong’s forces encountered Chen Xu’s army.

He had originally planned to get another item, level his Blademaster to 4, and train a Kodo Beast before launching a probing attack.

But seeing the enemy’s forces at this moment, Jiedong changed his strategy, deciding to go all-in.

He felt very strong at the moment, and the Wolf Riders had already formed an encirclement.

Tier 2 is a very strong phase for the Orcs. Although the Wolf Riders' attack attribute is Siege, which takes a slight penalty.

They have the Ensnare skill; they can directly snare a Crypt Fiend, killing it in one round, and it might not even be able to Burrow.

As Jiedong attacked, the audience and commentators erupted in excitement.

“Mr. Chen is at a huge disadvantage!”

The Blademaster charged in with a Critical Strike (from stealth), taking out almost half of a Crypt Fiend’s health.

“Mr. Chen, looking ashen!”

In the next moment, the Wolf Riders’ Ensnare targeted a Crypt Fiend, controlling it.

“Mr. Chen, terrible formation!”

The Death Knight charged alone into the Wolf Riders’ ranks.

“Mr. Chen, fight and retreat!”

The Death Knight, having lost half its health, with its Frost Armor nearly gone, retreated slightly.

“Mr. Chen, stuck in a dilemma!”

At this moment, a Death Coil instantly raised the Crypt Fiend’s health, while a Frost Armor was cast on the activated Crypt Fiend.

“Mr. Chen, Blademaster is all over him!”

The Wolf Riders’ attacks barely scratched the Frost Armor. The only damage came from the Orc Grunts, the Blademaster, and the Tauren’s attacks and shockwaves.

But after being attacked, all units were instantly slowed, moving as if they were dancing.

“Mr. Chen, a volley!”

At this point, utilizing the Death Knight's Unholy Aura, the remaining Crypt Fiends instantly created distance and began to focus fire on the Orc Grunts, who posed a threat to them.

The Wolf Riders surrounded the Crypt Fiends to attack, but surprisingly, they took no damage due to the Frost Armor.

Moreover, these Crypt Fiends, with the Death Knight’s Unholy Aura, were no slower than the Wolf Riders.

“Mr. Chen, won the fight!” Sun Yixie’s voice described everything happening on the field.

Meanwhile, Brother Huang was completely bewildered.

Wasn’t the situation looking great?

“What’s going on? Frost Armor with two-attack Crypt Fiends is so powerful!?” Brother Huang couldn't help but ask.

He saw Chen Xu’s Crypt Fiends split into three small squads, turning and firing a volley before instantly creating distance.

The Death Knight used a Death Coil, and with the Lich, who had reached Level 2, a Frost Nova instantly took out a Wolf Rider.

At the same time, the Death Knight used an Instant Potion, and with Frost Armor on himself, charged into the Orc forces, constantly chasing and slashing at the Orc soldiers.

The battle completely reversed!

As for Jiedong, his Town Portal scroll had already been sold in the shop for gold to buy a pair of Boots of Speed, so he couldn’t even use it to save his units. The Crypt Fiends, with the Unholy Aura’s speed, were no slower than the Wolf Riders.

Two volleys combined with one spell resulted in a unit’s death, and they were even chased all the way back to his base.

The tide had turned, and Jiedong called GG.

In the RTS Group Chat, the professional players who were spectating were also surprised.

“This Crypt Fiend strategy is quite something! Crypt Fiends normally have slow turning speed and movement, but with the Death Knight’s Unholy Aura supporting them, their mobility becomes very high.”

“That’s right. Crypt Fiends are usually afraid of Orc units like Wind Riders and Wolf Riders, but with Frost Armor for defense and the ability to slow opponents, Wolf Riders pose no threat at all. Instead, the Crypt Fiends can freely kite the Orc Grunts.”

“Indeed, even focus-firing won’t work. The Death Knight’s Death Coil instantly heals them, and Crypt Fiends themselves can Burrow to survive.”

“So, the Undead can fight Orcs this way too!”

“However, Orcs can also counter this by seeing the Crypt Fiend mass production and preparing to build Kodo Beasts and Wind Riders.”
