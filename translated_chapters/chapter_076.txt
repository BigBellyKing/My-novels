Chapter 76 Two New Games

Watching the bewildered staff, Chen Xu smiled and offered no explanation.

Naturally, Chen Xu had his reasons for such a request.

Moreover, this was related to one of the two games Chen Xu was about to produce.

After confirming some basic matters with the staff, Chen Xu planned to grab a meal at the exhibition's canteen area, deal with it quickly, and then drive back to the company.

Just then, a somewhat familiar voice came from behind: "Chen Xu, your Nebula Games also participated in this gameplay Expo!"

Chen Xu turned his head and saw Meng Zuo, whom he had met once at the Sci-Fi Game Design Competition last year.

When NetDragon previously wanted to acquire Nebula Games, it was he who contacted Chen Xu.

"Yes, we were invited to participate," Chen Xu said with a smile, nodding.

"Overcooked's performance has been excellent, especially the new version's Workshop update, which is truly a stroke of genius," Meng Zuo said with a smile on his face, starting with a round of commercial flattery.

Listening to Meng Zuo's words, Chen Xu was slightly taken aback, not immediately understanding why the other party was so enthusiastic.

Subconsciously, Chen Xu also wanted to return the commercial flattery.

After all, if someone flatters you, you should reciprocate, right?

However, as soon as this thought emerged, Chen Xu realized something slightly awkward: he had no idea what games the other party had developed after the previous Sci-Fi Game Design Competition.

"Hmm... the same goes for Teacher Meng! The third chapter level of Galaxy Heroes performed exceptionally well!" Chen Xu paused for two or three seconds, then boasted with a smile.

These words sounded so familiar, as if he had heard them somewhere before. Meng Zuo was stunned for a moment before realizing.

Wait! Wasn't that the same commercial flattery the other party used with him during last year's Sci-Fi Game Design Competition?

After half a year, your impression of me is still just that one sentence!?

It should be known that in these past few months, after losing to To the Moon in the Sci-Fi Game Design Competition, he had been constantly pondering and regretting, always wanting to avenge that 'arrow of defeat'.

Even when NetDragon's investment department approached him, hoping he could contact Nebula Games to discuss an acquisition, he felt a pang of discomfort.

After all, even then, he had successfully participated in and was responsible for a major project under NetDragon, thanks to his second-place award at the Sci-Fi Game Design Competition.

But if Nebula Games were acquired, wouldn't they become colleagues?

And more importantly, if Nebula Games were acquired as a subsidiary of NetDragon, the other party would have more freedom in both status and resources than him.

Fortunately, this acquisition ultimately fell through as both parties could not reach an agreement.

In his mind, he had imagined their meeting countless times.

He had visualized how to speak, how to initiate conversation, and what tone to use.

But the most painful thing was that he considered someone a great rival, while that person didn't even care about him.

'Today you treat me with indifference, tomorrow I'll make your jaw drop!'

Silently encouraging himself, Meng Zuo looked towards the exhibition area.

"This is your company's exhibition area, Mr. Chen! It must be the largest in the indie game section, right?" Meng Zuo exclaimed with a surprised expression.

"It's alright," Chen Xu replied with a polite smile and a nod.

"By the way, if I may ask, will Nebula Games be bringing any new projects to the exhibition this time, Mr. Chen?" Meng Zuo inquired.

"Based on our progress, there will be two games available for players to try out during the exhibition," Chen Xu said briefly, as these weren't absolute secrets. After all, the exhibition was only two months away, and everything would be public by then.

"I see, then I'll be sure to experience your new games first thing, Mr. Chen," Meng Zuo said with a smile, expressing anticipation.

"You're most welcome. Does Teacher Meng also have new works this time?" Chen Xu asked.

Meng Zuo, appearing calm and collected on the surface, replied with a smile: "Indeed, I've been responsible for a major project under NetDragon recently, and this exhibition is mainly for that project."

After a lively conversation, the two chatted for about ten minutes before parting ways.

Walking out of the venue, Chen Xu turned his head to look at Meng Zuo, who was still smiling and waving at him, feeling a bit curious.

This person is excessively enthusiastic.

Could he really be his loyal fan?

Inside the exhibition hall, Meng Zuo was filled with emotion.

"Alas, although I really want to compete against you, Chen Xu, this time it's a completely unfair fight. The spotlight of this exhibition will inevitably be on our NetDragon."

"Two new games, huh? They might face a difficult launch," Meng Zuo sighed with a hint of melancholy.

In the past few months, he had countless times imagined meeting Chen Xu, and what posture he could adopt to wash away the regret of losing the first prize in the Sci-Fi Game Design Competition.

But now, he actually felt a little sympathetic towards Chen Xu.

Participating in such a large-scale exhibition for the first time, having poured his heart and soul into preparing two new titles, he simply wanted to make a name for himself at the event.

However, fate was not on his side. He happened to encounter NetDragon, who were eyeing this exhibition covetously, and TengHua was also preparing for big moves.

The war between two industry giants affected the innocent.

Such is fate!

............

Completely unaware of the elaborate imaginings in someone else's mind.

After leaving the exhibition hall, he quickly ate a late lunch.

In the afternoon, Chen Xu drove back to Nebula Games and resumed writing the concept drafts for the next two games.

The two games Chen Xu was preparing to produce next were...

A strategic card board game set in the Three Kingdoms period, and a variety show obstacle course type game.

Sanguosha and Fall Guys.

Among them, Sanguosha was arguably the simplest from a development perspective.

Because the core of this game lay in its gameplay and numerical design. Chen Xu even knew all the numerical values without needing the Memory Capsule.

As for Fall Guys, in his previous life, many players referred to it as a battle royale.

In reality, apart from having only one winner at the end, this game had absolutely no connection to battle royale elements.

And if a game with only one winner was considered a battle royale game...

Then that would cover too many aspects.

Strictly speaking, it was a variety show obstacle course type game suitable for all ages.

And in the Parallel World, many local satellite TV stations had similar obstacle course shows.

This inherently gave Fall Guys an advantage.

Chen Xu also made some considerations when choosing these two games.

After Overcooked, the most direct and effective way to stabilize users on the Nebula Games platform was to continue launching corresponding multiplayer games on it.

Sanguosha and Fall Guys, these two games, perfectly matched that characteristic.

Sanguosha, in his previous life, had been around for 13 years since its online version. Despite Youka's various questionable operations, it still maintained a significant market share and occasionally even broke into the top ten of App Store's gross revenue charts, showing its tenacious vitality.

As for Fall Guys, it was actually like Overcooked: without continuous fresh version updates, it was...

...a fast-food style hit game.

However, this wasn't a derogatory term; it should be known that not every game could become a fast-food style hit.

At the same time, this game was very appropriate for the current Nebula Games platform.

From a commercial performance perspective, such a game, in his previous life, sold over ten million copies on Steam alone in its first month, though circumstances made the hero.

The variety show obstacle course nature itself, combined with the global pandemic environment at the time, had some impact.

But the fundamental reason was its distinct game features and the lack of similar competitors on the market, making it truly unique.

Besides this, there was another important reason for choosing this game.

That was, Chen Xu felt it was time to improve his image among players.

Outlast and Overcooked, although both were hugely popular.

But his reputation was suffering a bit of persecution!

Harvesting player emotion points couldn't rely solely on resentment.

You can't dig up the leeks by their roots.

So, it was time to bring a truly joyful game.
