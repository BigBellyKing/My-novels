Chapter 823: A Squabble Erupts

Chapter 823: A Squabble Erupts

It could be said that Final Fantasy left a very deep impression on Song Ren.

Especially the protagonist, Cloud.

After understanding the causes and consequences in the game, he could even more clearly feel Cloud's charm.

Although in Zack's DLC storyline, after that final heroic sacrifice scene, his love for Zack reached its peak.

But after the game ended, reflecting on this rather long adventure, from Midgar to Gold Saucer, Cosmo Canyon, and finally the Northern Crater.

Cloud’s image still left a deeper impression on him.

Initially, Cloud always gave off a cold and unapproachable impression, and liked to say ‘not interested’ and ‘reward’ a lot.

But in reality, that was just an illusion.

The real Cloud was very passive, and his heart was full of loneliness; he was a very fragile person.

As a child, he also wanted to play with Tifa and his other friends, but each time he couldn't bring himself to say it.

On the day Tifa's mother died, Tifa, innocently wanting to find her mother, went with her friends along a mountain path near their hometown to search. When Cloud learned of this, the always introverted and solitary Cloud secretly followed Tifa. When he saw Tifa fall and get injured, Cloud wanted to save her, but he also slipped and fell unconscious.

Fortunately, Tifa and Cloud were discovered by others and rescued back to the village.

This also made Cloud deeply blame himself and yearn for strength so he could protect Tifa.

Therefore, after learning of Sephiroth's deeds, Cloud developed a sense of admiration, chose to leave the village to join Shinra, and met Zack, the most important friend in Cloud's life.

When he returned to his hometown, because Cloud still remembered the promise he made with Tifa.

But because he was still just a minor mob, this intense inferiority complex prevented Cloud from showing his true face. He chose to wear a helmet to cover his face and silently watched Tifa.

Introverted, even self-deprecating, this was Cloud.

But Cloud also had another side. When he saw the ‘great hero’ he admired, Sephiroth, destroy his hometown.

When he saw Sephiroth hurt Tifa and defeat Zack.

Even though he was just a mob, Cloud still mustered the courage to fight, stopping Sephiroth with a righteous backstab.

From that moment on, Cloud had actually become a hero, just not yet fully mature.

Later, due to Mako immersion, he suffered memory loss, coupled with witnessing Zack's sacrifice, which caused Cloud mental trauma.

Later, he once again witnessed Aerith die before his eyes.

It could be said that Cloud was not a perfect hero.

One could even say Cloud was a rather weak man. Knowing Cloud's true personality, even players sometimes wondered, why is Cloud so spineless?

But it was precisely because of this that Cloud's character felt more like a real person, making his charm more palpable.

Furthermore, every character in the game left an extremely profound impact.

Jessie, who received her bento in Midgar, the first girl to boldly flirt with Cloud.

Wishing to be an actor, but because her father became a vegetable due to Mako, she decided to join Avalanche to destroy the Mako Reactors.

Barret, who wanted to avenge his close friend's death caused by Shinra, but ultimately admitted that the talk of ‘protecting the planet’ was just to make himself feel better, cursing and being somewhat unsympathetic, yet never retreating a single step in battle.

Red XIII, who as a child believed his father abandoned his tribe and mother in battle, and his skyward howl in Cosmo Canyon after finally discovering the truth.

Yuffie, who single-mindedly wanted to collect Materia and save her hometown.

Cait Sith, one of Shinra's executives, who became a double agent.

Cid, who wanted to become a great pilot.

Vincent Valentine, tormented by Professor Hojo.

Tifa, who lost her parents because of Sephiroth.

Zack, who heroically sacrificed himself to protect Cloud.

And Aerith, an Ancient, carrying a heavy destiny.

The big BOSS, Sephiroth.

Even Professor Hojo, the root of all evil, left a very deep impression.

“But the content of this game is too damn heartbreaking!”

Song Ren sighed as he watched the game’s final credits roll.

If, if only there was a happy ending, how wonderful that would be.

In fact, Song Ren wasn’t the only one with this thought; most players who completed the game had already started discussing it on various community forums. Of course, the discussion quickly turned into a squabble.

‘Seriously, can’t Mr. Chen just make some happy endings? This is so heartbreaking it hurts!’

‘Exactly, exactly! Jessie, Zack, Aerith, not a single one survived!’

‘But then again, even though it’s painful, shouldn’t the final ending be considered perfect? After all, they successfully stopped Sephiroth, and on the flip side, Zack and Aerith were reunited in the Lifestream!’

‘Right, and if Zack didn’t die, what about Aerith?’

‘What about it? Isn’t there Cissnei?’

‘Why Cissnei? Aerith is the best!’

‘Still Zack! Still Zack! Did you even watch the story? In Gold Saucer, when Aerith and Cloud were playing, it was clearly implied that she initially approached him only because he resembled Zack in his walking style and gestures, but later Aerith felt that Cloud was just Cloud.’

‘Exactly, Aerith definitely liked Zack at first. When she saw Zack's shadow on Cloud, she subconsciously drew closer, but later she clearly fell for Cloud!’

‘Please don’t confirm it so quickly, okay? It only said that Aerith realized Cloud wasn’t Zack. Was there a confession in the game? Were there any more intimate actions? If you think that means Aerith fell for Cloud, then I think if a girl asks to borrow your pen, you’ll start thinking about your future children’s names.’

‘Exactly, exactly! Although I like Cloud too, can you stop being so dramatic? And besides, weren’t we discussing the scenario where Zack and Aerith didn’t die? If they hadn’t died, wouldn’t Zack have reunited with Aerith directly?’

‘I think this ending is great! Aerith and Zack, Cloud and Tifa, how perfect!’

‘Jessie, Cissnei: Are you forgetting something?’

??????????

What the heck?

Is this turning into shipping wars?

Heartbroken and with unresolved feelings, Song Ren had just logged onto the Tieba forum, looking for like-minded players.

But seeing the content in the forum and community, he was utterly speechless.

To be honest, at first, he did have a bit of a Lewd Person element and focused on that. But as the game's story progressed, he was more attracted by the ensemble drama in the game, focusing on the stories of each character.

He had completely stopped caring about CP pairings.

And Song Ren didn't know if it was his misconception, but the game's presentation was actually quite ambiguous.

Except for Zack and Aerith, who had a confirmed relationship, officially acknowledged.

Other characters had no deep romantic involvement at all.

Even Cloud and Tifa had no official confirmation.

………………

Inside Nebula Games' office

“Of course, it’s not a misconception, it’s intentional. You’re all still too young!” Chen Xu said with a smile and a sigh.

“Look at these CP fans online, they’re all debating whether Aerith likes Zack or Cloud! This is very normal, after all, every player has their own preferences, some side with Tifa, some with Aerith, and some want both.”

“But our company can’t do that,” Chen Xu stretched.

Cloud, Tifa, Aerith, and Zack?

These are pure brother-sister, comrade relationships! Where does this CP come from!

Official CP?

Official CP is impossible to officially confirm.

If it's an official CP, how can it generate buzz?

In his previous life, SE was adept at this, including various spin-off novels, art books, and public video interviews, which basically maintained a confusing and ambiguous stance.

Sometimes, if they accidentally let slip a personal opinion, no worries, they would simply retcon it later.

Let alone Cloud and Aerith’s relationship, even Tifa and Cloud, despite countless players assuming it, were never truly confirmed in the games or the CGI movies.

“Only this way will it give players an open-ended feeling, guiding them to imagine the ending they want,” Chen Xu said with a profound and enigmatic expression.

“So, Mr. Chen, this is why Version B only goes up to Midgar!?” Yang Xin said with a speechless look.

“It’s mainly to see the players’ subsequent reactions, and continuously releasing content in this way is also a kind of overdrawing the IP itself. Don’t you think this can make Final Fantasy’s buzz and popularity ignite once again?” Chen Xu lightly coughed twice.

“Whether it ignites or not, I don’t know, but Mr. Chen, you definitely won’t be able to leave Nebula Games’ gate then,” Ruan Ningxue said thoughtfully from the side.
