Chapter 545: I Got Stuck in the Newbie Tutorial! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

He had absolutely no idea such a situation would occur.

How did his neck get caught in a rope?

The scene before him perfectly illustrated the saying, 'How much sorrow can one have? It's just like a red rope ensnaring a doggo's head.' But then again, this sight was absolutely hilarious.

Controlling the Corgi in the game to constantly struggle, which in turn manifested as incessant leg-kicking, Song Ren, sitting in front of his computer, was thoroughly amused by the Corgi's antics.

“Eh… something’s a little different, this thing seems to be able to break free!” Amused, Song Ren quickly noticed some unusual details.

He realized that as the Corgi continuously kicked its legs to break free, the two large iron contraptions tied around its neck were steadily sliding downwards. So, it was possible to break free, it just seemed to be a bit tough on the keyboard.

“Sure enough, even though this game looks like it’s wrapped in an adorable facade, its essence is still pure silliness!” Song Ren exclaimed with emotion.

Was this game normal? Absolutely not! The entire control scheme, just like the previous `Human: Fall Flat`, was even more bizarrely captivating.

Walking like a noodle-limbed figure, it swayed and staggered as if drunk.

At the same time, the game's physics engine and action system were very un-Newtonian.

But the biggest difference between this game, `Party Animals`, and the previous `Human: Fall Flat`, was that the characters in the game were simply too adorable! Not to mention the various cute little animals from the game's promotional videos, the Corgi covered in yellow fur right now looked incredibly foolish and cute.

And concealed beneath this fluffy exterior, even when performing silly actions like a noodle-limbed figure, this appearance made it feel utterly adorable.

“Indeed! Catgos and Doggos are most likely aliens, using their adorable appearances to win humanity’s trust, then unexpectedly seizing Earth’s resources!” Song Ren sighed with emotion.

The game's newbie tutorial levels were actually quite simple. They mainly covered basic controls and attacks.

For example, ordinary little fists punching the chest, dash punches, and mid-air flying kicks. Additionally, the game seemed to have a weapon function, allowing players to pick up items and swing them at people, which seemed very rich.

However, upon quickly encountering a fully automatic rotating large club, Song Ren felt his head spin.

The middle of this tutorial level had a very narrow small log bridge, but next to it was a constantly rotating large wooden club.

Upon entering this room, Song Ren immediately controlled the Corgi to recklessly charge forward. But it was brutally beaten by the club before him, making him understand what a “dog-beating stick” was. The doggo's head was completely bashed in by the stick!

‘Oh, I see! It can also roll? Is this a signature move learned from the Undead next door?’

After the Corgi's head was bashed in several times by the club, Song Ren successfully mastered the refined skill of rolling. However, even after rolling, the distance wasn't quite enough, and its butt was smacked twice more by the stick.

“Finally, the last newbie tutorial,” Song Ren sighed. A simple newbie tutorial like this was almost making his head spin.

‘Excellent! In no time at all, you've learned so much. Now let's get serious. Jump down and hit the crocodile. Throw it out of the ring to win.’ A bizarrely captivating narration in a regional accent began as Song Ren entered the new level.

“So this level is my big battle with this crocodile. Before, it was the weekly unit test, and now it’s the final exam!” Song Ren realized.

“But this crocodile, he’s a real tough guy!” Looking at his opponent, Song Ren couldn't help but click his tongue in surprise.

The green-skinned crocodile wore sunglasses and had a medal around its neck, though at first glance, he thought it was a big gold chain.

Finally, it was time to fight! Song Ren was a little excited, directly leaping from the second floor onto the central arena below.

Facing the crocodile, Song Ren brandished the Corgi's little fists.

However, controlling the small animals in the game was actually more wobbly compared to `Human: Fall Flat`. Although it wouldn't trip on flat ground, there was a sense of imbalance, like a drunkard stumbling and tottering down the street.

So, a very strange scene unfolded. Song Ren's Corgi kept swinging its little fists, while the AI-controlled crocodile circled behind Song Ren's butt. The scene was momentarily very comical, perfectly illustrating a comedic 'Errenzhuan' dance.

“These controls are a bit difficult!” Song Ren was also amused. If running in circles was the issue, then he might as well stop.

Thinking this, Song Ren immediately stopped. But the next moment, the crocodile that had been following him delivered a direct headbutt charge to the Corgi's face.

Accompanied by a sound of ‘Er-ah,’ the Corgi in the game, whose plump, round eyes originally looked like [0.0], turned into a bewildered state like [>.<] after the crocodile’s fierce headbutt. Then, the crocodile immediately grabbed the Corgi's two legs and, with a spinning move, threw it out of the arena.

“Holy crap! This AI has some skills!” Controlling the Corgi, Song Ren scrambled to his feet and re-entered the arena.

“Come on, come on! Let me see how formidable you are!” Looking at the crocodile, this time Song Ren was much more careful. He delivered a flying kick, and at the same time, he used a forehead attack to daze the crocodile.

‘Well done! Now throw the crocodile out.’ The narration chimed in appropriately.

Song Ren controlled the Corgi, who was holding the unconscious crocodile, to wobbly make its way to the edge of the arena. “Throw it out, go to h—” Song Ren hadn't finished his threatening words when he saw the crocodile in the game awaken from its daze. Clearly, being knocked out only meant a temporary daze.

The awakened crocodile displayed an extremely fierce stance, delivering a wild charge and direct punch followed by a three-pronged headbutt attack, directly knocking his Corgi out again. Then, it grabbed the Corgi by its legs and threw it out.

At this moment, Zhang Yi’s voice came through the voice channel: “Old Song, Old Song, are you still there? I’ve been waiting for you for almost 10 minutes, are you done yet? Are you doing the newbie tutorial? You didn’t disappear to the bathroom, did you?”

“Old Song, Old Song, are you still in front of your computer?” Zhang Yi asked curiously from the other end of the voice channel.

Looking at the formidable crocodile in the arena, and then at himself, thrown out of the arena once more, Song Ren remained silent for a moment before speaking. “You might not believe me, Old Zhang, but I’m stuck in this game’s newbie tutorial…”
