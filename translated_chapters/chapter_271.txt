Chapter 270: Game Crossover Warm-up (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Days went by, and the development of Warcraft on Chen Xu's end was continuously ongoing.

Art assets were constantly being produced.

Similarly, the related data and the overall game architecture were slowly improving.

For players of Monster Hunter: World, the New World had also become familiar.

Of course, the Palico's stretcher had also become very familiar.

Before this, Chen Xu had showcased the Light Bowgun's Slicing Ammo playstyle and the Gunlance's shield-holding playstyle through live streaming.

A shield and a cannon made solo hunts no longer difficult.

Facing Pink Rathian, two words: simple.

Facing Uragaan, two words: relaxed.

Even facing Nergigante, there were only two words: acceptable.

The feeling of clearing the game was completely stress-free!

After all, weren't these "cheese" playstyles meant for ordinary players?

But when these players faced Tempered monsters, the feeling was completely different.

Raise shield and fire cannon?

Who are you kidding?

Did you still think it was turn-based combat like before?

Faced with efficient AI performance, these players were instantly taught a lesson.

The forum was once again filled with wailing.

"The 'hunt' in Monster Hunter: World has become a verb again!"

"Damn it, Tempered monsters deal so much damage, and their AI is top-notch, how are we supposed to fight them!"

Of course, players who said this were mostly those who had previously relied heavily on "cheesing" strategies.

They were completely unfamiliar with the monsters' moves.

For ordinary players, having the Rocksteady Mantle and Flinch Free Decorations, their efficiency when teaming up to hunt monsters increased significantly.

Especially some highly skilled veterans even turned monsters like Nergigante into a combat prowess measuring unit.

It wasn't about who could clear it, but who could kill Nergigante the fastest.

The originally majestic Nergigante became like a Meimeizi.

Some players even felt Nergigante was too pitiful, and many online specially created fan art of a feminized, pathetic Nergigante.

This instantly made the monster leap to become the most popular in Monster Hunter: World.

Of course, for ordinary players, it was still quite difficult.

"Old Song! You're completely flip-flopping! Switched from Gunlance back to Long Sword again? You said you didn't know what a Long Sword was!" Zhang Yi, who had failed the quest after three consecutive Palico cartings, said to Song Ren in the party.

"*Cough, cough,* the Long Sword is a lifelong faith. I only temporarily abandoned it before, but now I've regained my belief, just like an anime protagonist who experienced a brief moment of confusion but ultimately found their conviction." Song Ren began to brag.

"Huh, why is the game updating?" Song Ren, who was in the middle of bragging, suddenly noticed something: the game had prompted a "version too low" message, indicating a new version had obviously been released.

"Me too, huh... Old Song, look, there's a new event! New layered weapons added: Frostmourne (Greatsword), Warglaives of Azzinoth (Dual Blades), Flametongue Blade Sulfuras (Long Sword), Hammer of the Lightbringer (Great Hammer), Elune's Longbow (Bow)..." Zhang Yi, who had just exited the game, also saw the updated content on the Nebula Games Platform.

"Holy crap, that's kinda cool! And there are two brand new hunting quests: 'The Power of Evil: Frost Dragon' and 'Chimera from Ashenvale.' But these two don't look like Monster Hunter: World monsters at all, do they!? And what the heck is 'Azeroth' mentioned in the description?" Song Ren was also a bit confused looking at the descriptions.

"Who cares about all that! Let's just get into the game and check it out first!" Zhang Yi's heart was also full of doubts. He had a premonition that this Monster Hunter: World update was a bit unusual, but no matter what, he still wanted to get into the game and take a look.

In the voice channel, while bragging to Song Ren, Zhang Yi had also already entered the game.

Soon he found a big exclamation mark above the Commander-in-Chief's head.

"You're here. Recently something has been off. A mysterious power has appeared in the Coral Highlands, like a deadly frost..."

"At the same time, countless skeletal monsters have appeared nearby..."

"Investigate alone? Alright, if you insist..."

Looking at the Commander-in-Chief's dialogue, Zhang Yi sighed with emotion.

Investigate alone?

I'm not, I didn't, this is all you talking to yourself, okay?

But he was already used to it.

When he first arrived in this New World, he thought the hunters at Astera Settlement were all his good teammates.

But reality was cruel; he suspected the receptionist was a Deviljho cub, otherwise how could she lie on Deviljho's back for so long? And all she did was eat every day.

The Big Bro of the First Fleet was very enthusiastic, but he never left the dining area on the third floor.

The Field Team Leader was like a Golden-Maned Lion King, looking incredibly fierce at first glance, but when it came to fighting Nergigante and the final Xeno'jiiva, he was nowhere to be seen.

The Swordmaster was indeed very cool, but only contributed once in the Zorah Magdaros capture mission.

As for the others?

They were an even bigger bunch of good-for-nothings.

On the surface, they called him the White Wind of the New World, the Azure Star guiding the way, but in reality, they just bullied him because he was mute and couldn't speak, giving him all the dirty and tiring work.

He sighed, took on a mission from the Commander-in-Chief to investigate the anomaly in the Coral Highlands, and then, under the affectionate call of "partner" from the 'Deviljho cub,' set off again with his loyal Palico.

"This is a brand new monster! A bit ugly!" Entering the Coral Highlands, Zhang Yi quickly noticed some differences.

The ground was covered in frost, and after getting close, there was also a DEBUFF that slowly recovered stamina. Moreover, on the path in the Coral Highlands, some of the original Wingdrake mobs were replaced by a group of rotten, corpse-dog-like monsters.

Ghoul, this was the name Zhang Yi got after killing these monsters.

Delving deeper, he finally reached the highest point of the Coral Highlands, where Zhang Yi finally saw his objective for this trip.

A huge bone dragon, its body covered in blue light: the Frost Dragon.

"Holy crap, that looks kinda cool!"

Amidst Zhang Yi's exclamations, the Frost Dragon evidently noticed him, the uninvited guest. Flapping its skeletal wings, it actually took flight, then a breath of frost erupted from the dragon's mouth.

……………

Zhang Yi and these Monster Hunter players were surprised by the new game event, featuring the Chimera and Frost Dragon, as well as the equipment layered customization.

Similarly, on the other side, Minecraft players were equally surprised.

Because in the official display server, many players found that a new building had appeared.

During Minecraft's launch period, more and more magnificent buildings were replicated by players.

Magnificent buildings like 'Irithyll of the Boreal Valley' and 'Lothric Castle' had not yet been put into the Minecraft display server by Nebula Games' official team, but they had already been created by players, which was quite astonishing.

The display server mainly showcased Nebula Games' official creations.

However, this function was more about guiding players in the early stages, so later, only a dedicated operations team managed it.

Their efficiency naturally couldn't compare to players', and up to now, only two new building complexes had been added to the official Minecraft server.

One of them was the Astera Settlement from Monster Hunter: World, and the other was the toy castle from It Takes Two.

But now many players suddenly found that a new building complex had appeared in the official Minecraft display server.

A magnificent human city-state.

Named: Lordaeron.

Symmetrical building complexes, dense yet clearly layered.

The central area was a huge arched castle, with a long canal behind the city gate, and one could only reach the central castle hall via a drawbridge.

At the same time, in front of the castle, there was also a huge bell tower displaying Lordaeron's banner, with its iconic symbols: a twin single-headed eagle and a lion.

At a glance, it simply felt immensely grand.
