Chapter 78: This Sounds Familiar

Nebula Games' lounge area.

During lunch break, Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin leaned back in massage chairs, while others like Qin Yi were battling the claw machine.

“The company's benefits are getting better and better!” Yang Xin said delightedly, holding a cup of milk tea in her hand.

“It's mainly because the company's capital is growing stronger, and there are more and more new colleagues. I'm still not quite used to it. Would you say we're a large team now?” Ruan Ningxue also mused.

Looking back now, she still felt a bit unreal.

This time last year, she was still drawing doujinshi at home.

“We're not quite a large team yet; we're still in the small to medium-sized category,” Yang Xin said.

“Oh, Sister Xin, I heard we might be attending the gameplay Expo next?” Ruan Ningxue asked.

“Hmm, I heard Sister Lin mention it, and didn't Mr. Chen go to check out the exhibition venue before?” Yang Xin replied.

“I used to go too, but always as a spectator. Now we get to be the hosts!” Ruan Ningxue said excitedly.

At this moment, Qin Yi and the others, who had finally given up wrestling with the claw machine, also gathered around.

“We're going to exhibit too, but there's only about two months left. I wonder if Mr. Chen will have a new project?” Qin Yi said, full of anticipation.

A new project — this could be said to be what all employees at Nebula Games looked forward to.

From the perspective of psychological and spiritual satisfaction, creating a new project and seeing players give all sorts of feedback brings a strong sense of achievement.

And in terms of material conditions, every new project, if it succeeded greatly...

...would mean big bonuses!

With *Outlast* before the New Year and *Overcooked* after, Chen Xu had given them substantial bonuses after the success of those projects.

“It feels like we might not have enough time?” a new employee said at this point.

“Yeah, two months feels a bit tight, but you never know. After all, it's an expo, not an official release,” the new employees discussed.

“You guys are too young! When the project starts, you'll understand why Mr. Chen is so successful!” Qin Yi said, looking like he was calmly watching the world unfold.

“Exactly!” the veteran employees beside him said, their faces filled with anticipation.

*Outlast* and *Overcooked* released back-to-back, unique game development experiences, development efficiency almost like a bug-free machine program, and team management.

It could be said that the veteran employees who had experienced all this were almost becoming die-hard fans of Chen Xu.

Everyone was still chatting when Yang Xin's surprised voice rang out.

“Look at the work group chat! There's a meeting this afternoon about a new project!” Yang Xin waved her hand, holding her phone.

“It must be for this game expo, right?”

“I wonder what kind of new project it will be?”

“It'll probably be a multiplayer game, right? Didn't we talk about the company's development direction in the previous meeting?”

“Who knows? Just follow Mr. Chen's lead, we'll find out this afternoon.”

Opening the work group chat and seeing a notice posted by Chen Xu, everyone instantly became excited.

They all speculated amongst themselves about what kind of project they would develop next.

………………

In the afternoon, employees clocked in one after another.

Chen Xu also brought his laptop and called everyone to the conference room for a meeting.

“I believe you've all heard some news. This time, we will also participate in the gameplay Expo in May, and we'll be a headliner for the sixth exhibition area.”

An exhibition space of about 500 square meters, though not comparable to major studios.

It was quite substantial compared to some medium-sized game developers.

This was mainly due to *To the Moon* winning the official Game Design Competition, and subsequently releasing two highly popular games.

Hearing Chen Xu's words, everyone nodded, their faces also showing a hint of excitement.

Chen Xu smiled, and then three folders appeared on the large screen.

They were labeled 1, 2, and 3, three different numbers.

“For this expo, we need to bring some new things to meet the players, but the task might be a bit rushed,” Chen Xu said, looking at everyone. “This time, we need to develop two games consecutively, and at the same time, we need to quickly produce a promotional animation for a truly meaningful major title that will come later.”

“Ah!”

Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, Qin Yi, and other veteran Nebula Games employees all looked bewildered.

As for the new employees who had just joined Nebula Games shortly after the New Year, they had expressions that clearly said, “Are you kidding us?”

Two months, making two games, and also taking care of a promotional animation for a major title.

Although everyone understood that a promotional animation for a so-called major title was different from development and could mostly be kept out of the main scope, usually only requiring simple scene design and then hiring a CG animation company for production.

But the key was two games in two months—how was that possible?

Even a donkey from the production team couldn't produce that much!

This included Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and Qin Yi, veteran employees who were quite familiar with Chen Xu's work efficiency, who were equally full of doubts.

If it were just making a playable DEMO for an exhibition, that might be possible.

But from Chen Xu's tone, it felt like he intended to fully develop the entire game content.

Can it be done?

Everyone listened with questions as Chen Xu explained the two new games they were about to develop.

“First up is *Sanguosha*. This is a strategy card battle game, and I've already completed the main rules and gameplay. You can take a quick look.”

As Chen Xu spoke, the corresponding rules for *Sanguosha* appeared on the large screen via the projector.

It was also accompanied by some rough drafts of generals and cards.

“In the game, there are four different factions: Lord, Rebel, Loyalist, and Spy. Players can freely choose their corresponding Three Kingdoms generals, and each general possesses specific skills.”

“Additionally, the game has three types of cards: Basic cards, Equipment cards, and Stratagem cards.”

Chen Xu briefly explained the basic rules and content of *Sanguosha* to help everyone better understand the game.

Time was limited, so Chen Xu didn't go into too much detail.

However, those present weren't completely clueless beginners.

Including Ruan Ningxue, who had participated in several projects since last year and had also undergone a period of learning; combined with the design proposal drafts, she could pretty much understand it.

Everyone quickly imagined the relevant gameplay of this game, although they weren't yet sure what the actual game experience would be like.

But the one thing they could understand was that this game would basically not require much effort.

The main time-consuming aspects would be the game's voice acting and the production of art assets.

And these could be handled by outsourcing.

If one outsourcing company couldn't finish it, then two.

The development difficulty of *Sanguosha* was close to none, so the key lay in the other game, and the aforementioned “major title.”

Everyone looked at Chen Xu, waiting for him to reveal the next project.

Looking at the crowd, Chen Xu smiled: “The next game will be one that allows players to greatly relieve stress and experience unparalleled joy. It can be described as quite harmonious and wholesome.”

If the world were a comic book world, then at this moment, a row of black question marks should have appeared on the foreheads of Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, Qin Yi, and the others.

“Why does that sound so familiar?”
