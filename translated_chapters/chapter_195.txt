Chapter 194: Don't Starve (7th update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)

As the screen displayed the image, everyone's attention was drawn to the `Don't Starve` `Concept Drafts` before them.

In front of the `Concept Drafts`, `Chen Xu` had already completed some simple art illustrations for the game.

In the wilderness, a dishevelled figure sat in front of a campfire, while distant `spiders`, `wild boars`, and other `monsters` slowly approached.

It wasn't colored, but the game's style was immediately apparent.

“Is this a survival type of game?”

“This `art style` is so eerie; the rough lines give it a European and American cartoon style?”

“It's similar to `It Takes Two` and `Overcooked (Chinese title)`. Is it a cooperative type of game?”

Looking at the `Don't Starve` game title and concept art, everyone present was quietly guessing what type of game it actually was.

“Just like the game's name, `Don't Starve`, what `players` need to do in the game is not let themselves die. `Survival` is the sole `core` of the entire game.”

“`Collect` `stone`, `twigs`, `craft` `hunting tools`, climb the `tech tree`, establish your own `camp`, then `explore` the unknown world to `survive` better.”

“Also, in the game, `players` might suffer a `mental breakdown` and go crazy from facing various eerie monsters, `freeze to death` from being too cold, `starve to death` from being too hungry, or die from `attacks` by `wild monsters`.”

`Chen Xu` explained the `core idea` of `Don't Starve` to everyone.

“`Does anyone have any more questions?`” `Chen Xu` asked.

As he finished speaking, `Qin Yi` stroked his chin while looking at the big screen on the `Concept Drafts`: “So this is a `survival game`? But `Mr. Chen`, if it's too difficult, won't `players` `stop playing`?”

`Ruan Ningxue` beside him also nodded: “`That's right, Mr. Chen. Dark Souls` is a `big production` with `top-tier graphics`, `plot`, and `action`. But `Don't Starve` is clearly a `small-scale production` and lacks that external appeal to make `players` `keep playing`. Won't it `turn players away` right from the start?”

“`By the way, why do you all think this is a game that makes you suffer?`” `Chen Xu` was a little speechless.

The slightly eerie `art style`, coupled with it being a `survival game`.

What with `mental breakdowns`, `freezing to death` from cold, `starving to death` from hunger, and `wild monster attacks`,

One could say that from `Chen Xu`'s introduction, it felt like the `protagonist` was `constantly facing` the `threat of death`.

Considering `Dark Souls`, `Silent Hill PT`, and the tear-jerking `The one with the big hammer` that `Chen Xu` developed previously, along with the `Death Mode` recently launched.

`Subconsciously`, they immediately thought of `suffering`.

“`Difficulty` will definitely be present, but unlike `Dark Souls (informal)`, `players` will have choices.” `Chen Xu` explained, a little speechless.

Did he look like the kind of `game designer` who enjoyed tormenting `players`? It was too much; he'd lost all their `trust`!

“`Alright, let me give you a detailed explanation of this game's design direction. The game's core revolves around survival, encouraging players to explore, collect...`”

After `explaining` the `design philosophy` of `Don't Starve` to everyone, they all went back to their respective `work`.

In his `previous life`, `Don't Starve` could be said to be a very unique `small-scale game production`.

Although it was a `small-scale game production`, its `sales volume` was even more astonishing than some `AAA-tier game`s.

`In his previous life`, on the `Steam Platform`, `Don't Starve`'s `sales volume` exceeded ten million.

Later, after being distributed by `Tencent` and launched on the `WeGame Store`, its `sales volume` surpassed one million in the first month, and then quickly exceeded three million in a very short time.

Of course, there were reasons for this booming success. Initially, `Don't Starve` was only a `single-player game`. Although it possessed a `unique charm`, it lacked a `breakout point`.

It wasn't until the release of the `Online Multiplayer Version` that `Don't Starve`'s `sales volume` truly experienced `explosive growth`.

Choosing such a game as the `team`'s next `development project`.

On one hand, it was due to `Don't Starve`'s excellence and charm, and on the other, it was for the future `strategy` of the `Nebula Games Store`.

Using `Don't Starve` as a `touchstone` to gauge `players'` `enthusiasm` for `survival and sandbox games`.

As for `sandbox games`, there were actually many other choices, such as the hugely popular `Valheim` from his `previous life`, and of course, `Minecraft` and `Terraria`.

But considering that `sandbox mode` hadn't yet become popular in the `Parallel World`, although `Chen Xu` had already noticed some `games with sandbox attributes` appearing.

Yet, they hadn't formed an `independent genre`.

`Players` were still relatively unfamiliar with this `game mode`.

`Launching Don't Starve` first was considered a `touchstone`.

Because compared to the `games` mentioned earlier, `Don't Starve` had one most `core characteristic`.

Namely, its objective was very clear.

As a `sandbox game` with a high degree of `freedom`, `new players` entering the game who hadn't played similar titles would very likely be directly `bewildered` and dumbfounded.

`In his previous life`, many `Minecraft players` entered the game and at first couldn't even understand the difference between `Creative (mode)` and `Survival Mode`.

Not to mention all sorts of complex `tools`; many people couldn't even make a `crafting table`.

For most `players` just entering the game, they basically only knew two things: `digging dirt` in place and `chopping down trees`.

Although it was partly related to the `game tutorial`, on the other hand, it was also due to excessive `freedom`, which left `players` who were still `immature` in `sandbox gameplay` feeling `bewildered`.

`Don't Starve`, on the other hand, was more direct, whether it was `survival`, adventure, or `cooperation`.

It immediately told `players` the `game's core`: to `explore` and `gather resources` as much as possible in an unknown world, `build` various `means of production`, and strive to `survive` for the longest time.

This directly gave `players` a `Main Objective`: `survival`.

Centered around this `Main Objective`, `players` wouldn't feel completely `bewildered`, because they would know that their purpose in the game was `survival`, and what they needed to do was achieve this `objective`.

And through this `objective`, `players` would gradually experience the `Gameplay` of a `sandbox game` and discover the rich content within `Don't Starve`.

There were various scene maps, including `plains`, `swamps`, `grasslands`, `mining areas`, `forests`, `caves`, and so on. Different `terrain` would `yield` different `production elements`, and the `monsters` generated on the `terrain` would also vary.

In addition, the game's `basic rules` also included `Season Settings`.

In `spring`, it would rain frequently, and `crops` would `grow` faster than in other `seasons`.

`Summer`, combustibles would undergo `spontaneous combustion`, and the `character's body temperature` would rapidly rise, leading to a `Heatstroke State`.

`Winter`, `crops` would `grow slowly`, the `character's body temperature` would rapidly drop, leading to a `Frostbite State`.

Coupled with certain `Random Map Generation Settings`, every `player's survival journey` would be a different experience.

On the other hand, as a `sandbox game`, another part of the fun came from various `MODs`.

`In his previous life`, `Minecraft` was able to remain long-lasting for over a decade, and various `MODs` could be said to have `played a crucial role`.

In this area, the `Nebula Games Platform`'s `Workshop (modding platform)` had already `laid the foundation` through `Overcooked (Chinese title)` and `Fall Guys`.

Currently, `Overcooked (Chinese title)` and `Fall Guys` still maintained considerable `popularity` among `players`, primarily due to the creation of their `MOD community`.

`Platform users` and the `Workshop (modding platform)` were all in place.

All that remained was to see the `Player Performance Feedback` that `Don't Starve` would bring.
