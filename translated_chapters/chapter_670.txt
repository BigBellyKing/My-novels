Chapter 669: The Answers Soon to Be Revealed (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)

Filled with rage, Zhang Yi fought his way to Comstock's mansion laboratory.

Although there wasn't any time limit or similar constraint in this particular level of the game.

Yet, thinking of Elizabeth who was still suffering, Zhang Yi wasn't willing to waste a single second.

After a fierce battle, the Siphon device, used to paralyze and restrict Elizabeth's abilities, was shut down.

Having regained her powers, an enraged Elizabeth immediately created a massive spatial rift.

On the other side of the spatial rift was a raging tornado, whose immense power instantly sucked in the researchers who had been tormenting Elizabeth.

“Holy cow, that's amazing!” Zhang Yi's eyes widened. He had always felt that Elizabeth was harmless.

The only time Elizabeth had killed someone in the game was when she killed Daisy, the leader of the Vox Populi, earlier.

In his impression, Elizabeth should be more of a support character.

But now, it seemed the power of this spatial rift was far greater than he had imagined.

Elizabeth herself might not possess such immense power, but she could harness the forces of nature.

For example, after opening a spatial rift, behind it could be lava or a storm.

Having successfully rescued Elizabeth and helped her get dressed.

Booker told Elizabeth that he had found a way to control the Songbird, and now he could take Elizabeth away from here.

Whether it was to Paris or anywhere else.

However, this suggestion was rejected by Elizabeth. The things she had experienced and witnessed in the sky city had given her a firm resolve.

‘I won’t leave, I’m going to find Comstock.’

‘Why?’

‘Look what he's done to me. I will never allow something like this to happen again.’

‘And then? Are you going to kill him?’

‘Booker, are you going to start lecturing now? You forgot, I understand you.’

‘I won’t let you kill him.’

‘Really, Booker? Then how will you stop me!’

Elizabeth, putting on her coat, looked resolutely at Booker in front of her.

Behind her, a space tore open, and a terrifying tornado raged there, combining with the lightning in the sky like the end of the world.

Facing such an Elizabeth, Booker, holding his gun, quietly said: “I’m not trying to stop you, I’m going to stop him for you.”

Hearing Booker’s words, Elizabeth retracted her powers. She understood what Booker meant.

Because Booker didn't want her to kill again, especially when the target was her father.

Although Elizabeth had no impression or emotional connection to this father whatsoever.

Then Booker and Elizabeth continued their journey, cutting down anyone in their path as they headed towards Comstock’s private airship.

After pushing open a door, they finally met the so-called Prophet Comstock.

But to Zhang Yi’s surprise, there wasn't the fierce battle he had imagined.

At this moment, Comstock was merely softly calling out to Elizabeth, like a benevolent old man.

‘Child, come here, come now, I won’t bite.’

‘Oh, my, you've grown so big.’

Facing Elizabeth, who walked over, Comstock took her hand.

‘Tell me, what exactly am I?’ Elizabeth asked, looking at Comstock before her.

Facing Elizabeth’s questioning, he merely continued speaking to himself, then looked at Booker.

‘Look at you… child, you're a mess, everything I’ve done was to keep you safe.’

‘DeWitt Booker, I was such a fool. I sent mighty armies to stop you, put you in a hail of bullets from on high, I tried everything to keep you from her, when all I really needed to do was simply tell her the truth.’

‘Ask him… child… ask him what happened to your finger, ask DeWitt Booker.’

‘Ask him! Ask this false shepherd!’

And when Comstock grew emotional and began to lay hands on Elizabeth, accusing Booker of being the true cause of all her suffering.

Booker in the game, unable to contain his rage, stepped forward and grabbed Comstock.

‘She’s your daughter, you beast! You abandoned her! Was it worth it? Did you achieve your goal? Tell me! Tell me!’

‘You imprisoned her for life, cut off her finger, and then blamed all this sin on me!’

The furious Booker held Comstock underwater until he drowned.

Dead?

The mastermind BOSS in the game died so easily?

Watching the now dead Comstock, Zhang Yi in the game was also a bit bewildered.

Even if a BOSS isn't necessarily strong, like the King of the Wild Hunt at the end of The Witcher: Wild Hunt, but there wasn't even a fight?

This minor character was defeated too thoroughly.

However, beyond that, what made Zhang Yi even more curious was the content within the game.

Elizabeth related to Booker?

The reason for Elizabeth's severed finger?

Elizabeth asked Booker, and Booker naturally claimed ignorance.

But at that very moment, Booker began to bleed from his nose.

At this point, Elizabeth seemed to understand something and said to Booker: “You did it, you just forgot.”

Nosebleed, did it but forgot? Extra memories conflicting with past memories, and Parallel Worlds?

Could it be?

Watching the game's plot, Zhang Yi, who suddenly realized something himself, had an incredible thought arise in his mind at that moment.

Could it be that the game's story was truly as he imagined?

Without further questioning Booker, the Vox Populi army attacked.

The two controlled the Songbird to repel the attack from the Vox Populi organization, then commanded the Songbird to completely destroy the Siphon machine.

At this moment, Elizabeth’s powers were completely unleashed. No one knew how many Parallel Worlds she had seen, no one knew what she had truly learned.

When the Songbird tried to attack Booker and her, Elizabeth, having completely unleashed all her powers, simply waved her hand.

Booker, she, and the Songbird were all teleported to another timespace.

A city located deep beneath the sea.

However, it appeared to have been ravaged by war. From the surrounding buildings and facilities, it was clear that this was a world no less magnificent than Columbia, the Sky City.

“So, could this be a new scene, a new map in the upcoming sequel?”

The mysterious underwater city before him greatly surprised Zhang Yi, especially since he already knew that, besides this game, BioShock Infinite.

Nebula Games would also launch the sequel to BioShock in half a month.

It must be said, this underwater city was simply too cool.

Although it didn't appear as prosperous as Columbia, the Sky City.

It was clearly a city ravaged by war.

So, what kind of scene and imagery would this mysterious underwater city have been like during its most prosperous period?

However, Zhang Yi's attention quickly returned to the game, because the various secrets within BioShock Infinite were about to be revealed.

Zhang Yi had a premonition that the questions that had plagued him would soon be answered.
