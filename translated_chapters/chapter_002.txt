Chapter 2: Wow, Golden Legend!

Chen Xu glanced at the virtual screen in front of him. The content displayed was extremely concise and clear.

There was an instruction button, a gashapon machine-like device filled with gashapon, and a reward list next to it, detailing the prizes: [Common Professional Skill Book], [Rare Professional Skill Book], [Special Item].
Below that was a line of numbers: 473451.

First, he clicked on the instructions, and Chen Xu quickly got the information he wanted.

Clearly, this system was his Golden Finger, no doubt about it.

It was a very simple lottery system, which naturally required points.
The source of these points was also very simple: when his works allowed players, viewers, readers, listeners, and others to become immersed and feel happiness, joy, excitement, sadness, anger, fear, etc., they would earn corresponding Emotion Points.
These could be converted into points for drawing prizes. And these more than 400,000 Emotion Points before him.
Were accumulated by Chen Xu in his previous life.

Seeing this, Chen Xu felt a twinge of regret.

“If I had known this, why did I bother with level and Plot Design back then? Event Planning would have been so much better,” Chen Xu mused with a touch of regret.

Unlike the Parallel World, where players would directly curse the Game Designer if they were unhappy,
In his previous life, Game Planners were always the scapegoats.

Favorite character's numerical design nerfed? Dog Planner!
Favorite character got a tragic ending? Dog Planner!
Favorite game server crashed? Dog Planner!
No matter if it was actually the planner's fault or not, cursing them was always the safe bet.

“100,000 for one draw? A ten-draw costing 1,000,000 with no discount is bad enough, but there isn't even a free bonus draw? Pig Factory games aren't as exploitative as you!” Chen Xu had originally thought he had plenty of points, but when he saw the cost of a draw, he fell silent.

So, his more than 400,000 points only allowed him four single draws in total?

Although he complained verbally, Chen Xu's hands didn't stop; he immediately started drawing.
He cleanly pulled the joystick four times, and Chen Xu watched as the gashapon machine whirred, and four gashapon dropped out.

Then, a golden light erupted from the four eggs.
Originally, Chen Xu hadn't expected to get anything good, after all, he only had four chances.
And there were only three possible options that could come out of these gashapon.
But now?

‘Wow! Golden Legend!’
Chen Xu mentally dubbed the scene, his face full of anticipation.

And then...
Common Professional Skill Book * 2, Rare Professional Skill Book * 1, Memory Capsule * 1

Looking at the four items in front of him, Chen Xu was utterly speechless.

This damn golden light was just a simple unboxing... no, an egg-opening effect, wasn't it?
System, you really are something!

Chen Xu grumbled internally, but his hand still reached for the Common Professional Skill Book.

Next, Chen Xu saw the skill book transform into a cluster of purple, star-like light points that merged into his body, along with a prompt.
‘Plot Design +1’

As the purple light surged in, Chen Xu felt his thoughts become incredibly clear, and he seemed to grasp some of the original arrangements for story pacing.

This feeling was quite wonderful, much like doing math problems in school, where he'd be stumped by a question.
But then he'd see a related mathematical formula, and everything would suddenly become clear.

Then Chen Xu clicked on the other two books.
‘Music +1, Painting Skill +5’

Music was from a Common Professional Skill Book, while Painting Skill was from a Rare Professional Skill Book.
The degree of increase was different. Whether this was due to different classifications or simply different numerical values, he didn't know.
After all, he didn't have enough points to experiment and conclude.

Finally, Chen Xu's gaze fell upon the last item he had drawn.
‘Memory Capsule: After use, can retrieve deeply hidden memories within 1 hour.’

Looking at the Memory Capsule, Chen Xu showed a surprised expression.
This is good!

This was equivalent to a time-limited Photographic Memory.

In his previous life, as someone in the gaming industry, Chen Xu could be said to have played countless games, and more than just playing, he researched them.

Taking the famous game The Last of Us as an example, an ordinary player would exclaim, ‘Wow, amazing!’ ‘Ah, scary!’ ‘No, I'm dead!’

But for a Gaming Industry Professional like Chen Xu, it required multi-faceted thinking and research.
For instance, why was the story told in this manner? Was the monster distribution reasonable? Why were the map and related covers placed in such a way? How should hidden details be subtly hinted at for players to discover?

Therefore, with this Memory Capsule, Chen Xu could now reconstruct some past games in his mind to the greatest extent possible.

The Memory Capsule was temporarily placed in his inventory; Chen Xu planned to save it for now.
Before developing his first game, there was still some preparatory work to be done.

For example, understanding the usage of the Official Game Engine, conducting research on the relevant game market, identifying mainstream game genres at the current stage, and determining which platforms to release the game on when it launched.
All of these required advance preparation.

“Hmm, let me take a look!” Closing the system, Chen Xu sat in front of his computer, typing on the keyboard, searching for the content he wanted.

First, he took a look at the game engine tools in the Parallel World.

Because he had previously helped game companies with outsourced Concept Art Production,
Chen Xu already had the Official Game Engine software on his computer and had long since registered an account.

In the Parallel World, this area was relatively mature.
For example, art Concept Art Production, modeling, Music, and even Voice Actors could all be found through the platform within the game engine.

“Hmm, it's not very difficult, nor is it cumbersome, but there are just too few resources,” he noted.

Chen Xu browsed through the introductory video in fast-forward mode, and at the same time, he searched online for corresponding text descriptions.
He now had a general understanding of game engines; they weren't too difficult to get started with.

Next up were the platforms. The flourishing development of the Cultural Industry also brought about a crackdown on piracy, and games developed using game engines completely eliminated piracy from a technical standpoint.

Of course, while there was no piracy, the industry competition was also considerable.
As for game platforms, they were not much different from his previous life, with both domestic and international options.

However, unlike his previous life where one foreign platform dominated, in the Parallel World, foreign platforms didn't wield as much influence; instead, domestic game platforms were the mainstream.

This was primarily because, unlike his previous life where domestic games often depicted blood as green or gray and skeletons had to have flesh, Real-Name Authentication was fully universal in the Parallel World, and cultural products also had corresponding Rating Systems.

For example, games like The Witcher 3 and GTA, which had virtually a 0% chance of passing review in his previous life, could completely pass review in the Parallel World, though they would certainly be rated 18R.
