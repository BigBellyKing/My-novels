Chapter 49: I'm a Tough Guy! What Am I Afraid Of!

Listening to the rustling wind in his headphones, and then glancing at the Asylum far away on the screen.

Sun Yixie fell silent for a moment.

“Before I play this game, I want to ask everyone, if… I mean, if I say I have some difficulties right now, can I not play?”

“Alright, then… then can I go turn on the light? Don't worry.”

After speaking, Sun Yixie stood up, leaned forward, and clicked the light switch.

The next moment, in the camera's view, a room that looked a bit like a storage room lit up.

Immediately, the bullet comments in the live streaming room started to flood in.

“????????? Cowardly and lecherous Sun Yixie!”

“Didn't you say playing horror games was as easy as breathing?”

“Turning on the lights already, are you scared already?”

“23333333, Brother Sun, if you really can't do it, let's wait for Brother Huang to come back and play together, at least you'll have company.”

“2333333, as easy as breathing, so why did Brother Sun turn on the lights?”

“Turn off the lights! Turn off the lights!”

“Turn off the lights! Turn off the lights!”

“Turn off the lights! Turn off the lights!”

Following Sun Yixie's act of turning on the lights, the screen full of bullet comments eventually unified into a single message.

And that was ‘Turn off the lights! Turn off the lights!’.

“Turn off what lights?! What the heck, why turn off the lights! Shut up!”

“I'm going to say it one more time, horror games are like breathing to me, absolutely no pressure, of course, I occasionally get startled.”

“But it's just a tiny bit of tension.”

Looking at the bullet comments in the live streaming room, Sun Yixie tried to use external factors to alleviate his panic.

Sitting back down in his chair and putting on his headphones, Sun Yixie officially started the game.

Through some of the game's previous explanations, he also understood some basic content.

That is, in *Outlast*, he plays an unarmed reporter.

Generally, horror games are divided into two types.

One type has a combat system, meaning players can use firearms or other weapons to kill monsters or BOSSes.

The other type has no combat system, where players solve puzzles, run, and avoid monsters.

Currently, the first type is mainstream in the market, while the second type, though it exists, is not mainstream.

At least there are few big productions, and the *Outlast* before him was clearly a major production in the horror game genre.

Sun Yixie could feel it just from the scenes and atmosphere.

The graphics, compared to an AAA-tier game, certainly had a considerable gap.

But it was also presented quite realistically.

And as a horror game, this realistic immersion easily made people a little nervous.

“Darn it, I'm not scared! How could I be scared, don't rush me, let me check the controls first.”

Sun Yixie looked at the secondary screen, trying to interact with the bullet comments to relieve some pressure.

Inside the unmanned guard post at the entrance, he found a battery.

After searching the main entrance, Sun Yixie found a few items in total.

A DV camera, a battery, and a blue folder.

“This should be what we use to replace the flashlight later, right?”

Sun Yixie pulled out the DV camera, put in the battery, and turned it on.

Looking at the extremely eerie fluorescent green screen, Sun Yixie, as a game streamer, had played quite a few games.

Seeing the DV camera's settings, he pretty much guessed some things.

Later, there would likely be some dark environments, and he would have to use this DV camera to find his way.

He spoke confidently, but deep down, he was still a little nervous.

After confirming there was nothing else to explore, Sun Yixie pushed open the large iron gate and stepped into the courtyard.

With a European architectural style, the entire Asylum was incredibly silent, and through the windows, he could see the lights in some rooms of the building flickering on and off.

It was as if a pair of eyes was watching him from one of the lit rooms.

Controlling the protagonist to advance along the small path, Sun Yixie's footsteps suddenly stopped.

Because in the Mount Massive Asylum before him, the lights on one floor suddenly turned on, and at the same time, a black figure appeared at the window.

His eyes, originally like slits, suddenly widened.

Sun Yixie controlled the protagonist to open the camera and use its zoom function to look, preparing to get a glimpse of what that thing was.

But the other party seemed to have noticed someone watching him, and instantly darted to the side.

From his perspective, he only saw a blurry black shadow.

At the same time, the room's lights were turned off again.

Immediately, Sun Yixie felt a chill run from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head.

Nothing had happened, and he hadn't even seen any terrifying monsters.

But he just felt a little nervous inside.

The Mount Massive Asylum before him was like a monster with its jaws wide open, waiting for him to enter.

Moreover, the surrounding environment and layout were very strange, especially the riot police vehicles at the main entrance, which made him feel particularly odd.

Why would there be riot police vehicles at the entrance of an Asylum?

He walked to the main gate of the Asylum and found it was locked and couldn't be opened.

After wandering around for a bit, Sun Yixie finally found a small hole in the iron gate on the left and squeezed through.

Next came a series of in-game operation prompts.

Actions like running, jumping, climbing, and crouching.

And the game's camera and details were also very well done, something Sun Yixie hadn't experienced in previous horror games.

Through his headphones, he could clearly hear the protagonist's heavy breathing.

Following the operation prompts, he reached a window, and just as he climbed in, all the lights in the room suddenly went out.

The entire room plunged into darkness.

At the same time, Sun Yixie, who was playing the game, flinched at the sudden darkness.

“233333, what did I just see?”

“Haha, Brother Sun actually has eyes!”

“I'm dying of laughter, Brother Sun seemed to flinch just now, didn't he?”

“Brother Sun, if you're scared, just say so!”

Seeing Sun Yixie's reaction, the bullet comments in the live streaming room also started flooding in with various messages.

Compared to his usual streams, today's bullet comments were more numerous, clearly indicating that many viewers were also scared and sending messages to alleviate their fear.

“D-darn it! What's there to be scared of?! I'm a tough guy! What am I afraid of?! There's nothing to be afraid of!”

After turning on the DV camera's night vision mode, the ghastly green tint of the screen made the entire game atmosphere even more eerie.

Sun Yixie encouraged himself by shouting loudly while holding the camera and beginning to explore.

Pulling open a slightly ajar door, Sun Yixie walked forward.

Suddenly, the television, which was off, automatically turned on, emitting a sharp noise.

“Ahhh!”

This sharp noise immediately startled Sun Yixie.

Sun Yixie, seen on camera, trembled all over from fright, accompanied by a world-class tenor's shout. He kicked the table with his legs, sending his wheeled chair rolling backward, while simultaneously covering his eyes with both hands and slumping back into the chair.

After a few seconds, realizing there seemed to be no further sound in his headphones, he parted his hands, which were covering his face, just a little, and peeked at the computer screen through the small gap with the corner of his eye.

In the pitch-black room in the game, there was only a static-filled television.

After confirming there was no danger, Sun Yixie finally lowered his hands, moving them from covering his face to covering his chest, a look of immense relief on his face.
