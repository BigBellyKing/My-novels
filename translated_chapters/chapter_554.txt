Chapter 553: Resident Evil Village (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

There were still some cheers and screams at the scene.

But in terms of decibels, it was clearly quite a bit less than before.

All the players, especially those who had just been lamenting that Mr. Chen had truly changed, now only felt one thing: their ‘youth’ was back!

Mr. Chen was indeed still Mr. Chen, consistently adhering to his love as always. After two consecutive cheerful games, just when everyone thought he had changed, his fangs were bared again!

As the news from the direct presentation approached night, he served them a horror film? Was he afraid they’d be too excited on their way home, and deliberately trying to cool them down?

Innumerable people complained inwardly, but their eyes were fixed on everything before them. After all, while Resident Evil scared many people out of their wits, its excellent game quality and story also attracted many players.

On the holographic projection in front, Ethan appeared, though with his back to the players. He was currently sitting on a chair, and his voice reappeared.

“It’s been three years since the Baker family incident.”

“I was looking for my wife back then, and one day… I received an email from her.”

“So I went to find her… in Louisiana.”

“In a rural farmhouse, I found her… but something was off about her.”

The moment Ethan’s voice fell, the holographic projection in front suddenly transformed into Mia’s ferocious appearance.

“She attacked me like a wild animal.”

It seemed as if she was about to charge directly towards the players. Despite being just a holographic projection, coupled with the darkening sky, many players were greatly startled, causing continuous screams from the audience.

“Later, I discovered she was infected with a special mold. I searched for an antidote or something similar in that house, and everyone living there was infected.”

“They had completely lost their humanity.”

On the holographic projection appeared the ‘kindly’ Baker family, with Jack Baker.

“The source of that infection was a little girl named Evelyn.”

“I fought that incurable family and cured Mia with a serum.”

“Later, Chris and his comrades appeared and saved Mia and me.”

“Thankfully, all of that was over.”

The scene returned to the dim little room, and Ethan sighed in relief, as if a great weight had been lifted.

But all the players at the scene were extremely nervous.

All over? This was practically a textbook example of jinxing oneself! It was like a minor foot soldier saying the classic line before a battle: “I’ll go home and get married after this war.” If it could end that easily, something was definitely up!

However, just as many players mentally prepared themselves for an intense moment, something that caught them off guard happened. There was no frightening jump scare; instead, an exquisite 3D fairy tale book appeared.

Many players immediately recognized it as the cover Mr. Chen Xu had posted online before the carnival. But what did this have to do with Resident Evil’s story?

As everyone watched in surprise, a familiar, gentle female voice spoke.

It was Mia’s voice!

Many players who had played Resident Evil immediately recognized it.

“Once upon a time…”

“There was a little girl and her mother who went into the forest to pick berries for her hard-working father.”

“But the forest was cold and silent, the bushes empty…”

As Mia’s voice spoke, the fairy tale book before them made a rustling sound. The pages began to turn, and corresponding images appeared: cartoon-style black shadows, a silent and eerie mountain forest, and a slender figure holding a child’s hand.

“The mischievous girl decided to find the berries, so she broke free from her mother’s hand and ran deep into the forest.”

The little girl pointed towards the deeper forest, then pulled her hand away, skipping and hurrying along a path formed by vines. Her mother called out repeatedly behind her, but the little girl was so fast that she disappeared from her mother’s sight in the blink of an eye.

“She passed through the forest, leaped over vines, her mother’s voice growing fainter and fainter, until she ran deep into the jungle.”

“The little girl felt a strange gaze.”

The little girl, who had been skipping happily, slowed down as she reached the depths of the jungle, seemingly feeling scared.

“The girl remembered the scary stories her mother told her before bed every day, and nervousness made her mouth dry.”

Suddenly, a huge fruit on a strange branch caught the little girl’s attention. But before she could get close, the fruit split open. It was a gigantic, upside-down bat! Startled, the little girl quickly backed away. And then the bat spoke.

“Come, child, quench your thirst.”

The Bat Lord kindly greeted the little girl, and as it spoke, it bit through its own wing, and golden blood flowed out. The little girl looked at the golden blood and stretched out her hands to catch it.

“She happily drank the cupped blood and laughed.”

Then the leaves rustled, and the little girl came to a graveyard.

“As she passed a graveyard, dark clouds suddenly gathered and lightning flashed, and the air became bone-chillingly cold.”

“The little girl was thinly dressed and shivered with cold.”

Walking through the graveyard, the little girl huddled herself. Then, a cloaked skeleton monster with four withered arms, the Dark Weaver, appeared before the little girl.

“Then the Dark Weaver appeared, and in a flash, wove a beautiful dress from mist.”

“Come, child, put it on and warm yourself.”

The little girl took the dress, put it on, and happily twirled around.

Next, thick darkness swallowed everything. Countless golden fish appeared, and the camera followed the golden fish through an underwater canyon. A massive, fat-headed fish appeared. Its body was covered in golden, lantern-like eyes, looking extremely bizarre.

“The little girl drifted in a small boat on ominous dark waters, wanting to find her way home.”

“But she was famished and heavy-hearted…”

On the sea surface, the little girl stood on a swaying boat, trying to fish out small fish from the water. But just then, waves surged, and the gigantic Deep Sea Fish King appeared, peeling off a scale from its body.

“Come, child, fill your hunger…”

The little girl happily took the golden scale and ate it, and her smile shone brightly again.

The pages turned, and the scene grew darker and darker.

“Next, the little girl soon arrived at the dark heart of the forest.”

A glimmer of light appeared in the dark scene. It was a fantastical world composed of chains and gears. Then an Iron Warhorse appeared out of nowhere, running around the little girl, with a conspicuous golden gear on its head.

“The little girl walked towards the warhorse; it remained silent…”

“So the little girl thought the golden gear was also a gift and took it away.”

Hiss…

The warhorse was enraged, fury erupting from its nostrils, and red light seeped from its eyes.

“The warhorse’s rage soared to the heavens, and it summoned the previous monsters.”

The Bat Lord, Dark Weaver, and Deep Sea Fish King appeared beside the warhorse.

“Fierce winds rose around the monsters, and the little girl grew more and more afraid.”

The four monsters continuously pressed closer to the little girl. But then a thick fog enveloped the four monsters. The next moment, when the fog dissipated, the four monsters had transformed into a tall, mysterious witch, dark and solemn.

“The more you are given! The more you desire! The greater the cost!”

Accompanied by the witch’s cry, the pages began to frantically flip before closing. On the book cover, which players couldn’t clearly see before, the golden game title was revealed.
