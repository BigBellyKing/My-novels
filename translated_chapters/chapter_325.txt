Chapter 324: For the Players, I Can Endure (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

“Damn it! That's absolutely incredible!”

Following the video's final curtain, Song Ren's voice, filled with shock, came through the voice channel.

“This is called Call of Duty: Modern Warfare? This must be World War! It's too insane!” Zhang Yi also spoke up in response at this moment.

At the same time, he couldn't help but click replay.

This short promotional video, less than two minutes long, brought him an overwhelming sense of shock.

This video was not only broadcast domestically but also overseas.

After all, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is a cornerstone title for Cosmic VR devices.

What it's competing for is not just the domestic market, but the global market.

This time, the overseas publisher was still Target Software.

However, there was one slight difference from before.

That is, Target Software is now in the shape of Nebula Games.

Simply put, Nebula Games acquired a portion of Target Software's shares and is now the largest shareholder.

If it came to selling, Target Software certainly wouldn't want to, as its profits were steadily increasing.

But the key point was that the majority of Target Software's overseas revenue came from Nebula Games' titles.

And now that Nebula Games had proposed this plan, not agreeing was certainly an option, but future collaborations would be difficult.

So Target Software deliberated and thought, 'Why don't we just sell?'

It's just becoming the shape of Nebula Games, and once we adapt, it might even be more comfortable.

With strong promotion, this promotional trailer also landed on major overseas video websites, accompanied by multi-language subtitles.

Overseas players were also incredibly excited by it.

After all, Nebula Games was no longer an unknown entity.

Earlier titles like Dark Souls, followed by Minecraft, Monster Hunter: World, Warcraft, and the recent Rainbow Six Siege, all received significant attention overseas.

At the same time, the three most popular game genres among overseas audiences were: guns, cars, and balls.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare belonged to the broadest genre: guns.

These explosive scenes instantly ignited the passion of countless overseas players.

Especially those scenes that could be described as insane, they sparked widespread discussion globally.

Domestic players.

“My God! Is this Chen Xu's new game? It's absolutely insane!”

“I can only say I'm buying it like crazy! And it feels like a completely different style from Rainbow Six Siege!”

“The White House falling, the Eiffel Tower collapsing, the space station disintegrating, cities nuked – is there anything Chen Xu wouldn't dare to do!?”

“Yes! Chen Xu wouldn't dare to set the background domestically! Forget about blowing up famous buildings, Chen Xu wouldn't even dare to destroy flowers and grass!”

“Ahem, be a bit more farsighted! It's not that Mr. Chen wouldn't dare, but it's a requirement for the bigger picture. After all, Cosmic VR aims to capture the global market, so setting the background overseas is mainly to better conquer the overseas market, isn't it?”

“Don't worry about all that, I'm more curious about the gameplay content of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Is it more focused on multiplayer or single-player?”

“Multiplayer and single-player, I don't know, I just hope it's satisfying. Rainbow Six Siege is fun, but I really can't play it.”

“Can't play it +1. I'm still alive, but I'm more useful watching cameras after dying.”

Similarly, many people were discussing it overseas.

“Atrai just revealed the promotional video for Storm Action, and Nebula Games immediately released content for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. That's so cool!”

“Haha, exactly. The confrontation between Zeus and Cosmic. I was originally going to buy Zeus, but now I have to say I'll have to wait and see. The Call of Duty: Modern Warfare trailer is just too cool!”

“But seriously, won't this company's promotional video turn out to be a misleading promotion/scam? I've been fooled many times before.”

“Friend, do you know Dark Souls, Warcraft, Minecraft, and Rainbow Six Siege? These games are all from Nebula Games, and they never fake things in their promotional videos.”

“Yes, I specifically went to a China website to learn more about this game company, especially their BOSS, who is also the lead designer for these games. In China, he has a nickname called 'Warrior of Love,' meaning that every game he makes contains his love for the players, so he would never do anything to make players uncomfortable.”

“My God, that's so cool! But even so, to be honest, I'll have to wait for the game to come out before drawing conclusions. Still, I have to say I'm even more excited for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare now.”

Clearly, the quality of this game's CGI was absolutely world-class, letting many players understand the meaning of 'Ten Years of Game Development, Nine Years of CG'.

But while it was cool, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare didn't show much in terms of gameplay, and many players didn't understand what kind of game it actually was.

This was also within Chen Xu's expectations; the promotional video was mainly to stir up players' enthusiasm.

To let players know what kind of explosive content this game, named Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, would have.

………………

News about Call of Duty: Modern Warfare spread worldwide.

Players engaged in various discussions.

At this time, Chen Xu was in Nebula Games' office, arranging story content with his team.

For the game's story, Chen Xu adopted two presentation modes.

The first was pre-rendered CG cutscenes.

For example, when a scene switch required pre-loading, CG cutscenes would be used to convey the story's plot to players.

The second was real-time story events.

This meant that players in game levels would communicate with their teammates to reveal the game's plot.

Rather than clearing a level and then playing a real-time rendered animation.

Doing this had both advantages and disadvantages.

The advantage was a smoother player experience.

The disadvantage was that if players weren't paying attention, for instance, scratching one's foot midway, and an NPC character was speaking in the game at that moment.

Then some content might be missed.

There was no good solution for this, as everything has its pros and cons.

A choice had to be made between the two.

Chen Xu's choice was to make the player's game experience smoother.

Moreover, for VR games themselves, players' concentration tends to be higher than in PC platform games.

To some extent, this also compensated for some of the drawbacks.

What remained was the story aspect.

“Mr. Chen, if this story is written, players will probably send you razor blades again!”

Yang Xin, responsible for enriching the story in the office, couldn't help but sigh with emotion as she looked at the outline summary.

Because it was truly too heart-wrenching.

Just the highlighted points and script content were enough to make her, being a bit emotional, feel uncomfortable.

And when made into a VR game, with that high sense of immersion.

Players' emotions would definitely explode!

“There's no other way. All of this is to bring players a better gaming experience. For the players, I can endure these misunderstandings.”

Chen Xu said with a smile.

Send razor blades?

Express delivery companies wouldn't even deliver them!

Moreover, Nebula Games' security forces had been strengthened before the New Year.
