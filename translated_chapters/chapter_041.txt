Chapter 41: Final Verdict

As time progressed, the sales of *To the Moon* gradually increased.

At the same time, numerous domestic media outlets that had been following this event also published articles.

*An Unforgettable Love, 'To the Moon' - A Game That Will Bring You To Tears!*

*Game Review: A Game That Touches Your Soul!*

*Sci-Fi Game Design Competition Favorite, Can 'To the Moon' Really Be Considered a Sci-Fi Game?*

*A Game That Makes Countless Tough Guys Cry*

A week after the Sci-Fi Game Design Competition began, it was already very clear which games could contend for awards and which could not.

Some games that were merely there to participate and make an appearance didn't really make much of a splash.

As for the games aspiring to win awards, by now, many players, including game designers in the industry, are well aware of them.

The first prize was essentially a contest between *To the Moon* and *Galaxy Heroes* from NetDragon's Jianhuolei Studio.

In the player voting section, *To the Moon* significantly surpassed Jianhuolei Studio's *Galaxy Heroes*.

However, this wasn't solely based on player evaluations; the official review by the Game Department was also quite important.

Although *To the Moon* held some advantages,

It hadn't reached a crushing victory yet.

So, it still depended on the official scores.

Players had also been endlessly debating these two games online during this period.

'The final winner will definitely be *Galaxy Heroes*. I admit *To the Moon* has a good story, but it has no gameplay at all, so can it even be considered a game? Or a sci-fi game?'

'I second the comment above! *Galaxy Heroes* truly deserves to win!'

'Oh, come on, what do you mean by gameplay? Translate that for me, dammit! Isn't story a form of gameplay? Isn't music a form of gameplay? Does it only count as gameplay if you're fighting monsters and solving puzzles?'

'Exactly! If *To the Moon* isn't considered a sci-fi game, then a huge number of entries shouldn't be either. So, tell the Game Department to remove them all then.'

'La la la, I'm not listening! My vote went to *To the Moon* anyway!'

'Hehe, victory surely belongs to *Galaxy Heroes*!'

'That's right, *Galaxy Heroes* will definitely clinch the final victory!'

'Hmph, what *Galaxy Heroes*? Look at the game designer's name, 'Meng Zuo' – isn't that just dreaming? If he wants to win first prize, he'll probably only get it in his dreams!'

'Damn, bro, your angle of interpretation is incredibly sharp!'

'By the way, are you all so sure that *To the Moon* and *Galaxy Heroes* are the only contenders? Are you looking down on *Beast of Darkness* made by my Great Demon King?'

'Hehe, don't look at how *To the Moon* and *Galaxy Heroes*' player votes far exceed other games right now. I have a hunch that the final winner will be *Ashaji* from Black Lily Studio!'

'The two above, it's not night yet, please stop daydreaming. Could you cleanly and smoothly exit, please?'

'+1, those two above, please exit smoothly!'

Every player had their own favorite, and with the true results not yet revealed,

Naturally, everyone wanted to gain an advantage in the various communities.

However, it was mostly a case of 'both sides have a point.'

Compared to all the discussions and heated debates online among players,

Chen Xu, at this moment, was much calmer.

...

Nebula Games' office.

Chen Xu sat in the office, calling to inform candidates of the interview results.

Candidates for art and music had already been found.

However, for numerical and level design, several people had been interviewed, but none had particularly satisfied Chen Xu.

"Chen Xu, why aren't you worried at all?" Yang Xin, next to him, watched Chen Xu finish his call, then stood up from her chair and walked around the office twice.

"Yeah, I think the winners are being announced today, right?" Ruan Ningxue was also a little excited at this moment.

This was the third game she had participated in developing.

Regarding the gaming industry, she was no longer the clueless person she once was.

As for her plan to become a doujinshi queen and then a cartoonist, that had also been put aside.

On one hand, it was because she had experienced the joy that games brought.

On the other hand, Nebula Games was developing so well, what manga would she still be thinking about?

"Even if I were anxious, it wouldn't help! The final outcome isn't something I can control," Chen Xu said, feeling a bit speechless after hearing Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue.

Of course, he hoped to win an award, but the key was that it wasn't up to him, right?

"Oh, right, let's release the mobile version of *Undertale* once the winners are announced today," Chen Xu said, remembering something. "Based on current trends, a top-two finish is pretty much guaranteed. Whether we get first prize or not, there'll definitely be a buzz, so we'll capitalize on our own momentum then."

During the period *To the Moon* was entered into the competition, Nebula Games' main internal work focused on two areas.

The mobile port of *Undertale* didn't take much effort; it had already been completed a while ago.

It was just held back until now to piggyback on their own buzz.

The other aspect was the formation of the Nebula Games team.

Apart from the R&D team, Chen Xu was preparing to expand.

Other departments throughout the company were also expanding during this period.

Operations, finance, HR – the basic structure was already in place.

Additionally, there was the platform development team.

Although currently, Nebula Games was seen as a small workshop by most players and within the gaming industry.

From *Mirror (Game)* to *Undertale* and then to *To the Moon*, they hadn't produced any blockbusters, mostly small-scale independent games.

But for Chen Xu, his ambitions clearly didn't stop there.

In the future, Nebula Games was bound to venture into a broader world.

Building their own platform now was a step towards solidifying their own foundation.

As for whether it would attract attention from the industry.

To put it bluntly, Nebula Games was nothing right now.

Even if *To the Moon* took first place in this competition, it would at most create a ripple in the independent game scene.

And then make an appearance in the broader gaming circle.

As for provoking caution or animosity from giants,

One could only say that was overthinking it.

Moreover, such self-operated platforms were quite common.

After all, establishing a platform didn't automatically mean establishing a distribution channel.

You still needed people to build it with you and to have enough popularity.

For some second and third-tier developers, and many independent game producers and companies, especially those with series and solid fan bases,

They all had self-operated platforms, because launching on third-party platforms meant paying others.

Whereas with a self-operated platform, if players bought from their own platform,

Besides taxes, it was pure profit.

At the same time, amidst all the online discussions among players, this Sci-Fi Game Design Competition reached its final verdict with an official announcement from the Game Department.
