Chapter 337: Remember, No Russian (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

However, this thought didn't last long, as Zhang Yi was quickly captivated by the current level.

He found himself standing with Soap on a cliff edge, an area barely two meters wide. Thick snow covered the ground, and one more step forward would lead to a bottomless abyss. The path ahead was even more treacherous, a narrow trail allowing only one person to pass sideways.

"Holy cow!" he exclaimed, his legs instantly turning to jelly.

As a player with a slight fear of heights, this scene was genuinely overwhelming. While the previous Call of Duty: Modern Warfare also featured high-altitude perspectives, they were mostly within aircraft or similar settings, allowing him to constantly shoot and divert his attention. But now? His legs were truly weak.

Especially with the incredibly high VR immersion of the new era, he felt utterly shaken. The glacier climbing sequence, with the ice axe striking the ice and the cracks appearing, sent shivers down his spine.

Continuing slowly towards the cliff top. In the strong winds, Soap and Roach reached a broken cliff face. To continue climbing, they had to leap across this chasm.

As the team leader, Soap was already a seasoned veteran. With a leap, accompanied by a 'crack,' his ice axe firmly dug into the ice, and he climbed onto the upper section. Taking a deep breath, Zhang Yi, watching Soap waving at him, also controlled Roach to jump.

However, compared to Soap's uneventful crossing, Roach was clearly much less fortunate. The ice axe, plunged into the ice, immediately showed a terrifying crack. The ice couldn't support Roach's weight and shattered. "Damn it, I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die!" The sudden development sent a jolt through Zhang Yi's heart. He glanced down at the bottomless cliff, and his legs completely gave out.

But at that very moment, as snow cascaded down from above, a man, gripping his ice axe with one hand, grabbed Roach. 'Gotcha!' The familiar words came from Soap, who then tilted his head. Roach in the game quickly plunged his ice axe into the ice and climbed up. At this point, Zhang Yi felt a prickling sensation on his scalp.

These words felt eerily familiar; Captain Price had saved Soap in the same way in the first installment! Combined with the fact that he had controlled Soap as the protagonist in the first game, the emotional connection between the character and player was instantly forged. It was an incredibly wonderful feeling.

As Soap and Roach infiltrated deeper into enemy territory, that familiar feeling filled Zhang Yi with immense excitement. During combat, teammates on the walkie-talkie provided directions. During an escape, they helped clear obstacles. When falling into a trap, teammates were his last line of defense.

What made Zhang Yi feel even more exhilarated was the combat itself. He felt that compared to the previous game, there were more options. Suppressed rifles, heartbeat sensors, and thermal scopes were essential for stealth. In the blizzard, Roach and Soap were like ghosts in the snow, penetrating deep into enemy territory.

Deep inside the military base, Roach successfully located their target. However, in the end, Soap was discovered by enemies in the warehouse. But Soap remained unfazed, because there was a Plan B. As Roach pressed the detonator, the bombs already deployed outside exploded. While the enemies were distracted by the explosion, Roach and Soap began their counterattack.

The two met up and retreated under the cover of the blizzard. But due to the blizzard and the excessive air defense equipment at the enemy base, the rescue plane could only land on another mountain peak. Here, a desperate chase unfolded: Roach and Soap commandeered a snowmobile and embarked on a life-or-death escape. Especially at the end, controlling Roach's snowmobile, Zhang Yi floored the accelerator, charging madly towards a jagged cliff, leaping over it like a bird with wings. This instantly sent Zhang Yi's adrenaline soaring.

Ten days of waiting! This thrilling sensation was exactly what he wanted! However, after this exhilarating experience, the next level once again left him feeling profoundly shocked. It was an even greater shock than the nuclear explosion scene in the previous game.

………………

Zakhaev Airport. This time, Zhang Yi's perspective shifted to Joseph Allen. However, he was now named Alexei Borodin, his undercover alias. [Note: The content of this level may cause discomfort. Would you like to skip it, or play it as a CG video?]

Below were three options: Skip, Play Video, and No. What did this mean? Was this level particularly special? Wasn't it already an adult-rated game? Zhang Yi was somewhat puzzled but still chose 'No'. For a game that could be called groundbreaking, he didn't want to miss any details.

The scene appeared, inside an elevator. Next to him were a group of teammates, one of whom Zhang Yi recognized: Makarov! He had seen his photo in the previous Operation Croaker. Now, everyone held a machine gun and wore bulletproof vests, seemingly preparing for an operation.

'Remember, no Russian!' Makarov turned to face them. At that moment, the elevator doors opened.

Outside was the waiting hall, a spacious area where countless ordinary civilians stood densely packed, their voices a bit noisy but generally orderly. But with the appearance of Makarov and his men, order was shattered. To Zhang Yi's dumbfounded disbelief, and amidst the terrified screams of the civilians in the game, Makarov and his subordinates raised their guns and began sweeping the crowd.

Zhang Yi had never imagined there would be such a scene in a game. Watching Makarov and his group massacre civilians, Zhang Yi subconsciously raised his gun towards them. He fired. If it had been before, shooting at teammates would have immediately led to a
