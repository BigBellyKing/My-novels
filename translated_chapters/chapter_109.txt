Chapter 109: Good Luck, Players\n\nAs the Coiled Sword was pulled from Ash Judgment Gundyr's body, the BOSS, which had been like a statue, began to revive.\n\nAt this moment, Chen Xu had already switched his Small Club to two-handed mode and let out a roar using the weapon's innate Weapon Art.\n\nThen, while Gundyr the Ash was still in the process of getting up, Chen Xu began swinging the Small Club at him.\n\nThe BOSS's health plummeted at a visibly rapid rate.\n\nThen, before the opponent could turn, he turned and created distance. As the opponent unleashed an attack akin to 'Split Mount Hua with Force,' Chen Xu easily rolled behind Gundyr the Ash, timing his Stamina Bar to ensure one bar always remained before continuing his assault.\n\nThe dual-wielded Small Clubs continuously struck Gundyr the Ash. Suddenly, in the game, Gundyr the Ash stumbled, lost his balance, and fell to his knees. Qin Yi and the others nearby understood that this was a direct Poise Break from the Small Club, resulting in a stun.\n\nFacing Ash Judgment Gundyr, who was kneeling, Chen Xu maintained the same attack rhythm as before, ensuring not to completely deplete the green Stamina Bar.\n\nSoon, Gundyr the Ash, with only half his health remaining, stood motionless, his entire body enveloped in black matter, transforming into a giant, serpent-like form, glaring menacingly.\n\nTaking advantage of Gundyr the Ash's transformation, Chen Xu's Small Club snuck in two more hits.\n\nThe transformed Gundyr the Ash leaped high into the air with a 'Mount Tai Crushing' attack. Chen Xu easily dodged it with a nimble roll using Invincibility Frames, then continued to pummel him twice more with the clubs to clear his remaining health.\n\nWith a roar, Gundyr the Ash slumped to the ground.\n\n“Very good. The Combat System and actions are excellent. The team should continue to test this aspect,”\n\n“As for the Numerical Design and difficulty, it'll remain as is. After all, as the first BOSS players encounter, it shouldn't be too difficult.”\n\nChen Xu said, looking at everyone.\n\nHe was very satisfied with the current results of the game test.\n\nFirstly, the visual representation of the game content had significantly improved compared to his previous life.\n\nThis included blood splattering after attacks and interactive environmental destruction within the scenes.\n\nIt was all exceptionally well done. Gundyr the Ash's slashes in the game would show destructive effects on the courtyard bricks.\n\nOf course, these were merely visual effects. For instance, when Gundyr's Halberd struck the ground, corresponding cracks would appear, but it wouldn't actually create a real crater with each hit.\n\nAs mentioned before, while this aspect doesn't affect the core game content, it contributes to the player's experience feedback during gameplay.\n\nIt's not a critical core element, but it can serve to add a touch of elegance, subtly allowing players to become more immersed in the game.\n\nAs for the core difficulty, Chen Xu wasn't exaggerating; the current feeling was indeed quite acceptable.\n\nIt's worth noting that in his previous life, Gundyr the Ash had another nickname: the Discouraging Boss.\n\nThis was meant to be a reminder to players about the nature of this game.\n\nIf you could accept it, then congratulations, a door to a new world was opening for you, and perhaps you might even unlock some special attributes.\n\nBut if you found Gundyr the Ash an insurmountable obstacle and felt utterly despairing.\n\nThen, refunding the game before the refund period expired would be a more rational choice.\n\nOf course, there was also a more direct method, which was also the choice of many Souls-like players on PC platforms in his previous life.\n\nThat was to become a grand disciple of the Wind, Spirit, Moon, and Shadow Sect, or more directly, to use a Trainer.\n\nSome players wanted to personally experience the game's story and gameplay rather than learning about it through videos, but their skill level didn't permit it. In such cases, a Trainer was clearly a good solution.\n\nHonestly, as a game developer, Chen Xu didn't hold much prejudice against players using Trainers for single-player games.\n\nOne could only say that every player has their own preferred way to play.\n\nHowever, players who use Trainers still needed some restrictions. After all, Dark Souls wasn't a purely single-player game. If a player wasn't playing Offline but in Online Mode.\n\nThen, while in the Embered State, they might encounter invasions from other players, which was part of the game's mechanics.\n\nAfter all, there were benefits, but also risks.\n\nTherefore, for this aspect of the game, Chen Xu also drew inspiration from the methods used in Dark Souls in his previous life.\n\nPlayers could use Trainers, but after doing so, their save file would be marked, preventing them from connecting with normal players in Online Mode. Upon connecting to the network, they would be assigned to a unique server, populated exclusively by players using Trainer-modified save files.\n\nFurthermore, save files using Trainers would not be able to achieve corresponding in-game achievement records.\n\nIn addition to this, there were other regular online contents, such as numerical balancing.\n\nThis was to prevent players from deliberately creating a Low-Level Character, becoming a High Wall Lord of Cinder by relying on equipment stats, and invading the worlds of Rookie players who, bewildered, didn't even know what the Embered State was for.\n\n“But Mr. Chen, won't this difficulty be too low?” Yang Xin, unaware of the full truth, offered her opinion.\n\n“Exactly! It feels a bit like a Hack-and-Slash Game. This BOSS and the small monsters don't seem very durable!” Ruan Ningxue echoed.\n\n“So, Mr. Chen, is Dark Souls a Hack-and-Slash Game?” Zhang Yida from Marketing and Operations also inquired.\n\nAfter all, for future promotions, the game's tags would be crucial.\n\nAt this moment, Qin Yi and the other Combat System planners all wore bewildered expressions.\n\nToo simple? Not durable? Hack-and-slash? What are you talking about?\n\nAre you trying to kill the players when it launches?\n\nAnd why is Mr. Chen so incredibly good?\n\nQin Yi and the others' expressions were incredibly complex.\n\nThe game wasn't the problem, and they weren't the problem, so the only one who *was* the problem was Mr. Chen!\n\nWho the heck would've thought their Mr. Chen was actually a Gaming Master!\n\nSeeing their expressions, Chen Xu smiled and waved his hand: “Mainly, it’s because I know the BOSS’s attack patterns, so I can handle them easily. Ordinary players will still need some practice.”\n\nOh, so that's it!\n\nEveryone showed expressions of sudden understanding, but they looked at Qin Yi with very strange gazes.\n\nAlthough no one spoke, Qin Yi and his team could feel what everyone was trying to say.\n\nThe gist was probably: Weren't you also involved in the numerical content, BOSS actions, and Combat System design for Dark Souls?\n\nIs this what you've been calling 'too difficult'?\n\nAre you sure you just aren't terrible at the game yourselves?\n\nAfter Chen Xu left, facing the gazes of everyone, Qin Yi snorted and stood up from his chair. The rest of the employees involved in combat and action system design promptly vacated their seats next to him.\n\nThere was no verbal communication, but their actions were exceptionally coordinated.\n\nEasy?\n\nThen you try to Link the Fire yourselves.\n\nThus, those who expressed disbelief all sat down, intending to experience it for themselves.\n\nHalf an hour later.\n\nEveryone's expressions had become somewhat complicated.\n\n“I'll suggest to Mr. Chen later that perhaps we need to add some death achievements in the game, to ensure players receive some rewards and comfort even when they die,” Yang Xin was the first to speak.\n\n“After dying, I think the screen could transition from crimson, slowly to dark red, and then to grayscale. Also, the 'YOU DIED' message could be slightly beautified, to provide some solace to the players' hearts,” Ruan Ningxue said with a complex expression.\n\nEveryone exchanged glances, understanding each other's unspoken meaning.\n\nGood luck, players! This was the last thing they could do!\n\nMeanwhile, Zhang Yida beside them wore an utterly dumbfounded expression.\n\nIt's easy enough for you to handle on your end.\n\nBut what about him?\n\nFor the game's promotional warm-up, what tags should he possibly use to promote it!\n\nThinking of Chen Xu's gameplay footage, then recalling his own experience.\n\nZhang Yida fell into confusion.\n\n(Daily request for recommendation votes, monthly passes...)\n\n(End of Chapter)
