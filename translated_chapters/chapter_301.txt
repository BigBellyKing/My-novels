Chapter 300 Anti-Terrorism Game (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Two days later, in Nebula Games' reception room.

Chen Xu looked at Meng Zuo and couldn't help but sigh with emotion: "I thought NetDragon, the Channel Alliance, and TengHua were all on the same side."

"Please remove 'you guys'. I'm just an employee, responsible for acting as a lubricant, building a bridge for communication between you, Mr. Chen, and NetDragon," said Meng Zuo, sitting in the chair.

"However, Teacher Meng, this will be our first collaboration!" Chen Xu said with a smile.

This time, NetDragon approaching them was indeed beyond Chen Xu's expectations. According to NetDragon's idea, Nebula Games and NetDragon could form a strategic cooperation.

Some of NetDragon's third-party, including first-party games, could be launched on the Nebula Games Platform. But similarly, Nebula Games Platform's first-party and third-party games would also need to be launched on NetDragon's platforms.

Chen Xu didn't have much objection to this. Because these games themselves required the Nebula Games Platform to launch, and it was the same for NetDragon's side. In terms of user numbers, there wasn't really a case of one party taking advantage of the other.

The main reason NetDragon approached Nebula Games was that in the VR field, NetDragon had been suppressed by TengHua in recent years. Starting from "Star God" two years ago, they were only slightly inferior in awards, but sales were still considerable. However, in the past two years, Nebula Games had risen rapidly in the PC field, and TengHua was also pressing hard in VR. NetDragon was a large corporation, but even so, it already felt a sense of crisis.

At the same time, due to the rise of the Nebula Games Platform, the Channel Alliance also united. TengHua was now in cahoots with the Channel Alliance. This time, for the VR Game Design Competition, NetDragon also wanted to make a move, which was to join hands with Nebula Games to establish a foothold in the VR sector.

Both parties were pursuing their own interests, but NetDragon's terms were indeed quite sincere. Chen Xu had no reason to refuse. Both parties would co-invest in the new project, and profit sharing had been agreed upon. However, the copyright would belong to Nebula Games.

This was Chen Xu's bottom line. "Money can be shared with you, but copyright is non-negotiable."

"But regarding the new project, Mr. Chen, what are your thoughts?" Meng Zuo didn't continue discussing that matter with Chen Xu, but instead shifted the topic to games. He wasn't very interested in the specific interests involved or any strategic goals. For him, what he wanted to know more was how Chen Xu planned to approach the new VR game. In the past, he had thought about competing with Chen Xu, but now that thought was completely gone, replaced by curiosity about what Chen Xu would do.

"FPS and first-person, these two entry points are the best," Chen Xu said.

Meng Zuo, sitting there, nodded. In fact, this was probably also the direction that other interested parties participating in this VR Game Design Competition were preparing to venture into. After all, it involved military training. Regardless of what it was actually for, since the Game Department announced it this way, they would definitely pursue this direction.

"However, the theme cannot be the same as traditional themes, like cops and robbers battles where you buy corresponding weapons and firearms, revolving around defusing bombs. There's no big problem with that gameplay, but the key lies in the game's presentation content," Chen Xu said, looking at Meng Zuo.

Similar to CSGO-like games in his previous life, the embryonic form of such games in the Parallel World had already emerged. They basically revolved around planting and defusing bombs, and of course, rescuing hostages. But the gameplay was similar to Counter-Strike in his previous life.

"If counter-terrorism operations were really like these games, where you just hold a gun and flashbangs, or simply rush in to kill terrorists, defuse bombs, or rescue hostages, then soldiers from any country would likely suffer heavy casualties. Completely different from traditional field battles and jungle warfare, with the advancement of the times, the continuously spreading terrorist activities, crime, and special operations environments have moved into confined indoor environments such as buildings, residential houses, and alleys. The tactics derived for these scenarios are called Close-Quarters Battle, or CQB. Of course, not all indoor combat is referred to as CQB."

"And nowadays, general counter-terrorism units will appropriately group personnel according to mission characteristics, such as: Assault, Support, Sniping, Demolition, Containment, and so on. At the same time, with the advancement of the times, counter-terrorism equipment is no longer limited to just a gun; it involves high-tech combat that considers overall tactics. Flash Shields, Unmanned Reconnaissance Vehicles, Heartbeat Scanners, Concussion Grenades, Breaching Rams, Cluster Charges, Breaching Charges..."

All sorts of professional terms came out of Chen Xu's mouth. Meng Zuo, sitting opposite him, was directly bewildered by this combination punch. Some he had heard of, others he was completely unfamiliar with. But even though he didn't understand, he was greatly shocked!

And Chen Xu's narration didn't stop; he became more enthusiastic the more he spoke. "Facing an unfamiliar building, inside which are hostages we need to rescue, or explosives to defuse, but at the same time, there are heinous terrorist personnel. In such a situation, do you think a normal counter-terrorism operation is just to go in with guns blazing? Of course not! When the decision is made to enter a building occupied by terrorist personnel, it means negotiations have broken down. And when executing a mission in a complex building, you never know where the enemy might be hiding, or if they'll suddenly appear and shoot at you. At this point, you need to utilize all effective tools."

"Using unmanned reconnaissance vehicles to gather information about the indoor environment and the approximate location of enemies, and using breaching rams and breaching charges to blow open doors, windows, and walls, providing a completely new attack route. Infiltrating and rescuing through ropes from second and third-floor windows. True counter-terrorism doesn't rely on marksmanship, but on tactics, on gathering information, and on psychological warfare! And this will be the content we need to showcase in the new game."

"As for the game's background, that's not particularly important, but the scope can be set a bit grander. As terrorist attacks worldwide increasingly grow and international terrorist attacks emerge, the World United Nations has decided to draw elite special forces personnel from various countries to jointly form a special counter-terrorism unit named 'Rainbow' to combat the threat of terrorism to the world. Similar to the heroes in Warcraft, different Operators in the game will each possess unique abilities, combined with backgrounds of various nationalities, which will allow the game to sell better in different countries."
