Chapter 338: Price, Return! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

The airport incident was merely a catalyst.

Regardless, war had broken out.

Russia's air force directly bypassed America's outer defenses and reached the West Coast.

Meanwhile, the modules that Roach and Soap had retrieved earlier had already been cracked by the Russian army.

This allowed Russia's air force to bypass America's air defense facilities, and by the time it was discovered, it was already too late.

Instantly, the entirety of Washington was engulfed in war.

Task Force 141, along with some Russians who wished to avoid war,

all understood that Makarov was the true mastermind, but they lacked sufficient evidence to convince the world to intervene and end this war that should never have happened.

Thus, Task Force 141 could only trace the bullets left at the airport to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, hoping to obtain clues from an arms dealer collaborating with Makarov.

From this moment, the most classic dual-line narrative of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare unfolded simultaneously.

In Washington, facing the Russian army's offensive, players would take on the role of James Ramirez, a member of the Ranger Regiment.

They would join Sergeant Foley in a counterattack.

The battle was incredibly brutal, almost a meat grinder.

One second, a comrade beside him was reminding him to take cover; the next, a stray bullet pierced his neck.

All you could do was watch him die in front of you.

This impact was far more intense than any movie or TV series.

It was another war scene, but after the previous No Russian airport massacre level, what Zhang Yi felt at this moment was not excitement, but a sense of cruelty.

Meanwhile, with Task Force 141, players followed Roach's perspective, continuously investigating Makarov.

During this time, they couldn't get a handle on Makarov's movements.

Especially in the level called Slum, Zhang Yi fully experienced the local 'hospitality'.

It was comparable to the Hollows in Undead Burg.

In the Slum, all the houses had huge elevation differences; you never knew where the enemy would attack from.

Front, back, left, right, above, below—it was an all-around assault.

Moreover, the buildings here were very chaotic, and 'black guns' (ambush shots) often appeared from unknown corners.

Even playing on normal difficulty, Zhang Yi felt a bit dizzy.

He couldn't even imagine how difficult this level would be on veteran difficulty.

Of course, it wasn't without reward; here, Roach met another teammate from Task Force 141.

It was Ghost - Simon Riley, from the previous Operation Kingfish.

Several times, when Roach was heavily surrounded in the Slum, Ghost stepped forward to help him break the encirclement and cover his retreat.

And this good teammate was the perfect example of someone who was ruthless and spoke little.

Black sunglasses, a skull mask, tactical headphones—he was an accurate shot, handsome, and even understood hacking technology, though he was a bit slow when cracking things.

Under a hail of bullets, they caught the target and, using a 'friendly' method of electroshock therapy, persuaded him.

Finally, Soap and the others obtained a crucial piece of information.

A prisoner, Code 627, was being held in the Gulag.

This individual was someone Makarov desperately wanted to eliminate but was powerless to touch.

Upon hearing this, Soap and Roach were instantly stunned.

“Holy cow, how could such a formidable existence be out there?”

They immediately decided to go to the Gulag prison to investigate this Code 627 prisoner, to see if they could get any information about Makarov.

Moreover, an enemy of their enemy was a friend; since this person was so formidable, perhaps he could become a great asset to them.

The entire island's defenses were exceptionally tight.

After riding in an attack helicopter and using automatic rifles to clear all the guards outside the castle-like prison,

Roach, Soap, Ghost, and other Task Force 141 members charged straight in.

As the team's tech expert, Ghost began hacking into the prison's security system.

But as mentioned, while Brother Ghost was handsome, his hacking skills were a bit slow when it came to cracking things.

So, Roach could only let Soap proceed first to the underground armory.

It was a cramped terrain, with enemies attacking from two long corridors around them.

The difficulty was no less than that of the previous Slum level.

Thus, Zhang Yi very honestly switched to Recruit mode.

As an excellent veteran of modern warfare, what was needed was not sharp marksmanship or agile movement,

but a big heart capable of judging the situation.

Given the current difficulty, Recruit mode was clearly more suitable for him.

As for not playing on Recruit difficulty?

Who said that? He certainly didn't!

Roach, Soap, and the accompanying Task Force 141 members broke through little by little.

At the same time, this sparked some curiosity in Zhang Yi's mind about the target of this operation.

Who exactly was this Code 627 prisoner, this 'big shot'?

Carrying this doubt, he controlled Roach, following Soap, and delved deeper inside.

After blowing up a wall, amidst the dust and smoke of flying bricks and stones,

an agile figure appeared. Although his hands were bound by chains, his movements were remarkably swift.

He cleanly dispatched a guard in front of him, then delivered a flying kick to the stomach of Roach, whom Zhang Yi was controlling.

He raised the shotgun in his hand, ready to fire.

But the next moment, the figure suddenly lowered his weapon.

“Roach?”

A familiar voice sounded in Zhang Yi's ear.

“Holy cow! Captain Price! Captain Price isn't dead!”

Instantly, Zhang Yi was overwhelmed with joy.

The person before him was none other than Captain Price, whose fate had been unknown since Operation Kingfish.

Chen Xu had also slightly altered this part of the storyline.

In his previous life, in this part of the story, Captain Price didn't know Roach, but recognized Soap.

The main reason was that the Operation Kingfish storyline was a player-completed narrative, which, although later officially recognized,

the game had already been made by then, making changes impossible.

But now that Chen Xu had turned Operation Kingfish into a level, it was naturally impossible to make such a mistake. After all, how could Captain Price not recognize his own soldiers?

Looking at Captain Price, who had his signature mustache and appeared somewhat haggard in his prison uniform, Zhang Yi was extremely excited.

Because Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was a game that allowed players to empathize with NPC characters.

He had deep feelings for Roach, Soap, Ghost, and Captain Price.

Now, seeing Captain Price, who had been missing for so long, alive, he was also very emotional.

Soap in the game felt the same, but as a soldier, he didn't lose his composure; he simply picked up the M1911 pistol, which had once symbolized and witnessed their bond of life and death.

“Captain Price, welcome back.”

“This belongs to you… Captain!”

There were not many words, but that single sentence conveyed Soap's inner excitement.

At this point, the main protagonist group of Task Force 141 was reunited, except for Allen, who tragically only survived three levels.
