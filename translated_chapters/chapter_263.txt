Chapter 262: Mr. Chen's Conning Time (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

For two consecutive days, many players online strongly demanded nerfs for Diablos and Rathalos, and stated that the Long Sword's stats needed a buff.

With so many Longsword Heroes suffering tragic fates, Mr. Chen, don't you feel heartbroken!?

Then something that surprised everyone occurred.

On the official Weibo account, Chen Xu and Nebula Games surprisingly released a notification.

Live streaming platforms like Shark TV also issued an event notice.

'On the evening of August 11th, Chen Xu, the designer of Monster Hunter: World, will be live streaming the game at 19:30 to answer questions everyone has about the game.'

Upon seeing this news, some Hunter players were a little bewildered.

What does this mean!?

Chen Xu is going to live stream Monster Hunter: World and answer everyone's questions?

How novel!

Many players were quite surprised.

Of course, designers live streaming games isn't that novel anymore.

Many designers in the industry have done such things.

It mainly helps to close the distance with players.

Moreover, it's beneficial for game promotion.

Of course, this premise is built on the game having decent reputation and quality. If your game is a mess and you still come to live stream?

They'll roast you to death!

But Chen Xu coming to live stream and explain questions about Monster Hunter: World still made many players feel it was quite novel.

Because generally, when designers live stream, aren't they usually explaining gameplay content, rarely touching upon balance?

However, some veteran players recalled the so-called strategy videos for Dark Souls from back then.

But in any case, it undoubtedly attracted countless players.

At 19:20 that evening, a large number of viewers gathered in Nebula Games' live streaming room, engaging in discussions.

This was considered prime-time for live streaming in the evening, but many big streamers in the gaming section stopped their own broadcasts and directly entered Nebula Games' live streaming room from theirs.

Because they were also very curious and wanted to take a look; after all, with the launch of Monster Hunter: World, this trend had also swept across major live streaming websites.

Neither skilled streamers nor entertainment streamers were spared.

Moreover, the entertainment value of this game was excellent, especially during the 'three faints'.

Aside from some highly skilled streamers who managed to conquer Diablos and Rathalos with their techniques, most ordinary streamers were still suffering here.

It felt just like Dark Souls again.

Meanwhile, players were idly chatting in the live streaming room, looking at a black screen.

“I really want to see how Chen Xu explains the weapon balance issues in Monster Hunter: World!”

“Exactly, exactly! It was supposed to be a hack-and-slash game, so why are *we* the ones being hacked and slashed?”

“That’s right, Long Sword players, charge with me and let Chen Xu hear our voices!”

Soon, the live streaming room showed a picture, and Chen Xu appeared on camera. Of course, he wasn't alone; sitting beside him were Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and Lin Tao, along with other core members of the team.

The audience immediately got excited. As Chen Xu's broadcast began, many viewers received live notifications and immediately poured in, causing the number of viewers in the live streaming room to skyrocket.

“Hey! It’s not just Chen Xu, who are the people next to him?”

“Holy cow, two beautiful young ladies! Is Nebula Games still hiring? Do you think I’m qualified?”

“+1, does Nebula Games need someone to sweep the floors?”

“Forget the young ladies! Chen Xu, hurry up and explain the difficulty of Monster Hunter: World!”

“You’re absolutely right!”

The bullet comments in the live streaming room were furiously scrolling, even with restricted comments, they still came in like snowflakes.

At this moment, Chen Xu also spoke.

“It seems all the players are very enthusiastic! Also, let me introduce you to the development members of Monster Hunter: World.” Chen Xu first introduced Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, and the others, then continued: “Also, I’ve noticed many players have some doubts about Monster Hunter: World.”

“But here I want to say, I did indeed state that Monster Hunter: World is a game with a completely different style from Dark Souls, but I never said it was a hack-and-slash game. So Nebula Games won't be taking the blame for this one!” Chen Xu said with a light cough.

Hearing Chen Xu's words, the players watching the live stream were momentarily stunned.

It seemed he was right!

Since its release, Chen Xu had only stated that Monster Hunter: World was not a Souls-like game, but he had never called it a hack-and-slash game.

“And didn’t you all even think the game was too easy back then and wanted the difficulty increased!?” Chen Xu added.

Upon hearing this, the players immediately remembered something.

That is, it seemed this wasn't even the most difficult part yet. According to Chen Xu, there were supposedly 'Tempered monsters' later on. If it was already this hard, what the heck would 'Tempered' be like!?

Would that even be playable?

“Everyone, don’t get agitated. Monster Hunter: World is actually a game with perfectly balanced difficulty, completely different from Dark Souls.”

“Especially in terms of the equipment system, the benefits from armor are much higher than in Dark Souls. Plus, if you make good use of items and traps in the game, it’s actually very easy. Even clumsy newbies can easily clear the game as long as they understand the game's mechanics.” Chen Xu said, looking at the agitated bullet comments.

Hearing Chen Xu's words, the bullet comments all spammed a row of '????'.

From this symbol, one could infer the players’ attitudes.

Which was: 'You keep conning?'

“Hey, don't use question marks! Don’t we, as designers, have even the most basic trust with you players?” Chen Xu sighed.

Along with Chen Xu's words, many more similar phrases appeared in the live streaming room's bullet comments.

‘Warrior of Love?’ ‘Old Geezer!’ ‘I have never seen such ________!’

Trust, indeed!

Dark Souls, Outlast, Silent Hill PT, Overcooked, and that Big Hammer Game – who made these games? Don’t you have any self-awareness? And you still want trust!

“Alright, I’ll give you a brief demonstration of how to use various weapons and game mechanics in Monster Hunter: World, so you won’t keep saying that the weapon balance is off and the game difficulty is too high.” Chen Xu clicked on the Nebula Games Platform and entered the game.

In reality, Monster Hunter: World is genuinely a very friendly game, at least compared to games like Dark Souls.

For ordinary players, if their sole aim is to clear the game, there are indeed many ways to achieve it.

Of course, the core of Monster Hunter: World isn't just about clearing the game.

One could even say that clearing the game is merely the beginning, the introduction to the game.

So, for Chen Xu, he wasn't worried that his demonstration would lead to any serious consequences.

Moreover, many players had already found some tricks to it, even if a complete strategy guide hadn't emerged yet.

But that would likely happen within a day or two.

However, the players currently watching the live stream clearly didn't understand Chen Xu's intentions.

They were all chatting in the bullet comments.

“Mr. Chen is going to demonstrate Monster Hunter: World! Wonder how good he is!”

“New players, right? Haven't seen Mr. Chen’s previous Dark Souls strategy videos? Let’s just say he’s got a lot of tricks!”

At this moment, within Nebula Games, Qin Yi and the others sitting beside Chen Xu quietly lowered their heads.

Here it comes, here it comes!

Mr. Chen is about to start conning people.

What were the players so agitated about?

Nerfing Diablos and Rathalos, and buffing the Long Sword.

But now, it was clearly 'Mr. Chen's Conning Time'.

Change the stats?

Anything you want in your dreams!
