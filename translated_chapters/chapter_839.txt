Chapter 838: The Game Becomes Easier

From its previous thread-based gameplay, it transformed into an open-world experience, and the game's content is arguably the richest in a Souls game to date.

While *Elden Ring* thoroughly tormented a batch of players, more and more players gradually uncovered additional game content.

At the same time, thanks to the open-world elements, some more clever and resourceful players quickly figured out how to make the game easier for themselves.

On Shark TV, A'Shu, as a streamer, was among the first to broadcast *Elden Ring*.

However, unlike the skilled players who were already dominating and had reached areas like Crumbling Farum Azula and the Mountaintops of the Giants, A'Shu, being one of the clumsy players, had just arrived at the Volcano Manor area.

It was just like a line from his favorite *DOTA* hero, Windranger: "I'm the bane of clumsy players." This Souls game was indeed the bane of noobs like him.

Despite following online strategy guides, he obtained the Mage's early-game divine artifact: the Meteorite Staff, an S-tier Intelligence scaling weapon, and the dedicated spell, Rock Sling.

However, compared to the previous life, Chen Xu had still performed some numerical balancing in *Elden Ring*.

The Fog gate glitch for Rock Sling was gone, and the aggro and AI mechanisms for summoning Spirit Ashes had also been balanced. While playing a Mage was indeed much easier, players still needed a bit of skill.

So, naturally, A'Shu, as a player inherently unsuited for Souls games, once thought about giving up.

But today was completely different.

As soon as he started streaming, viewers who heard the news flooded the bullet comments.

'Brother Shu is here, Brother Shu is here! Everyone, start ordering takeout!'

'Brother Shu is here! Brother Shu is dead!'

'Exciting! Yesterday, Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon set a new record for boss deaths. Today, based on Brother Shu's progress, he should be heading to Leyndell, Royal Capital, right? I wonder how long the Draconic Tree Sentinel will keep Brother Shu stuck.'

'At least two hours, alright.'

'Two hours? Do you underestimate Brother Shu that much? Be bolder, super double!'

Watching the various bullet comments, A'Shu didn't sigh and put on a pre-battle face as he used to. Instead, he cheerfully started the game.

"I told you guys! Today you're going to see a different me! I specifically caught up on my studies last night!"

The audience chuckled: 'Brother Shu, studying won't help. If studying helped, wouldn't everyone be a top university student?'

'Exactly, with your operating skill level, Brother Shu, studying is useless!'

'I, for one, don't believe Brother Shu can master a Souls game.'

'It's fine, it won't be long until Brother Shu is drawing summon signs with his fingers and asking for viewers' help.'

Not long after, A'Shu quickly entered the game.

He initially chose the Knight starting class, as all players who had played Dark Souls knew that the Knight start was the easiest for early-game progression.

But after playing for a while, especially with the news of the Meteorite Staff in the Caelid ruins, he switched to a Mage build mid-game.

Although he started as a Knight, HP and stamina were still important, so he didn't specifically start a new save file.

By the time he reached the Volcano Manor, he was already nearly level 70.

"Let me show you how to truly play this game!" A'Shu confidently ran towards a marked spot on the map.

There was an Erdtree there, and beneath it, a Rotten Erdtree Avatar.

Unlike other Erdtree Avatars wielding large warhammers, this Rotten Erdtree Avatar resembled a giant snake, identical to the hidden monster in the secret basement of Stormveil Castle.

If he fought it head-on, he would be no match. But the key was that this BOSS didn't have a time limit.

Moreover, unlike the regular Erdtree Avatars that could summon countless golden arrows for ranged attacks, this Rotten Erdtree Avatar didn't have such an attack method.

In addition, being in the Volcano Manor region, the area around this Erdtree was entirely composed of various rocks.

As a qualified Souls-like game player, he always kept eight golden words in mind: hairy, weak to fire; big body, weak to doors.

A'Shu quietly positioned himself between two rocks and began casting the Rock Sling spell.

The bullet comments were speechless: 'Holy cow, the despicable door-trapping strategy is here!'

'Honestly, isn't this cheesing?'

'That's right, that's right, it's as despicable as cheesing Father Gascoigne with the tombstones and stairs in Bloodborne!'

'Speaking of despicable, Genichiro, who got trapped by the door in speedruns, has something to say!'

Without much effort, A'Shu, who had just defeated the BOSS, cleared his throat lightly: "Everyone, don't scold me. Honestly, I really couldn't beat this BOSS fair and square. But from now on, I won't use this cheesing method anymore! I'll fight BOSSes honorably! Besides summoning in-game NPCs and Spirit Ashes, I won't ask viewers to carry me either."

The bullet comments, which were originally boisterous, quieted down after hearing A'Shu's words.

Because up to this point, he had barely defeated any BOSSes fair and square. How dare he make such a grand declaration now?

"Hehe..."

Watching the bullet comments, A'Shu smiled slightly.

He silently put on the Intelligence-boosting helmet from Raya Lucarian Academy, and at a Site of Grace, he opened his Flask of Wondrous Physick, adding the newly acquired Cerulean Hidden Tear potion.

Then he removed three spells from his memory slots, teleported back to the Grand Library of Raya Lucarian Academy, and used his one and only respec item to reset his stats, putting all points into Intelligence and his FP bar.

Instantly, the bullet comments erupted a bit: 'Holy cow, what is A'Shu thinking?'

'Is he suicidal?'

'With this HP and stamina, he can't even wear armor, can he?'

However, some discerning bullet comments seemed to have figured it out.

'Holy cow, could it be that move?'

'Glass Cannon!?'

While everyone was discussing, A'Shu had already equipped a special spell—Comet Azur.

Of course, for veteran Souls players, it had a more familiar name: Comet Azur (Soul Stream).

At this point, A'Shu had arrived at the side entrance of Leyndell, Royal Capital, where a Draconic Tree Sentinel guarded the gate.

Compared to the tutorial Tree Sentinel, this Draconic Tree Sentinel was much fiercer. Its axe had become a Dragon Tooth, and in its second phase, it gained lightning power. The horse it rode not only performed Iron Mountain Tackle and galloping maneuvers but also spit two large fireballs.

Facing this Draconic Tree Sentinel from afar, A'Shu silently summoned his Lone Wolf Ashes.

Then he drank his Physick, and pressed the lock-on button.

Followed by a loud shout.

'Makankosappo!'

The blue magical energy, like a beam of light, instantly pierced through the Draconic Tree Sentinel.

Its health plummeted as if a floodgate had opened.

Comet Azur in *Elden Ring* had no time limit, but its FP consumption was terrifying. Even with a full FP bar, the original Comet Azur could only be cast for a few seconds.

However, the unique feature of the Cerulean Hidden Tear that A'Shu had just obtained was that it made magic consumption zero for a certain period.

So, under the bewildered gazes of countless bullet comments, the beam of light never stopped. Furthermore, Comet Azur itself had a certain poise-breaking property, which the Draconic Tree Sentinel couldn't ignore, forcing it to staggeringly advance towards him.

In ten seconds, although it didn't instantly kill the Draconic Tree Sentinel, the opponent was left with only a sliver of health.

After rolling several times to create distance and recovering some stamina, he seized an opening and finished it off with two Rock Slings.

"Oh, I didn't get the instant kill. It must be because my level isn't high enough. Don't say anything, I'll go back to my 'sect' and train for a while. Then we'll raise Intelligence to 70 points and upgrade the staff dropped by Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon." A'Shu said smugly.

'Holy cow! This isn't the show I wanted to watch!'

'No, isn't this too cheap!? Mages are this invincible?'

'Streamer, your playstyle is too brutal!'

The bullet comments were stunned; this was not what they expected!

In fact, A'Shu wasn't the only one who found ways to make the game easier.

Other players who didn't play Mages also found ways to simplify the game.

In a lake next to Caria Manor, after players defeated a scarab, they could obtain an Ash of War called Hoarfrost Stomp. Equipping it immediately gave players a taste of what it felt like to be ridiculously overpowered.

And for warriors who disdained transforming into old Hoarfrost Stomp users and casting spells, after defeating a Night's Cavalry near Castle Morne, Weeping Peninsula, they obtained an Ash of War called Barricade Shield. Combined with a spear, they instantly recaptured the feeling of wielding a Gunlance in *Monster Hunter*.

A shield raised, a spear thrust—who could stop them!?

The once difficult game suddenly became simple.
