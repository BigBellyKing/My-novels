Chapter 364: Game Launch (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

In the gaming industry, 'Beautiful World' and 'Red Dead Redemption', which had already begun their promotional warm-up, were undoubtedly the main topics of discussion among players recently.

However, a post on Chen Xu's official Weibo account garnered significant attention from many players, including those in the gaming industry.

The Weibo post was not long, containing only a few simple sentences.

'Regarding some key points that online players are curious about, I'd like to briefly mention a couple of features of "Red Dead Redemption" here.'

'Firstly, it's a completely different genre from "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare". Players will experience more interesting gameplay and a seamless large map, fully immersing themselves in the freedom and charm of the Western world.'

'Secondly, in terms of story, "Red Dead Redemption" will feature multiple ending choices this time, allowing players to become either a good person or a bad person.'

There was no lengthy discourse, just a simple answer to the two most hotly debated topics among online players previously.

Yet, from these few simple sentences, players and game designers in the industry gleaned a lot of information.

"Multiple endings!? Become a good person or a bad person, so the implication is that if you become a bad person, the protagonist's ending won't be a good one, but if you become a good person, it will be a good ending?"

"That must be what it means, and it's quite normal, isn't it?"

"A shiver of indignation! Ghost, Roach, Soap, Gaz, Griggs, and others, far away in heaven, roared: Why didn't they have multiple endings!?"

Reading Chen Xu's words on the official Weibo account, many players enthusiastically discussed the plot details he revealed.

Multiple endings were no longer a particularly novel game mechanic.

It was well-known to many veteran Nebula Games players—or rather, veteran Chen Xu players, as Nebula Games hadn't even been established back then.

The very first game Chen Xu made, 'Mirror (Game)', was a standard multi-ending game.

Pure Love and Netorare, two extreme endings, had even sparked a debate between Pure Love Warriors and Netorare Warriors in the Adult Game Industry at the time.

Now, 'Red Dead Redemption' was clearly following a similar path.

Of course, some players felt that things might not be so simple.

After all, if Captain Price was considered the protagonist in 'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare', then even though Captain Price didn't die in the end, Task Force 141 was completely wiped out.

And in the new game 'Red Dead Redemption', Arthur Morgan had a gang.

However, aside from this, what was most surprising was Chen Xu's announcement regarding the game's features.

Players will experience more interesting gameplay and a seamless large map.

This phrasing sounded a bit familiar, as if it had been heard somewhere before.

Wasn't this what Atrai had been promoting externally before?!

Many players were stunned.

And it wasn't just players; the gaming industry was also shocked.

'Red Dead Redemption' with a seamless map?

That visual quality couldn't possibly allow for it!

At Atrai, Antorini, after seeing Chen Xu's Weibo post, immediately launched a Cosmic VR device and entered the environmental theme previously released by Nebula Games.

With such visual performance, how could it achieve seamlessness?

Antorini frowned.

Or did Chen Xu have another trick up his sleeve?

Perhaps he would divide the seamless large map into segments, then play a CG cutscene to load when transitioning between certain areas.

For example, while players were riding horses, or performing other actions?

Or perhaps when heading to a certain map, players would need to take a train?

It would appear seamless in the game, but in reality, it would still involve loading zones.

Pondering the possible methods, Antorini felt he had guessed the truth.

As for graphical downgrades, although uncommon in the gaming industry, Antorini didn't think Nebula Games would resort to that.

The more he thought about it, the more he felt his idea was correct.

Petty tricks! Why promote it this way?

It was nothing but a gimmick!

As for the talk of richer gameplay, Antorini didn't care about that at all.

How rich could it be?

Like this environmental theme, running a farm in the West, raising pigs and farming?

"If it's only to this extent, 'Red Dead Redemption' is still quite uncertain. Also, we can't let them get a head start," Antorini said. Although he still had some concerns, he was very confident in his own game.

From the current situation, he felt that the threat from 'Red Dead Redemption' wouldn't be too significant, but its launch date still needed attention.

……………………

In the following period, Atrai's promotion for 'Beautiful World' was in full swing, with new game information and content being revealed almost daily.

Each new gameplay mechanic and character steadily raised players' expectations.

'Red Dead Redemption' wasn't actually lagging behind either; besides its previous promotional videos, more was showcased within its environmental theme.

In addition to farming, raising pigs, and playing dominoes and poker, players discovered that a newspaper feature had been updated within the environmental theme.

Every day, a newsboy would deliver a newspaper.

It introduced various situations in the Western world.

In the game, newspapers were a very important item.

Besides the main story content that had occurred, much information for side quests could be found in the newspapers.

Of course, the newspapers Chen Xu currently released to players would certainly not involve actual game content.

They primarily served as an introduction to the social background of the time.

………………

As the project gradually progressed, days turned into weeks.

Finally, amidst the anticipation of players worldwide.

'Red Dead Redemption' and 'Beautiful World' successively announced their launch dates.

'Red Dead Redemption' would launch on January 16th, while 'Beautiful World' would launch on January 15th.

Unlike before, where Atrai would first announce its promotional content, and then Nebula Games would follow suit.

This time, however, 'Red Dead Redemption' announced its launch date first, with Atrai quickly following.

Even Chen Xu within Nebula Games was surprised.

Because the development of 'Red Dead Redemption' had been exceptionally smooth this time, yet even so, the current launch would not include online mode content, only the pure story content.

Under these circumstances, Atrai had announced its launch date so quickly, and it was exactly one day earlier than theirs?

However, surprise aside, since the release date had already been announced, Chen Xu had no plans to make any adjustments.

Because everything had already been planned, and Chen Xu believed that a single day wouldn't significantly impact 'Red Dead Redemption'.

Unless it was three or four days, or even a week in advance.

Otherwise, a mere one or two-day difference in release schedules wouldn't truly affect the overall situation for the games involved.

Chen Xu was surprised, but Antorini at Atrai was even more relieved, grateful that everyone at Atrai, including himself, had been working overtime during this period.

Otherwise, it would have been impossible to set such a date.

Looking at the release date, Antorini couldn't help but smile.

He felt it was a sure win!

At least in terms of the release date, he had already surpassed 'Red Dead Redemption'.

The rest was up to the market to decide.

And he could finally get some good rest these few days. On January 15th, he planned to sleep in.

He would enjoy a full day's sleep, then wake up the next day to savor the sweet fruits of victory.

………………

January 15th

'Beautiful World' officially launched, while 'Red Dead Redemption' also began its pre-download phase, allowing players to enter the game as soon as it launched on the 16th.

Major game developers and designers in the industry were also closely watching.

Recently, these two games had completely dominated the gaming industry's spotlight.

But who would ultimately be the winner was hard to say.

After all, 'Red Dead Redemption' and 'Beautiful World' were both games of the same genre and theme.

If they were of different themes or genres, there would be an impact on sales, but it wouldn't be too significant.

However, with them being of the same genre and theme, the impact would be far greater.

As for the players, they weren't thinking too much.

Players who purchased 'Beautiful World' directly entered the game to experience it.

Meanwhile, players who pre-ordered 'Red Dead Redemption' were pre-downloading it, while also following 'Beautiful World''s performance on platforms like live streaming, eagerly anticipating their own experience with 'Red Dead Redemption' tomorrow.
