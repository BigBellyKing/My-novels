Chapter 697: Have I Evolved and Become Stronger? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

In reality, Genichiro Ashina is indeed a BOSS whose moves are easily understood, and he isn't a particularly difficult one either.

However, for new players, especially those who prefer to cheese and haven't solidified their fundamental skills, Genichiro Ashina proves to be the most challenging type.

This is because he tests all sorts of basic player skills.

Blocking, Mikiri Counter, dodge step, and pursuit—if you're lacking in any of these three, then facing Genichiro Ashina will essentially force you to pay back all the lessons you skipped, twofold.

This is why many people call Genichiro Ashina a teacher, as many players learned various fundamental skills from him.

“Are you serious?! Are you serious?!”

Zhang Yi's voice grew increasingly agitated and loud.

He had already died countless times, but he could now usually get through Genichiro Ashina's first phase without dying once.

After all, he did have some foundation, and frankly, Genichiro in his first phase wasn't that difficult.

But once he entered the second phase, everything changed completely.

First, there were more variables. Besides his grappling attacks, Genichiro Ashina's new counter moves included a low sweep attack in addition to his predictable thrusts that could be easily Mikiri Countered. This low sweep could not be Mikiri Countered; he could only avoid it by jumping.

The crucial point was that Zhang Yi sometimes couldn't react in time, because sometimes, even if your mind understood, your hands couldn't execute the action.

Furthermore, in the second phase, Genichiro's little tricks increased.

Especially after he jumped, sometimes it was a cleave, and other times it directly turned into rapid fire, frequently giving his head a thorough “washing” with arrows.

There was once the historical allusion of Zhuge Liang borrowing arrows with straw boats; now there was Zhang Yi borrowing arrows with his iron head.

This Genichiro was truly despicable.

Just fight, what's the meaning of suddenly pulling out a bow out of nowhere?

Of course, what further shifted his mindset was not just Genichiro before him, nor the countless “DEATH” messages.

What truly changed his mindset were the off-field factors within the game.

While he was still suffering, the voice prompt rang again.

The familiar voice reached his ears.

“Old Zhang, where are you now? Have you passed Genichiro Ashina yet? I finally took care of Gyoubu Masataka Oniwa at the main gate.” Song Ren's voice echoed in Zhang Yi's ears.

He felt like speaking but held back.

Gyoubu Masataka Oniwa was already defeated!?

Doesn't that mean, besides the Blazing Bull and the General of the Samurai in front of Ashina Castle who doesn't need to be fought, there's only one Iai Swordsman left?

He was about to catch up to his progress soon!

“Genichiro? This BOSS is quite formidable, not comparable to the Blazing Bull or Gyoubu Masataka Oniwa from before. I can only say that Genichiro Ashina is indeed worthy of being the grandson of Sword Saint Isshin Ashina, right?” Zhang Yi coughed lightly and said.

This was his usual excuse when playing multiplayer games like Warcraft and Rainbow Six Siege.

Infinitely exaggerating the opponent's strength made it feel like whatever embarrassing things he did weren't a big deal.

It was the same now; who was the opponent?

The grandson of the legendary Sword Saint Isshin Ashina—how could he be weak?

“That formidable, huh? But Old Zhang, you've been stuck for almost an hour and a half, haven't you? I've already fought from Hirata Estate all the way to Ashina Castle. Have you died 100 times yet?” Song Ren smacked his lips.

“You talk too much!” Zhang Yi's mouth twitched upon hearing Song Ren's words.

Had it been 100 times?

If he counted the resurrection times, it probably was quite close, wasn't it?

“Don't be disheartened. I also died fifty or sixty times fighting Lady Butterfly before. But I feel like fighting humanoid enemies in this game is much more satisfying than fighting monsters. That Sword Clash feeling is simply amazing,” Song Ren said with some emotion.

“Enough talk, I feel it this time. Genichiro should be going down!” Hearing Song Ren's words, Zhang Yi felt he couldn't continue this topic any longer.

And he genuinely had that feeling: he was about to defeat the Genichiro before him.

Because he was already quite proficient in the first phase.

He hung up the phone with Old Song and continued his fierce battle with Genichiro.

Finally, Zhang Yi saw the light of victory.

It had to be said, Genichiro Ashina was absolutely the strongest opponent Zhang Yi had faced so far.

“Die!”

Zhang Yi shouted excitedly and aptly.

As the Kusabimaru in his hand pierced Genichiro's chest, the game screen didn't follow the usual BOSS kill animation but transitioned into a cutscene.

'Impressive... Shinobi... How regrettable. Do you intend to change masters?'

'Absurd.'

'Absurd, you say? As long as it protects Ashina, no matter how much it defies convention, I will master it... Let me show you Tomoe's Lightning!'

The armor on Genichiro before him receded, revealing his upper body covered in blade scars.

At the same time, a bolt of lightning ripped across the sky outside Ashina Castle, striking the blade in Genichiro Ashina's hand, which then shimmered with golden electricity.

The next moment, the game entered the combat phase. The original Genichiro Ashina had now transformed into 'Way of Tomoe - Genichiro Ashina'.

Looking at Genichiro before him, Zhang Yi in the game was utterly stunned.

“What's going on? What happened? There's a third phase?! Are you serious?!”

“And this lightning-infused third phase was waiting for me here!”

Zhang Yi completely panicked.

He recalled that before fighting Genichiro, he had seen a hint for Lightning Reversal on the wall in the dojo downstairs.

So, after all this time, Genichiro's third phase involves summoning lightning?

And this third phase Genichiro must be very strong, right?

Zhang Yi was cautious, watching Genichiro charge towards him, ready to dodge first.

With a dodge step, he stomped on the blade. Genichiro retreated, then followed with a continuous slash. This move was still from the first and second phases, and Zhang Yi was quite proficient at it, performing continuous blocks.

Sparks flew from perfect blocks. Although he didn't perfectly block every attack, as long as his Posture Bar didn't break, everything was fine.

Then a 'Perilous Attack' symbol appeared above Wolf's head.

Zhang Yi saw Genichiro flip back, draw his bow, gathering lightning around himself, and rapidly fire an arrow towards Wolf.

He remembered the Lightning Reversal scroll he had seen after defeating the Iai Swordsman.

Subconsciously, Zhang Yi immediately jumped, following the description of the Lightning Reversal skill he had learned: catch the lightning, then attack just as he was about to land.

The Wolf in the game caught the bolt of lightning with his Kusabimaru, then swung it back – Lightning Reversal.

Wolf's health bar dropped by one segment, while Genichiro's Posture Bar increased by almost two-fifths. More critically, Genichiro immediately entered a stun lock state.

“I... I successfully performed a Lightning Reversal?”

Zhang Yi was momentarily stunned.

He even forgot to attack Genichiro, who was in a stun lock state before him.

When Genichiro got up and continued attacking him, Zhang Yi blocked, dodged, and counterattacked, then noticed something.

This third-phase Genichiro was simply too fragile!

One strike took down a large segment of his health bar, and his Posture Bar filled up relentlessly.

Genichiro then retreated, continuing to summon lightning.

Timing it perfectly, Zhang Yi jumped to catch the lightning and returned it.

“Oh my God! Isn't this a free win? This Lightning Reversal is much easier than parrying!”

He accidentally made a mistake once and was defeated by Genichiro, but Zhang Yi wasn't disheartened at all.

Because he realized that this third-phase Genichiro really didn't seem strong!

He continued the challenge, returning to the rooftop from the second floor. After about three consecutive attempts.

Looking at Genichiro, whose Posture Bar was full and had an execution prompt, Zhang Yi pressed the attack button to execute him and was completely stunned.

He hadn't even fully processed what just happened.

Why did this third-phase Genichiro feel so easy?

Like a free win?

He had died hundreds of times in the previous two phases, so how did he clear Genichiro's third phase in just a few attempts?

It felt a bit unreal!

“Could it be that... I've evolved?!”

“Have I become so powerful that I don't even understand my own strength anymore?”

“It's not that this third-phase Genichiro is too weak; it's that I, having undergone arduous training, am now too strong?”

After successfully defeating Genichiro Ashina, Zhang Yi looked at the subsequent cutscene with Emma and Kuro appearing, his face filled with pleasant surprise.
