Chapter 228: A True Miracle (Sixth update, requesting subscriptions, monthly passes)

While Chen Xu and his team were carrying out the maintenance for Minecraft, and developing the mobile and VR versions.

Minecraft's unique gameplay attracted more and more players.

Initially, most players were focused on figuring out how to build beautiful small houses.

However, as time progressed, many advanced players discovered the ingenious uses of the Redstone system.

Just like a puzzle, Redstone Torches continuously send signals.

Doors, music boxes, and dispensers, on the other hand, are objects that open when they receive a signal and close when there's no signal.

Levers and pressure plates are easy to understand; they're just switches.

Repeaters act as signal regulators, because after a certain distance, Redstone signals dissipate, but with a repeater, they can be boosted to their maximum state.

Although no players had yet managed to create things like calculators or pianos.

Some players had already successfully built simple facilities such as automatic chicken farms, small minecarts, and signal doors.

Meanwhile, some players exploring Minecraft's adventure content also discovered a gameplay mechanic that could make them pull their hair out: enchanting.

Moreover, various temples existed in forests, deserts, and underwater.

Of course, some unlucky kids, upon seeing a Desert Temple for the first time, jumped straight down without a second thought, only to be brutally taught a lesson by TNT.

These videos sparked heated discussions on Minecraft's official forum.

'Mom asked me why I was watching videos on my knees!'

'We all bought the game for 68 Yuan, why is yours different from mine?'

'I think I bought the wrong game. I'm playing Minecraft, but what world are *you* guys playing?'

'Holy cow, you can actually play it like this?'

'Honestly, Mr. Chen is really losing money selling this game for 68 Yuan!'

'Damn it, I'm still a caveman, living in the Stone Age, and you guys have already entered the Industrial Age!?'

'Count me as another caveman! I'm still working hard to build my own structure with my own hands, and you're already setting up chicken farms and minecarts?'

Watching videos of various master players showing off, many other players also poked fun online.

They joked that they were playing "My World," while these other people were playing "Others' World"—it was practically two different games!

Of course, despite the banter, this didn't dampen the players' enthusiasm in the slightest.

Because any player could find unique enjoyment in Minecraft.

This was all thanks to Minecraft's unique characteristics.

The game itself doesn't give you a set objective; everything is simply an objective you set for yourself.

This extremely freeform gameplay was arguably unparalleled.

Coupled with special game mechanics, the game was filled with all sorts of incredible gameplay possibilities, giving players many ideas.

It truly validated the line from the promotional video: the game is only as fun as the player's imagination is vast.



A miracle.

This was the definition given to Minecraft by game designers across the industry over the past month.

Not only PC designers but also some game designers specializing in VR were dumbfounded.

Because in this past month, the power demonstrated by Minecraft had simply made everyone exclaim it was a miracle.

It was truly incredible.

If the first-day sales of 3 million and first-week sales of 10 million were astonishing, that would be one thing.

After all, there were plenty of games in history that had achieved such numbers.

But the crucial point was Minecraft's subsequent development. Typically, after an explosive sales growth in the first week, the second week would likely see a drastic drop, with sales being halved often considered a good outcome.

However, Minecraft was different; although its sales declined in the second week, they remained exceptionally stable.

This pushed Minecraft's cumulative sales over two weeks to a high of 17 million.

And there was no sign of it slowing down.

Not only domestically, but the overseas version of Minecraft also launched two and a half weeks after its domestic release, priced at $14.9.

Initially, foreign players familiar with Nebula Games were quite confused.

After all, this was the company that had previously developed Dark Souls.

Why had they suddenly developed a pixel-style game now?

But after players paid attention to the game, they were immediately stunned.

This was because when Minecraft launched overseas, Target Software directly *cosplayed* Nebula Games, translating and disseminating all sorts of shocking domestic videos abroad.

Even before the game launched, various classic building videos, tutorial videos, and Redstone technology videos from China saw their view counts explode.

This, in turn, ignited Minecraft's popularity.

Within a week of its overseas launch, Minecraft's sales had already reached 13 million.

Moreover, its subsequent trend was almost identical to the domestic market, steadily advancing.

While there was a gradual decline, it was very limited.

It was as if this game possessed an extraordinary magic.

Although its price was similar to most independent games, this was no longer important in the face of its terrifying sales figures.

After Minecraft exploded with a sales miracle, major media outlets were filled with praise for the game.

Even the domestic Game Department, for the first time ever, published a review.

'You'll never find another game as special as Minecraft.'

'This is a game about blocks and adventure, though that might be too one-sided. In this special game, players can explore a randomly generated world alone and create astonishing miracles.'

'Whether it's a cramped prison darkroom or a luxurious grand villa, players can fully utilize their free imagination to create in the game.'

'In Survival Mode, players must collect resources as much as possible to build bases and weapons to cope with unknown dangers. Almost every player can find their own unique fun in the game.'

'The promotional trailer once stated that the only limit to this game's fun would be the player's imagination, and from the current perspective, this is undeniably true.'

'If there's such a genre as a sandbox game, then without a doubt, it's exactly like Minecraft!'

This evaluation was exceptionally high, practically equivalent to the Game Department directly endorsing and recognizing 'sandbox game' as a special genre.

As for designers across the gaming industry, they were repeatedly researching Minecraft's design.

If, before, some game designers had scoffed at this game.

Thinking, "What new tricks could a pixel-style sandbox game possibly pull off?"

Now, however, no one held that attitude any longer, because the facts had proven one thing.

That Minecraft not only pulled off new tricks but did so in a way that garnered adoration from tens of thousands.

However, Chen Xu, at the center of all the discussion, wasn't paying too much attention to the industry and media's reactions to Minecraft at this time.

At this moment, Chen Xu was busy editing and producing a very significant video.

This was the first episode of a video series documenting the history and major events created by players in Minecraft.
