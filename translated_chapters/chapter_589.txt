Chapter 588: Is This Really Still The Witcher? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

In the early hours of the morning, like all other ordinary Witcher players, Grayson immediately entered the two DLCs of The Witcher: Wild Hunt in Huanyu VR.

Although he had been persuaded to delay the release at the meeting, from a certain perspective, he had conceded defeat. Although losing to Chen Xu was not shameful, the key was that he flinched before the fight, and it wasn't even facing a complete game, but just a DLC, which still made him a little hard to accept. So this time, he also immediately entered the game, ready to do some research.

However, Grayson soon discovered a peculiar point. That was, the new expansion content could surprisingly not inherit existing save files, but directly start a new game. Moreover, the White Wolf's level didn't need to start from level 1, but players could directly allocate skill points to choose Signs and playstyles. This kind of design immediately made Grayson's expression solemn.

Because there was only one reason for such a design. That was, to maximize players' immersion in the story content of The Witcher: Wild Hunt expansion. Originally, although The Witcher: Wild Hunt was an open-world game, its RPG elements were still more prominent. But now, directly giving players such a high level, was this removing the progression elements? Grayson secretly guessed in his heart.

“Blood and Wine and Hearts of Stone. Let me try Blood and Wine first and see.” Looking at the two different expansions, from the sequence, Hearts of Stone was before Blood and Wine. If arranged in this order, clearly the official developers hoped players would experience Hearts of Stone's content first and then play Blood and Wine's content. But Grayson still decided to test the waters with Blood and Wine first, because he hadn't been completely unconcerned. It could be known from Nebula Games' previous direct presentation at the theme park. Compared to Hearts of Stone's story content, the story of Blood and Wine took place in a brand new map, Toussaint. Moreover, this brand new map was completely different from Kaer Morhen, Velen, Novigrad, and Skellige Isles. The Witcher: Wild Hunt typically gave players a sense of coldness and oppression. But Toussaint, as presented in the Blood and Wine expansion, was completely different, with a warm and joyful atmosphere and breathtaking scenery. In terms of style, it surprised many players, but as a designer, Grayson knew that doing so carried significant risks. Because different styles might bring about an odd feeling. If not handled well, it would not be a highlight but a flaw.

However, once Grayson truly entered the game, he knew that his idea might not be realized. Simply and clearly through dialogue and the narration of the political landscape, it immediately told players why Toussaint was so special. Why? Because Toussaint had a powerful patron. Toussaint's current ruler, Duchess Anna Henrietta, was the cousin of the Nilfgaardian Emperor. Under the Empire's protection, Toussaint was completely untouched by the conflicts on the continent, becoming a sort of paradise. Coupled with Toussaint's superior geography, especially its wine industry which was famous throughout the continent, these various reasons made Toussaint seem like an ideal kingdom. Moreover, people here also believed in knightly culture. Knights were to uphold the Five Virtues. As for why Geralt came here, it was to investigate a case.

In 1275, three years after the main story of The Witcher: Wild Hunt. In Toussaint's capital, Beauclair, a series of peculiar murders occurred. Both victims were nobles. Their deaths were clearly not human-caused, but as if torn apart by a beast, so the populace gave the mysterious killer a nickname: 'Beast of Beauclair'. Furthermore, with Toussaint's tourney about to commence, the Duchess, in order to quickly find the killer and appease the public, thought of the renowned Witcher: White Wolf Geralt. Guided by two respected knights, players thus arrived in Toussaint, a place like a fairy tale world.

“Is this really still The Witcher?” Grayson was a little disbelieving. Because it was truly too special. Especially in this process, the game was also full of humorous easter eggs. For example, at the beginning, one could see a knight attacking a windmill, and then a monster appeared from behind the windmill and violently beat the knight. This was an easter egg about Don Quixote. Also, when Geralt investigated clues and delved underwater, he could find a note with the initials 'DLC'. It could be said there were surprises everywhere.

...

It wasn't just Grayson; all players who entered the game and chose Blood and Wine first to experience had the same feeling.

“Does it feel like I'm still playing The Witcher: Wild Hunt?”

‘+1, if the protagonist weren't still Geralt and the UI interface still The Witcher: Wild Hunt, I'd feel like it was a completely different game!’

‘Toussaint's design should have referenced the architectural design of Southern France.’

‘Indeed, the giant that appeared behind the windmill at the start said the line 'pté', which means 'pâté' in French.’

‘Toussaint is simply a fairy tale world!’

Many players online, as soon as they entered the game, eagerly exclaimed in surprise and then discussed it in major communities. It wasn't just the change in visual style and tone, but also the in-game experience.

In White Orchard, Velen, and Novigrad, the attitude towards Witchers was entirely unfriendly. Fearing them, or treating them as freaks, it could be said that elsewhere, whether officials and nobles or ordinary commoners, treated Witchers like Geralt as poorly as possible; for most people, Witchers were essentially mere tools. Only when encountering various terrifying monsters would they reluctantly pay to commission a Witcher for help; as for ordinary times, they completely kept their distance from Witchers. But on the land of Toussaint, it was completely different; people's friendliness towards Geralt as a Witcher wasn't just a slight improvement. The people living here harbored no animosity towards Witchers at all; this entirely different treatment truly made one feel deeply emotional. The people in Toussaint were simply two extreme manifestations compared to those outside.

Grayson continued playing; initially, he was amazed by Toussaint. But as the story progressed, as a designer, he keenly noticed that the overall tone of the game had actually not changed; the exterior had changed, but the unique profound core of The Witcher remained unchanged. No matter how glamorous an existence, there would always be some dirty corners, and Toussaint, like a fairy tale park, was clearly no exception.

Returning to the main storyline, the White Wolf headed to a nearby vacant vineyard, but upon arriving, he discovered that a female vampire had already gotten there before him and killed all the guards. After a fierce battle to defeat her, Geralt was then able to examine the victims' bodies. After obtaining some clues and resolving a monster-induced crisis at the tourney grounds, Geralt also met the Duchess. He reported the investigation findings to the Duchess, and the Duchess was surprisingly generous, directly gifting the White Raven Vineyard where the bodies were found to the White Wolf, and promising a large sum of money upon completion of the task. After that, the White Wolf questioned the guard captain for more clues.

And deduced the ferocious beast's motive, which was to expose the dark side of Toussaint's old knights. Here, knights upheld the Five Virtues: Honor, Wisdom, Generosity, Valor, and Compassion. The first two victims had engaged in some immoral behaviors; consequently, one's body was placed on a gallows at the execution ground, and the other was dressed in pajamas, made to look comical, implicitly suggesting they had violated Honor and Wisdom, respectively. So the beast's ultimate goal was to convey a message.

That was, Toussaint's old knights did not uphold the Five Virtues!
