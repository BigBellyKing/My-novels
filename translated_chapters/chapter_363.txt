Chapter 362: Nebula Film Studio's Grand Presentation (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Because at the beginning of that environmental theme, there was a special slogan from Nebula Games.

That is, the content of the themed environment was actual in-game footage.

This meant that the graphics should be similar to actual in-game visuals, though the gameplay might be different.

After all, Nebula Games wouldn't make such a big fuss just for a cowboy farming game; at most, that would be a bonus feature within the game.

And the game's visual presentation, as shown, also made many game designers feel they had seen through to the truth.

'The visual performance is on par with the previous Call of Duty: Modern Warfare!'

'Actually, there's still a slight difference; Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's textures are a bit more prominent, but the color tone and lighting of this themed environment just masked that part.'

'But it's basically confirmed that Red Dead Redemption should be a linear game.'

'Yeah, it's similar to the previous Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.'

'This is also Chen Xu's strong suit: telling a good story.'

Many designers in the industry who were paying attention discussed animatedly.

Judging from the visual presentation of Red Dead Redemption, as long as Nebula Games wasn't faking anything with this themed environment, many felt that their new title would be a linear game.

Just like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, with separate map scenes and using CG to demonstrate map transitions.

Inside Atrai, Antorini also breathed a slight sigh of relief after experiencing this 'farm life'.

His thoughts were essentially the same as those of other designers in the gaming industry.

That is, Chen Xu had adopted the same model for Red Dead Redemption as for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.

And if that were the case, Antorini felt he had a significant advantage.

After all, story-driven games require players to be immersed.

As long as he could announce it before Nebula Games, he could seize a significant head start.

According to his time estimate, if nothing unexpected happened, the launch dates of these two games should be very close.

Moreover, Chen Xu was always known for his efficiency in the gaming industry.

Although the development progress of 'Beautiful World' was very optimistic, he couldn't guarantee that he would definitely seize the initiative.

At the same time, it was time for promotional warm-ups.

After all, Chen Xu's sudden creation of such an environmental theme had put him somewhat on the defensive.

………………

As time progressed, Atrai also launched more targeted promotions.

First, Atrai released a promotional video.

It wasn't a very long video.

In this video, players took on the role of a cowboy galloping through the wilderness, eventually arriving at a small town to eliminate a local bully.

Fans familiar with the original novel instantly became excited, as this was a classic plot segment from the book.

And ordinary casual players were also thrilled, because the short video showcased all the core elements of the Western genre.

Cowboys, revolvers, outlaws, sheriffs, horses, cacti, saloons, deserts, covered wagons...

However, in response to Atrai's promotion, Nebula Games didn't make much of a move, only announcing an update for a new 'Western Game' theme.

It added some mini-game features to the existing farm.

Blackjack, Texas Hold'em, Dominoes, Five Finger Fillet—all very period-appropriate, and it also added a friend score ranking for the Nebula Games Platform.

But Antorini at Atrai felt a pang of frustration, because 'Beautiful World' also had these distinctive mini-games.

Especially Dominoes, which evolved from Pai Gow in the Northern Song Dynasty, and the seemingly barbaric mini-game Five Finger Fillet—they were exactly the same as what Nebula Games released. After all, these were common elements in Western themes, but the key was that Nebula Games had gotten there first.

However, Atrai didn't get discouraged. They released some important character designs and promotional videos, featuring some original characters in addition to the protagonist, which is, of course, a characteristic of adapted works.

The video also generated a lot of buzz, but before Atrai could celebrate, Chen Xu's official Weibo account updated its content almost simultaneously.

A simple message: [Nebula Film Studio's Grand Presentation]

Along with a video link.

Seeing this, Antorini at Atrai instantly felt a tightness in his chest.

Deliberate!

This is absolutely deliberate!

Otherwise, how could it be such a coincidence!?

They just released their promotional video, and you Nebula Games release yours right away!?

As for the truth of the matter?

Hmm... indeed, Chen Xu was intentional.

But ordinary players clearly didn't have so many convoluted thoughts.

The 'farm life' during this period had already made many people curious about what kind of game Red Dead Redemption would be.

Although, based on past experience, Chen Xu would certainly still be in a "making grand promises" state when the promotional video came out, there's an ancient saying about "quenching thirst by looking at plums." Now, they could at least satisfy their hunger by watching the promotional video.

……………………

Countless players immediately clicked on the video released by Chen Xu and Nebula Games' official Weibo account.

At the beginning, Nebula Games' LOGO flashed by.

First to catch the eye was a wilderness. In a forest camp, a middle-aged man spoke to Arthur Morgan.

'After this big score, we'll have money, and then we can get away. What do you think!'

Under the twilight wilderness, a group of people, revolvers in hand and masks on their faces, galloped towards a distant town.

'We met because of Dutch, and to me, this gang is everything.'

In a bustling city, Arthur Morgan and members of the Van der Linde gang were carrying out a robbery.

'Whether it's killing or being killed, I'm willing!'

They were carrying gold bars from the vault, along with wads of colorful cash.

In front of a burning villa late at night, Dutch's gun was aimed at a guard on the ground.

'I wish things hadn't come to this...'

The scene shifted. In the forest, morning dew dripped from the leaves; the textures on the leaves were even clearly visible.

Arthur Morgan spoke to the woman next to him, who wore a cowboy hat.

'This life is almost over; we're constantly hiding.'

The moment the words fell, the scene returned to the burning house, where Dutch and Arthur Morgan were having an argument.

'Trust me, Arthur, I have a plan.'

'There's always a damn train...' Arthur Morgan interrupted Dutch.

The screen went dark, and a rapid, stirring background music filled the ears, along with the sounds of horse hooves, gunshots, explosions, and a train moving on tracks.

Arthur Morgan, Dutch, and members of the gang were attacking a train.

On the night after a successful haul, a group of people in the gang's camp were singing and dancing.

There were old people, a priest, and children.

But the scene suddenly shifted, and a group of uninvited guests appeared at the camp.

'I don't want to kill innocent people, Dutch...'

Gunshots rang out, accompanied by a cold voice.

'Only you will die!'

'You guys advocate savagery...'

A train exploded, gunfights in the wilderness, and blood.

'And you will die in a savage way!'

After a series of gunshots, the screen went dark. About a second later, the scene reappeared.

In a dilapidated house lit by an oil lamp at night, a somewhat haggard Dutch, his face weathered by hardship, raised his hands high to everyone.

'Listen, everyone... this isn't easy, but... trust me!'

As Dutch spoke, the camera slowly moved out of the house, revealing a snow-covered, ancient mountain forest outside.

With the background music softening, the scene slowly transitioned as if through a filter, arriving in a city.

A bustling town, with horse-drawn carriages, streetcars, and streetlights on its streets.

This unique landscape of a special era was displayed before all players.

Then the entire video abruptly ceased.

The game's LOGO appeared on screen.
