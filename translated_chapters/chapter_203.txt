Chapter 202: Widely Popular (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

At Nebula Games, Chen Xu was also paying attention to the performance of Don't Starve.

Compared to the games he had released before, Don't Starve's performance wasn't particularly high. First-day sales of 230,000 didn't look encouraging. After all, Don't Starve itself wasn't expensive, and there had been some market promotion. Moreover, Chen Xu was no longer the unknown nobody he once was, so these sales were far from a surprise.

However, Chen Xu himself wasn't overly disappointed, because unlike previous releases, this time Don't Starve hadn't launched on other platforms. Nebula Games itself described it as a genre unfamiliar to many players: sandbox game. All of this led many players to take a wait-and-see approach. And there was another crucial point: Don't Starve's current player rating was as high as 9.6, which was already an incredibly exaggerated score. Of course, this was also related to the fact that most current buyers of Don't Starve were Nebula Games fans. Once more players poured in, the rating would inevitably drop.

As the first batch of players' word-of-mouth exploded, more and more players became curious about Don't Starve and purchased it. When these players subsequently bought and entered the game, and after playing it a bit and understanding Don't Starve's gameplay, they were instantly captivated by this wonderful game world.

“This is the survival game I've always wanted, it's practically a classic!”

“Yeah, it feels like this might be the most in-depth small game Chen Xu has made in the last two years, right?”

“Agreed!”

“At the very least, this game is definitely a huge surprise. I never expected it to be so fun!”

Players who loved Don't Starve praised the game extensively. And Don't Starve's various settings were indeed very effective at retaining players.

Firstly, there was a clear objective upon entering the game. When players hadn't yet grasped a game's deeper core and gameplay modes, there had to be a clear objective. For example, in a PVP game, the clear objective is to kill opponents and win the match. For PVE games, it's to defeat the final BOSS and clear the game. As a sandbox game, Don't Starve, at a time when players didn't really understand what a sandbox game was, directly gave players a clear objective: to survive and stay alive for as long as possible. With this clear objective, more abundant gameplay elements then branched out.

In Don't Starve, revolving around the main goal of survival, the gameplay that emerged revolved around various physiological needs. The concept of 'people die if they are killed,' which sounds like stating the obvious, was arguably pushed to its extreme in Don't Starve. Without food, you'd starve to death. If the weather was too cold, you'd freeze to death. If your Sanity was too low, you'd suffer from mental instability, leading to hallucinations and being hunted by phantom creatures. So, to avoid starvation, players needed to find food; to avoid freezing to death, they needed to build houses and Warming Stones. In addition, the game contained many dangerous monsters, and at certain times, monster attacks would even occur. This required players to craft weapons to protect themselves. All these were phased objectives that emerged around the theme of survival.

Once players became familiar with these elements, and were able to survive in a corner of this perilous world, that's when the game truly began. Because when players wouldn't die as long as they didn't do anything, exploring the wider world became their pursuit. To experience this living world.

In this world, there were its own operating rules, from the grand changes of seasons to the subtle shifts of day and night, and each season had its unique characteristics. For instance, spring was often rainy. If players didn't prepare equipment like umbrellas or Rain Hats, they would quickly lose body temperature and Sanity due to high humidity, and could easily kick the bucket. And if one's luck was poor enough to hide under a tree during a thunderstorm, they'd have to be extra careful of being struck by lightning. Summer, on the other hand, brought scorching heat. While it was quick to dry jerky during this season, continuous high temperatures could easily lead to heatstroke. Trees in the forest or even base equipment could spontaneously combust due to excessive heat.

If, unfortunately, you built your base too compactly, a summer fire would quickly make you understand what it means to be beyond tears.

As for the most terrifying winter, it was even harder to endure. Besides the deadly cold, almost all crops in the entire world, except for trees, ceased growing. This meant that without ample preparation, winter could lead to a predicament of no grass, no twigs, and no food. The desire to eat one's fill became incredibly strong in winter, making players experience the essence of the game's title, Don't Starve, for the first time. Moreover, seasons weren't just that simple; they even affected the habits of various creatures. For example, in spring, it was best not to approach Beefalo, as it was the mating season with spring flowers blooming. Also, food had its shelf life; after a while, it would gradually become stale or even spoil, eventually turning into rotten food if left unattended.

Then there was monster hunting. In traditional games, monster hunting invariably required good equipment and excellent skills. However, in Don't Starve, this single problem of monster hunting had an infinite number of solutions. You could craft the best equipment, brew the best potions, and then confront monsters head-on. But you could also be a Trap Master, find an open area, fill it with traps, and then, with skillful kiting, enjoy some dessert while watching monsters flip and tumble in your trap array. You could even play a 'driving tigers to devour wolves' trick, watching monsters fight among themselves and then reap the benefits. If you accidentally placed items too close to a bonfire, they would catch fire. If not extinguished promptly, even the most precious items would be reduced to ashes.

Furthermore, the randomly generated maps ensured that each survival attempt by the player was a different journey.

Of course, there was also the most crucial point, which, like most sandbox games, didn't even count the officially released DLC content. The player-created MODs alone brought a lot of fun to the game. Moreover, the Workshop feature itself had already become a characteristic of the Nebula Games Platform. Don't Starve was naturally the same. Chen Xu was also prepared to officially release some unique MODs that don't heavily impact balance, such as numerical displays and architectural geometry, as a way to 'cast a brick to attract jade,' encouraging more players to create their own. After all, that's how sandbox games are; only with player participation can a sandbox game sustain its vitality and give rise to various interesting gameplay methods.

………………

However, compared to ordinary players engrossed in Don't Starve's rich gameplay, game designers in the industry who had been paying attention had a much stronger reaction than the players.

As for Chen Xu, clearly no designer would underestimate him. After all, to this day, Chen Xu could be said to have an illustrious track record. Putting other things aside, the Dark Souls series from last year and this year alone was enough to impress many. However, the unique characteristics of Dark Souls determined that it was a game difficult to imitate. Dark Souls' global success was decided by the overall quality of the game, not just a single outstanding feature. For example, the game's level map design was truly exquisite.

But merely having excellent level map design was clearly not enough. The game's difficulty curve was very reasonably designed, allowing players to gradually overcome powerful enemies through continuous struggle. But if it only had this difficulty curve, could Dark Souls have succeeded? The answer is also no. Perhaps it would have achieved some success, but it definitely wouldn't have exploded in popularity like it has now. Level map design, difficulty curve, and a grand and majestic story worldview setting. It was the combination of all these elements that allowed Dark Souls to achieve its current success. As for so-called Souls-like games, many players in his previous life simply equated them with high difficulty, which was a completely incorrect understanding. Because a 'Souls game' doesn't refer to a single aspect, but rather the comprehensive overall performance. So, even today, although many game designers have been envious of Dark Souls and attempted to imitate it, not a single one has made any significant splash, let alone reached the heights of Dark Souls.

However, Don't Starve was completely different. Its appearance made many game designers in the industry feel as if they were back to when Chen Xu, fresh off making an 18R Adult Game, introduced Undertale.
