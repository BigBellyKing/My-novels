Chapter 452: From Awesome to Must-Buy (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

As the video content was released, it instantly sparked heated discussions among players.

A significant reason was that the video showcased enough content.

However, there was also a lot of content that left many players baffled.

“So, the game should have two storylines, right? In reality, there's that young man named Desmond, who uses that machine to go back to ancient times!”

“Exactly, exactly! So players play as Desmond, and through that machine, travel back to various eras to experience those grand and epic stories?”

“But the plot is a bit mysterious! I didn't quite understand it. Is it multi-threaded narration? Desmond's modern storyline, Ezio's ancient storyline, and the last Assassin doesn't seem to be Ezio, right?”

“Indeed, it's not Ezio. Although his face isn't visible, from his physique, he's different from Ezio.”

“That's right, not Ezio. The movements are different, clearly not using the same animation module. I have to say, Mr. Chen is truly meticulous! If it were a typical game developer, they would definitely just use one animation module.”

“While you're praising him, I don't think Mr. Chen would like that.”

“Enough! I don't know about anything else, but I do know that this Assassin is incredibly cool! Especially the one called Ezio, he's mind-blowingly awesome. Thousands of soldiers and horses avoid a single white robe! Five people just charged in recklessly. Is that even an Assassin?!”

“As if the end wasn't cool! He blended into the crowd from the top of the bell tower in an instant, assassinated the target in broad daylight, and then vanished into the crowd!”

“Honestly, in history, many Assassins actually acted openly in public. Look up Nie Zheng.”

“But it feels like Assassin's Creed isn't really a historical game in the true sense, with Golden Apples and Assassins.”

“Isn't alternate history quite normal? And how awesome is this Assassin called Ezio!”

After watching the video, many players engaged in intense discussions.

However, there were also quite a few controversies.

Firstly, from the content, it was clearly visible that each segment was set in a different era.

Aside from the Assassins' attire still being so pretentious and cool.

One could glean clues from the ordinary civilians' clothing and the architectural styles.

Coupled with the previous promotional trailer about the Animus.

Therefore, most players were able to make some educated guesses about the content.

That is, Desmond experiences the stories of various Assassin Masters from different periods based on the information in his DNA.

So, in the game's modern storyline, Desmond is definitely the protagonist, and in the ancient storyline, the one named Ezio is certainly the protagonist. But it's unclear if the white-clad Assassin who appeared at the very end is also a protagonist.

At the same time, many players felt that the game's background should be an alternate history.

After all, with Golden Apples and Assassins, it clearly has absolutely no relation to real history.

This also caused some players to worry about whether Assassin's Creed could truly handle the sense of history well.

The other area players focused on discussing was the game's various gameplay elements.

Although not directly showcased, the promotional CG gave players much to imagine.

Because the game featured scenes of confronting enemies head-on, fleeing a thousand li after an assassination, and even leading allies in a direct assault.

In terms of weapons, the video alone showed longswords, Hidden Blades, throwing knives, and axes, giving an all-encompassing feeling.

Of course, besides these, there was one more point that excited players the most, and it was also the most crucial point.

That is, the Assassins in this game are just incredibly cool.

A hooded cloak, Hidden Blade, along with stylish assassinations and parkour movements—this combination punch completely dumbfounded many players.

After watching, only one word filled their minds: Cool!

Two words: Mind-blowingly cool!

Coupled with a close-up shot from the promotional video, this coolness was showcased to the extreme.

Even though the protagonist's face wasn't visible, this outfit alone was enough to excite players.

And this perfectly aligned with the Assassin image in players' minds.

After all, players always tend to imagine things more beautifully.

Playing a dirty, unkempt beggar who spends half a year begging on the streets to establish his identity, then finally performing an assassination only to be hunted down and left in a sorry state.

Where is the coolness of such a realistic Assassin compared to the one in the promotional CG?

Could the Assassin experience it brings to players be the same?

Just by watching this promotional trailer, combined with Nebula Games' consistent reputation, many players had already decided to buy it like crazy.

At this point, they had already mentally pictured what their in-game experience would be like.

It was going to be incredibly cool!

And this 'coolness' that filled players' minds, slowly evolving over time and tempered by emotions, began to change again.

From 'Cool!' it turned into 'Buy!'

From 'Mind-blowingly cool!' it became 'Must-buy!'

……………………

Following the promotional video, players engaged in various discussions and hot debates on community platforms such as forums, Tieba, and the official Weibo account.

Assassin's Creed's popularity soared immediately.

The CG released by Chen Xu highlighted two other characters in the game.

The first was Ezio in his middle age, who founded the Brotherhood, and the other was the Assassin Master Altaïr.

As for Desmond, he had already appeared in the first promotional video introducing the Animus, so Chen Xu did not include him in this one.

Regarding the characters, Chen Xu revealed Ezio's name in the promotional video.

However, Chen Xu did not reveal Altaïr's name.

The main reason was that in the trilogy Chen Xu was developing, Altaïr's screen time primarily focused on the later parts.

During Ezio's youth and middle age, Altaïr would only be mentioned but not deeply explored.

It wouldn't be until the Revelations section, when Ezio, in his old age, followed Altaïr's footsteps to Masyaf and Byzantium, eventually entering the library to see the legendary Assassin's remains, that relevant DLC content about Altaïr would be unlocked, allowing players to learn about the life of this legendary Assassin Mentor from a century ago.

As for the current CG, players couldn't understand it for now, nor could they figure out what it was truly saying, or what the phrase 'Nothing is true, everything is permitted' implied.

This was actually completely unimportant, as Chen Xu's purpose in creating this CG animation wasn't for players to understand everything.

If players could understand the entire story of the game just from a CG animation, then how would he sell his game?

As long as this CG animation could make players feel it was mind-blowingly cool, and that mind-blowing coolness could be translated into a must-buy.

Then this CG animation would have achieved its value and mission.

And judging by the current online discussions and popularity among players, it was clearly a great success.
