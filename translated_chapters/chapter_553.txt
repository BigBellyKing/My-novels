Chapter 552: Mr. Chen, Give Me Back My Emotional Investment! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

After the game content finished playing, Chen Xu's voice was transmitted through the park's equipment to all players' ears, while relevant English subtitles were displayed on the holographic projection.

“First, welcome everyone to this Nebula Games Carnival. As you just saw, `Super Mario Maker` is the latest title Nebula Games is bringing to the Switch today.”

“In this game, players can freely create Mario levels and share them with the world.”

“Different scene maps, combined with different characteristics: forests, underground, ice and snow…”

Accompanying Chen Xu's introduction, corresponding visual content was also displayed on the large screen behind him.

Many players at the scene were equally astonished.

Because as Chen Xu introduced it, they found the game content to be truly rich. All sorts of different scenes were paired with distinct elemental features, for example, there were 3D themes and also pixel themes, different main items, level mechanisms, and even operating modes seemed to be distinct.

For many Switch owners, most had played the Mario series available in the membership library. This was influenced by the previous `Super Mario Odyssey`.

However, what they found most interesting was that they could create different levels within the game, and it also seemed to support multiplayer? Divided into competitive and cooperative modes?

As Chen Xu explained, the players below began to discuss animatedly.

‘I feel like it’s quite interesting. Players all over the world can play maps I made? And the game has multiplayer mode!’

‘Yeah, it feels really positive and adorable! It should be similar to `Party Animals`, where friendship comes first and winning second, right?’

‘Exactly, exactly! This time, Mr. Chen has truly changed! This is yet another very positive game.’

‘That's right, I can already imagine how harmonious and loving the atmosphere in the game will be. And look at the voice lines in the game, they’re very friendly too! It's either ‘Please help me’, ‘Please come over here’, or ‘I lost’, ‘You worked hard’. It feels especially friendly!’

The players present listened to Chen Xu’s explanation, all discussing the style and content of `Super Mario Maker`.

After all, this was Mario. The previous `Super Mario Odyssey` on Switch and some subsequent Mario series games launched in the membership library had made players very clear about what kind of game this was. One could say it was a family-friendly platformer, and children especially would love this type of game. Now `Super Mario Maker` was clearly of the same type, how amiable!

“That concludes the content for `Super Mario Maker`. Next, please watch…”

Chen Xu, with a smile, paused, then raised his right hand and snapped his fingers.

Immediately after, accompanied by the start of background music, the entire audience erupted in cheers and exclamations. Compared to the more niche platformer games, this background music clearly brought them greater excitement.

The melody, named 'Geralt Finds Ciri', was the exquisite tune from `The Witcher: Wild Hunt` when Geralt and Ciri first reunited.

Amidst the cheers of countless players, the holographic projection displayed a scene.

It was the familiar Witcher, but then, with a hawk's cry, the camera slowly pulled back, and the players' cheers rose again. Because they were all stunned!

It was a completely unfamiliar map scene.

How should one describe it? Fairy tale!

Yes, they had only one feeling: fairy tale!

This word, quite incongruous with `The Witcher: Wild Hunt`, was applied here.

The sky was clear, a gentle breeze swept across the water, and the woods and bushes were laden with abundant, juicy fruits. Rivers flowed, and music never ceased, with birdsong and the singing of beautiful maidens drifting everywhere. When handsome knights called, the maidens were unreserved in their charm. There were magnificent elven monuments: intricate towers, exquisitely carved reliefs, and mysterious ruins. And the incredibly grand capital of Beauclair.

If not for the familiar Witcher, if not for this familiar melody, no player would have thought this was `The Witcher: Wild Hunt`. Because before, whether it was Velen, White Orchard, the Skellige Isles, or Novigrad, they were all somber. Even Novigrad was full of gloom, but this scene named Toussaint was truly like a fairy tale.

“Toussaint, a small vassal duchy under the Nilfgaardian Empire, is hailed as the 'Kingdom of Fairy Tales,' the 'Land of Wine and Love.' And here, our White Wolf Geralt will receive the curtain call for his final ending.”

“`Blood and Wine` will be one of the DLCs for `The Witcher: Wild Hunt`. In this DLC, equipment and character skill trees will see new changes, and a new independent region: Toussaint, will be added.”

“And besides the new region, on the original `The Witcher: Wild Hunt` map, we have also added a brand-new DLC main questline: `Hearts of Stone`.”

As Chen Xu introduced this, all the players were incredibly excited; only frantic cheers could release the agitation in their hearts.

Facing the cheering players, Chen Xu did not continue, instead giving everyone time to vent, and secretly giving a signal to the staff beside him.

‘Mr. Chen has changed too much this time! He’s not like himself anymore!’ A young man with glasses in the crowd exclaimed emphatically. As his voice fell, a black man next to him showed a surprised expression. He understood a little Chinese, so he had been very excited when Chen Xu was explaining. Hearing the bespectacled young man talk about Chen Xu, the black man also grew curious: “Friend, why do you say that? Isn’t the `The Witcher: Wild Hunt` DLC looking amazing?”

“It is indeed amazing, but this is not Mr. Chen's style. Especially with the recent series of joyful and wholesome games, and judging from the style of the Toussaint map, it's just too bright and sunny. It feels like Mr. Chen has truly become very kind and friendly.” The bespectacled young man explained to the black man with a sigh, also reminiscing about his lost youth.

But just then, the lights of the holographic projection in front suddenly went out.

Only the lights in their plaza remained on.

As everyone was still surprised and unclear about the situation, an incredibly familiar voice that also made countless people shiver appeared.

‘My name? My… my name is…’

‘Ethan…’

‘Ethan… Winters.’

Instantly, the black man looked at the bespectacled young man beside him with a “Are you kidding me?” expression.

Friendly? Sunny? Are you serious?

The bespectacled young man, and many other players, were also dumbfounded.

Many at this moment had only one thought: Mr. Chen, give me back my emotional investment!
