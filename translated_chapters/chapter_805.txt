Chapter 804: The 3D Zone Cannot Be Without Tifa, Just as the West Cannot Be Without Jerusalem

Listening to Yang Xin's words, Qin Yi, Meng Zuo, and the others all wore pained expressions. What did she mean by all the secrets being hidden in Azeroth? You're not a Great Pirate!

However, everyone knew that since Chen Xu said it, he definitely wasn't bragging. He truly hid easter eggs for a new game within *Warcraft*, because when *Warcraft* was originally developed, Chen Xu specifically included many such easter egg characters, which no one knew about at the time. It wasn't until the new project was released that many people were surprised to discover that arrangements had already been made back then.

So, after learning about this content, Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, and others privately began exploring Azeroth, hoping to find some clues. Although Chen Xu would surely hold a meeting when officially launching a new project, that would take away a bit of the fun.

While Qin Yi and the others were searching for clues about the new project, players online were also discussing it. Of course, ordinary players weren't getting any special information; it had simply become a habit. One could say that almost every month, both domestically and internationally, there were numerous so-called 'Insiders'. One day they'd say Nebula Games was preparing a sequel to *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*, the next they'd claim a sequel to *The Witcher: Wild Hunt* was in development. The day after, someone else would announce that a sequel to *Red Dead Redemption* was coming. In any case, no renowned IP under Nebula Games could escape, and their claims always seemed well-reasoned. What if they guessed wrong? So what if they guessed wrong? It was no skin off their backs, but if they guessed right, that would be awesome!

…………

“Ah! Mr. Chen, there’s no news at all about this new project!” Yang Xin couldn't help but let out a wail in the lounge area. After work every day during this period, they would all go to Azeroth to search for the supposed easter egg content, wanting to figure out what the new project was exactly. But with no idea about the game’s genre or theme, searching for it was clearly like finding a needle in a haystack. If they were ordinary players, they would have given up after a while and dismissed it. But the fact that everyone knew Mr. Chen was contemplating a new project made it very hard to endure.

“Why don’t we just ask Mr. Chen directly?” Qin Yi smacked his lips and said.

“Yeah, let’s just ask Mr. Chen directly,” Ruan Ningxue echoed.

“Sigh, last time Mr. Chen brushed me off like a child, deflecting the topic and being very perfunctory when I asked,” Yang Xin sighed.

“Sister Xin! You asked Mr. Chen!?” At first, they didn’t react, but after realizing what Yang Xin meant, Qin Yi and the others widened their eyes.

“Ahem… just curious,” Yang Xin coughed softly.

“Sister Xin! That’s a traitorous act!” Ruan Ningxue sternly criticized, following up. They had all been trying to find the easter egg clues Mr. Chen mentioned in Azeroth all this time!

“Alright, alright, I’ll take the lead this time, okay?” Seeing that she had incurred public wrath, Yang Xin spread her hands, stood up from her chair with a helpless expression.

Seeing Yang Xin get up, Ruan Ningxue and the others couldn't help but exchange V-signs.

………………

In Nebula Games' office, Chen Xu's computer screen was displaying a unique female model. Willow-leaf eyebrows, almond-shaped eyes, cherry lips, combined with a standard oval face and a high nose bridge, along with flowing black hair, gathered all the beautiful characteristics of an Eastern woman, perfectly embodying what it meant to have an angelic face and a devilish figure.

Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, and the others, who had knocked and received permission to enter the office, instantly saw the brand-new character model.

“So beautiful!”

“Mr. Chen, is this a character for a new game?” Seeing the female model on the screen, everyone’s eyes lit up, and then they realized something.

“You could say that, but it’s not for a new game currently. She’s one of the protagonists of our new CG animated film,” Chen Xu nodded, then shook his head.

“What!?”

Qin Yi and the others looked bewildered. Did… did they mishear?

What did Mr. Chen just say?

A CG animated film?

Aren't they a game company?!

“Don’t make such faces. The main purpose is to boost the influence of our Nebula Games, including the Nebula Games Theme Park. Relying solely on games isn’t enough; film and television adaptation is a very important direction,” Chen Xu said, looking at everyone’s astonished expressions. “Also, it’s a way to advertise for upcoming new releases.”

In his previous life, major game developers had already begun diversifying. Classic masterpieces like Uncharted, The Last of Us, The Witcher, and Halo had all attempted film and television adaptations. Even in this Parallel World, many game developers had done the same, with Atari being a specialist in it, although they mostly adapted films into games. Now, this was considered an experiment, and more importantly, Nebula Games certainly wasn’t short on money.

Compared to Chen Xu's nonchalance, Yang Xin and the others couldn't help but grumble inwardly after hearing his words. Is this how you advertise!? Others make a promotional video for advertising, but now he's directly making a movie!? Of course, despite their internal grumbling, everyone was still very curious about this new project.

“So, Mr. Chen, is this a female-led project?” Qin Yi asked tentatively.

“Not really. The new project will be an Ensemble RPG, similar to the traditional RPG mode of *Xenoblade Chronicles*, but with a more aesthetic and realistic style,” Chen Xu replied, shaking his head.

Listening to Chen Xu’s words and looking at the model on the screen, a few of them nodded instinctively.

“As for the theme of the new project, it will fuse various elements like magic, weaponry, steam machinery, and summon beasts, like a fantasy. Its name will be *Final Fantasy*.”

Chen Xu gave a brief introduction of the relevant background to everyone. The character on the screen before them was Tifa, the female protagonist from the seventh installment. She was one of the most beloved female characters in gaming history. After more than a decade, even with rising stars like Marie Rose, D.Va, and 2B, Tifa still managed to dominate the 3D Zone. She even caused a sudden assassination attempt in the Italian Senate, leading countless players to exclaim: “The 3D Zone cannot be without Tifa, just as the West cannot be without Jerusalem.”

*Final Fantasy*, also with a long history, has given birth to many classics. The reason for choosing this particular *Final Fantasy* installment, with Tifa as a central figure, was certainly not due to Tifa's status in the 3D Zone. After all, while Tifa is top-tier, Lightning (Final Fantasy), who later endorsed LV, is no pushover either.

The main reason for selecting this installment was its derivative films. In Chen Xu's previous life, the *Final Fantasy* series released three major CG films: *Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within*, *Advent Children*, and *Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV*. *Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within* cost $160 million and nearly bankrupted Square Enix. They learned their lesson and adapted their ace, FF7, again. *Advent Children* was no longer a money pit like *Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within*, allowing Square Enix to make a fortune and even be invited to the Venice Film Festival for two consecutive years. But after that success, Square Enix got carried away again, releasing the even larger-scale *Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV*, and the result was, naturally, that they lost their shirts.

Similarly, FF7 enjoys immense popularity worldwide. Besides the game's inherent quality, it also has a certain connection to the impact brought by *Advent Children*. Many players came to know Cloud, Tifa, Aerith, and Sephiroth not through the PlayStation era games, but through the *Advent Children* CG film.

This is why Chen Xu decided to lead with this installment, combining games and film to expand the IP's and Nebula Games' recognition. In fact, despite *Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV* receiving overwhelmingly negative reviews in his previous life and almost crashing Square Enix again, the subsequent sales of *Final Fantasy XV* demonstrated the influence of its film promotion. Even with overwhelmingly negative reviews at launch, its sales still reached fourth place in the main series.

Of course, the later cancellation of DLC content and the completion of the story through novels also left countless players with regrets about this title.

Naturally, for Chen Xu, he didn't solely want to drive game sales through CG films. What Chen Xu desired was to leverage the dual power of games and CG films to boost the influence of the IP and Nebula Games. Moreover, from the perspective of merchandise, *Final Fantasy* was also very suitable.

With handsome men and beautiful women like Cloud, Sephiroth, Tifa, and Aerith, adorable mascots like Moogles and Chocobos, and for those with heavier tastes, there were Professor Hojo and Don Corneo, and if humans weren't your thing, Red XIII could also satisfy — it was truly a comprehensive package!
