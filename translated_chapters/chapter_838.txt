Chapter 837: Tormented to the Point of Doubting Life

Looking at the collected Runes, Song Ren was just about to have a grand battle with the sword-and-shield knight in the dark room, but the next second, he noticed the number of Runes in his vision and froze.

Counting the Runes he had acquired on his way up from the Site of Grace, he only had over 9,000 after picking up the previously dropped Runes.

Compared to when he dropped them earlier, it was a whole three thousand less!

He had died a few times before, especially when the trap in a chest under the Dragon-Burnt Ruins teleported him to a mine. But previous deaths were basically identical to the death penalties in Dark Souls and Bloodborne: Runes would drop where he died or nearby, and he could retrieve them as long as he didn't die again on the way.

But what the heck was this now!?

Why were nearly 30% of the Runes gone after picking them up?

In Sekiro, after dying, a percentage of money was lost, which could be explained as a protection fee paid to the Sculptor.

But what was this now? Not only did the money drop where he died, but they also charged him a handling fee?

Was that even allowed!

………………

While Song Ren was still paranoid about a few thousand Runes, the online buzz and discussions surrounding “Elden Ring” had already erupted.

The combination of Souls-like gameplay and open-world elements had attracted countless curious players.

And after diving into “Elden Ring,” many veteran Dark Souls players were similarly tormented to death; it was truly a scene of widespread lament.

On live streaming and video platforms, almost any stream or video you clicked on would show players dying in inexplicable ways.

In the deep valley of Raya Lucarian Academy.

A player, having wandered in by mistake, was happily scavenging for shiny items when, the next second, a tire-like scraping sound came from behind him. He instinctively turned his head to see a metal machine wielding two Blade Wheels charging at him.

A furious onslaught crushed the player to a sliver of health. But before he could celebrate, the box-like front of the metal machine suddenly opened, and a cluster of arm-like appendages reached out and embraced him.

“Holy crap… What is this? I’m being eaten!?” The player was utterly shocked, staring bewildered at the screen as he was swallowed into the metal robot’s belly.

But what bewildered him even more was that after respawning, he found himself in a scene resembling an underground volcano, where he couldn’t teleport, and after dying, he would respawn right back there.

“Holy crap! Just like the Dragon-Burnt Ruins? I fell into another trap!? Is my character ruined again?!”

In the large lake near the Church of Vows, in front of Raya Lucarian Academy.

A player, riding his Spirit Steed Torrent, was leisurely heading towards the Raya Lucarian Academy. As he occasionally passed a lake, stones that looked like they were covered in green moss suddenly floated up from the water. They were all enormous lobsters.

“Oh wow, look at all these giant lobsters! Good thing I have a mount, aren’t you surprised! I’m out of here!” The player chuckled, looking at the lobsters beside him. This was his favorite part of “Elden Ring.” If he encountered an unbeatable enemy or BOSS in the open world, he could ride his horse and kite them.

Compared to the pure running mechanics in Dark Souls and Bloodborne, this kiting method in Elden Ring was so much more convenient. But just as he finished speaking, the floating lobsters opened their mouths. Liquid, like sharp arrows, shot out from their heads, piercing him and his horse instantly.

His long health bar evaporated like tofu in a flash.

“Holy crap! What the hell was that!? These lobsters are so strong? You’re the Elden Lord, aren’t you!?” Seeing the “YOU DIED!” logo appear on his screen, the player was utterly stunned.

The lobster’s attack was incredibly fast, giving him no time to react, and its damage was explosively high. He had a feeling that if Godrick the Grafted, that pushover in Stormveil Castle, had grafted a lobster head instead of a dragon head, he would have already reached the Erdtree and become the new Elden Lord.

Caria Manor.

A player was carefully walking, shield raised, when suddenly two giant hands descended from the sky, making him jump. Then, from the nearby woods and the hot springs in front of the statues, countless small, worm-like hands emerged.

“What the hell!? What kind of monster is this!? Little hands holding big hands, not afraid of slipping when walking?”

Facing the pile of Fingercreepers, the player had no intention of fighting. He turned and ran towards a small path nearby. Souls-like players know that the most terrifying thing in a game is not encountering a powerful BOSS, but being surrounded by a group of small mobs. The saying, “Three dogs can rival a Lord of Cinder,” is no joke.

Furthermore, the appearance of these Fingercreepers was chilling, so he decisively chose to run. But in his panic, combined with the gloomy environment, in the jungle along the side path, he didn't notice the five fingers exposed on the ground ahead. The moment he stepped into the center, a large hand suddenly burst out of the ground, seizing him whole.

‘Crunch, crunch!’ The sound of bones breaking filled his ears, and his already incomplete health bar instantly evaporated. In this sudden fright, the player completely broke down, and various polite greetings spilled from his mouth.

Besides this, many players discovered that as the game’s story progressed, upon reaching later areas, all sorts of insane scenarios and monsters appeared. In the upper part of the Carian Study Hall, facing a powerful mage, many players realized for the first time how strong a spellcaster who could blink truly was.

After participating in Starscourge Radahn’s farewell ceremony with countless warriors, players arrived for the first time in the Eternal City of the underground world. Here, besides slug-like monsters, there were many Minotaurs, as if hinting at something. Their long-range lightning arrows made players clearly understand what it meant for every shot to hit its mark.

Of course, that wasn't the crucial point. What truly baffled players was encountering hairy, long-legged ants in the underground world, which made them shiver uncontrollably.

Beneath Stormveil Castle, besides rats, there was also a Lovecraftian Great Octopus with maxed-out SAN points and grotesque pus-filled monsters. As for the Royal Capital, the Elder Curse Frogs with large eyes and the Maggot-spitting creatures that constantly demanded hugs made players understand true cruelty.

Beyond these SAN-value-plummeting monsters, the game's various malicious dungeons also made many players, who had long adapted to Souls-like games, doubt life itself. Dungeons that were like supernatural loops, but the actual path was below an elevator.

After passing through the Black Blade Kindred of Crumbling Farum Azula and reaching the collapsed Royal Capital, the Royal Capital sewers made countless players contemplate quitting. In the dark, lightless sewer labyrinth, maggot-like monsters, gigantic centipede spirits, spider spirits, large pus-filled hulks, gargoyles hidden on walls and ceilings, and large-eyed Elder Curse Frogs ravaged the fragile minds of countless players.

For many players who approached with their old Souls-like game experience, this journey through Elden Ring was nothing short of a hellish trip; they were all tormented into a state of mental blur.

However, even though many players were tormented into mental confusion, there was still a group of players who discovered the exhilarating aspects within it. Through various research, they found an easy and enjoyable path through the game.
