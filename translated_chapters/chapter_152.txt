Chapter 151: The Most Perfect Two-Player Game! (Seven updates, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)

Before experiencing *It Takes Two*, neither Zhang Yi nor Wang Han had imagined a two-player cooperative game of such a large scale.

After grinding for a whole day, it seemed they had only experienced less than half of the game's content.

In the subsequent plot, *It Takes Two* continued to maintain its previous brilliance.

After the Little Cutie storyline, though it lessened some of the earlier joy and added a touch of somberness to their journey, they were soon captivated by even cooler levels and abilities.

In the scene involving the Cuckoo Clock, May and Cody once again acquired two unique abilities. Cody could manipulate time, restoring destroyed objects, while May gained the ability to create clones. Just like in previous levels, every section required them to utilize their special abilities.

This particular scene also featured many amazing segments, such as soaring through the sky on a little bird, which left a deep impression on both of them.

However, during this part of the journey, Zhang Yi and Wang Han also noticed something different: Cody and May's cooperation became more tacit, and their relationship grew more intimate. Especially at the end of this level when the clock exploded, Cody used time reversal to allow May to escape, perfectly showcasing their tacit coordination.

This parkour experience was as intense and thrilling as a sci-fi blockbuster. The sight of the two stumbling and bumping into each other, and finally their daughter Rose happily looking at the repaired Cuckoo Clock, dispelled some of the gloom from the Little Cutie storyline for Zhang Yi and Wang Han, while also making them more curious about the subsequent plot.

After completing the Cuckoo Clock storyline, it was again the boisterous emotional expert Dr. Hakim's special segment.

Under Dr. Hakim's guidance, Cody and May arrived at a new scene: the Snow Globe. In this level, Cody and May's items were split magnets, requiring them to overcome challenges by utilizing the principle of like poles repelling and opposite poles attracting.

But unlike before, after the perilous adventure of the Cuckoo Clock, Cody and May's relationship seemed to have eased. Inside the Snow Globe, they also revisited the past. A tree with a saw stuck in it triggered their memories.

“Oh, look! A saw!”

“Hey, remember our first Christmas with Rose?”

“You mean when all the Christmas trees were sold out?”

“Yeah!”

“And when we snuck into the woods.”

“To cut down a tree?”

“I thought for sure we’d get caught.”

On their adventurous journey, the two also began to talk about past events. They discovered a desolate town, frozen by snow and ice. Dr. Hakim told them that ringing the bell would restore prosperity to the town.

The game didn't explicitly say it, but Zhang Yi and Wang Han, while playing, clearly understood the metaphor of this scene. Undoubtedly, it referred to May and Cody's frozen hearts.

During their journey through this scene, May and Cody talked about old times.

“This is where we proposed. I was so nervous then.”

“I know, that’s what made that moment so special.”

“Really?”

“You forgot the whole speech you’d prepared.”

“That was the worst proposal in history.”

“No, I didn’t care what you said. I cared about how you acted. You didn’t try to hide your fear, and that was brave.”

Just as the desolate, frozen town was awakened by the bell, their relationship also seemed to be slowly mending.

Town, bell tower, Underwater Candy Factory – unique scenes one after another, still featuring excellent puzzle mechanisms. Eventually, the two ascended and reminisced about all the past events.

“Finally, we can catch our breath.”

“Yeah, we deserve this.”

“Absolutely!”

“Exactly!”

“You know, ever since Rose was born, we haven’t been on vacation once.”

“It’s been that long!?”

“Right, why didn’t we go skiing together?”

“Well, Rose was born then, and household expenses got higher.”

Chatting on the cable car, this level made players feel a sense of warmth within the game. At this point, the cable car descended, and Cody and May began a gliding race on the ice slope. Two consecutive thrilling and exciting ski journeys had Zhang Yi and Wang Han thoroughly hooked.

Afterward, Dr. Hakim appeared, and what was even more amazing was that their magnets gained the ability to attract each other. This was no longer a hint, but almost a direct indication.

Zhang Yi and Wang Han, in front of the monitor, also recalled the various previous themed scenes and realized that none of them were useless.

The Shed and Great Tree simply introduced the story background and led players to familiarize themselves with gameplay. The vacuum cleaner's rage and the squirrel and bee infestation subtly hinted at marital discord.

Upon reaching the Rose's Room theme, the game truly entered a tumultuous phase. They mistakenly believed that their daughter's tears were the culprit behind them becoming dolls. As they attempted to destroy their daughter's toys to make her cry again, a space toy monkey appeared to stop their evil deeds. Parents wanting to make their daughter sad, while the toy wanted to protect the daughter – this highly ironic plot was like a scalpel cutting deep into the parent-child relationship. Subsequently, breaking Little Cutie pushed the game's conflict to its peak, highlighting that as parents, they had never cared about their child's feelings.

But it was precisely from this moment that the game's pace began to shift. The Cuckoo Clock represented time; facing the daily grind of life, would they give each other enough time together? The Snow Globe represented attraction. What truly brought them together? As they completed the Snow Globe level, the two stood there, talking about the past, clearly beginning to care about each other.

Outside the Snow Globe, their daughter Rose saw the Snow Globe glow again, and some of the gloom in her heart was also swept away.

Playing up to this point, Zhang Yi and Wang Han realized the game was probably nearing its end. And that was indeed the case. The subsequent Garden level still featured brand new items and very interesting levels. At the same time, various fun mini-games also increased here. However, what Zhang Yi and Wang Han were most concerned about at this point, besides the interesting cooperative challenges, was the game's plot, which also attracted them.

In the Garden, the psychedelic purple mist, withered and decaying branches, and dilapidated ruins all indicated an abandoned, desolate garden. This had once been Cody's most treasured place. After defeating the BOSS and the purple mist dispersed, lush green plants grew from the earth, and specks of yellow light floated, showcasing the green nature of spring returning to the earth and all things growing. The originally withered Joey also came back to life, symbolizing the return of Cody's former passion.

“I’m sorry, I didn’t know how important that was to Cody back then. Now... I understand.” May apologized to the blooming Joey.

But Joey, in turn, enlightened May. “Cody giving up gardening wasn’t your fault.”

“Cody, no one can take your dream away from you unless you give it up yourself. Are you going to give it up now?”

Through his conversation with Joey, Cody understood that no one could take his dream away. Everything depended on his own choices. Love is the driving force behind people's self-discipline, as it leads one to proactively and self-disciplinedly solve problems.

In the final scene, Cody and May, led by Dr. Hakim, arrived in the attic. The last theme was music, which was May's former dream. Gongs, drums, and singing were Cody and May's special abilities in this level. With Cody and May jointly overcoming the level, and with Dr. Hakim's help, they found speakers, microphones, and lights, defeated the Flying Demon, and rescued the Orchestra. The concert preparations were largely complete; all that remained was to rehearse and find an audience.

Heading to the Disco, Cody and May found the audience for this concert—a group of Glow Sticks. After all this was done, a unique concert began, amidst countless Glow Sticks watching. From behind the stage, May slowly walked onto the stage. Overcoming her inner worries, May stood on stage and sang loudly.

Thus, amidst May's music, the blooming fireworks, and the cheers of countless Glow Sticks, Cody and May floated directly above the stage, embraced each other tightly, and kissed deeply.

This also meant that their originally fractured relationship finally merged at this moment. Having turned into dolls, they had finally found the true way to turn back. May, sleeping on the sofa, and Cody, slumped on the table, woke up.

And as Cody and May rediscovered their love through countless trials, their daughter Rose was actually working hard to save her parents' love. The young girl thought the root of her parents' arguments was herself, so she chose to leave home to make her parents friends again.

Of course, Cody and May eventually found Rose. In front of the train station, May and Cody walked hand-in-hand with their daughter Rose, slowly heading towards home.

The game ended here, but the subsequent credits roll also gave many players some surprises. The repaired vacuum cleaner, the organized toolbox, the re-homed space monkey, the cleaned garden with blooming flowers, the repaired Little Cutie, the Cuckoo Clock on the wall, the Snow Globe on the table, the phonograph playing music, and the Book of Love placed alone on the bookshelf, all made people couldn't help but smile knowingly.

Watching these scenes, Zhang Yi and Wang Han, in front of the monitor, also smiled slightly.

“This should be the most fun co-op game I’ve ever played!” Zhang Yi said with some emotion.

Wang Han, next to him, nodded in agreement: “Please remove the words ‘should be’!”
