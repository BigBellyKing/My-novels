Chapter 774: Is This What a Traditional RPG Map Should Be Like?

Based on the game's worldview, the so-called Cloud Sea clearly corresponds to the ocean, and the Titans correspond to ships or land.

But the crucial question is, how many people can these Titans accommodate?

"So, is it an alternative nautical-themed game? Players control the protagonist Rex, venturing through the Cloud Sea of Alrest, and together they head towards the World Tree?"

Zhang Yi pondered.

The game's content quickly arrived at Geltmont Port, which offered a series of tutorial guides: opening and viewing the map, and a money-making gameplay similar to salvaging. While there, he also completed a hide-and-seek quest with his teammates. The overall framework of the game felt very retro to Zhang Yi, embodying the most traditional RPG structure.

However, regarding its map, Zhang Yi felt a surprising sense of freedom, especially since he could control Rex to reach seemingly inaccessible areas through jumping. Notably, Zhang Yi lost his first life here; after a short jog to the third floor of the inn, he was happily hopping around, misstepped, and plummeted, claiming his first life.

After exploring the exchange, places like the inn and shops were all locked. Evidently, they would gradually unlock as the story progressed. Finding little he could currently interact with, Zhang Yi followed the prompts to advance the plot.

"Nia, Malos, and Jin? These should be allies, right? But this Mr. Bana doesn't look like a good guy."

As the story advanced, watching Rex undertake the salvager's task, Zhang Yi speculated about the factions of the various characters. The promotional trailer had already revealed some content: Nia was on Rex’s side. As for Malos and Jin, whether they were allies was hard to say. Judging by Malos’s sudden attack on Rex, Jin’s robot-like lack of emotional fluctuation, and Nia’s slight show of indignation, these two rough fellows were likely antagonists, and Nia might eventually join Rex.

As for Mr. Bana, Zhang Yi’s judgment was purely based on his appearance. With so little fabric on his numerous maid assistants, combined with his shifty look, he clearly wasn’t a good person.

Nia, judging by their dialogue, seemed to be a slightly headstrong and impatient Catgirl. Considering her age, personality, and appearance time, she certainly felt like a quintessential female protagonist.

But then, considering Pyra, who appeared in the promotional trailer, could this be a game with multiple female leads? Were they all Rex’s “wings”?

Zhang Yi mused, feeling rather pleased.

Of course, setting aside these speculations, there were still some aspects Zhang Yi felt compelled to complain about, particularly the game's mischievous humor. He received 100,000 Yuan from Bana, then, under guidance, spent a few thousand Yuan on equipment, which initially excited him. He realized that compared to the game's prices, 100,000 Yuan was a massive sum in the early game. However, the very next second, Rex sent 90,000 Yuan back to his village, fully demonstrating the game’s mischievousness. If you were going to send it back, why not do it first? What kind of trick was it to let him hold the money and then make him spend it?

While grumbling, Zhang Yi slowly advanced the game's story. He also learned more new things, such as Blade specials and Blade Combos. This content, in the original version, would have been taught much later, in Gormott, as Rex didn't have his own attuned Blade yet at this stage. But considering the subsequent cinematic presentation and player experience, Chen Xu placed it here during the shipwreck, using Nia and Malos’s Blade attacks as demonstrations.

"It feels a bit complicated!" Zhang Yi muttered, smacking his lips, and he felt some content wasn't fully displayed here. For example, he noticed three accumulable energy gauges in the upper left corner, and he still didn't know what they were for. Furthermore, the game had previously mentioned Blade Combos would provide elemental orbs to monsters, but he hadn't seen that either.

However, he didn't have much time to study the combat system he hadn’t fully grasped yet, as his attention was soon captured by the game's story. Well... it wasn't purely the story.

Because, honestly, `Xenoblade Chronicles`, at least the story so far, wasn’t particularly surprising; it was purely in the traditional RPG style. Upon reaching the shipwreck, Rex helped Jin and Malos open a vault containing their target Blade: the Aegis. Coincidentally, the Aegis was a beautiful girl, and Rex was coincidentally stabbed through the back by Jin, and conveniently, the Aegis was willing to share half her life with Rex to become his Blade and asked him to take her to Elysium. Orphaned, with a ship and a house, and now a wife literally dropped from the sky – this was the quintessential protagonist template!

What followed was a cutscene lasting several minutes, a typical progression for a heroic shonen anime. Rex, having successfully attuned with the Blade, wanted to confront Malos and Jin but was utterly defeated. It was then that Nia, who had clearly only recently joined the enemy organization and possessed a kind heart, sided with Rex. Fortunately, Rex's Grandpa Titan arrived just in time to save them. From the exchange between Malos and Pyra, and Jin referring to Rex's Grandpa Titan as Azurda, it was clear that there was an untold backstory. The story itself wasn't particularly stunning, but the excellent production values and exciting BGM still made Zhang Yi feel a surge of enthusiasm, as if he had rediscovered the feeling of playing traditional RPGs in his childhood.

Of course, what excited Zhang Yi even more was having to admit that Mr. Chen truly understood! When Pyra shared half her life with Rex, making him touch her chest core, and later, when Rex accidentally fell into the Land of Oblivion in Gormott after being rescued by Grandpa Azurda and woke from his coma, the game’s presentation shifted to a first-person perspective. At that moment, the player was lying on Pyra's lap, opening their eyes to see her gentle, caring expression – the positive BUFF was absolutely maxed out!

His only complaint again was about Grandpa Azurda’s sacrifice. The sad melody, words of farewell, and Rex’s sorrowful expression made Zhang Yi sigh deeply at the time. But in the next second, the tragic scene immediately turned comical: Grandpa Azurda hadn't died at all; he had simply transformed from an adult Titan into a juvenile Titan, rendering all of Zhang Yi’s emotions wasted!

Next came the uneventful search for Nia. However, here Zhang Yi encountered more of `Xenoblade Chronicles`'s systems. For example, different Blades possessed unique Field Skills. Pyra, for instance, had fire elemental power, and occasionally, a large tree blocking the path required Pyra to use her fire power to burn it down, functioning as a resource allocation and puzzle-solving element. Besides this, the game's maps contained various collectible items, a common feature of traditional RPGs, which Zhang Yi didn't find particularly surprising.

What truly shocked him was when he passed through the Land of Oblivion and reached the Outlook. The game's camera zoomed out to a distant view, revealing the entire landscape of Gormott Province. "Holy crap! This map! Is this a traditional RPG?! Where are the mazes?! Where are the linear maps?! This is an open world, damn it!" Zhang Yi's eyes widened. That moment reminded him of a masterpiece he had once played, `The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild`; the feeling of emerging from a cave and seeing the vast Great Plateau was eerily familiar. But the key was that this was a traditional RPG map! While the previous shipwreck salvage story and the Land of Oblivion also allowed free movement, they were essentially linear paths with few choices, similar to mazes in traditional RPGs. Branching paths only led to collectible treasure chest items. But now?

Zhang Yi opened the in-game map, and he was utterly stunned. If he hadn't known he was playing a traditional RPG, he would have absolutely believed this was an open-world ARPG. Because this map was simply too big! Is this what a traditional RPG map should be like? And according to previously released information, this was just one region.

Controlling Rex and Nia as they walked across the lands of Gormott Province, he saw herds of horses frolicking by the distant water, Armored Bovines grazing on the grasslands, a large colorful bird flying out from a dense ancient forest and soaring across the sky, and packs of wolves sleeping soundly on colossal rocks. Zhang Yi could only describe the entire map's art as stunning. Walking through the green hills and clear waters of Gormott Province, his mood seemed to calm down. Until a level 80+ gorilla appeared before him.
