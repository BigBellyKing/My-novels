Chapter 612: I'm Waiting for the Game to Launch, What Are You Waiting For? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Seeing that less than twenty minutes had passed, Song Ren was utterly speechless.

Why did he ever think Nebula Games had turned over a new leaf?

This was even worse than making grand promises!

Making grand promises was like letting you look and sniff, but now it was different.

This was letting you take a bite; the level of temptation was completely different from before!

Song Ren wasn't the only one; keywords like 'making grand promises' and 'Cliffhanger-Dog' quickly became trending search terms online.

On one hand, Detroit: Become Human could be said to be the first game to utilize the latest technology. Although the game was a demo version, and the content only consisted of simple options and actions like walking, crouching, and picking up items.

It truly brought players a unique experience.

On the other hand, the game's setting itself definitely piqued players' curiosity.

Especially the android Connor, who was at the forefront, his cold and ruthless demeanor inadvertently gained a large following among many players.

Furthermore, the content was incredibly rich. What seemed like merely a prologue scenario turned out to contain a great deal more as players explored it online.

Some endings even required players to investigate certain objects to trigger them.

For example, the option to use a firearm: if players didn't investigate the still-uncollected police officer's body on the scene, they naturally wouldn't notice the pistol hidden under the chair, and thus wouldn't be able to choose the handgun-related endings.

As for the other endings, each had its own unique characteristics.

There was an ending where a perfect negotiation led Daniel to release the hostage voluntarily, only for snipers to gun him down.

Another ending saw Connor sacrifice himself, rushing forward and falling with the other party, but saving the little girl.

There was also an ending where he rushed forward but failed to stop the android.

Of course, besides these, there were also endings where negotiations failed, leading to the hostage's death.

Online players enthusiastically shared the different endings they discovered.

“This demo version has so many branching paths!”

“Exactly! And Connor is just too cool!”

“+1, that emotionless negotiation expert is explosively cool!”

“The game's graphics are also mind-blowing; I can barely tell if it's reality or the game anymore.”

“Yep, the details are insane; so many things are interactive.”

“The only problem is, when the heck is it going to launch? 'Stay Tuned for the Official Version' – but where’s the news about the official version?”

“I want to complain too! I used to think Mr. Chen was force-feeding us grand promises, but now it seems I was too naive!”

Not only players but other game developers also took notice of Detroit: Become Human's content.

Immediately, many game developers were frustrated.

Miscalculation!

When it came to marketing, they still couldn't beat Nebula Games!

What a great selling point!

If they couldn't make the full game, wouldn't it be good to rush out a simple Test DEMO?

The first game in the gaming industry to use brainwave capture technology – what a huge selling point!

A week after Detroit: Become Human's demo version quietly launched, major game developers also successively released preview versions of their new projects.

The game length content generally remained uniformly around 10 minutes.

And each company was quite tacit, explicitly stating that the demo version did not represent the final product.

As for the players, they were all speechless.

“What the heck is this? Chen Xu and Nebula Games have corrupted everyone! What are all these early access versions? They just made an intro and tossed it out?”

“I’m going to throw up! This cake tasting session is utterly insane!”

“Will it ever get better?!”

“But actually, there are a few quite interesting ones.”

“Interesting is interesting, but they’re treating us like fools!”

Initially, with only Detroit: Become Human, players, despite their complaints, were actually quite excited.

Relevant forum communities continuously followed updates and constantly @-mentioned Chen Xu, hoping he would step forward to offer some explanation.

But soon, the trend started to go awry. Various companies successively launched their so-called demo versions, which quickly turned players' anticipation into a degree of annoyance.

Seeing the shift in player sentiment online, various game developers were also depressed.

However, there was still a slight sense of relief.

At least they weren't the only ones being cursed; Nebula Games, being the first, was getting the worst of it.

However, the very next day after this thought appeared in the minds of the major game developers, news that bewildered everyone emerged.

Nebula Games and Chen Xu's official Weibo account once again released an announcement.

Detroit: Become Human's official version will launch in three days. Players can purchase and download it on the Nebula Games Platform.

Official version?

The game is finished?

Not just a selling point?

Innumerable game designers and developers were dumbfounded.

Players were also filled with both surprise and joy.

They were cursing the day before, and the next day Nebula Games directly announced the game was complete?

Under this trend, players' fire instantly shifted to other game developers, though many also expressed anticipation.

Nebula Games had finished; could they expect the same from these other game developers?

The game developers who had released demo versions, looking at their eager fans, were dumbfounded.

Chen Xu, who had just finished posting the launch announcement on Nebula Games' official Weibo, couldn't help but find the online buzz amusing.

He was waiting for Detroit: Become Human's development to conclude and launch. What were these game developers waiting for?

………………

Three days later, Detroit: Become Human officially launched.

Players who had previously played the demo version generally entered the game immediately.

Song Ren was no exception. He didn't even have time to brag to Old Zhang before choosing to enter the game.

These days, his mind was filled with the handsome Connor.

For the first prologue featuring Connor, Song Ren was already well-versed in the story.

He clearly understood what outcomes each option and branch would lead to.

So, he directly chose to skip it. The game could also load progress from the previous demo version.

Accompanying the perspective as it plunged into a brief darkness.

After about three or four seconds, a cacophony of sounds reached Song Ren's ears, gradually becoming clearer.

At the same time, screen colors gradually appeared. However, he couldn't control the character or even shift the camera, and it was a forced first-person view.

He seemed to be in an android specialty store.

Lines of English code he couldn't understand scrolled across his vision. Finally, a staff member dressed as a store clerk, leading a burly man with a fleshy face, came before him.

They provided the corresponding introductions, discussing topics like repairs, fees, and models.

‘AX400, log your name.’

‘Kara’

It wasn't until he got into the middle-aged man's car and drove away that Song Ren regained his senses.

Was this game a multiple protagonists game?

Wasn't he supposed to be playing the handsome young man, Connor? How did he become Kara, a female android who had been in a car accident and sent back for repairs?

Sitting in the car, a bewildered Song Ren still couldn't move freely, but he could control the camera.

He looked out the window, and soon his confusion about the character was temporarily replaced by the scenes outside.
