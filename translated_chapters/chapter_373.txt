Chapter 372: Everyone's a Villain

Not only were players experiencing Red Dead Redemption, but many game designers and media outlets in the industry were also paying attention to this game.

Initially, most people's focus was on the extremely free gameplay of Red Dead Redemption.

However, as the game progressed, the diverse gameplay ceased to be their main focus.

Because as the story deepened in the game, it brought an extraordinary experience.

It was realistic and deeply moving, especially for players who enjoyed Western-themed content, who felt an unparalleled sense of immersion.

………………

In Rhodes Town, there were two rival plantation families, the Braithwaites and the Grays, who had been enemies for generations.

The sheriff, from the Gray family, enlisted Arthur and Dutch to help destroy the Braithwaite family's moonshine distillery.

At that time, although Prohibition had not yet been implemented in the USA, legal alcohol was heavily taxed, so moonshine distilleries flourished.

This period laid a solid foundation for the large-scale moonshine industry during the later Prohibition era, including the famous Grape Bricks.

Furthermore, Rhodes Town's plantation industry, which was originally prosperous, naturally declined with the abolition of slavery, as it required a large labor force. Thus, moonshine became the main source of income for these prominent families, who secretly undermined each other.

Dutch, seeing the local lawmen he worked with as utterly foolish and believing the people in a rural place like Rhodes Town were easy to deceive, set his sights on the two families.

He decided to exploit their animosity, playing both sides to benefit the Van der Linde gang.

So, he began various cunning schemes: helping one family steal the other's horses, then helping the other family burn the first family's fields, all while working for both sides with zero pay and having a grand time.

However, during this time, something else happened: the O'Driscoll gang came knocking.

But surprisingly, the O'Driscoll gang, their sworn enemies, proposed a meeting to negotiate peace.

Arthur thought this was unreliable. After all, they had killed Dutch's former woman, and Dutch had killed their leader's brother. How could there be an opportunity for peace after more than a decade of fighting?

But Micah said there would be no harm in checking it out; if it was a trap, they'd just fight, but if it was real, it would be even better.

Dutch adopted this plan, and the two sides met for negotiations, with Arthur providing sniper cover.

However, it turned out that their target this time was not Dutch, but Arthur.

Because the O'Driscoll gang had already partnered with the Pinkerton Detective Agency, they believed Dutch would bring the gang to rescue Arthur, allowing them to set an ambush beforehand and capture the entire Van der Linde gang.

Ultimately, Arthur escaped alone, taking advantage of their carelessness. By the time he returned to camp, Arthur was half-dead, and his companions quickly scrambled to care for him.

Weeks passed, and Arthur's injuries finally healed, but then things completely spiraled out of control.

The Gray family invited Arthur and the others to town, but then suddenly attacked and opened fire.

Caught off guard, Sean, who was occasionally foul-mouthed but the team's cheerful spirit, was instantly shot in the head.

After a fierce struggle, everyone barely managed to escape from Rhodes Town back to camp, only to receive more bad news.

The Braithwaite family had infiltrated the camp and kidnapped Little Jack.

Sean's death and Little Jack's kidnapping.

At this point, the rage of Arthur, Dutch, and everyone in the Van der Linde gang reached its peak.

Hosea was no exception.

No one was thinking about keeping a low profile anymore.

Dutch, Hosea, Arthur, John Marston, Charles, Bill, Lenny, and Javier.

A total of eight people, they aggressively stormed the Braithwaite family estate. Just looking at their backs, one could feel the ferocity and audacity of the Van der Linde gang in their prime.

This was also the mission that players found most shocking and where they most keenly felt the formidable combat power of the Van der Linde gang.

Transforming into a gang of villains, after a major battle, they captured Catherine Braithwaite and learned that Little Jack had been sent away to a prominent figure named Angelo Bronte in Saint Denis.

So, after setting the house on fire, everyone left, leaving a frantic Catherine watching her century-old mansion engulfed in flames.

But one crisis hadn't passed before another arose. The very next day, as everyone was discussing how to rescue Little Jack, the two Pinkerton Agents who had previously found Arthur also located them. They issued a stern warning, telling them not to run, and that next time they would bring 100 men, before turning and leaving.

For Dutch and the others, it was clear they couldn't stay there any longer.

Under Dutch's leadership, everyone moved to an abandoned mansion in the swamps not far from Saint Denis.

After temporarily settling down, they began to inquire about Angelo Bronte's whereabouts to rescue Little Jack.

And here, players finally stepped into the game's most prosperous and largest city: Saint Denis.

The city's prototype is New Orleans, established by French colonists and later sold to the USA, so the city adopted the French pronunciation, Saint Denis.

The city has many French-style buildings, and Saint Denis's trade and industry are highly developed. It boasts both exquisite streets and abundant goods, as well as dirty, crowded slums and a hazy sky brought by high industrialization.

After wandering around the city, Arthur finally learned Angelo Bronte's location from a street thug that made players grit their teeth in hatred.

Dutch and Arthur took John to Angelo Bronte's home.

But unexpectedly, Little Jack had not suffered any abuse.

He was even being well-fed and cared for.

After helping Angelo Bronte deal with a group of Grave Robbers.

Dutch actually seemed to become good friends with Angelo Bronte.

And after that, Angelo Bronte even invited them to a high-society gathering in Saint Denis.

He also hinted that Dutch should help him eliminate a business rival.

However, Dutch, who fancied himself the Robin Hood of the Wild West, naturally refused to help Angelo Bronte and directly rejected the offer.

So, at the banquet, Angelo Bronte asked Dutch what their true purpose was in coming to Saint Denis.

Upon learning that Dutch and his gang wanted money, he told Dutch that there would be a large sum of money at the train station.

During this period, players would also trigger many important missions.

For example, another date with Mary.

Helping Mary retrieve her mother's belongings, the two had a great time, and Arthur even watched a movie with Mary. In the cinema, Arthur's hand wanted to rest on Mary's shoulder, but he reached out countless times only to pull it back at the last moment.

Finally, as they were leaving, this time Mary didn't hesitate as before but spoke up.

She wanted Arthur to leave with her, to leave the Van der Linde gang and start a new life.

But this was clearly futile, as Arthur still cared about the gang; he couldn't abandon them.

He told Mary that as soon as the gang was settled, he would definitely go find her.

But when would that be?

Also, in the city, Arthur met the Native American Chief Rains Fall and his son Eagle Flies.

Originally, this was just a side quest, another trip to an old acquaintance, Leviticus Cornwall, to
