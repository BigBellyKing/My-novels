Chapter 69: Overcooked? Arguing Kitchen!

At the same time, on Shark TV.

Although it was during the New Year period, there were still many streamers, big and small, live-streaming various games.

In Dong Zhen's live stream, he was showing his audience some legs.

‘Look at this monkey! He wants to look at legs himself, but insists we want to see them!’

‘Bro, is there something about me you're not happy with?’

‘Just this? So-so!’

‘Boss, during this holiday, let's stream a new game! Chen Xu's new title, *Overcooked*, is out, and it seems pretty good.’

‘I saw it too; *Overcooked* really looks quite fun.’

In the live stream, Dong Zhen, who was just admiring some long legs, noticed the bullet comments.

“Oh, isn't it the New Year? Perfect time to show you what you like and foster our emotional warmth. I don't actually like these things much myself!”

“Let me see, a multiplayer co-op game! Perfect, I'll go check what A'Shu is up to and see if he's free.”

Dong Zhen opened the Game Platform, searched for *Overcooked*, glanced at it, and then remembered it was Chen Xu's previous game.

He still had an impression of Chen Xu, the Game Designer.

After all, his experience with *To the Moon* felt incredibly warm, and then *Outlast* scared him half to death; it was quite a twist.

After understanding the game, he also opened another streamer's room in the Shark TV gaming section. After all, many streamers knew each other, and they would often play some multiplayer games together.

Opening the other streamer's live room, a person wearing a baseball cap and black-framed glasses, with a small tuft of beard on his chin and a black shirt, was telling a story.

“Society is good now! Not like before, when school gates were full of these hooligans! What did they do? They'd extort money! They'd adopt you as a little brother, then walk over, pat your head, and say: 'Brothers, lend me some money. If anything happens in school later, just tell your big brother.' 'Got any money? Take it out yourself quickly, because if I have to search you and find a single dime, you'll get a huge slap. Are you taking it out yourself or should I search?'”

“Brother A'Shu, you're so familiar with this, did you often rob others' money when you were a kid?”

“Hehe... hehehehe... I'm telling you, if I often robbed others' money, my performance wouldn't be so vivid. The perspectives of the victim and the perpetrator are always different.”

While A'Shu was recounting his childhood memories, Dong Zhen also sent him a message, and viewers watching both live streams were flooding the bullet comments.

“A rare guest, long time no see! Squad Leader Dong wants to play a game with me? No problem, let's head to the voice channel first.”

With that, the two met in the voice channel.

“How has Squad Leader A'Shu been lately?”

“Very good, very good!”

For the sake of the show's effect, the two exchanged pleasantries.

“Just the two of us playing? I see this game can have up to four players,” A'Shu said.

“It also seems to support 2v2 battles. How about I see if I can call two more people? Liuliu and Zhuangzhuang seem to be playing this game too, should I ask them?” Dong Zhen said.

“Sure, go ahead and ask,” A'Shu replied.

Soon, two more people joined the voice channel.

As the four formed a team, the audiences in their respective live streams were also quite excited, showering the chat with bullet comments.

After all, during regular streams, everyone mostly played their own games, with little interaction like this.

This time, it was precisely during the New Year period, coupled with a game like *Overcooked* that supported multiplayer mode, which led to such a scene.

“Should we jump straight into PVP? We haven't even gotten familiar with it yet,” A'Shu asked.

“No need, we're all new anyway, let's just try it out first,” Dong Zhen suggested.

“How do we divide teams?” Liuliu asked in the voice chat.

“I'll be with Old Man, you and Zhuangzhuang will be a team, how about that?” A'Shu said.

After a brief discussion, they quickly agreed.

When entering Versus Mode for the first time, there were also guiding prompts.

Creating a private room, choosing maps, and setting rules were not difficult at all.

Everyone directly adopted the default mode.

Then they entered the game.

However, to get familiar with the game controls first, the few of them still tried out the tutorial level.

The tutorial levels of *Overcooked* were not complex; they could even be described as simple.

They were all progressive, with players starting from chopping and combining ingredients, then cooking, washing dishes, and experiencing environmental interferences, all separated.

So Dong Zhen and the others had only one feeling.

That it was simple, easy.

But once they truly entered the Versus Mode, the feeling was completely different.

The appearance of various orders, combined with the background music, created an inexplicable sense of tension.

It was as if they were in a noisy restaurant kitchen, with customers queuing outside.

Moreover, unlike the previous tutorial levels, the Versus Mode was a mixed mode.

Frying, cooking, chopping, and washing dishes were all happening at once.

A more crucial point was that the two players were separated.

This meant that, as two independent individuals, they couldn't agree on one task.

Suddenly, they became flustered.

“Zhuangzhuang, hurry and chop the meat! Chop the meat!” Liuliu, playing with a controller, shouted at Zhuangzhuang, who was sitting next to her.

“Sis, stop nagging! You've already thrown the plates flying! Look, you haven't even washed the dishes, what's the use of me chopping meat? And can't you chop meat in there too?” Zhuangzhuang, operating with a keyboard, retorted with a wave of chattering complaints.

“What did you say?” Liuliu, sitting right next to him, glared at Zhuangzhuang with an unfriendly expression.

“Nothing... nothing, Sis, I'm serving, serving the dishes!” Zhuangzhuang, frightened, recoiled his neck, suddenly remembering that even though they were communicating through headphones via the voice channel, his actual sister was right beside him.

Already a bit flustered, and then startled by his own sister, Zhuangzhuang became a little bewildered, taking the dish and heading towards the serving counter.

“Zhuangzhuang, wake up! Wake up! This dish isn't even done yet, how could you serve it? And this isn't our serving counter, it's the opponent's!” Liuliu, watching Zhuangzhuang serve an unfinished dish, was completely dumbfounded.

On the other side, Dong Zhen and A'Shu weren't doing any better.

“Squad Leader Dong, we're selling these dishes, can you stop throwing them on the floor all the time! This isn't an Indian kitchen!”

“Forget the dishes! Squad Leader A'Shu! Hurry up! What the heck, it's on fire, and you're still picking up vegetables there! Quickly, put out the fire!!”

“No! The fire came from next door! And didn't you throw that dish on the floor?”

“Then who told you that you couldn't catch it!”

“Can you blame me! There's a table, but you don't put it there, always throwing it on the floor!”

Just like that, the two started arguing over a small matter.

Arguing while cooking, they became even more flustered.

With various urgent orders, the entire kitchen was in utter chaos.

The bullet comments, watching the chaotic live stream, erupted in laughter.

‘Haha, the Da Zhou siblings have gone from inseparable to the brink of collapse!’

‘Taiyuan Flame Blade and Babao Dong Family Spear, have fallen into a state of rupture!’

‘233333 (lol), this is too amusing.’

‘Is this game really for fostering emotional warmth? I feel like they're about to start fighting!’

‘Isn't it for fostering emotional warmth? Look, Old Man's face is completely red.’

‘This isn't *Overcooked*, this is *Arguing Kitchen*!’
