Chapter 143: It Takes Two (Sixth update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)

After explaining the relevant content of It Takes Two to everyone, they each went back to their respective tasks.

The New Year's holiday was approaching soon, so during this period, Chen Xu primarily focused on explaining the core gameplay ideas of It Takes Two to Qin Yi and the others.

At the same time, he had Ruan Ningxue's Art Team produce the necessary assets.

The actual game development would wait until after the New Year.

Choosing this game was also mainly to give players a change of pace.

After all, Dark Souls had just harvested a massive wave of Resentment Points from players.

Making a relatively wholesome and loving game to let them feel the warmth of the sun was still necessary.

It also happened to enrich the game types available on the Nebula Games Platform.

Furthermore, releasing another couple-focused cooperative game a year after Overcooked would also be quite a topic of discussion.

As she entered work mode, Ruan Ningxue, who was in charge of art, clearly felt the difference in It Takes Two.

“This game feels a bit like an animated movie!” Ruan Ningxue exclaimed, looking at the storyboard drafts in front of her.

“To some extent, that's indeed the case,” Chen Xu said with a smile, nodding.

The previous Overcooked had a cartoon art style, but Overcooked's cartoon art style was different from It Takes Two.

In It Takes Two, the contrast between various scenes, as well as the comparison between characters and themes, could create a style of exaggerated performance.

Including composition and color, it was also primarily focused on a cinematic feel.

This style was more commonly applied in animated movies.

While It Takes Two was under development.

Outside, the impact of the recently concluded Game of the Year event was still fermenting.

Thanks to the influence of this Game of the Year event, sales of many games under Nebula Games saw a significant increase.

Especially Dark Souls, which won Best Role-Playing Game, welcomed another large batch of new Firelinkers.

Of course, after entering the game, these new Firelinkers experienced Chen Xu's omnipresent 'love' and 'enthusiasm' for players in the Souls world.

'Dark Souls', 'Nebula Games', 'Chen Xu' were all keywords during this period.

While these related topics were hotly debated, the annual Spring Festival travel rush also swept across the country.

But for the gaming industry, the Spring Festival travel rush clearly didn't have much impact.

More players, as well as industry designers and media, were eagerly anticipating what Nebula Games' next title would be after the great success of Dark Souls.

………………

On the eighth day of the Lunar New Year, employees successively reported for duty.

Chen Xu also called Qin Yi and the others into the meeting room.

During the New Year period, Chen Xu had already completed the design concept document for It Takes Two.

Compared to his previous life, he had made some modifications to certain aspects of the game's content.

For example, in the original version of It Takes Two, there was also a game easter egg from a game called A Way Out.

This was also the work of that game designer.

Chen Xu did not make any changes regarding this part, as the impact was not significant.

Besides this, there were also numerous movie homage lines.

For example, a line Cody says after being captured by a space ape: 'In space, no one can hear you scream.'

This was a classic line from the movie Alien in his previous life.

And the audio easter egg of this game designer saying “Fuck the Oscars” at TGA.

This part of the content needed to be modified.

There were also some relatively dark scenes in the game.

Although It Takes Two was a game with a cartoon art style.

But just like the original Grimm's Fairy Tales, which were a collection of European folk tales from the 17th and 18th centuries, a period when Europe was under the shadow of wars brought by Napoleon.

Although they were fairy tales, they were written for adults, naturally possessing some dark and profound core themes.

These stories were more like Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio.

They appeared to be fairy tales, but contained numerous metaphors.

The same was true for It Takes Two; although it was cartoon-like, it wasn't meant for children to play.

Especially many scenes within it were quite disturbing.

The vacuum cleaner in the first level, and the pink elephant later on.

In terms of content, there weren't many major issues.

However, the way it was presented in his previous life drew some criticism from many.

So, Chen Xu also made some optimizations in this area, at least in terms of visual presentation, to avoid it being as disturbing as in his previous life.

Art style, cinematic camera features, unique two-player split-screen camera usage, the story's plot and core ideas, level pacing control, the characteristics of different scenes, and the special abilities and gameplay corresponding to each scene.

Chen Xu basically laid out all the core elements of It Takes Two.

Compared to the simple recollection before the New Year, Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, Qin Yi, and the others all understood the game's core.

They also understood why Chen Xu had said earlier that there might not be enough time.

Because although this game sounded like an independent game, its actual content was substantial.

It could even be said that among the games currently developed by Nebula Games, it was second only to Dark Souls in game scale.

Even the previous Outlast was still a bit behind.

After Chen Xu finished explaining, they moved on to the Q&A session.

“Mr. Chen, will the complexity of this game's levels be a bit too high?” Qin Yi asked.

Qin Yi could only describe the levels corresponding to various game themes and the special abilities as stunning.

But there was also one point that made him quite worried, and that was he noticed some levels, especially those involving platforming.

Seemed to require players to have very tacit cooperation.

If the cooperation was good, then naturally it would be fine, but if it wasn't.

For some reason, Overcooked flashed in Qin Yi's mind, with the arguing scenes seen on video and live streaming platforms back then.

How did Breakup Kitchen get its reputation?

It came from exactly this!

“When players face a BOSS battle, as long as one person is alive, the other can revive indefinitely. Moreover, the game saves progress in real-time, so there won't be a situation where you've already passed something but are forced to return due to a single failure.”

“The game's difficulty is actually quite reasonable, and later we will also add a dynamic difficulty setting. If a player gets stuck on a level for a certain amount of time, the game will provide corresponding prompts,” Chen Xu explained, noting that these were some changes he made compared to his previous life.

After hearing Chen Xu's words, Qin Yi also nodded in understanding.

Next, Zhang Yida, who was in charge of game operation and promotion, took over the conversation: “Mr. Chen, regarding the promotion of It Takes Two, what plan will we adopt?”

“We'll follow the same model as Overcooked last year. I'll edit a promotional video for you before Valentine's Day. At that time, the game's slogan will be set as 'Couple's Game', and the promotional direction will be 'passion', 'cooperation', and 'friendship'.”

“As for the game's operation strategy, there's no need for a buy-one-get-one-free deal like last year. As long as a player purchases the game on the Nebula Games Platform, one player who owns the base game can invite another player to play, continuing to promote the platform,” Chen Xu said to Zhang Yida after a moment's thought.
