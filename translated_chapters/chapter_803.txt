Chapter 802: What Was Meant to Come Has Arrived

The launch of *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim* MODs also reignited many players' interest in the game.

Although these MODs didn't change the game's rules or add new story expansions, they gave players a lot of fresh content.

After all, for players, the most direct way a game provides a sense of novelty is through its appearance.

This is why top-tier game developers in the industry have continuously strived for progress in art presentation and the game's visual presentation.

The game's core gameplay, story, and other content require players to delve deeper into the game and play for a period to experience them.

However, when it comes to graphics, players don't need to invest much time. A quick glance is enough to tell if it's good or bad.

The companions and character alterations introduced by *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim* are the most direct points of this.

In addition, the appearance of the Dragonborn Museum in the game could be said to have many players both loving and hating it.

For collecting enthusiasts, this MOD was absolutely exhilarating, making them feel like they could grind for hundreds more hours.

As for some players with obsessive-compulsive disorder, everyone who saw this unique MOD subconsciously clutched their liver, starting to worry about their health.

And for other players, as more and more adventurers explored Skyrim and found the companions hidden by Nebula Games, they began to worry about their kidneys.

During this period, many MOD makers participated in creating MODs for *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim*.

Modifications to combat structure frameworks, brand new large map expansions, epic additional stories... None of these MODs were present!

There were only additional equipment modeling modifications, Office Lady outfits, schoolgirl uniforms, and other rather special attire. But even just this was enough to excite many players.

And it wasn't just players; even some MOD makers who enjoyed *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim* felt like they had received new toys when they saw the related MOD tools.

"Nebula Games really has something! Holy cow, this MOD creation tool is amazing! So many things can be used directly, it's practically idiot-proof!"

"Exactly, it feels similar to a game editor, even more convenient, though it's limited to *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim*."

"After unpacking Nebula Games' art models, modifying some parameters allows direct replacement, which is quite convenient!"

"What truly impresses me is that the game also provides terrain creation and functional modifications! Holy cow, this is awesome! You can even edit quests!"

"Not only that, I've looked into it, and it seems they've also given us physical modification permissions within the game."

"Nebula Games must have spared no expense just for this MOD development tool!"

"It's been optimized specifically for *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim*, and it feels much more interesting!"

"From now on, Lord Harkon and Miraak won't have a say in what clothes they wear!"

"Something's not right with you! Your XP is a bit strange!"

A group of renowned MOD makers in the MOD creation group were all amazed after getting acquainted with the MOD development tools.

For ordinary players, this might seem like a very complex thing.

But for these MOD makers, it was essentially a very interesting DIY toy, and one with high replayability.

………………

While various MODs for *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim* and the updated Tania companion in Nebula World attracted much player attention, *Xenoblade Chronicles'* Torna ~ The Golden Country DLC arrived late. After the development of *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim* was completed, the entire team had enough personnel to return to the development of this story-completing DLC.

For fans of *Xenoblade Chronicles*, the Torna ~ The Golden Country DLC was highly anticipated.

And coincidentally, with the release of *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim*'s MOD tools, many MOD makers also began creating *Xenoblade Chronicles*-related MODs.

Mythra, Pyra, Nia, and various Blade-form equipment were added. Although this anime style seemed a bit out of place with *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim*'s realistic style, for players, that was clearly not an issue.

As newly launched DLC content, Torna ~ The Golden Country unsurprisingly topped the sales charts.

This installment of Torna ~ The Golden Country primarily tells the story of the bond between the hero Addam and Mythra, and Lora and Malos, 500 years ago.

How Lora and Malos met, and how Mythra and Addam met, all these stories were revealed in the DLC.

It also gave players a more complete understanding of Mythra and Pyra's story.

Why Mythra feared her own power, how Malos turned into a villain and wanted to eradicate humanity, including what happened to the Aegis.

The DLC story perfectly concluded *Xenoblade Chronicles*.

And the characters Lora, Malos, and Addam, who appeared in it, also saw a significant boost in popularity.

The main reason for this was immersion.

The entire lives of these characters were unfolded before the players, allowing them to feel everything these characters had experienced.

Just as the *Uncharted* quadrilogy completed Nathan Drake's life, and the *Assassin's Creed* Ezio Trilogy completed Ezio's life.

*Xenoblade Chronicles* also did an excellent job of filling in the experiences of these characters.

Furthermore, compared to its previous life as a side story in a different game, Chen Xu and his team clearly did not use that method to prolong content. Instead, they added more main story cinematics to let players experience Torna's reversal from prosperity to destruction.

The various thrilling plot twists within it also had players cheering for more.

And the spectacular visuals were no less impressive than those in the main game.

Finally, the epic battle between Mythra and Malos, and the mech battle when Siren appeared, thrilled many players. The game also contained numerous easter eggs.

'LOL, so that's where the name Rita Oasis in Gormott came from!'

'Haha, Mythra's cooking skills are actually that bad! It's clear that Pyra's excellent cooking is entirely due to Mythra's resentment!'

'It feels like anyone can mess with Mythra, and Mythra really struggles to communicate with others, so when she first appeared in the main game, she already had LV3 communication skills, which must have been developed here in Torna ~ The Golden Country!'

'Future Sight?! Does that mean Mythra already knew she would meet Rex in the future?'

'So, I feel like Addam is a bit undeserving of the title of hero! He was a bit too weak. If Addam hadn't feared the power of the Aegis in the end, Lora wouldn't have died, Malos wouldn't have become corrupted, and all those subsequent events wouldn't have happened.'

'Damn, Nathan actually broke up with Elena halfway through due to these adventures, which is why Elena was so angry at Nathan for lying in *A Thief's End*!'

'But honestly, Addam's final decision to retreat to the mountains is understandable. Based on the dialogue, Addam had a wife and an unborn child, coupled with his loyalty and love for the country of Torna, in the end, his family was ruined and all his hopes were destroyed.'

The entire Torna ~ The Golden Country DLC for *Xenoblade Chronicles* left players deeply moved, mainly because players who had already played the main game were aware of the subsequent plot and knew it was an unchangeable ending.

Although there were many moments of joy and laughter throughout the game, the overall atmosphere still made many players feel somewhat oppressive.

Especially watching the characters in Torna ~ The Golden Country die one by one, players couldn't help but grumble inwardly, recognizing Mr. Chen's familiar style.

Under the impact of Torna ~ The Golden Country and the rekindled popularity following *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim* MODs, other games launched during this period appeared dim in comparison.

Although the impact wasn't as severe due to different themes, it still caused immense frustration among countless game designers and developers in the industry.

Nebula Games stood like an insurmountable mountain in everyone's hearts, always difficult to overcome.

This was especially true for game companies like Atari and FOW, who had always been dedicated to taking down Nebula Games.

They initially thought *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim*'s popularity was waning.

But with the release of *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim*'s MOD tools, the game's popularity was reignited, and then *Xenoblade Chronicles'* DLC delivered another critical hit.

What was even more critical was the emergence of various MODs, which kept *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim*'s popularity at a very high level.

Even after *Xenoblade Chronicles'* DLC faded in popularity, *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim*'s popularity remained steady, and even felt like it was returning to its peak.

Compared to before, when there were only a few isolated MOD components released by Nebula Games and some equipment appearance modification components,

Now, some special MODs, such as those that add questlines, have also been created by many MOD makers. Although not very large and more akin to short side quests, they still provide new content for many players.

And just like then, some rather indescribable MODs also quietly began to surface.

Inside Nebula Games, Chen Xu gently shook his head and sighed with emotion as he looked at some content on the forums.

In a certain unofficial *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim* player community forum, a post was at the top of the trending list.

This post was published by a well-known MOD development team in the gaming industry.

Members of this renowned MOD development team were present in many relatively open-world games.

The content revealed in this post was also very simple.

They would be developing a MOD called 'LoversLab'.

To date, they stated that they had already developed some content.

According to their description, this MOD would provide players with richer romance options.

In the game, players could fall in love with various NPCs, and once their favorability reached certain conditions, some new gameplay would be triggered.

Seeing this post, Chen Xu was filled with emotion, realizing that what was meant to come had indeed arrived.
