Chapter 317: Nebula Games is Losing a Ton of Money This Time! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

“These points are much harder to earn than before!” Chen Xu leaned back on the sofa in the experience store, sighing with emotion as he looked at the system interface before him.

After the system upgrade, the difficulty of acquiring points had increased significantly. Those prosperous days after developing Minecraft only lasted for a moment.

However, the item skill books obtained from gacha pulls now contained more good things.

Embracing the idea of a fresh start for the New Year, Chen Xu happily spent all the points he had saved up on gacha pulls.

As for the keys he had pulled before the system upgrade, Chen Xu decided to save them for now.

After all, the items in the in-game store were truly a bit too expensive.

【Professional Knowledge: Modern Warfare (Intermediate)】

【Professional Knowledge: Director's Cinematography (Intermediate)】

【Art Knowledge: Battlefield Atmosphere Creation (Beginner)】

…………

A whole bunch of miscellaneous things.

“Is this hinting at something?” Chen Xu smacked his lips, looking at the skill books he had acquired and maxed out one by one.

The commercial success of Rainbow Six Siege had greatly excited NetDragon. However, in Chen Xu's opinion, it was merely commendable.

Because Rainbow Six Siege was clearly a game with more hype than actual players. Simply put, like Dark Souls, many players had heard of it, but not many actually played it.

Just like the Rainbow Six Siege of his previous life, for example, “Today, I, Fuze, will rescue the hostage! Ironclad Baby Room, I live or die together with the Mansion!” The spread of these memes made many players aware of a game called Rainbow Six Siege.

But very few of the players attracted by these memes actually stayed in the game. Ultimately, this was because Rainbow Six Siege, as a tactical game, had too high a barrier to entry.

Of course, compared to previous single-player series that were so obsessed with tactical strategy they were brain-burning, Siege could only be described as having just graduated elementary school. But for most ordinary players, it was still too hardcore.

Whether a game can become a mainstream game ultimately depends on its learning curve. For example, Warcraft, although its RTS gameplay deterred many, its rich single-player story and interesting RPG map gameplay were entirely sufficient to support it becoming a mainstream game.

For the company plan next year, Chen Xu intended to focus on VR. After all, on the PC platform, Nebula Games was basically stable, but on the VR platform, only Minecraft had significant influence so far, and that game was a bit special.

As for Rainbow Six Siege, it was a product of Nebula Games' cooperation with NetDragon. For Chen Xu, the next game would be Nebula Games' stepping stone into the VR space. Moreover, for the team, after the development of Rainbow Six Siege, they had already accumulated some technical expertise. If all else failed, they could always talk to NetDragon and see if they could lend a development team as contract manufacturing for Nebula Games.

While Chen Xu was pondering, Zhang Yida also reported the New Year's event content to Chen Xu. After confirming there were no issues, it was finalized immediately. Soon, these event contents were also published online.

This time, the Nebula Games Platform event also got many players excited. There wasn't much to say about online games. The main focus was still the continuously operating Sanguosha. Inevitably, some overpowered generals had appeared in its operations, but the operations team was following up on player feedback in real-time to minimize negative impact. At the same time, during the operation, the team also developed some new gameplay, such as Sanguosha's PVE mode and corresponding Nian Beast events.

There were both positive and negative reviews. As for Sanguosha's events, they were quite simple: New Year-themed general skins, and a permanent skin given to players as a New Year gift.

For Rainbow Six Siege, it was also relatively straightforward. A new version update was released, introducing Ranked Mode, Recruit Mode, and so on. At the same time, the Homepage Spectator System was updated, allowing players to watch high-tier matches. Then there were some new gift packs, like 50% off boxes! No flashy and gaudy stuff, just simple and crude.

In addition, the defenders and attackers each received two brand new Operators.

Games without in-app purchase content, such as Dark Souls and It Takes Two, also made some changes for the New Year event. Among them, the multiplayer-oriented Warcraft launched two new Ranked Competitive Maps, one two-player map and one four-player map.

Both maps had a special feature: the large monster in the middle of the map was replaced by a special monster: the Nian Beast. Of course, after the Spring Festival, it would revert to its original form.

In Minecraft, there would be an official New Year's Celebration Video event, adding many New Year-related content, such as dumplings, New Year cakes, qipaos, fireworks, and so on. This also applied to It Takes Two, Overcooked, and Fall Guys, where all levels would also gain some New Year attributes.

Monster Hunter: World was no different, adding a new hunting target, the Nian Beast. And for the first hunt, it would definitely drop a decoration of the player's choice. This was meant to be a small comfort for players who had been grinding for almost a year and still hadn't gotten many decorations.

As for Dark Souls, it also added a new monster to Death Mode: the Nian Beast. Of course, to give Dark Souls players an authentic experience, the Nian Beast's strength might be just a little bit high. But it wasn't a big problem, after all, after so long, which of the players still playing Dark Souls wasn't a battle-hardened masochist? Perhaps they would even be more excited.

These contents were only for specific players of each game. But for all players on the Nebula Games Platform, there was also a major event.

That was, 90% of the games on the Nebula Games Platform would participate in a discount sale. Of course, Rainbow Six Siege, which had just been released, was not included. On one hand, it had just launched, and on the other hand, NetDragon on the PC platform had not yet ported it.

As for how much discount the game developers participating in the New Year's Big Sale would offer, that was up to the developers themselves. 10% off, or even 90% off, depended on the developer's willingness. If you found it troublesome or had decision paralysis, that was fine too; you could choose to authorize Nebula Games, and they would formulate the discount based on relevant backend data and player reputation.

In addition, there was a new discount purchase event: Matryoshka Coupons. Every player on the Nebula Games Platform would receive a 10 Yuan and a 30 Yuan discount coupon, which could be used when purchasing designated games. The 10 Yuan coupon could be used when purchasing games over 60 Yuan, and the 30 Yuan coupon could be used when purchasing games over 150 Yuan, and both coupons could be stacked. After using them for a purchase, another coupon would be immediately refunded.

Of course, game developers had already been notified about this event, and most expressed their willingness to participate in such a discount activity. For no other reason than that Nebula Games would specifically promote it if they participated. And if everyone else offered discounts, wouldn't not participating mean losing a ton of money?

Upon hearing this, countless players instantly couldn't resist. The Spring Festival hadn't even arrived yet, but players online were already discussing it.

“Oh my god, so many games all on discount? But the question is, why are Outlast and Dark Souls getting the biggest discounts???”

“These coupons aren't a bug, are they? You buy something and get another one?”

“No, it's just a Nebula Games event!”

“Holy cow, they're going to lose a ton of money!!”

“It's not just Nebula Games' games, but also many games from third-party developers, including some classic games from NetDragon, are also on discount!?”

“Even though I've played them all, at this price! I can't resist!”

Players have a very strange psychology: I can buy this game and not play it, but I can't not have it!

Such high discounts undoubtedly gave countless players a reason to add one more to their collection. And players were buying them while expressing immense emotion.

Nebula Games and these game developers are truly conscientious! This wave is going to make them lose a ton of money!
