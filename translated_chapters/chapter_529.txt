Chapter 528: Geralt, Is This Your True Nature!? (Requesting Subscriptions)

It wasn't just Song Ren alone; many other players, after entering the game, were captivated by various elements.

After all, "The Witcher: Wild Hunt" itself has a slower narrative pace, much like "Red Dead Redemption." However, there's a slight difference: while "The Witcher: Wild Hunt" is also an open-world game, it is fundamentally built upon an RPG framework. Quests, map exploration, and the main story are still unavoidable.

In the early game, players could theoretically travel to Novigrad and the Skellige Isles, but the limitations of the character's level restricted some exploration content. Yet, beyond specific mini-games like Gwent, what truly impressed players was the game's world-building.

From the interconnected quests in White Orchard, players could gain a basic understanding of the political landscape. This was clearly what Chen Xu aimed to achieve: to depict a truly chaotic era. It was a time of frequent wars, with the Northern Kingdoms and the Southern Empire vying for supreme dominance.

Amidst such a societal backdrop, the game chose to cast players as Geralt, and the main quest didn't directly involve political changes but rather focused on the search for his beloved adopted daughter. However, it was precisely this indirect, neutral perspective that allowed players to experience a greater sense of realism in "The Witcher: Wild Hunt's" world depiction.

The journey from the opening to Velen didn't feature exaggerated grand scenes or thrilling, blockbuster-like sequences. Apart from the griffin battle, it was remarkably calm. Yet, it surprisingly conveyed a sense of realism, which permeated every detail of the game environment, every side quest, and every line of character dialogue, making players feel that this world was brimming with life.

………………

As Song Ren completed some side quests in Velen, he began to delve into the game's main story and experience its charm. The White Wolf, following his previous plan, headed to a village in Velen to meet an imperial spy and inquire about Ciri.

But when Geralt arrived, he found he was one step too late; the imperial spy had been tortured to death by the Wild Hunt. However, in an account book found in the cellar, Geralt discovered the spy's hidden ledger, which contained clues about Ciri. The clues pointed to two individuals: a witch in a small local village and the leader of Temerian deserters, who had established himself as a warlord in Velen, known by the locals as the 'Bloody Baron'.

Song Ren first went to the witch. Upon arrival, he discovered that this witch wasn't a mere village witch but an old acquaintance he knew: Keira, a member of the Lodge of Sorceresses. From Keira, Song Ren also gained a deeper understanding of the game's background story.

Under the rule of Emperor Emhyr, the Southern Empire of Nilfgaard launched a massive invasion. The only one of the Northern Kingdoms capable of resisting the empire was Redania, ruled by Radovid. When Nilfgaard attacked Temeria, Redania launched a blitzkrieg, annexing its neighboring countries and collaborating with the Church of the Eternal Fire. They reorganized the church's armed forces, the 'Witch Hunters', frantically persecuting sorcerers and non-human races to confiscate their property, funding their exorbitant military expenses, and holding off Nilfgaard's advance.

Keira, as a sorceress, had come to this rural area of Velen to live in seclusion, avoiding persecution by the Witch Hunters of the Church of the Eternal Fire. She disguised herself as a witch, using her magical powers to make a temporary living. However, since they were old acquaintances, communication was much easier. Keira didn't hide anything from Geralt's inquiries, frankly telling the White Wolf what she knew: indeed, a strange person had contacted her, but it wasn't Ciri, but an elven sorcerer wearing a mask.

Next, she led Geralt to the underground ruins where the elven sorcerer was hiding. There, they ran straight into the Wild Hunt, and a fierce battle ensued. Despite playing on normal difficulty, Song Ren still felt the pressure. He had always relied on the Gourmand skill for health regeneration, but against the Wild Hunt soldiers, his health bar seemed to struggle to recover.

"The Wild Hunt is so fierce! These are just regular soldiers, how powerful must the final Wild Hunt boss be!?" Song Ren exclaimed, thinking of the Lich King-like Wild Hunt leader from Geralt's opening dream.

After a great battle, they discovered that the elven sorcerer was long gone, leaving only a holographic message, seemingly a warning for Ciri, telling her not to trust the witches in the Crooked Back Bog. Thus, Keira's lead ended. However, Song Ren also received a side quest from the sorceress to lift the curse on the Tower of Mice in the middle of the lake.

This side quest also deeply moved Song Ren. The side story wasn't very long, but it presented a blend of darkness and beauty. The original lord of Velen, to resist the Nilfgaardian invasion, abandoned Crow's Perch and moved to an island in the middle of a lake. There, he made an agreement with a mage to research a plague virus. However, the lord's daughter, Anabelle, fell in love with a peddler named Graham, who often delivered fish to the island. Later, a group of bandits persuaded Graham to bring them to the island. These bandits then massacred everyone on the island, inadvertently spreading the plague.

Anabelle, at the time, drank a potion from the mage, putting herself into a state of suspended animation. But when she awoke, the plague virus had killed everyone, leaving only countless rats. In her relief, she was then bitten to death by the rats. Although she was still alive, her beloved Graham was nowhere to be found, and her powerful resentment transformed her into a Plague Maiden. The solution to her curse was simple: find Graham, the source.

After Geralt explained the situation, Graham chose to go with Geralt to the Tower of Mice. When Anabelle asked if he still loved her and would kiss her, Graham didn't hesitate for a moment.

"Holy cow! This... this actually happened!?" Song Ren was utterly shocked, yet also filled with emotion, watching Graham in the game kiss the long-tongued skull, the Plague Maiden no less terrifying than the Brain Suckers from Bloodborne, sacrificing his life to lift the curse.

But what surprised him even more was Keira's subsequent storyline. After helping Keira lift the curse from the Tower of Mice, Keira pestered Geralt to help her collect various odd items. After completing the tasks, Keira invited Geralt to a unique candlelight wine dinner in the woods late at night.

Of course, dinner wasn't the main point; the real focus was the after-dinner activities.

'Romance? I thought it was just a friendly gathering,' Geralt said, shaking his head slightly at Keira.

'Friends... but with a little extra, how about it?' Keira said meaningfully.

At the same time, a UI interface with choices appeared before Song Ren:

[Don't ask me twice]

[Not interested]

[Sorry, I'm with someone else]

Could it be! Could it be!

As an experienced gamer, Song Ren understood instantly. But he still struggled to choose the third option.

"Don't be like that, Geralt is a good man, I already have Yennefer," Song Ren muttered.

'So what? Geralt, Geralt, you're too old-fashioned, aren't you? Or at least lie with me and watch the stars?' Keira smiled sweetly.

'Hmm... that wouldn't hurt,' Geralt showed a faint smile.

'Really? Then close your eyes and count to ten...' Keira chuckled, put down her wine glass, and Geralt did as he was told.

After ten counts, Keira was no longer in Song Ren's sight. Following the system's prompt, Song Ren activated his Witcher senses and followed the footprints on the ground for a while. Then, what did he see?

'A skirt? Looks like we're playing big bad wolf and Little Red Riding Hood, not hide-and-seek.'

'A bra? Oh good, no need to unbutton.'

'Shoes? Oh dear, too bad, I should have asked her to leave her shoes behind.'

Controlling Geralt as he moved forward, Song Ren looked at the clues on the ground and listened to Geralt's dialogue, completely dumbfounded. What was going on!? What terrible lines were these!

Geralt, how did you change like this!? Is this your true nature!?"

Soon, Geralt found Keira by the lake.

'现在的我身上什么也没有，不过我一定会给你奖品的。'

'I have nothing on now, but I'll definitely give you a prize.'

As Keira spoke, Geralt in the game slowly walked forward.

"Holy cow! This... this storyline actually exists!?"

"Geralt! You're a Witcher, not a sorceress hunter!"

Song Ren's eyes widened. Although it was just a montage of quick cuts, it was enough to astonish him. He finally understood why this game required real-name authentication!
