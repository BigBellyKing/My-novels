Chapter 555: Resident Evil? Kidney Crisis! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

After the Nebula Games Carnival concluded, “Resident Evil Village: Blood and Wine,” “Super Mario Maker,” and the entire Nebula Theme Park all flooded social media.

Regarding the Nebula Theme Park, it is essentially set to open within the year.

As for players, their focus was clearly more on “Resident Evil Village,” “Blood and Wine,” and “Super Mario Maker”—these three main elements.

However, what frustrated many players was that, just like previous Nebula Games direct presentations, Chen Xu did not provide precise information, only a vague announcement that the games would launch within the year.

This approach not only caused a bit of 'pained expressions' among players but also left many game designers in the industry feeling a little 'confused.'

The DLCs named 'Blood and Wine' and 'Hearts of Stone,' although merely additional paid content, were based on “The Witcher: Wild Hunt.”

Secondly, even though “Resident Evil Village” is a horror game, its predecessor performed exceptionally well, and from Chen Xu's introduction at the direct presentation, it seemed he intended to introduce some new tricks and innovations in this installment.

Considering Chen Xu's past track record, it's safe to say no one wanted to clash with these two titles.

This was especially true for some game developers on the Huanyu VR Platform; after all, the Zeus segment, even if affected, still had a certain user base, primarily competing for third-party neutral players.

Conversely, game developers preparing for recent launches all began their promotions, vying with “Super Mario Maker,” creating a sudden feeling of games 'erupting.'

After all, this was a Switch platform game, so it wouldn't cause too much impact.

However, in the prelude to the launch of “Super Mario Maker,” something caught many players completely off guard: Chen Xu's official Weibo account actually released some data about “Resident Evil Village,” or rather, a short video.

The official Weibo content was very simple: 'BOSS, Countess: Alcina Dimitrescu.'

The short video was only five seconds long.

Clicking on it, one saw a scene set in what appeared to be a castle hall. Standing before them was a mature and voluptuous woman with a full and tall figure. Her face was incredibly pale, her hair black, her lips painted red, and she wore a white gown and a wide-brimmed black hat. As if noticing something, the noblewoman slowly turned, revealing not a grotesque face, but rather a smile that made one's heart flutter.

What the heck!?

Innumerable players who saw Chen Xu's and Nebula Games' official Weibo post were completely bewildered!

Where was the promised horror game?

What was the deal with this noblewoman BOSS?

She was truly too big!

Many players were stunned on the spot.

“Holy cow! This... this... this!”

“Isn't this the ‘Resident Evil’ I know? Where are the Fungal Beasts and all the disgusting monsters? Why is there such a huge noblewoman here! Mr. Chen, well done!”

“Kid driving a big car? Who can resist that?!”

“Is this the content we wanted? Yes! This is the content we wanted!”

Watching the Countess video released by Nebula Games' official platform, many players eagerly left comments in the official Weibo's comment section.

This wasn't “Resident Evil” at all! It felt more like they'd entered some 3D Zone! This had directly become a Kidney Crisis!

With the release of the Countess BOSS video, in just one day, major video websites were flooded with this short five-second clip. There's no telling how many Lewd Persons gathered here.

Many players who had never intended to buy “Resident Evil Village,” whose bottom line they thought was as solid as rock, suddenly felt a slight loosening.

This... seemed a little tempting!

Its explosive momentum even overshadowed the soon-to-be-launched “Super Mario Maker.”

Not only that, many fan-made secondary creations appeared on the same day.

Of course, the impact on the gaming industry didn't stop there.

On the second day after “Resident Evil Village” released this promotional video, another game developer's video climbed to the trending searches.

However, this time it wasn't Nebula Games, nor was it their old rivals FOW under Zeus, or Atari.

It was NetDragon Games, which had been cooperating very well with Nebula Games in recent years.

While “Dance Dance Revolution” on Switch sold very well, NetDragon wasn't entirely focused on it. In fact, NetDragon had quietly been developing a sci-fi FPS masterpiece.

Their original plan was to launch before the New Year, but the sudden arrival of “Resident Evil Village” and “The Witcher: Wild Hunt” DLC disrupted their plans.

A delay was inevitable.

But NetDragon was conflicted.

Because at the same time, some domestic and international game developers who chose to delay were scolded fiercely by players.

And now, they found a way.

It was still a delay, but others had a yellow background with black text, appearing cold and ruthless.

But how should they announce their delay?

Same yellow background with black text, but with a new twist!

Under melancholic background music, a pitiful blonde loli held up a 'sorry' sign, cautiously peeking at the players in front of the computer screen. The 'sorry' on the sign couldn't be a mechanical font; it had to look handwritten, with a crying emoji added for good measure.

Plan complete!

Just after Nebula Games released a horror game BOSS trailer for the Countess, NetDragon Games followed right behind with a big spectacle for their delay apology.

It immediately made countless players shout 'despicable.'

What was NetDragon Games doing? They were exploiting human concern for young creatures to achieve their ulterior motives!

But, for the sake of the blonde loli, we'll forgive you this time!

This move instantly left other game developers bewildered.

What kind of people are these!?

Everyone apologizes, why are you showing off so many tricks! 

Chen Xu, seeing NetDragon Games' move from within Nebula Games, couldn't help but sigh with emotion.

“NetDragon has finally learned to do it!”

It had to be said, other companies' delay announcements were cold notifications, no matter how sincere, they still seemed a bit heartless.

But this time, NetDragon Games' delay was a textbook example!

Of course, this delay tactic could only be used once. If used repeatedly, it would erode players' patience.

Hearing Chen Xu's words, Qin Yi and Meng Zuo beside him remained silent.

When it came to 'shenanigans,' Mr. Chen, you're no slouch either!

Remembering the special promotional theme song they were currently tailoring for “Resident Evil Village,” Qin Yi and Meng Zuo's mouths twitched.
