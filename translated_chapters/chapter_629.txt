Chapter 628: Players in Heated Discussion (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Compared to the first CG animation released previously,

The second official CG animation sparked an even greater discussion among players.

On one hand, due to the previous promotional warm-up, players' expectations for World of Warcraft were skyrocketing.

On the other hand, this CG animation finally featured characters familiar to them from Warcraft.

That was Arthas.

Although the story of Warcraft does not have a fixed protagonist.

It is told from the perspectives of various factions such as Humans, Night Elves, Undead, and Orcs.

But the characters with names and surnames left a deep impression on players, especially Arthas.

His storyline was quite extensive, and the topic was controversial enough.

After all, what was Arthas before his fall?

A tall, rich, and handsome prince, who became a Paladin of the Knights of the Silver Hand at a young age, and had a wealthy and beautiful lover.

However, Arthas later became a Death Knight, influenced by the Lich King's will within Frostmourne, leading him to commit patricide.

This transformation from good to evil, coupled with extensive plot development, means that when Warcraft is mentioned, the first character most players think of is Arthas.

This beautifully crafted CG animation once again evoked players' past memories of Arthas.

Another point is that this officially confirmed that Arthas is definitely an antagonist.

The old king's hopes for Arthas all turned into their opposite.

The old king hoped Arthas could become the embodiment of justice.

But Arthas became the Lich King.

He hoped Arthas would use his power cautiously, and that true victory was inspiring the people's fighting spirit.

But Arthas used the power of Frostmourne to turn his subjects into Undead.

These highly controversial and profound points led some players who played Warcraft back then to discuss its content once more.

“As expected! That idiot Arthas finally became the true big villain, the Wumiao King!”

“What the heck is Wumiao King? It’s Lich King, not Wumiao King! Don’t just casually give that idiot random names!”

“You guys upstairs, enough already!”

“Actually, if you think about it, Arthas was quite tragic. When he needed support the most, Uther went directly to tattle to his elders, and Jaina said she couldn’t watch Arthas do that, then just ditched.”

“True, if Uther and Jaina had stood by Arthas back then, who would have become the Lich King in the end? Is Yili Dan a possibility?”

“Stop bragging, all of you. I’m more curious if we’ll be able to grind Arthas and get his Frostmourne to drop.”

“+1, and Illidan’s Warglaives of Azzinoth!”

“Speaking of Frostmourne, I wonder if there’s a Fire’s Joy?”

“What the hell is Fire’s Joy? Even if there was a fire-attributed weapon corresponding to Frostmourne, it wouldn’t be called Fire’s Joy!”

“Just let me say it, why so serious-minded! And doesn’t Fire’s Joy roll off the tongue quite nicely?”

With the release of this second promotional CG animation, players' enthusiasm was once again pushed to a peak.

At the same time, it made some contemporary game developers hesitant because they couldn't pinpoint when this game would actually be released.

If it was just initially approved, that would be fine.

After all, no actual in-game footage has been released yet.

Considering the setting of Nebula World and the map of Azeroth.

Everyone understood just how massive World of Warcraft would be.

But the key was that these elements indicated Chen Xu had planned ahead.

No one wanted to clash with this behemoth of a game.

Amidst the players' excited anticipation, as time slowly progressed, some game developers also tentatively released their new titles.

For example, FOW's Wasteland 1981, after adding new brainwave capture technology updates, was pushed to the market and once again achieved decent sales, though its reputation was slightly lower by 0.2 points compared to the first generation.

In addition, other game developers also successively launched new titles.

And during this period, what Chen Xu and Nebula Games did.

Was to release CG animations.

“I have been imprisoned for ten thousand years, and cast out from my own homeland.”

“Now you dare to invade my territory… You are not prepared!”

One by one, the CG animations were released like a serialized anime series.

Especially after Arthas, the appearance of Illidan once again pushed the popularity of World of Warcraft to a new height.

For most players, Illidan's popularity could arguably compete favorably with Arthas.

This could be seen from the starting heroes in Warcraft back then.

For players who hadn't delved into RTS gameplay and only played the story.

Undead and Night Elves always started with DK and DH, which are Death Knight and Demon Hunter, respectively.

Of course, like Arthas, Illidan in World of Warcraft would not be a BOSS that players could defeat right from the start.

After all, there are only so many named BOSSes; they couldn't all be released to players at once.

At the same time, in terms of story, it can be said that the early versions of World of Warcraft were completely different from the later versions.

The early Warcraft story indeed had some awkward parts, but the overall direction was self-consistent. However, when Blizzard embraced mediocrity, people realized what having no bottom line meant.

Whether a character was whitewashed or not wasn't the key; the critical point was how the blackening and whitewashing plots were handled. If a character who turned evil for an ideal could be swayed by a few empty flatteries, then what was the point of their blackening?

Furthermore, compared to early versions where Onyxia, the Black Dragon Princess, secretly infiltrated for decades, undermined Varian, and indirectly created the Brotherhood through her connections with Blackrock Mountain, only to be exposed by the Marshal due to a tiny oversight. Her true form revealed.

In later stages, Sylvanas Windrunner's various methods completely lacked a queenly demeanor. Moreover, from her distinct personality in early versions to her split personality later on, she seemed to be on a rollercoaster ride and almost went to borrow a golf club from her psychotic neighbor.

In stark contrast, Kerrigan's setting in StarCraft, where she killed countless people but was a savior, seemed completely acceptable.

Of course, Warcraft didn't continuously regress entirely. If there's one thing that became increasingly outstanding and prominent.

Look, aren't the game's CG animations quite well made?

As for the subsequent story, for Chen Xu now, there's no need to rush. After all, as an MMORPG.

Version updates and iterations allow sufficient time for refinement.
