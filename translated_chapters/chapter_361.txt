Chapter 360: Environmental Theme 'Farm Life' (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Following a Weibo post from Chen Xu, players instantly erupted.

Because the meaning contained in this official Weibo post was simply too clear.

There was almost no need to even think about it.

This was Nebula Games' new game announcement.

Of course, this wasn't what excited players the most.

What excited them the most was the protagonist in this official Weibo post: Arthur Morgan.

If it were just based on the name and introduction, there wouldn't be much to discern.

Arthur Morgan — the character's name.

Third-in-command of the Van der Linde gang — the character's identity.

The key was the character's appearance, and the final description: one of the strongest gunfighters in the West!

Coupled with the cowboy attire and revolver.

This instantly made many players realize that Nebula Games was planning something big this time!

'Shocked, shocked! Is Nebula Games also going to make a Western cowboy-themed game?'

'They're going head-to-head with Atrai!'

'Haha, didn't that Antorini subtly praise and criticize Call of Duty: Modern Warfare before? Now Chen Xu is directly saying, 'Let's have a real fight with real swords and guns.'

'Interesting. Let's wait for more news. Anyway, we probably won't be able to play it anytime soon.'

As Chen Xu's official Weibo post went out, players' enthusiasm was instantly ignited.

Especially since Atrai had been warming up the Western theme during this period.

Various sequels, various hypes, all making players very interested in the Western theme.

However, the Western genre itself, not just in the gaming industry but also in the film and television industry, is a relatively niche category.

So, there were basically not many excellent ones to satisfy players' cravings.

At this moment, Chen Xu also got involved, and coupled with the ongoing popularity of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, it instantly pushed all players' expectations to the highest level.

In just one day, Chen Xu merely posted an official Weibo with only one picture, yet it attracted the attention of countless players.

Regarding this, everyone at Atrai, including Antorini, felt completely unwell.

Is there no justice left? Is there no law? How can a game company do this?

Whether it was the topic of Western themes, the popularity, or the projects, they were all hyped up by them first.

If you wanted to make a Western-themed game, you should have spoken up from the beginning!

Don't hide it!

Now, Atrai has hyped up the niche Western genre with all sorts of promotions, and then Nebula Games comes to reap the benefits?

It's infuriating!

But despite the anger, Atrai was helpless. After all, they couldn't just make a Western-themed game and forbid others from doing so, could they?

“I'd like to see what kind of Western-themed game you can create!” Antorini also took a deep breath.

However, he still couldn't quite let go of his previous idea.

But clearly, Atrai wouldn't let him mess around.

After all, the entire project had already been decided as a novel IP adaptation.

Although he had some regrets about this, they weren't too significant, as it was just an idea of his.

Moreover, he wouldn't be too arrogant; after all, Chen Xu was also a top designer in the industry, especially having just developed Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.

So he still took it quite seriously. The next step would mainly depend on the development progress.

Meanwhile, Atrai remained silent.

Mainly, it was still early in the game project's development, and this was just a pre-release warm-up.

But the crucial point was that Nebula Games had also suddenly entered the Western genre.

Their warm-up was essentially also warming up Nebula Games' Western-themed game.

So Atrai chose to bide its time, waiting until the game's development reached a certain stage before proceeding.

………………

While various discussions were happening in the industry, Chen Xu within Nebula Games wasn't significantly affected.

As for the development of Red Dead Redemption, including its promotion, Chen Xu had already made preparations.

The 'Beautiful World' and Red Dead Redemption, both in development, had uncharacteristically entered a period of silence.

However, this period of opportunity was soon broken by Chen Xu, and at the same time, external players and industry designers learned the name of Nebula Games' Western game.

On that day, Nebula Games officially announced that it would launch an environmental theme for Red Dead Redemption for users of the Nebula Games Platform.

This news immediately stunned many people.

On PC and mobile platforms, themes are essentially wallpapers, but advanced ones are dynamic, and some are even real-time dynamic.

For example, mouse clicks or finger touches would trigger corresponding special effects.

Naturally, VR platforms also have themes, and some advanced themes on VR platforms are almost equivalent to an independent scene.

Some can even offer simple mini-games.

There are even developers specializing in creating these themes, selling them as games.

Maintaining high-quality visual content throughout a blockbuster game is difficult for most game developers to afford.

However, creating a simple small scene with high-quality content is not that difficult.

And this market segment is not small; for example, a theme software from his previous life, Wallpaper Engine, had global sales of tens of millions, as everyone appreciates beauty.

Similarly, on VR platforms, for many players who can afford VR equipment, if they encounter a favorite theme scene, they simply buy it.

At the same time, some VR games also leverage this, for example, offering limited themes as a bonus for pre-orders or deluxe edition purchases.

For game developers, it's made from game scraps anyway, so it doesn't cost much.

Of course, most of these themes still lag in quality compared to dedicated themes.

But Nebula Games hadn't even released the game, and they were directly giving away themes?

Many players were also bewildered.

However, despite the bewilderment, players still chose to download it.

After all, as long as they had made a purchase on Nebula Games, they could directly claim this theme into their inventory.

Many players met this qualification, and in such a situation, it was a no-brainer to take it.

Moreover, many players also wanted to see what kind of game Red Dead Redemption actually was.

After all, besides knowing it was a Western theme and a character named Arthur Morgan, there was absolutely no other information.

Atrai, at least, had an adapted original work to refer to.

Zhang Yi, who had just finished playing 'Warzone' and was analyzing why he had become a '4500 Yuan' player, immediately saw this message pushed by the Nebula Games Platform.

“Old Song, stop talking. Look at the announcement on the Nebula Games Platform. What kind of move is this? Giving away an environmental theme before the game is even out?” Like most players, Zhang Yi was very surprised.

“Idiots are still making a fuss, while smart people have already quietly downloaded it.” Song Ren's voice came through the voice channel.

“You damn it!” Zhang Yi cursed, and at the same time, quickly clicked download.

Soon, the theme named 'Farm Life' was downloaded. After all, it was just an environmental theme.

However, after clicking to enter, the first prompt that appeared made Zhang Yi slightly stunned.
