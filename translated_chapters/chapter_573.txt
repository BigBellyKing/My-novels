"Hand Sanitizer Warrior, truly lives up to its reputation!" Song Ren exclaimed with emotion.

The scene just now was indeed a bit comical.

After his exclamations, Song Ren refocused his attention on the game.

He had now temporarily escaped Lady Dimitrescu's pursuit, but he still needed to find the faces of four statues to open the door to the castle's main hall.

This was clearly a classic puzzle segment in the game.

During this time, Lady Dimitrescu would randomly appear in various parts of the castle, but her speed was very slow. Initially, she did give him a slight sense of oppression.

However, after familiarizing himself with it a bit, Song Ren felt no pressure at all. Plus, there was a very safe spot: the Duke's small room, where he could save his game and buy items, and enemies wouldn't follow him in.

He even took the opportunity to tease Lady Dimitrescu.

For example, he'd pull out the in-game knife, sneak up behind Lady Dimitrescu, and slash her with it.

Since Lady Dimitrescu in the game was exceptionally tall, Ethan's height only reached her waist, and thus, something entertaining occurred.

The spot where Ethan's knife swung and attacked was quite ingenious, a place that couldn't be explicitly written about.

"Damn it! Duke, quickly get another box of hand sanitizer; I could play here for a year!"

In the main hall, Song Ren engaged Lady Dimitrescu in a game of kiting around pillars, stealthily slashing her a couple of times with the knife.

If he got hit, he'd just have Ethan wash his hands.

It was a shame the game didn't have a Clothing damage system, otherwise, this game would be an instant classic!

After using up all his hand sanitizer and finally dying tragically to Lady Dimitrescu's sharp claws, Song Ren let out a heartfelt exclamation.

Reloading his save, Song Ren once again began advancing through the game's content.

During this time, in a small room, he used a switch to bring in cold air, taking down another one of Lady Dimitrescu's daughters.

After finding all four statues and opening the door to the castle's main hall, Ethan found a dagger inside a coffin.

From the notes found earlier in the castle, he knew this dagger could inflict effective damage on Lady Dimitrescu.

Before Ethan, there had been an assassin who tried to use this dagger to assassinate Lady Dimitrescu, but he had clearly failed.

As Ethan picked up the dagger, Lady Dimitrescu finally caught up to him, grabbing him. Ethan seized the opportunity and plunged the dagger directly into Lady Dimitrescu's waist.

As the ancient dagger with its special effects pierced Lady Dimitrescu's body, the formerly elegant noblewoman suddenly mutated, transforming into a giant, rotting, dragon-like monster.

It possessed wyvern wings and sharp claws, but its head was a rotting maw like a pitcher plant, and faintly visible on its back was Lady Dimitrescu's human form, surrounded by countless flies.

Ethan immediately engaged in battle with the mutated Lady Dimitrescu on the tower's summit.

Shotguns, pistols, and the newly acquired sniper rifle—this battle was absolutely thrilling for Song Ren.

Lady Dimitrescu, transformed into a rotting dragon, constantly attacked Ethan, circling the tall tower. Bricks and tiles crumbled under her powerful assaults, making it incredibly intense.

"This is so damn exhilarating!" Song Ren exclaimed excitedly. Luckily, he had fully stocked up on ammo from the Duke earlier, otherwise, it wouldn't have been enough.

Because Lady Dimitrescu's health bar was simply too thick.

It wasn't until his pistol was almost out of bullets that Lady Dimitrescu let out a piercing shriek: "Ethan, you'll die a terrible death!"

Her massive body crashed directly onto the tall tower, causing the entire structure to instantly collapse. As the bricks beneath his feet gave way, Ethan and the weakened Lady Dimitrescu fell together.

Using Lady Dimitrescu's massive body as a cushion, Ethan only felt a bit dizzy from the fall, but Lady Dimitrescu wasn't so lucky.

Her body gradually began to calcify. Facing Ethan, she left her final, venomous dying words: "It's too late! Ethan, you'll never see your daughter! I curse you to die a terrible death!"

*Crackle...* As her words faded, the completely calcified Lady Dimitrescu instantly disintegrated into a pile of dust, leaving only a statue behind.

"Phew... she's finally dead!" Song Ren let out a long breath, still filled with excitement.

Truthfully, this particular BOSS battle wouldn't rank high among the many games in Nebula Games' portfolio.

There were far too many BOSS battles more thrilling and intense, especially in games like Bloodborne and Dark Souls.

But the key was that Resident Evil Village was a horror game, and having such a tense and exciting BOSS battle felt incredibly novel.

It was a good thing he chose the easiest difficulty, otherwise, he'd probably have to melee the monster with just a knife.

Looking at his dwindling ammunition, Song Ren felt a pang of emotion.

Of course, this was also related to him wasting quite a bit of ammo. It was foreseeable that on higher difficulties, players would need to use ammunition much more rationally, avoiding waste of every single round.

But that had nothing to do with him; he always played games on the easiest or normal difficulty.

This was his creed and conduct as an ordinary gamer!

Looking at the crystal shard in his hand, Song Ren sighed. Even though it had only been a little over two hours,

He had only taken down the first of the Four Heavenly Kings and the final BOSS, Miranda.

Yet, he was already thoroughly convinced, especially about the game's story, which he still hadn't fully grasped.

Chris had inexplicably killed his wife Mia, his daughter had somehow fallen into Miranda's hands, and whether Chris was alive or dead remained unknown.

He also had no idea about the subsequent plot.

However, the only thing that made Song Ren happy was that this Village installment was incredibly satisfying to play.

There were certainly some scares, but more than that, it was exhilarating.

Resource collection, character development, and thrilling combat.

Under this triple assault, the sense of fear the game delivered significantly diminished.

Clearly, the subsequent levels would follow the same vibe. Mr. Chen has really changed!

At this moment, Song Ren temporarily exited the game, took a screenshot of Lady Dimitrescu's calcified form, and posted it on the official Weibo account and his WeChat Moments.

"This is what a Warrior of Love is all about. Mr. Chen nowadays truly lives up to the name!"

A horror game that could make even him thoroughly enjoy it – he had previously complained about Chen Xu when Resident Evil Village was announced at the direct presentation, but now, looking back, he really shouldn't have.

How fun this game was! It wasn't grim at all, not the slightest bit hellish.

Even if there were some jump scares, wasn't that to be expected in a horror game?

There always had to be some elements designed to adjust the atmosphere.

Song Ren's face was full of smiles as he continued to advance the story. Next, he planned to scavenge a bit more, then return to the Duke to save his game at the typewriter and log off, as it was getting late.

At the candelabra, Ethan found a grimy yellow bottle, which he studied for a long time without understanding what it was.

On the way, he encountered the mysterious old woman again, but one detail caught Song Ren's attention.

On a wall in one room, there was an emblem: surrounding it were the heads of the Four Heavenly Kings, with Mother Miranda in the center. In a later area, there was even a relief with a familiar pattern.

A-shaped umbrella pattern, identical to the Umbrella logo.

Could there be a connection between the two!?

Song Ren grew curious and continued forward.

But what surprised him was that after circling around, he found himself back in the village where he had started.

Moreover, the stout Duke also appeared there, and from his tone, it seemed he had been waiting specifically for him.

Approaching him triggered a dialogue, and the subsequent plot left Song Ren in silence and bewilderment.
