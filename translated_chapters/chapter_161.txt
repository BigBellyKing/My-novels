Chapter 160: Really, I Believe You! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Everyone was quite excited. VR games were nothing new, but the key was that this was Nebula Games' first internal VR production! Although Chen Xu had already said it was just a DEMO, it was most likely greenlit due to a demand from the Game Department. But no matter what, it was still a VR game. Being among the first to participate in the company's first VR production was a highly rewarding and memorable career experience.

The other two Art Team members were very happy. Ruan Ningxue was also very happy, simply because it was her first time participating in a VR production.

"Mr. Chen, what kind of DEMO are we developing this time?" Ruan Ningxue asked Chen Xu in the Meeting Room, her excitement still completely undiminished.

Hearing Ruan Ningxue, the other two art employees also looked at Chen Xu with anticipation.

"A story related to family ethics," Chen Xu thought for a moment, then offered a rather fitting description. Family ethics? Could it be something like 'It Takes Two'? Hearing the words 'family,' Ruan Ningxue's mind instantly conjured up two small doll figures, one made of wood and one of clay.

However, once she saw the title on the big screen, some keywords below it, and a simple concept art of Lisa, Ruan Ningxue fell silent. Where was the promised warmth?!

Staring at the main title 'Silent Hill PT' on the big screen, and Lisa, missing one eye, the other rolled back, her face covered in bloodstains, and a mouthful of yellow teeth.

Ruan Ningxue, along with the other two previously excited members of the Art Team, all fell into a state of silence. "As you can all see, the DEMO game we're developing next will be horror-themed. This is the main monster in the game, and you could also consider her the female protagonist, Lisa," Chen Xu said with a smile, looking at the three silent people.

From a visual presentation standpoint, let alone being made into VR, just this simple original concept art already had a significant impact. Because it was truly too grotesque.

Of course, this was normal; after all, it was a horror game. If it wasn't grotesque, how could it scare players? Imagine if the monsters in a horror game turned into tall, sexy, and alluring beautiful women. What the heck kind of horror game would that be? Players would already be eagerly awaiting those 'scary' female ghosts, wouldn't they? As long as you're brave enough, you can even make a female ghost take maternity leave.

"Mr... Mr. Chen, this is our new game?" Ruan Ningxue asked Chen Xu, her voice trembling slightly, as the gap between reality and imagination was truly too wide.

"Don't worry, it's not scary. Aside from Lisa, the most terrifying thing in the game is just an embryo. Of course, if you're afraid of cockroaches, then you'll have to add cockroaches to the list," Chen Xu said with a smile.

Hearing Chen Xu's words, Ruan Ningxue was speechless. Really, she believed him!

But this time, Chen Xu genuinely wasn't lying. This was also what made the 'Silent Hill PT' DEMO so special. In his previous life, many players, including people in the gaming industry, called this DEMO a perfect masterpiece. And in reality, it was true. No one knew what the full game would have been like, nor should it be exaggerated to such mythical proportions. After all, even Konami and Hideo Kojima in his previous life probably didn't know what the full version would have looked like, because it was stillborn.

But for a DEMO, it could only be described as flawless. Because it achieved perfection in everything it set out to do.

The sense of spatial occupation created by the infinite corridor, using the players' drive and narrative experience to make them move forward, and then using darkness and endless corridors to invade their visual space. Even though the entire scene from beginning to end was just a single long corridor, it gave players an endless sense of oppression.

There was also a sense of powerlessness conveyed through color; whether in horror films or horror games, color is always paramount. In this DEMO, a very unique warm and pallid color scheme was used; it could be said that over 80% of the scenes in PT were built with warm colors, except for the dim room where the cockroach crawled at the very beginning. The entire demonstration primarily used a palette of yellow, brown, red, and dark green, but the lighting technique leaned towards cool tones, opting for slightly bluish incandescent lamps.

Even worse, despite being dazzling incandescent lamps, their illumination range was less than a few meters. This strong contrast brought about a feeling of cold violence and loneliness. Inability to vent, to speak, to express – all these emotions blended together, elevating the overall sense of horror to a new level.

Listening to Chen Xu introduce the game's settings and artistic implications one by one. Ruan Ningxue and the others present felt a chill run down their spines. "Mr. Chen, this will scare players to death," Ruan Ningxue couldn't help but complain.

"Don't worry, the VR version of this game isn't for ordinary players to experience. It's for professionals, and in the game, we'll also adapt it accordingly to VR equipment and communicate with the Game Department's Research Institute for double assurance," Chen Xu explained.

..............

After Chen Xu finished explaining PT's design concept drafts, Ruan Ningxue and the other two members of the Art Team began their respective tasks. Just as Chen Xu said, the workload wasn't large, and it wasn't complicated at all. The entire game takes place in a fixed scene; the changes primarily involve the atmosphere, colors, and the representation of small items like photos and glass.

Meanwhile, Chen Xu began researching new VR equipment and game development engines. Chen Xu had previously experienced the performance of the new VR system at the Research Park.

Of course, it wasn't the kind of black technology that involved subconscious implants. When playing, players still needed to maintain a focused state of mind, and also wear corresponding Motion Capture Suits, such as gloves. At the same time, the gaming pod was equipped with various motion information collection devices, partly to monitor the player's physical condition and disconnect the pod if fluctuations occurred. On the other hand, it was also to create a more realistic experience for players; for example, if a player wanted to run, and their feet made slight movements, the system would provide corresponding feedback actions based on the player's reactions in the gaming pod.

Of course, when it comes to a specific VR game, what actions are supported and how to operate them still depends on the game's design. For instance, if the game didn't implement a running animation, even if you kicked inside the gaming pod, the game screen wouldn't respond. It sounded a bit strange, but after playing for a while, one would get used to it. It was like a player accustomed to mouse and keyboard controls feeling a bit unaccustomed the first time they used a controller. But given time, they would get used to it.

It was precisely for this reason that playing VR games was very mentally taxing for players. This was also why most VR games were incredibly expensive, as they required designers to pile on details within the game. The more details piled on, the stronger the player's immersive experience. What are these details? They are money!

After broadly understanding some key aspects of VR games and how they differed from PC games, Chen Xu also began designing the detailed content for 'Silent Hill PT'. As for action assets, Nebula Games wouldn't need to create them. The Game Department had subsidies, so everything would be outsourced. The DEMO would be produced as quickly as possible, and to be honest, its scale wasn't actually that large.
