Chapter 54: Player Reactions

Regarding Nebula Games, or rather, Chen Xu's new game.

There were actually quite a number of people paying attention.

These individuals were not just players, but also included some game designers from the industry, as well as game media outlets.

After all, Chen Xu still carried a label: that of the first-prize winner of the Sci-Fi Game Design Competition.

Coupled with the fact that To the Moon had indeed moved countless players.

So, it's safe to say that a considerable number of people were curious about Chen Xu's new work, Outlast.

Especially for player communities focused on horror games, Outlast had already begun to spread within their circles.

In a certain horror game enthusiast forum, many players were posting and discussing the game Outlast.

"Holy crap, today I found a horror game that just launched and it scared the living daylights out of me! At first, I thought it was just some ordinary, third-rate horror game! But it's absolutely insane, I played for half an hour and was too scared to continue!"

"I know, Outlast, right? The one developed by the same designer who made To the Moon. This game is really terrifying, damn it. At first, those door jump scares didn't impress me much, but when I got to the basement, I realized I was so wrong!"

"I bought it too, and it's definitely scary, especially when hiding in the locker. I was so afraid that fat guy would find me."

"I think the door jump scares are alright, I'm used to them, but the combination of that creepy camera night vision mode and dark scenes? I really couldn't handle it!"

Many players who had already played the game discussed the content of Outlast in their groups.

At the same time, these players' conversations also attracted some confused players.

After all, while quite a few players paid attention to Chen Xu, even more ordinary players didn't follow this aspect at all.

Speaking of To the Moon, many of them knew what kind of game it was.

Because To the Moon and Undertale were quite well-known among independent game players.

But when it came to Chen Xu and his new work, Outlast, unless they specifically followed him, most players would be completely clueless, not knowing anything.

This is also why top industry giants still spend huge amounts of money promoting their AAA-tier games.

Because most players' acceptance of games is very passive; they might even play some excellent games without knowing who the designer or the game company is.

In various threads discussing Outlast, the topic attracted many players who hadn't been following Chen Xu.

"Outlast? A new horror game?"

"Is it as exaggerated as you guys say? It's just a horror game."

"If you don't believe it, go try it yourself. You can buy it on the Official Game Platform and the Nebula Games platform, but it's 5 Yuan cheaper on the Nebula Games platform."

"OJBK, I'm going to take on the challenge!"

"I'll give it a try too, you bunch of cowards!"

"Waiting for your post-play reactions!"

"Alright, just wait for the news of our completion! Heh heh, what's there to be afraid of in a small horror game?"

They boasted confidently beforehand, but an hour or two later, the players who had previously vowed to take on the challenge returned to the forum.

Compared to their previous confident and disdainful tones.

This time, just from the text they posted, one could feel their psychological state at that moment.

"Damn damn damn! It scared me to death! That mental patient in the wheelchair scared the hell out of me!"

"I can't take it, I feel a little dizzy. When I was starting the generator in the basement, I completely broke down. It was pitch black, my camera battery wasn't enough, and there was a guy with a nail board chasing me."

"Same here, it scared me so badly I almost peed my pants, thankfully I held it in at the crucial moment."

"I wonder what the designer of this game has been through!"

"I dare say this is absolutely the strongest horror game this year, no, in recent years, alright!"

"+1! I think so too!"

"So, for such a fun game, does anyone have any ideas?"

"For example, recommending this game to more players? After all, good things should be shared!"

"Great minds think alike! Let's go post in other game community forums!"

"Heh heh, I already posted, go upvote my thread!"

"Holy crap, no sportsmanship, you jumped the gun!"

Following the first batch of horror game enthusiasts experiencing Outlast and getting scared silly.

Many players who didn't dare to continue playing halfway through also flocked to game community forums and other places, preparing to post threads recommending Outlast to other players.

Of course, the majority of players' thoughts weren't about how excellent this horror game was and how others absolutely *had* to play it.

Their thoughts were very simple: I got scared so badly myself, shouldn't more players get a scare just like me?

Naturally, some pre-arranged promotional internet trolls from Chen Xu's side were also guiding the conversation.

Otherwise, it would be difficult to quickly generate buzz. Of course, this also required the game to have the inherent ability to do so.

And did Outlast have that ability?

The answer was obvious.

So, in game community forums and various game groups, these first batch of players began recommending Outlast to their friends and even unfamiliar online players.

How could such a good game only scare themselves so thoroughly?

They absolutely had to let other players also experience the 'love' conveyed by this game!

On game communities, some players noticed that at a certain time, many similar posts suddenly appeared.

They were basically all discussing a horror game called Outlast.

"Strongly recommend a horror game, Outlast. Bought it for my grad school roommate, it's incredibly effective, my roommate has been scared to death, and I've successfully secured my spot for grad school."

"A game bought for the kid, now the kid is having a blast playing in the underworld!"

"Other games cost money, this game is amazing, it costs your heart!"

"The game was bought in the morning, played in the afternoon, and I was scared to death at night."

"If you're timid, absolutely do NOT buy this horror game, or you'll definitely regret it!"

"Only truly courageous people dare to play this horror game alone!"

"This year's best horror game, Outlast. Cowards, please stay away from this game!"

Some game forums and communities were filled with these kinds of posts.

They were divided into two factions: one was making jokes and trying to trick others into suffering along with them.

The other type seemed to be genuinely descriptive, telling others just how terrifying this horror game really was.

Among them, the joke posts were quite easy to distinguish.

But this couldn't help but make many people curious.

Was this horror game called Outlast really that scary?

The game actually scared so many people, and made so many want to use memes to trick others into playing and suffering?
