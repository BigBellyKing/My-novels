Chapter 268: Map Editor and Optimization Improvements (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

After the meeting, Chen Xu returned to his office to meticulously refine the game design document.

Unlike other RTS genres, the races, unit types, and even building attributes in Warcraft are all distinct. There are also corresponding detailed numerical values, which is a relatively complex area. These contents are precisely the core of Warcraft.

Different races each have their own characteristics and their own positioning. For example, for the Night Elves, buildings like the Ancient of War can not only produce units but also stand up, move, and attack. Therefore, Night Elves typically place their Ancient of War (barracks) next to neutral creeps, and after their starting hero emerges, they cooperate with the Ancient of War to quickly level up to level 2.

The Human race is similar; their main city can transform Peasants into Militia. In the early game, Humans can use Militia to quickly expand their bases and level up. Furthermore, with different starting hero characteristics, there are countless tactical playstyles.

For instance, an Orc player starting with a Blademaster can use Wind Walk to harass enemy Peasants, tail online teams and steal creeps or dropped items when the opponent's monsters are at low health, and spend all early-game economy on purchasing attribute items from neutral shops to maximize the Blademaster's combat power.

When Humans face Orcs with a neutral tavern, they can abandon the advantage of expanding, focus entirely on leveling their starting Archmage, and at level three, go to the neutral tavern to buy a Beastmaster to harass with Quillbeasts. Meanwhile, they accumulate Priests and Sorceresses, and once they've formed a sufficient force, they purchase Mass Healing Scrolls and Mini Towers from the Human Shop. With a certain number of spellcasters, they bring Militia and Mini Towers to build Arrow Towers, directly taking out the Orcs.

Racial characteristics, building characteristics, and hero combinations are the core aspects that differentiate Warcraft from other RTS games. Furthermore, if broken down, it involves attack types, armor types, including the skills of various unit types, and related numerical values, all of which are very complex.

Just the attack types alone in Warcraft are divided into Regular, Piercing, Hero, Chaos, Siege, and Magic. Similarly, armor is divided into Light, Medium, Heavy, Fortified, Hero, and Unarmored. Chen Xu has already instructed Qin Yi to begin developing the damage model for these. First, they will establish these different types and damage calculation ratios; the classification of monsters will come later.

Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin, on the other hand, are responsible for the art content production in Warcraft. The main characters in the game, such as Arthas, Illidan, Tyrande Whisperwind, Sylvanas Windrunner, and Jaina, will naturally be handled by Chen Xu himself. If one only looks at the in-game models of these characters, they are truly unsightly by current standards. However, if one only looks at the concept art, it is absolutely top-notch regardless of the era.

But the game doesn't just feature these main characters. Common unit types, such as Human soldiers, Orc warriors, and Undead Ghouls, all require art production. In addition, there's the game's controls and UI interaction. This area requires extensive modifications.

Although Warcraft's game design philosophy is undoubtedly excellent, it was limited by the technology of his previous life. This part of the content could be described as quite user-unfriendly, even unscientific. Player interaction experience is one such point.

In his previous life, Warcraft did not support custom keybinds for players. For example, items in the hero's inventory required the Numpad keys to use. This design was primarily because Warcraft had a unit grouping function, and the number keys on the Alphabet keys were reserved for unit grouping. Therefore, the item inventory could naturally only be used with the Numpad. However, for most ordinary players, this design was quite awkward, especially for rookie players.

Unit grouping? "Why would I need unit grouping? I just drag a box with my mouse, blindly A-move, and focus entirely on controlling one hero, and that's it."

Besides, there were related font bugs. When a game had too many map resources and too much time passed, font errors would appear, turning into garbled characters. These were all limitations of the game development technology at the time. Now, Chen Xu naturally wants to be more diligent, correct these shortcomings, and make the entire game more perfect.

As for the game's storyline, Chen Xu has not yet started working on it, as it is not urgent for now.

In addition, there is a very important direction, which is arguably the greatest design in Warcraft. It is also the design that allowed Warcraft to endure for so long in his previous life, with countless players still immersed in it even after more than ten years. That is Warcraft's Map Editor.

To describe it in one sentence, Warcraft is a culmination of RTS masterpieces. And Warcraft's Map Editor gave Warcraft even more possibilities. Many players didn't even get into Warcraft through its story, campaign, or RTS gameplay. Instead, they got hooked through various interesting RPG maps.

Defend the Sword Pass, Defend Athena, Fantasy Cao Cao's Biography, Monopoly of the World, Pyramid Escape, Calamity of the Western World, Cops and Robbers, Trolls and Elves, Rabbit vs. Sheep War, Human Invincible, War of the Minions...

It even spawned classic games like DOTA. Especially DOTA, it can be said that the later MOBA era in his previous life was inseparable from this game.

In his previous life, Blizzard Entertainment's creation of the Map Editor originally stemmed from an idea in StarCraft, but it wasn't very refined and was quite complex. It wasn't until Warcraft 3 that the Map Editor became relatively complete. However, it was actually just a small supplement to Warcraft's content, and Blizzard Entertainment didn't even realize how great a thing it was. This is why the DOTA copyright dispute with IceFrog happened later.

Knowing these things, Chen Xu naturally wouldn't underestimate Warcraft's Map Editor. Instead, he wanted to dedicate himself to making it even more perfect. After all, in his previous life, with the development of the times, Warcraft's Map Editor was actually updated several times by master players in the community, adding more content.

In addition to in-game elements like heroes, unit types, buildings, and their respective attributes, it also includes the shaping of game maps. Forests, water bodies, rocks, and beyond that, the game also has weather and time settings. The time factor also affects the state of neutral monsters, whether they are awake or asleep, including the game's visible field of view, which differs between day and night.

However, compared to the Map Editor of his previous life, Chen Xu felt it was still too complex. Because the Map Editor in his previous life, while powerful in functionality, still required a certain level of coding knowledge for map creation.

For Chen Xu, with the technology of the Parallel World, a more open-ended design is entirely achievable. For those who want to create more complex and interesting maps, higher port permissions can be granted to community experts. And for ordinary players, they can also create simple defense maps and so on, based on the game's existing mechanisms, using Warcraft's Map Editor.

Just like the openness to MODs in Fall Guys, Overcooked, and Minecraft. Let more ordinary players, with a little thought, create various interesting maps. Why can't the Map Editor itself be a part of the game's gameplay?

For example, categorizing various maps within a single community, and allowing players to like the creators when they play their respective maps. Creating an open community similar to Minecraft.

And not like the official platform in his previous life, after being managed by Pig Factory, where the quality of the remake was Blizzard Entertainment's fault, but why did the WAR3 official platform also become a tool for monetizing, with more and more RPG maps resembling web games?

Ultimately, it was due to the commercialization of the platform. While there were indeed many map players who chose to share for free or out of nostalgia, the WAR3 map community did not have as good an environment as MC. If your map didn't include an in-game store, the platform wouldn't display your custom game rooms, and if the platform deemed a map unprofitable, it wouldn't even pass censorship.

Therefore, creating a good community environment is essential. However, for Chen Xu, Nebula Games already has experience in this area. Of course, platform censorship must also be noted. Maps that excite Lewd Persons, such as "Seven Dwarfs and Snow White," "Defend Athena (Tough Guy Edition)," and "Princess Xiangxiang," should disappear in the Parallel World.

Hmm... at least officially, players definitely won't find them.

Sitting in his office, Chen Xu pondered the directions for optimization and improvement in Warcraft.
