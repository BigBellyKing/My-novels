Chapter 134: New Item (Requesting Subscriptions)

A uniformly positive reception, so much so that it made people wonder if these media outlets had been paid.

Hmm... well, it's true that Target Software did pay some public relations fees.

But this was also primarily due to the inherent quality of *Dark Souls* itself. Otherwise, for big-name gaming media like GameSpot, a simple business expense wouldn't be enough to make them lie through their teeth.

As for the effect, it was also quite excellent. Players who actively follow review news from major gaming media outlets are mostly seasoned veterans, not casual players who learn about a currently popular game from news, advertisements, or live streaming video platforms and then decide to buy and play it.

*Dark Souls*' nature leaned towards hardcore, which also attracted the attention of many players.

On a large overseas game forum, players from various countries were discussing gaming topics. Among them was a trending hot post, with *Dark Souls* as its subject.

"Heard about it? There's a new game that recently launched, called *Dark Souls*?"

"Of course, GameSpot and some other media gave it very high ratings."

"It seems like this is a game from the East."

"Let me see, my God! Did GameSpot get paid for this?"

"Haha, my friend upstairs, you should perhaps check out the promotional CG animation for *Dark Souls* on YouTube, I can guarantee it's explosively cool!"

"That's right, you can go check it out, it's really cool, unless it's a misleading trailer."

"Friend, I can assure you of this: this game has been online in their country for almost a month now. There are videos on YouTube uploaded by streamers and video creators from their country, and you can clearly see the game's true performance."

"I watched it, but they die so often in the game, I've already learned those three Chinese characters for 'You Died' now!"

With Target Software's overseas promotion, *Dark Souls*' popularity began to slowly rise. The high ratings from major gaming media, coupled with its excellent CG animation, made many overseas players anticipate it. Was it truly as excellent as the game boasted, or was it an unworthy game? Many players held this idea of uncovering the truth.

............

Regarding the overseas promotion, Chen Xu temporarily stopped paying attention after understanding Target Software's promotional strategies and policies. After all, everything that needed to be done had been done; the rest was up to the market to determine the results.

Moreover, for Chen Xu, there was now something even more exciting. That was the gold-tier item he had previously drawn, which, thanks to *Dark Souls*' performance these past few days, finally accumulated enough corresponding points.

In the office, Chen Xu eagerly opened the gold gashapon he had previously drawn from his item inventory. He opened it, and with a flash of golden light, a card appeared before Chen Xu.

**[Game AI Performance Technology]**: Optimizes game AI performance, making it more akin to life-like intelligence.

Prerequisites for use: Own a wholly-owned AI technology company (X), 20 million research funds (X).

Looking at the golden card in his item inventory, Chen Xu was stunned. This was the first time he had ever drawn such an item. Game AI was not unfamiliar to Chen Xu. For a game, AI can be said to be a very crucial point. The strength or weakness of AI performance in a game also has a tremendous impact on players' sense of immersion.

In the Parallel World, AI performance was actually much higher than in his previous life. But it couldn't quite be called Artificial Intelligence. Of course, in Chen Xu's understanding, so-called Artificial Intelligence would at least be at the level of the 'Terminator' in his previous life. But whether such technology would be good or bad for the world, that was truly hard to say.

Many industries in the Parallel World already used AI, such as smart home systems, and some hazardous work industries, etc. However, these were not necessarily applicable to the gaming industry. Compared to the AI applicable in the gaming field, their level was actually not that high. Moreover, AI applied in the gaming field is different from AI in other fields. Yet, in this area, the gap between large game developers and ordinary small studios was still enormous.

Similar to the accumulation in action feel, AI also required a strong technical foundation. The decision to make *Dark Souls* before was mainly because its requirements for both action and AI were relatively low. It was a game primarily focused on level and BOSS design. However, for some works that require players to interact with the game world, the AI experience in the game is extremely important.

In Chen Xu's original plan, Nebula Games' future development, besides continuing research in action performance, also included AI and other related technologies. This item came at just the right time. It just had prerequisites for use. And judging by the 'X' marks, it seemed there were further requirements for the so-called AI technology company, though they weren't specified.

Chen Xu then looked at the accumulated points. It had to be said that *Dark Souls* was truly a score-farming tool. With 136 draws worth of points, it was arguably Chen Xu's wealthiest moment to date.

However, Chen Xu didn't immediately draw. On one hand, his current ability points were sufficient, and there weren't any major projects coming up. On the other hand, the overseas version of *Dark Souls* was about to launch soon, so he could save up another batch and then have a satisfying drawing session all at once.

After pondering for a while in his office, Chen Xu called Lin Rou in and asked her to compile a list of domestic and international companies specializing in AI technology research, to see which ones could meet the conditions of this item card. At the same time, it was also to understand their scale, as the prerequisite required a wholly-owned company. Therefore, he would definitely need to acquire an AI technology company himself.

Of course, if he built one himself and it met the conditions, it should also qualify for the system's requirements. But building from scratch would be much slower than an acquisition. Moreover, Chen Xu wasn't in a hurry with this. Unlike the timed items he had drawn before, this item card didn't specify a time limit. Even if he couldn't use it, he could just keep it for now.

Next, Chen Xu called Qin Yi into his office. Based on the current progress of players in *Dark Souls*, the carefully prepared small gifts for players could also start being reddied. And the brand-new mode was also a powerful tool for harvesting points!
