Chapter 231: Nebula Games Platform Transformation (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

On the official Weibo account, Chen Xu also announced in advance the news of the Minecraft mobile version and VR version.

Scheduled for release on March 31st.

Of course, this was mainly due to the somewhat special nature of April 1st.

That's why it was set for March 31st; otherwise, it would have been quite meaningful as a two-month anniversary for Minecraft's launch.

As for the pricing, it also pleasantly surprised many players.

The VR version was priced at 148 Yuan, and 29.9 USD overseas.

As for the mobile version, if a player purchased either the PC version or the VR version, it would be automatically activated.

Of course, if players stated they didn't want to buy the PC or VR versions and only wished to play the mobile version, they could also purchase it separately.

Priced at 28 Yuan. However, players who had already purchased the mobile version and wished to buy the PC or VR version would only need to pay the remaining balance.

This pricing strategy made countless players exclaim, "It's so good!"

Similarly, after announcing the news of the VR and mobile versions, Chen Xu didn't pay too much attention to it.

After all, with the PC version's sales figures, the VR version's sales couldn't possibly be too bad.

Moreover, compared to game prices on VR platforms, Minecraft, priced at 148 Yuan, could be said to be a cabbage-level price.

However, in contrast to Chen Xu's calm demeanor, other designers and media outlets in the entire gaming industry were fixated on this, paying immense attention to its data.

The next day, Nebula Games did not release the relevant data as it had with the PC version's Minecraft sales.

However, a third-party statistical company immediately compiled the figures.

The VR version of Minecraft sold 2.41 million copies domestically.

The mobile version of Minecraft sold 1.52 million copies domestically.

April Fool's!?

Many industry designers and media outlets who were paying attention were a bit bewildered.

The figures were simply a bit too unexpected.

The VR version's sales weren't particularly surprising.

According to data compiled by the Game Department, the current number of VR units in China is approximately 30 million.

However, in reality, this 30 million figure is certainly an underestimate.

The reason is that this data counts the activation volume of VR gaming pods.

Meaning, VR gaming pods that have been activated and used.

But the key is that not every player has purchased a gaming pod; VR experience stores and similar venues account for a significant portion.

While the gaming pods in these experience stores are fixed, the players who use them are different.

Therefore, the actual number of potential user players is far greater than this data suggests.

Previously, Minecraft on the PC platform had sold like crazy, and it still maintains extremely hot momentum.

The VR version, offering a better experience and not being particularly expensive, selling so many copies is not surprising.

What was truly surprising, however, was the mobile version.

This counts sales, not the number of players!

This means that over a million players had not purchased the PC version, and these are all entirely new player demographics.

However, while the industry was filled with self-doubt, Chen Xu at Nebula Games was currently contemplating more important matters.

Furthermore, on the display screen in front of Chen Xu, the current games under Nebula Games were shown.

Mirror (Game) (crossed out) Undertale, To the Moon, Overcooked (Chinese title), Sanguosha, Fall Guys, Outlast, Dark Souls, Valiant Hearts: The Great War, It Takes Two, Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame, as well as Don't Starve and Minecraft... hmm, a certain Big Hammer Game was temporarily excluded by Chen Xu.

As of now, the Nebula Games Platform has a total of twelve games it can showcase.

Simultaneously, these games also enjoy immense popularity among the player base.

For a game store, Nebula Games has actually been very successful, much like Blizzard's Battle.net in his previous life.

But for Chen Xu, he clearly had no intention of stopping there.

Simply being an integrated platform for its own games was never Chen Xu's goal; he had always aimed for comprehensive digital platforms like Steam Platform and GOG from his previous life.

102 million registered users, 23 million daily active users, 77 million monthly active users, with an average peak concurrent online users of 8.17 million.

This was primarily due to the recent popularity of Minecraft, which boosted Nebula Games' active user data.

Nevertheless, all these data points indicate one thing: Nebula Games has now developed into a game store with significant influence.

Now fully fledged, and the launch of Minecraft was originally part of this plan.

Including with the Marketing and Operations Department, Chen Xu had already discussed this aspect with Zhang Yida.

Now, leveraging the influence of Minecraft, Nebula Games could finally take this step.

……………………

April 15th.

Although it was a Sunday, all employees of Nebula Games were at their respective posts today.

On major gaming media websites and in game communities, the trending topic was originally still Minecraft.

But soon, the top spot was taken by the term 'Nebula Games'.

Many players who opened the Nebula Games Platform, preparing to enter Minecraft,

As the platform opened, seeing the pop-up message, countless players were stunned.

'Effective immediately, Nebula Games Store will transition into a comprehensive digital game platform, allowing all game designers to publish games on the store and providing corresponding promotion and services for those games.'

'Including features such as cloud saves, user feedback, Workshop (modding platform), and store friend connections, while granting game designers on the platform sufficient autonomy, provided they comply with the rules.'

Of course, these games must first undergo relevant censorship and obtain publishing qualifications before they can be launched.

In simple terms, Nebula Games was transforming from an independent platform that solely ran its own games into a comprehensive distribution platform.

What further excited gaming industry designers were the sales terms of the Nebula Games Platform.

In the Parallel World, just like most game stores in his previous life, the official game store took a 30% cut.

But this was the official store; for large channels like TengHua and NetDragon, it was entirely different.

If they were top-tier game designers or powerful developers, they would naturally get a 30% cut.

But what about the treatment for ordinary game designers and developers?

In his previous life, many people felt that the 30% cut taken by platforms like Steam and Google was very high.

However, for channels like some domestic mobile app stores, the split generally started at 50-50.

Want a 30% cut? No problem, you can list it on my platform, but I won't promote it; then it's a 30% cut. But if you want promotion and use my servers, then it's a 60% cut, okay?

Don't even complain about it being high, because some even more outrageous ones had a 70-30 split.

Developer 70%, channel 30%? What are you thinking?! Developer 30%, channel 70%!

Even more outrageous, you couldn't even control what operational methods your game should adopt.

What? You're saying that wouldn't be like begging on one's knees?

Exactly! If you put it that way, it really is like begging on one's knees, and for this, how many people wanted to kneel but couldn't even get the chance!

Compared to the major app channels in his previous life, the major channels in the Parallel World were also like this.

As for why so many designers were still willing:

There was no other way. Setting up their own platform and selling through an official website completely lacked the budget for promotion.

As for the official game store, while it had a considerable user base, when it came to recommendation slots and rotations, although there was some exposure, the algorithms were quite outdated.

After all, since it involved official bodies, they couldn't directly interfere due to market regulations.

Therefore, unless a game was a genuine blockbuster, it rarely became hugely popular on official platforms.

And yet, most games actually don't possess the qualities to become a huge hit; more often, they cater to the tastes of a specific segment of players.

So even if the channel providers took a high cut, they could at least ensure exposure.

Circumstances are stronger than people, so they could only gnaw on bones themselves, allowing the channels to eat meat and drink soup.

After all, if you're making money, begging on your knees is not shameful.

And now, what shocked gaming industry designers was that in the Nebula Games Store, the revenue-sharing terms Chen Xu offered were surprisingly 25%.

Regardless of whether they were large game developers or individual game designers, there was a uniform 25% cut taken for the platform's daily operations.

As soon as this news spread, it instantly caused a major upheaval in the gaming industry.
