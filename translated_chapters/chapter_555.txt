Chapter 554: First Joy, Then Suffering – This is Mr. Chen's Calculation! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

As expected, it's a sequel to Resident Evil.

Looking at the gilded title, all the players present were filled with emotion. Ethan, that man is back again!

Another thing that made many players curious was what kind of threats Ethan would encounter in the new game. After all, Evelyn was already taken care of in the previous installment. And from the current information, it seems a bit like a fairy tale. What is it alluding to?

A dark fairy tale, eerie forest, chilling air, along with bizarre monsters and atmosphere. All these interwoven elements, even without high-energy scary scenes, made many players feel a shiver down their spines.

'Oh my god, I knew Mr. Chen wouldn't let us off easily.'

'Who would have thought Mr. Chen was waiting here? I naively thought Mr. Chen had truly become wholesome.'

'Speaking of which, what's the deal with this promotional content? It feels full of allusions!'

'Who knows? Looking at the entire promotional content, all I can make out is three words: Riddler-like!'

'I don't know about other hints, but the old witch at the end must be referring to us, right?'

'Haha, thinking about it, that actually makes sense. The more he gives us, the more we want, and the greater the price. After Human: Fall Flat and Animal Crossing, and now Super Mario Maker, plus The Witcher: Wild Hunt's Toussaint DLC also seems beautiful, so he's collecting all the principal and interest back with Resident Evil Village?'

'Holy cow, how terrifying will Resident Evil Village be then?'

'Honestly, Ethan is so miserable. He went through so much in the previous game, why won't they let him off in the new one? And I thought Chris from the previous DLC was pretty strong, and from the background info, he's a tough guy too. Why not make him the protagonist and spare Ethan?'

'By the way, is it possible that Ethan and Chris will work together to solve the biohazard incident in the new game?'

'I can't figure it out, but compared to Resident Evil Village, I'm actually more interested in The Witcher: Wild Hunt's two DLC contents.'

The players on site were discussing animatedly, and amidst their chatter, Chen Xu reappeared.

Looking at the players present, Chen Xu couldn't help but smile: “That’s right, this is the final major news for today: Resident Evil Village, a brand new action-adventure shooter blockbuster, will be landing on Huanyu VR!”

As Chen Xu spoke, players, regardless of gender or nationality, all let out a collective 'Huh?' sound.

Action-adventure shooter? Who'd believe you, Mr. Chen!

“Ahem… Of course, there will be a tiny bit of horror content in the game, but the core gameplay and mechanics will bring a revolutionary breakthrough compared to the previous installment,” Chen Xu said with a light cough.

Players showed curiosity. Anyone who had played Nebula Games' products and understood Chen Xu knew what kind of designer he was. He seemingly prided himself on being a 'Warrior of Love' yet often created games that made people 'collapse'. However, one thing both those who liked and disliked Nebula Games had to admit was that Nebula Games never resorted to false advertising in their promotions; what they said was always what they delivered.

Given Chen Xu's description of 'action-adventure shooter,' the game would definitely involve these elements. Moreover, Chen Xu stated that the new game would be completely different from the previous one, with core mechanics and gameplay undergoing a transformation. This wouldn't just be talk, but a significant change, which piqued many players' curiosity.

“Furthermore, I believe everyone is concerned about one thing: when exactly can you play it?” Chen Xu paused, then continued, “Resident Evil Village and The Witcher: Wild Hunt's DLCs will meet you before the New Year.”

Here it comes! Here it comes! He's making grand promises again!

All the players were speechless. Before the New Year? Then give us a date!

This was clearly another of Nebula Games' usual tricks: making grand promises.

However, before the players could react, Chen Xu’s latter half of the sentence made many players gasp and cheer.

That was Super Mario Maker, which would launch in three days, and its cartridges had already been distributed to major offline game stores.

With the end of the direct presentation, there was still a concert performance to follow, recreating Pauline's concert from Odyssey.

But now, all the players' attention was no longer on the performance. Many players immediately pulled out their portable Switches, turned on their mobile hotspots, and entered the Nebula Games Platform to pre-order Super Mario Maker, then proceed with the pre-download.

Online, various gaming media outlets that had been following the event also quickly published articles.

Although only three announcements were made, all three were undoubtedly major news.

The Witcher: Wild Hunt DLC content, which also added a new map called Toussaint. Moreover, the game's style had changed from its previous dark tone, making players curious about what new stories Geralt, the White Wolf, would bring in such a setting.

Then there was the news about Resident Evil Village. Although it's a horror game, when Resident Evil was released last year, it truly scared a large number of players worldwide, especially its performance on Huanyu VR. Even now, the total clear rate hasn't surpassed 30%.

But a low clear rate doesn't mean a small audience. In fact, many players expressed great fondness for the series. This was because Ethan in the game gave them a sense of being flesh and blood. He was just an ordinary man… well, even if this man could recover from severe injuries just by washing his hands. But in the setting, he was just a regular person. This allowed players to empathize more with Ethan's story, and the sense of relief after surviving a catastrophe deeply moved many players.

What challenges would Ethan face in the new generation? This made many players curious.

As for Super Mario Maker, there was no need to say more. This was clearly Mr. Chen's final act of mercy. He was letting players enjoy a good meal before experiencing the horror that Resident Evil Village would bring.

From the game's characters, the protagonists were the plumber uncle and the seemingly honest Luigi, along with the clever-looking little blue Toad with wide eyes and the adorable little pink. Considering the creative elements in the game, much like Minecraft, it would definitely attract many children.

Within every adult's heart lies a pure fairy tale. This was clearly the central theme the game aimed to express. A game filled with harmony, friendship, and joy, allowing players to feel this happiness before bravely stepping into the world of Resident Evil Village to face their doom. This was Mr. Chen's calculation!
