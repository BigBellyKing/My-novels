Chapter 839: Player Controversy

Many players, when first encountering Elden Ring, essentially approached it with the mindset of playing Souls games like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Bloodborne, and Dark Souls.

In terms of combat system, including style and characteristics, Elden Ring indeed shares many similarities with these Souls-like games.

However, the open-world aspect grants Elden Ring countless possibilities.

Just like in the Dark Souls Prequel, where players could speedrun to get the Gravelord Sword, sever the dragon's tail for the Drake Sword, or farm for the Black Knight Halberd early on, thereby reducing the game's difficulty. Elden Ring offers even greater freedom in its settings, a vaster map, and more content to explore.

This open-world design dictates that Elden Ring allows many players to find a simple and easy route to complete the game, ensuring that the entire experience isn't just about blood pressure exploding, but also offers moments of pure exhilaration.

For instance, melee players who acquire the Hoarfrost Stomp weapon art can transform into weapon art maniacs. Combined with Hoarfrost Stomp's wide-range AOE and frostbite properties, they can effortlessly defeat previously difficult BOSSes.

Alternatively, by utilizing 100% physical defense and the stamina delay effect provided by certain weapon arts, they can tank everything.

Paired with a special item called Mimic Tear, obtained from the Eternal City, it can sometimes achieve an effect greater than 1+1=3.

Although Chen Xu made some balance adjustments to the Mimic Tear's damage, aggro, health, and AI, as a Spirit Ash that can use the same weapons, magic, and weapon arts as the player, it remains incredibly powerful, especially for certain playstyles.

For example, Hoarfrost Stomp, and against monsters with low Poise, dual-wielding colossal weapons can prevent them from even straightening up.

As for Mages, favored by players, there are even more diverse playstyles. They can utilize the Cerulean Hidden Tear to maximize spell damage and Intelligence, becoming a glass cannon focused on one-shot kills.

They can also use faster Glintstone magic, combined with a dagger equipped with the Bloodhound's Step weapon art, to become an incredibly agile Mage.

For many Mages, the magic professor at the top of the Carian Study Hall, with his teleportation summons and great bow, left a profound impression with his sneaky combat style.

Unfortunately, the teleportation magic is BOSS-exclusive, but players aren't without alternatives.

The Bloodhound's Step weapon art is a substitute, offering a longer distance, faster startup, and longer Invincibility Frames compared to rolling.

The only cost required is a small amount of mana consumption and stamina bar.

Furthermore, the Faith build using Incantations is also quite powerful in the game. Although the signature Dark Souls skill 'Sunlight Spear' is somewhat weaker in Elden Ring.

However, the Dragon Heart obtained after defeating dragons, which can be exchanged for Dragon Incantations at the Dragon Communion Cathedral, opens up many possibilities. Especially the Scarlet Rot Dragon Breath, combined with Bleed crossbow bolts and a Pulley Crossbow, along with a main weapon featuring the Seppuku weapon art, makes the entire game feel effortlessly easy.

Two blasts of Scarlet Rot Dragon Breath make the BOSS feel the power of Scarlet Rot, complemented by the long-range Bleed effect from crossbow bolts, letting monsters experience what it's like to face a despicable Tarnished.

And even if these tactics aren't enough to make the game easier, there's an even simpler and cruder method: grinding levels.

While unlike traditional ARPGs where sufficiently high stats prevent BOSSes from breaking hyper armor, the significant increase in well-rounded stats still lowers the combat margin for error.

At the Site of Grace in Caelid, there are two giant crows nearby. If a Mage learns Rock Sling, they can earn approximately 8,000 Runes per minute.

Also, on the treetop in the Deeproot Depths, the massive Gargoyle can be easily defeated by both Mages and melee characters. One Gargoyle yields 4,000 Runes, enough to keep players happy for a while.

By following the White-faced Varré NPC's questline at the Rose Church to initiate the Mohgwyn Dynasty quest, the first Site of Grace near there offers a giant crow worth 10,000 Runes, and rows of smaller experience fodder worth 2,000 each, giving players ample motivation.

One could say that if players wanted to, they could completely transform into a Shi Li Po Sword God.

As long as my damage output is explosive enough, no BOSS can stop me.

Initially, on various platforms and videos, streamers were getting beaten mercilessly, and players watched with great interest.

But as time progressed, players' understanding of Elden Ring deepened, and more content was uncovered.

It was still suffering, but for most BOSSes, if one wasn't completely clumsy, they could typically pass after dying ten-odd times, getting stuck for half an hour or an hour.

This sense of contrast even made many players feel a great sense of satisfaction, prompting them to want to try the game themselves.

After all, while Souls games have always been immensely popular, arguably one of Nebula Games' top three IPs, their sales haven't truly been top-tier. The main reason is the excessive number of cloud players, as not many players are looking for an experience purely focused on intense suffering.

However, Elden Ring, with its accessible shortcuts that aren't bug exploits, has inspired many players to experience it for themselves.

And once these players entered the game, they immediately felt its charm.

Combined with rich gameplay, Elden Ring could arguably be the easiest Souls game ever created, if one chooses. As long as one gets a little familiar with the BOSS's combat patterns, they can easily overcome them after a few tries.

Of course, if one avoids summoning NPCs and these easy playstyles, then Elden Ring will also be the most difficult Souls game ever created.

These two extreme experiences have also sparked much controversy and discussion among players.

Tieba, live streaming platforms, and community forums are filled with various hot topics.

'The Spirit Ashes system is truly a bad apple spoiling the whole pot of soup. I don't know what Chen Xu was thinking, creating something so devoid of technical skill. Combined with the Mage's Cerulean Hidden Tear and Comet Azur, any BOSS loses all meaning in front of it.'

'Bloodborne, Dark Souls, and Sekiro – if you could just summon helpers whenever you wanted to fight a BOSS, would these Souls games even be playable? It's ridiculous! And don't give me that
