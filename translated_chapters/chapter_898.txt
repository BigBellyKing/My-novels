Chapter 897: A Four-Person Gang, and I'm the Only Junior Member?

He had just gotten off the plane, and already officers from Lost City had approached him, secretly threatening him to work for them?

This was just too damn dark!

After a brief complaint, Zhang Yi shifted his attention to the game's map.

He had played many open-world games. There were all sorts of themes, but modern city ones were few. After all, compared to other types of games, this kind of modern city-style open-world game was very difficult to make. Just in terms of assets, ordinary game developers couldn't handle it.

The game's setting was still in the 90s, so the buildings in the streets and alleys still had a strong sense of the era. Of course, what Zhang Yi found most interesting was the bicycle.

“This little bicycle is quite interesting!” Zhang Yi exclaimed, controlling Carl as he rode the bike, a surprised look on his face. Its speed wasn't slow, but it certainly wasn't as fast as a car. But the most important thing was that this little bicycle could perform all sorts of acrobatic stunts. Lifting the front wheel, standing on the back wheel, or jumping – performing these stunts in the game often resulted in a spectacular fall.

Soon, Carl, controlled by Zhang Yi, arrived at the mission objective. Parking the bicycle at the door, Carl pushed it open and entered the house. He looked around; it wasn't a luxurious place. There was a bulky old TV, a sofa with a coffee table, a game console on the floor, and a photo frame.

‘Stop! What are you doing? Carl, Brian, stop!’

‘Stop it, Mom will hear!’

‘Mom, they want to do bad things!’

With a mournful expression, Carl placed the photo frame on the table, recalling events from his early days with his family. Just then, a middle-aged, bearded man, wearing green clothes and pants with a green hat, walked out of the kitchen. Holding a baseball bat, he shouted ferociously, “You got the wrong house, kid!”

Seeing the bearded man charge forward, ready to hit him with a baseball bat, Carl quickly got up, stepped back, and nervously called out, “Big Smoke! It’s me, Carl! Calm down, calm down!”

“CJ? Man! What are you doing here? Hey, bro, you alright?”

It was then that the bearded man, known as Big Smoke, recognized Carl. The two had been childhood friends, and their reunion was joyous, dispersing the sadness in Carl’s heart.

Then, Big Smoke led Carl to the graveyard, and through their simple conversation, Zhang Yi learned about the game’s background. Carl was born in this African-American community in Lost City. His father passed away when he was young, and he grew up under the care of his mother and older brother, with a younger brother and sister. His older brother, Sweet, was the leader of Grove Street. The gang members were all native residents, marked by green, wearing green clothes and pants, and green hats. Their sworn enemies were the Ballas gang from the neighboring community, who wore purple clothes. The two gangs constantly engaged in shootouts, living a life of bullets and explosions. However, when Carl was 19, his younger brother died in a gang conflict, which deeply affected him. He decided to temporarily leave the streets and went to Liberty City. Only now, because of his mother’s murder, had he returned.

But the community was now much worse than when Carl left. The Ballas gang from the neighboring community had gradually grown stronger by selling drugs, while Carl’s brother’s gang, refusing to deal in drugs, had become the weakest among all the communities, with negligible influence. Members had either defected to the enemy and become traitors, or they had become junkies. Now, only two trusted bearded men remained by Sweet’s side: Big Smoke, and Ryder, who constantly wore dark sunglasses and smoked. Including the newly returned Carl, there were only four people in total.

“What a miserable start to the game!” Zhang Yi muttered, riding the bicycle and following Carl’s brother, Sweet, and Big Smoke, as they traversed the streets and alleys of Lost City. Suddenly, gunshots rang out from behind, bullets hitting the ground nearby with a harsh sound. Turning around, they saw a car in hot pursuit. Two gang members, one in front and one behind, fired submachine guns at Carl and his companions from the open car windows.

Wearing green clothes and green hats was their gang’s identifier, so that was understandable. After all, it seemed they hadn't forced him, and he still kept his white shirt look. But your gang is in such a pathetic state, aren't they? Including him, newly returned, there were only four of them. And at the funeral, the rival gang came and opened fire madly, and they didn't even have weapons to fight back? Of course, if it was just that, he could still endure it. But damn it, they're driving cars, and you're riding bicycles?

“With this kind of treatment, why are you even in a gang? Working at an electronics factory would pay better than this!” After riding the bike through streets and alleys, finally shaking off the pursuers, Zhang Yi couldn't help but complain.

However, in terms of game content, it still gave Zhang Yi a pleasant surprise. The game’s mode reminded him of an open-world game by Nebula Games a few years ago, called *Red Dead Redemption*. Because there was a common feature in the game: once entering the main mission mode, it became a forced linear progression. When not on a mission, players could freely explore the game world and do anything they wanted. However, Zhang Yi didn't immediately go exploring but continued to honestly follow the main storyline.

The subsequent plot was pretty much the struggle of a young, grassroots African-American man for his gang's rise. After going with Ryder — who, with his dark sunglasses, clearly looked like a show-off — to get a haircut, then buying and eating a pizza, killing a pizza shop employee to get a shotgun, and then hiding from a police pursuit, Zhang Yi met his brother again and received his first important mission for the gang's rise.

“???????? You two are playing basketball here, and you want me to do the work? A four-person gang, and I’m the only junior member? You’re all leaders?”

Watching Sweet hand him the spray paint, telling him to spray their gang's tags back on their turf, Zhang Yi was deeply puzzled. A gang of four people in total, and the other three are all leaders, so he has to do all the dirty and tiring work himself? Previous games at least pretended, saying 'I'm the great hero,' but now they're just laying it all out? Zhang Yi muttered inwardly, looking at the spray paint in his hand.

As the mission progressed, Zhang Yi quickly experienced some of the game's characteristics. First, the NPC behavior in the game was very realistic; each person had their own details and lives, but their intelligence was a bit naive. However, he didn't find this design strange or bad. Because the difficulty was lower, and it was especially satisfying to play.

Especially when driving, he initially thought about obeying traffic rules and stopping at red lights. But he quickly discarded that idea. How could playing with restrictions be as satisfying as playing without any? He drove recklessly through the streets. If the car broke down, he'd just steal another. The only thing he needed to watch out for was getting wanted. And unlike the bounty system in *Red Dead Redemption*, in *Vice City (Game)*, as long as you evaded the pursuit, even if you strolled right in front of an officer, they wouldn't pay you any mind. Unless you intentionally got right in their face.

Furthermore, the game's missions were scattered throughout the city. Although the current storyline involved accepting missions, the mission locations were quite far apart. When racing or driving to a destination, the player wouldn't go alone but would have a companion, chatting along the way to fill the boring travel time. The dialogues, meanwhile, revealed the game's background and related life experiences, and the lines were quite interesting. Except they used colorful language, swearing a lot. They'd frequently insult each other's families. Beyond that, there was one most direct feeling: the lives of people overseas were truly filled with hardship! Especially when Carl helped Sweet try to recruit old gang members, only to find them all ruined by drugs. When they eventually stormed the drug dealer's hideout and saw the chaotic lives there, it filled Zhang Yi with immense emotion.

Indeed, home is truly better!

But putting all that aside, Zhang Yi had to admit that with *Vice City (Game)*, Nebula Games had truly let loose. He had only experienced a little over an hour of content so far, but it already involved street gangs, shootings, and a whole series of other elements. Combined with *Vice City (Game)*'s modern setting, there wasn't much blood and gore, yet it delivered an indescribable sense of excitement.
