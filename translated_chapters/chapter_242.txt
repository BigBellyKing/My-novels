Chapter 241: Nobody Stop Me From Becoming an Azure Star! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

With Chen Xu's official Weibo post, many Souls series masochistic players who were still hoping to experience the long-lost dancing on a knife's edge and hardship in *Monster Hunter: World* felt a pang of regret.

However, most players were more interested in the content revealed in Chen Xu's reply.

A pure cooperative hunting game, not a Souls-like game, and it also features equipment collection and enhancement gameplay.

Many players were momentarily taken aback.

Because the few simple sentences in the official Weibo post revealed too much information. In the Parallel World, co-op games were not a rare genre. However, pure co-op games were relatively uncommon. Most adopted a setting where competitive and co-op gameplay coexisted. After all, with pure co-op, all content must revolve around map levels and BOSS design. When it comes to player-versus-player content, it's simpler in terms of content creation and can also better maintain a player's in-game playtime. Therefore, pure co-op games were quite rare. As for hunting games, although there were a few good series, they were also very rare, typically releasing only one title every two or three years. This was because it was difficult to establish a core gameplay loop. Even some games originally focused on hunting either underwent reskinning or an overhaul. More often, hunting was integrated into FPS and ARPGs as a system setting for supplementary mini-games. To make it a stand-alone genre was truly uncommon. If there was any difference, it was that Chen Xu's *Monster Hunter: World* this time turned the hunting targets into dragons.

Similarly, countless attentive players were also discussing *Monster Hunter: World* being a hunting-themed game.

"Hunting games, thinking about it, there really aren't many fun ones, are there? The hunting games I used to play were incredibly boring."

"Exactly, it felt like a Running Simulator."

"+1! In the early stages, you'd track the prey, find it, *bang* with a shot, and the prey would just die."

"By the way, I wonder what the gameplay for this game will be like! With the ratio of the character to the dragon, will it end up being monsters dominating us?"

"Probably not, didn't Mr. Chen say so? It won't be a Souls-like game, and it has grinding elements. It might just be an exhilarating action hunting game."

"When you put it that way, it's not impossible! Why did Mr. Chen give a hint on the official Weibo? Wasn't it to prevent players who thought it was a Dark Souls-like game from buying it and then feeling disappointed when they found it wasn't what they expected?"

"If it really is a grind-heavy game, then my only hope is that the dragons in this game will be tough to beat. Some previous hunting games just weren't satisfying enough."

As players enthusiastically discussed, and with the development of *Monster Hunter: World* progressing.

Chen Xu also successively revealed more content on the official Weibo and website.

Over a dozen usable weapons, each offering a different experience. Clearly, there was no so-called Class Divisions in this game; all players shared a single identity: Hunter. And what weapon to use was entirely up to the players themselves. One weapon was equivalent to one class; if you got tired of it, you could simply switch to another weapon. In addition, the game's environments – Ancient Forest, Wildspire Waste, Coral Highlands, Rotten Vale, Elder's Recess – were gradually unveiled to players. They were truly magnificent and beautiful.

Furthermore, there was relevant game background, such as simple introductions and explanations of the Hunter's Guild and the Azure Star.

Combined with these Scene Concept Art pieces and the gameplay Chen Xu mentioned earlier, a general outline had already formed in the minds of all players.

Players would take on the role of a Hunter in a lifelike world, embarking on adventurous hunts. The hunting targets were powerful dragon-like creatures, and eventually, players would, through repeated hunts, become a Miracle Legend in the hunter community, guiding the way for future Hunters as the legendary Azure Star.

Simply perfect!

Using various weapons to hunt different dragon species, and collecting corresponding materials to craft equipment. Ultimately becoming the great Azure Star.

And with the release of this information, countless players became increasingly excited.

I'm going to be a Hunter!

I'm going to hunt Elder Dragons!

Nobody stop me from becoming an Azure Star!

Especially from the promotional materials, it seemed the game would apply the latest AI technology.

It would showcase a vivid ecological chain within the game.

Although it's still unclear what this so-called AI technology and the game itself are all about.

There's no doubt that the grand promises made, even through the screen, smelled delicious.

This was also thanks to Nebula Games, as every game released so far had given players great surprises. Although sometimes the 'surprise' component was a bit too much, one thing was undeniable: they were all high-quality masterpieces.

So this time, there was no reason for players not to look forward to *Monster Hunter: World*.

Of course, during this period, many players remained less optimistic.

After all, from a size perspective, such massive dragons paired with tiny Hunters always gave players some unsettling thoughts.

"By the way, why do you all think this is an easy game? What if it's a hardcore game like Dark Souls?"

"Oh, how could that be? Mr. Chen has already explicitly stated that this isn't a Souls-like game, and it has grinding elements. Even if it's difficult, how difficult could it be?"

"Exactly! Although Mr. Chen has always misled us, saying that *The one with the big hammer* is a very philosophical game, and while talking about the 'Warrior of Love' he simultaneously created *Outlast* and *Silent Hill PT*, since Mr. Chen said on the official Weibo that it's not a Souls-like game, then *Monster Hunter: World* definitely cannot be a Souls-like game!"

"And based on the content revealed so far, we are organized people! I think we should also be able to recruit NPC Hunter teammates to collectively hunt monsters!"

"Yeah! Just thinking about it is exciting, and there's an online multiplayer function, up to 4 people hunting together. Any game with multiplayer usually isn't too difficult, and even if it is, so what? Can it be harder than Dark Souls? Eighth playthrough Dark Souls player reporting for duty!"

"Bro upstairs, while what you said is very passionate, and I really don't want to expose your bragging, can we please turn off the Nebula Games Platform verification? A total of 8 hours of playtime across two Dark Souls games, and you're already on your eighth playthrough?"

Regarding the various online promotions for *Monster Hunter: World*, players entered into heated discussions.

Basically, most players expressed great anticipation.

Even though there hadn't been any particularly fun hunting games before this.

But this was a Nebula Games production. Over the past few years, although Chen Xu had inexplicably accumulated many memes.

However, the reputation of 'Nebula's products are always high-quality' was increasingly trusted by players.

Furthermore, *Monster Hunter: World* itself was completely different from ordinary hunting games.

After all, typical hunting games were just about hunting lions and tigers or similar animals.

But *Monster Hunter: World*, although it had only shown one monster called Nergigante so far.

But from the oppressive feeling conveyed in the Concept Design Art, many players were already eager to battle it out for three hundred rounds.

Not to mention the magnificent and beautiful map environments like Ancient Forest and Coral Highlands.
