Chapter 644: Can't Understand It? They Must Be Swearing at Me! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

In World of Warcraft, the Alliance and the Horde are naturally at odds.

Every player knows this. Early on, in Warcraft, this irreconcilable image was already established.

The conflict between Orcs and Humans persisted from beginning to end. Although there were those in the Human faction who longed for peace, and those in the Orc faction who also yearned for it, this hatred could only change with the appearance of a common enemy. But when there was no common enemy, they would surely try to bash each other's brains out.

This was already foreshadowed in the promotional videos released before World of Warcraft went online, and in the opening cinematic cutscenes.

In the face of the Burning Legion's invasion, the Horde and Alliance once briefly united. However, after the crisis passed, their fragile agreement dissolved, and they naturally returned to being adversaries.

It wasn't just the game's lore; the in-game settings also reflected this, including neutral and contested zones, enemy territories, and the fact that all NPC and player names of the opposing faction appeared as red. Simply put, even common mobs, from their background to their mechanics, completely showcased this irreconcilable tendency.

However, when the game first launched, players would spawn at their respective racial starting points and proceed through quests to various dungeons. The Horde and Alliance players had no contact with each other, and given World of Warcraft's massive map, many players reached level 30 without even seeing a glimpse of the opposing faction.

Channel chat in each area mostly consisted of calls for 'Mages' or 'Healers' for dungeons, or 'Warriors with shields' who could tank. The only discordant notes were complaints about certain players being 'big scammers' or 'shady merchants,' or warnings not to run dungeons with someone who 'ninja-looted' gear.

But when they reached certain neutral zones, maps where both Alliance and Horde had quests, things became entirely different. They were adversarial; all opposing names were red. Moreover, some resources on a single map were limited. Since Alliance and Horde players couldn't communicate, many players immediately started brawling.

In this version, Chen Xu had also added a corresponding honor system. Furthermore, there were no losses upon PvP death; even equipment durability wouldn't drop. With opposing factions, the PvP aspect was obvious, directly amplifying players' competitive spirit.

………………

Southshore. Song Ren, Zhang Yi, their guild, and a group of players who joined them along the way, aggressively arrived at the Yeti Cave. Upon reaching the location, the hunter who had been corpse-camped immediately resurrected.

The five Horde players on the other side were stunned at the sight of such a massive crowd.

“￥%@￥@#￥@”

“！@#￥！#￥！”

The Tauren Warrior leading them spewed a torrent of incomprehensible words.

“Brothers! Get them! They’re so damn arrogant! They killed our Alliance members, and now they’re still swearing at us! Take down this Tauren first!” Song Ren roared.

Then, he charged in headfirst, followed by a barrage of skills raining down on the five opponents.

Compared to outdoor PvP in the previous life's World of Warcraft, Chen Xu had made some subtle adjustments. The emphasis was more on player skill. While level and gear disparity still existed, it wasn't as exaggerated as before. If a player was skilled enough, a low-level character facing a high-level one could still deal significant damage, and by utilizing terrain, skills, class differences, and items, it wasn't impossible for the weak to triumph over the strong.

But now, these five Horde players were facing thirty to forty people. They wouldn't even last if everyone just used a basic attack, let alone skills!

The five instantly fell to the ground. Believing they would also be corpse-camped, they chose to 'spiritually resurrect,' their original bodies turning into piles of dry bones.

“Let these Horde guys show off! Still daring to mouth off and make threats!” Song Ren snorted.

“Old Song, you understood that?” Zhang Yi looked bewildered.

Other guild members and Alliance players who had joined along the way were also surprised. In the game, Alliance and Horde couldn't communicate; both voice and text were garbled and incomprehensible. Could it be that this warrior named ‘Brave Tough Guy’ had deciphered it?

“Even if I didn’t understand, I could feel they were definitely swearing at me!” Song Ren declared confidently.

It’s well known that when people encounter language they don't understand, they often feel like the other party is swearing at them, especially when they are adversaries.

It's like playing Dou Dizhu: you lose, and the opponent sends a message like 'Your cards were played exceptionally well,' or 'Good game.' Literally, there's nothing wrong with these messages, but they still carry a hint of mockery.

Listening to Song Ren’s explanation, Zhang Yi and the other players were speechless.

‘Bro, is there still room in your guild? Can we join?’

‘Haha, that was thrilling!’

‘Daring to mess with our Alliance is like going to the toilet with a lantern – looking for trouble!’

‘Those who offend our Alliance shall die!’

‘Kill the Horde! Long live the Alliance!’

Some players who had gathered midway chatted with Song Ren and his group. Though strangers, this extensive PvP encounter left everyone feeling incredibly happy.

It was simply too satisfying.

However, just as Song Ren and his group were excited, similar events were unfolding in the Horde faction.

As a game that allowed PvP, if some in the Horde were troublemakers, then naturally, some Alliance players would also cause trouble. Many Horde players had also been defeated by Alliance members.

Groups of Alliance and Horde players, traveling on the same roads, were bound to encounter isolated individuals. What to do when you encounter a lone player? If you can take them down, you do it!

And what about those who were defeated?

They definitely called upon friends, as this was an MMORPG. Even without friends, a shout in the general map channel would attract many enthusiastic players willing to help.

Of course, this was mainly because World of Warcraft had only recently launched, and many players felt a strong sense of immersion and engagement.

And as more and more players came to the Hillsbrad Foothills, the battlefield slowly began to expand.

Alliance chat channel:

‘Any brothers? The Horde are here again!’

‘This is too much!’

‘Can’t stand it. So what if they have more people? Who can't call for backup?’

‘Brothers, gather at Menethil Harbor!’

The Alliance was outraged, and the Horde was not to be outdone.

In the Horde chat channel:

‘As expected, the Alliance has no good people. Outnumbering us is not what so-called heroes do!’

‘Level 20-30 brothers, come to Tarren Mill quickly! The Alliance is literally peeing on the Horde’s heads!’

‘Smash the damn Alliance!’

‘Come to Tarren Mill quickly, there are so many quests!’

‘Exactly, this dungeon is in our Horde territory, it belongs to us! Why can the Alliance come and farm it?’

With both Horde and Alliance players calling upon their friends, more and more players gathered in this area.

Some were there to avenge their friends.

Others were simply there to watch the excitement.

And so, the grand battle between the Alliance and the Horde officially began.

Both the Alliance and the Horde believed themselves to be the victims. They felt incredibly wronged, as if the opposing faction (Horde/Alliance) was simply too aggressive and went too far!
