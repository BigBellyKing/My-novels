Chapter 370: Of Course, I Chose To Forgive Her (Please Subscribe for Monthly Passes)

All players were immersed in the world of Red Dead Redemption.

Because there was simply too much to experience in the game.

In the game, players could choose to be a good person, doing good deeds.

They could also be a masked outlaw, committing crimes.

If they committed too many evil acts, their Honor would decrease.

When their Honor was very low, players would find that NPCs in places like taverns would look at them with fear.

Some shops would even refuse to sell items to them.

This included city lawmen and some bounty hunters, who would all be hostile towards them.

When interacting with NPCs, they wouldn't have a good attitude either.

Conversely, if players did good deeds, other NPCs would be very willing to interact with them.

Items sold in shops would be discounted, and some NPCs might even give players gifts.

In addition, the game contained a considerable amount of detailed content.

For instance, if players ate too much, they would find their weight slowly increasing.

The originally robust and handsome middle-aged Arthur would gradually transform into a greasy, chubby middle-aged man.

At the same time, players also needed to pay attention to their hygiene, such as taking a bath occasionally.

Otherwise, long-term neglect of bathing would attract flies, and NPCs would even keep their distance.

It could be said that in Red Dead Redemption, every player felt as if it wasn't a virtual world, but a vivid and lifelike Wild West.

Many players, after first experiencing the free open-world gameplay of Red Dead Redemption, treated it as a purely enjoyable game.

Because it was simply too free.

And this was a major characteristic of players' experience with open-world games.

However, as the main story missions were triggered, players quickly felt its deeper charm.

It was a completely different feeling from freely experiencing the Wild West, more profound and deeper.

The Wild West in Red Dead Redemption was not at its peak, but rather at its twilight.

By the late 19th century, the West had been fully developed, and traditional wild west culture was on the verge of being phased out by the times.

To describe it in one sentence: the wheels of history were rolling relentlessly forward.

And the Van der Linde gang, Arthur Morgan, and others were part of this historical current.

From their stories and experiences, one could clearly feel the charm of that particular era.

The lifestyle of robbing the rich to help the poor, taking responsibility for one's actions, and seeking swift revenge was slowly disappearing from the Wild West.

In its place came an increasingly powerful state apparatus and vast commercial capital.

………………

In the game, Old Dai experienced the content of Red Dead Redemption, forgetting food and sleep.

Having temporarily settled at Horseshoe Overlook, the gang members also began scrambling to make money.

For instance, Karen, the blonde bombshell, tried a honey trap and almost got herself into trouble, but luckily Arthur arrived in time.

As gang members, although the Van der Linde gang seemed to have higher ideals compared to typical gangs.

This couldn't hide the fact that they were a bunch of old outlaws. However, some gang members' money-making methods were truly unsavory, making Arthur and the others uncomfortable.

For example, Strauss, the gang's bookkeeper, often went around lending money at exorbitant interest, profiting from the despair of the weak.

In Arthur's heart, he would rather rob unrighteous wealthy individuals than bully these impoverished borrowers.

Using the civilized weapon ‘law’ to then plunder the poor again clearly made Arthur very uncomfortable.

Accounts of shameless scoundrels were one thing, but more often, they were desperate poor people.

“This is too tragic!” In a farm, Old Dai controlled Arthur as he severely beat a farmer named Thomas Downes.

The man appeared impoverished and even sickly; when Arthur beat and threatened him for money, he coughed up blood that splattered all over Arthur's face.

Like Arthur in the game, Old Dai couldn't help but sigh with emotion.

But upon returning to camp, the conversation between Strauss and Arthur left Old Dai speechless once more.

‘Did you get the money back, Arthur?’

‘He's dying... they look absolutely destitute. You're a fool to lend them money.’

‘Let me put it this way, Arthur. Those who aren't desperate beyond hope won't be interested in my proposals.’

They spent a peaceful period at Horseshoe Overlook, but this tranquility was soon broken.

One morning, Lenny, the young black man in the gang, stumbled back into camp in a panic, shouting that Micah had been captured.

Before this, Dutch had dispatched Dutch and Lenny to scout the path south, preparing for their upcoming journey. But a few days later, Micah got drunk in a place called Strawberry Town, clashed with O'Driscolls, killed two people right on the street, and was captured by the town's lawmen, awaiting hanging. Lenny, who was with him, barely escaped being caught and managed to flee back.

Upon hearing this news, Arthur exclaimed that Micah deserved it, and Old Dai, playing the game, shared the same sentiment.

“That old scoundrel Micah is going to be hanged? That's good news!” Old Dai seemed very happy.

Because Old Dai could honestly say he didn't like Micah's character one bit.

After all, he acted like an old scoundrel towards the widow Sadie, and then was constantly sarcastic and annoying in the temporary snow mountain camp.

However, Dutch, as the gang leader, still sent Arthur to rescue Micah, and told him to take Lenny to Valentine for a drink to calm his nerves.

Old Dai absolutely loved this drinking scene. Apart from the slightly shaky visuals to convey drunkenness, it was incredibly fun.

Lenny and Arthur played a game of slapping each other's ears, and then there were the indescribable scenes of them repeatedly pushing open bedroom doors on the second floor – one white, one black – which were quite exciting, though unfortunately, not much was revealed.

After a night of heavy drinking in Valentine, the next day Old Dai controlled Arthur to rescue Micah.

He blew a large hole in the police station's basement, allowing Micah to escape.

Arthur's original intention was to rescue him quietly and then leave, but Micah showed his crazy and bloodthirsty side, not caring about escalating the situation. He directly faced the town's full firepower, 'blood-bathed' Strawberry Town from east to west, reclaimed his beloved old gun from an old acquaintance, and even killed the entire family.

Compared to previous missions, Micah's mission was full of explosions and gunfights.

It was indeed very fun to play, especially the chaotic battle in Strawberry, which was incredibly thrilling.

But equally, Old Dai really disliked Micah's character.

After all, no matter how you looked at it, this guy was like a madman.

And during his time helping the Van der Linde gang, there were also various interesting side missions interspersed.

For example, going hunting for a large brown bear with Hosea gave Old Dai a brand new experience.

He had hunted before, but it was mostly rabbits, deer, or birds.

But he never expected that this game could even let you hunt brown bears. Would there be tigers, lions, or jaguars later on?

Old Dai pondered inwardly.

After Micah's bloody mission line, the game's plot became slightly more relaxed.

Hunting, fishing, and occasionally robbing big landowners with gang members.

Until Arthur received a letter; it was from Mary, the woman in the photograph by his bedside.

She was Arthur's first love, but due to Arthur's outlaw status and Mary's family, the relationship eventually ended. Now Mary had settled near Valentine, recognized members of the Van der Linde gang, and entrusted someone to deliver a letter to Arthur.

Reason told Arthur not to go, but he couldn't resist rushing there. Once they talked, Arthur learned Mary's current situation: her husband had long since passed away, and she was now a widow.

Her younger brother had joined an evil cult, and now she had no one to rely on, so she could only ask Arthur for help to rescue her brother from the cult.

“Ugh! What kind of missions are these? All widows?” Old Dai, playing the game, couldn't help but sigh.

Especially recalling Sadie from before, and now looking at Mary, Old Dai suddenly felt that his Arthur had a bit of 'tool-man' potential.

Right away, she asks for help.

And Arthur, aren't you an outlaw? Why do you have such a rich romantic history?

Thinking about how he was still a single man, Old Dai couldn't help but sigh.

What could he do now? Of course, he chose to forgive her.

With a sigh, Old Dai decided to take on the mission.
