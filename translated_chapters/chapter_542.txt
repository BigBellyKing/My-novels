### Chapter 541: Let Go! Let Go of Me! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

“Let’s go, we’re off!” Zhang Yi and his group excitedly headed forward.

Song Ren, on the other hand, picked up a yellow brick from the ground.

“Everyone, let me handle this! I’ll use this brick to smash open the gate’s lock!”

As a member of the team, Song Ren spoke up to make his presence known.

As a clever and quick-witted man who had found over 500 Power Moons in *Super Mario Odyssey* and over 700 Korok Seeds in Hyrule, Song Ren instantly saw through the puzzle-solving nature of this game.

There was a large gate not far ahead, and at the starting point, there was a brick-like item. Was there any need to overthink the meaning of this?

“Old Song? What are you talking about?” Zhang Yi, who was walking first, turned around and looked speechless at Song Ren, who was holding a brick and wobbling towards him. Then, with a gentle push, the gate in front of them opened.

Looking at the open gate, then at the brick in his hand, Song Ren was dumbfounded: “This is illogical!”

If the gate could be opened with just a push, why put such an obvious brick at the entrance? Wasn’t that just taking off your pants to fart?

“Old Song, I think with your IQ, you should probably say goodbye to puzzle games. Just follow me,” Zhang Yi sighed.

In the team’s voice channel, Wang Han and the other two also burst into joyful laughter.

“Nonsense! Get out of my way!” Song Ren threw the brick aside and rushed towards the gate.

“Damn it, Old Song, don’t push! How can a spectator like you walk first?” Seeing Song Ren charging towards the gate, Zhang Yi also quickly started to move.

Wang Han and the others next to him were not to be outdone, all wanting to be the first to pass through the gate.

This door wasn't very wide, only enough for about one and a half people. Coupled with the game’s hands, which seemed to be coated with super glue, the scene instantly turned chaotic.

All five people instantly became stuck together at the doorway. No one knew whose hand grabbed whose head, or whose hand grabbed whose belly. Ten hands intertwined, and the five of them were jammed at the entrance, unable to move. It was like your tangled headphones, controller, keyboard, and charging cables.

“Hey, hey, hey, hey! Who’s grabbing my head? Let go! Let go!”

“Whose hand is this! Don’t pull my head! You’ll pull it off!”

“Stop pulling! Stop pulling!”

“I’ve let go, whose hand is still pulling!”

“Haha, whose hand is this? Can you please not grab the door with one hand and my waistband with the other!”

For a moment, the scene was utterly chaotic. The five people were like conjoined twins, standing at the doorway, grabbing each other and completely unable to squeeze through.

The five of them stood at the entrance, harming each other for a good while, before finally reaching an agreement, letting go of each other’s hands, and emerging from the door one by one.

Of course, as agreed, no one was allowed to run around after leaving the door. They were a whole, a team, a team!

Just like when they played *Rainbow Six Siege*, if five people were to die, they would die together, then collectively watch the monitors, appreciating the spectacular performance of the last random player on their team. Now, playing such PVE mini-games, they also needed to be united!

“Excellent! Come on everyone, let’s hold hands and connect our hearts, and together we’ll advance towards the finish line.” Passing through the gate, Zhang Yi, standing in the middle, raised his arms and grabbed the two people on his left and right.

Then, the two people he grabbed also grabbed the outermost two people.

In a horizontal line formation, the five of them wobbled forward.

The sight of the five swaying figures looked as if they had all drunk fake alcohol and just stumbled out of a hotel. It was impossible not to laugh just by looking at them.

“Haha! They look like five big idiots!” In the voice channel, Joey, who was on the outermost side, couldn’t help but exclaim.

“Who talks about themselves like that!” Wang Yifan interjected in the voice channel.

Even though they did look a bit like that, they shouldn't insult themselves!

Several people walked forward, laughing and chatting.

The first level was a scene resembling a sky garden, not difficult at all, at most a new player tutorial level. But sometimes, the difficulty often comes not from enemies, but from your own teammates.

For example, now.

Reaching out and pressing the mechanism for the first door, the five people walked out one after another, then lined up neatly and walked forward.

Although this level was called ‘Mansion’, the entire game scene was floating in the air, which meant there were no walls around, and no invisible walls either.

Thus, an accident suddenly occurred when they were passing through a corner corridor.

The little characters in the game walked a bit unsteadily, just like real drunkards. Joey, who was on the outermost side, accidentally missed a step while turning and fell straight down.

At the same time, Song Ren, who was next to her, was dragged halfway down, and Zhang Yi, standing in the middle, was startled by this scene.

He instinctively let go of Song Ren’s hand. However, Song Ren was quick-witted; he grabbed Joey’s hand with one hand, and just as he was about to fall, he clung to the wall with the other.

“Holy cow! Old Zhang, why did you let go? Hurry up and pull me up, quickly! I’m going to fall!” Song Ren gripped the wall tightly, but Joey, whom he was holding, had nowhere to grab. She could only cling tightly to Song Ren’s arms with both hands.

Furthermore, because she was suspended in mid-air, she swung back and forth like a swing.

If this were in reality, Song Ren believed he would have already fallen. But in the game, these super glue hands were incredibly strong; as long as he didn’t let go, he seemed like he would never fall, though he couldn’t climb up either.

“Hahahahaha… that pose, I can’t! Haha!” Looking at Song Ren, who was half-lying on the ground and half-hanging outside, Zhang Yi in the game felt his stomach ache from laughing.

“Stop laughing, quickly pull me up!” Song Ren urged.

“Alright, don’t rush! I’ll pull you up right now.” Zhang Yi, still laughing, reached out and grabbed Song Ren’s head. Wang Han and Wang Yifan also came over, grabbing Zhang Yi’s back and pulling backward.

“Don’t pull my head, are you pulling up a radish!? It’s going to break! Break!” Song Ren yelled loudly.

Just like pulling up a radish, Zhang Yi forcibly dragged Song Ren up by his head, slowly pulling him onto the ground.

After some twists and turns, the brothers finally regrouped.

“This game is simply too ridiculous!” Back on solid ground, recalling the scene of being 'pulled like a radish,' Song Ren couldn't help but exclaim.
