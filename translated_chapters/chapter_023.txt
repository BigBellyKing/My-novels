Chapter 23: Undertale's Multiple Endings

In reality, even setting aside its META elements, the story of *Undertale* itself is already quite excellent.

The game is filled with many interesting and charming characters.

For example, Sans, who shakes hands with the protagonist holding a whoopee cushion, and Papyrus, who is keen on blocking the protagonist with puzzles.

Sans, who appears very lazy, loves to tell skeleton-related puns to tease his brother Papyrus.

His brother Papyrus, on the other hand, is very enthusiastic about blocking the protagonist with puzzle mechanisms, yet he actively reveals the answers to the puzzles when the protagonist doesn't take the initiative or can't solve them.

A scientist like an otaku girl.

What shocked players was Sans's speech in the golden, magnificent corridor just before the final BOSS battle in the game.

Here, Sans begins to judge everything the player has done.

From Sans's words, players learn that EXP isn't "experience points" as commonly understood, but rather "execution points".

And LV isn't what players understand it to be, nor is it simply "LOVE", but rather an abbreviation for "Level of Violence".

Every time a player kills a monster, execution points increase, and with the rise in execution points, the Level of Violence also increases.

It's not experience points, and it's not a character level; it's the game's violence index.

This is where *Undertale* subverts traditional RPG settings.

Killing monsters to level up should be a given for most RPG players.

But it's different in *Undertale*.

Most players who experience the game for the first time will get the first Neutral Route, and upon encountering Flowey, they will be shocked by its content.

However, if players choose not to kill Flowey at the end of the Neutral Route, they will learn the method to achieve the Pacifist Ending from it.

In the Pacifist Ending, players must not kill any monsters, but instead befriend each one through dialogue.

During this ending, players will discover that these monsters each have their own unique characteristics.

Monsters that appear menacing often have a cute side; for example, Undyne is a textbook tsundere!

"Listen, human. We're not just going to be friends.

We're going to be best friends.

I'm going to make you obsessed with me.

This is my perfect revenge!"

Under Papyrus's 'goading', the legendary captain of the Royal Guard thus accepted the protagonist as a friend.

She even performed a cooking lesson for them, even though the cooking lesson burned down her house.

The two skeleton brothers (Sans and Papyrus), Toriel, Undyne...

Especially when finally facing the ultimate BOSS, King Asgore, and Toriel's son, Asriel, it brought countless players to tears.

In this battle,

When you die, it doesn't show "Game Over."

Instead, a line of text appears: Your DETERMINATION refused.

Finally, with the help of the DETERMINATION of countless friends, the player eventually defeated Asriel.

At the same time, they learned some of the game's backstory from Asriel.

A long, long time ago, a human child fell into the Underground, was coincidentally rescued by Asriel, and then taken in by King Asgore and Toriel.

They became the best of friends, but then, for some reason, he lost this friend.

So Asriel absorbed the soul of the first child, transformed into an incredibly powerful being, and gained the power to pass through the barrier. Asriel left the Underground and went to the surface to fulfill his friend's dying wish.

But he was mistakenly attacked by humans who thought he had killed the first child. Finally, a wounded Asriel stumbled back home, then collapsed to the ground, turning into dust that scattered throughout the garden.

His DETERMINATION then flowed into a golden flower—this is the origin of Flowey.

In this final battle, Asriel finally found liberation and relief, letting go of the pain he had clung to.

Both the Neutral and Pacifist Endings had been achieved.

It seemed players should have been satisfied with this, but curiosity is human nature.

The violence points, execution points, and Flowey's evil side all seemed to drive players to explore another ending.

And in this ending, players truly felt an indescribable shock, as well as a spiritual contemplation.

………………

Sitting in front of his computer, Jiang Ping's expression was very serious at this moment.

'3 remaining in current area'

A prompt appeared on the monitor.

In the Underground world's scenario, the monsters had been slaughtered. In this area, only three monsters yet to be found remained.

The map was empty, and the once lively tavern was now deathly silent.

At this moment, Jiang Ping felt an ineffable sensation.

Because of the Gentleman's Game *Mirror*, he was also very curious about Chen Xu's new work, *Undertale*.

His initial disdain upon entering the game, and the shock he felt upon completing it.

After achieving the Neutral and Pacifist Endings, he became curious about the so-called Genocide Ending.

But now, he felt a bit of regret.

In the previous game, monsters who were his friends died one by one by his hand, simply to fulfill the conditions of the game's plot.

Including Papyrus, this skeleton who was like a little angel, who even in his dying moments still believed he could turn over a new leaf.

"What a good excuse? You must understand better than anyone how relieving this method is!"

"But at least we're better than those hypocrites who stand by and watch evil deeds, those poor souls who want a quick look but are too cowardly to do it themselves!"

The game's narration was full of irony.

But he still didn't stop.

All monsters were instantly killed with a single blow.

Until he encountered Undyne, the captain of the Royal Guard, again.

Next to a waterfall, Undyne appeared and blocked an attack for a small, bean-like monster.

As the captain of the Royal Guard, she had always protected the monsters of the Underground, but now she said she had disappointed them.

But just as she was about to die, an impassioned BGM started playing.

The fierce wind howled, accompanied by a flash of white light.

Undyne the Undying appeared.

"This hero reshaped herself through her 'DETERMINATION' to save the world."

Listening to the impassioned BGM titled "Battle Against a True Hero," Jiang Ping felt immense irony.

The game's monster was crowned with the title of hero.

Yet the protagonist he controlled was doing what monsters were supposed to do.

This was the most difficult battle he had fought in the game so far.

After much effort and difficulty in defeating Undyne, he continued forward, finally arriving at a familiar place.

The Throne Room antechamber was magnificent and golden, and a familiar figure was waiting just ahead.

Before this, Sans would judge the player's actions.

But now?

There was no more idle chatter.

It immediately entered the battle phase.

"It's a beautiful day outside.

Birds are singing, flowers are blooming...

On days like these, kids like you...

Should be burning in hell."

As the words fell, an attack like a surging tide swept over, instantly killing an unprepared Jiang Ping.

Constant effort, constant attempts.

Finally, just as he was about to defeat Sans.

Sans in the game seemed to have come up with a strategy: to never move on his turn.

But unfortunately, Sans still failed.

While Sans was resting, he quietly moved into attack position, ambushing and killing Sans.

Then Flowey appeared, but unlike Flowey in the Neutral Route, this time Flowey was filled with fear towards the protagonist, begging not to be killed.

The next moment, eight consecutive slashes cut it into pieces.

Everything seemed to be over, but at this moment, a person who bewildered Jiang Ping appeared.

Chara, the first human to fall into the Underground, was awakened from death.

Two choices appeared before him: to destroy this world, or not to destroy it.

Looking at the dead silence of darkness, and the eerie Chara.

Jiang Ping only felt an immense sense of oppression.

At first, he only wanted to know the plot of this ending.

Midway, he had regretted it, but he didn't stop.

And now, this feeling of regret was even stronger.

So he chose "no."

But the next moment, Chara's expression became sinister.

"You seem to have misunderstood something. When were you in control?"

As Chara's words appeared, a flash of a blade passed.

The game screen trembled, and a series of blood-red 9999 damage numbers filled the screen.

Immediately, the entire game automatically shut down.

Was this the ending of the Genocide Route?

Jiang Ping, sitting in front of his computer, took a deep breath, his lips pressed together.
