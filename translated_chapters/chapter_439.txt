Chapter 438: This DLC Plan is Already in Place? I Can't Outplay You, Mr. Chen! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Song Ren wasn't particularly surprised by the puzzles. Essentially, most games, be they action, FPS, or any other genre, use puzzles as a seasoning.

Why do game developers like to include them? The answer is simple: they can extend playtime. However, puzzles are a double-edged sword. If you do them poorly, players won't appreciate it and will leave negative reviews. If you do them well, players will give high ratings, but if they're too difficult, they might turn players away. After all, not all players are Sherlock Holmes.

It's like the puzzles in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. If you say they aren't hard, some shrine levels will certainly make players scratch their heads. But if you say they are hard, it's really just a matter of perspective. Moreover, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has a very clever point compared to typical puzzle games: most of the puzzle elements are linked to the various abilities players use. This means solving puzzles while playing, rather than pure puzzle-solving, and the game's guidance is also quite excellent.

Uncharted, on the other hand, leans towards more traditional puzzles. This involves combining mechanisms and clues for players to decipher. Thankfully, they aren't too difficult, and the game provides corresponding hints.

“So that's how it is!”

After circling the room for half a turn, as the 'Sleeping Dragon' of the 'Wolong and Fenghu' duo, for a moment he wanted to ping Zhang Yi and ask about his progress and how to solve the first puzzle. But he stopped that thought as soon as it came, figuring that his friend, the 'Young Phoenix,' was probably in the same boat as him. However, a subsequent system notification cleared the clouds and showed him the green mountains, a sudden realization.

Song Ren looked at the symbols on the wall, pressed the corresponding stone mechanism, opened a secret compartment in the prison cell, and retrieved a cross.

The subsequent development after the puzzle deeply delighted Song Ren.

That was the thrilling climbing and parkour segment.

However, this return was not via the same path, but through another route. And because the prison level was structured in a spiral upwards, returning involved rapidly descending using slide-like methods and performing aerial grappling hooks, making it even more thrilling than the way in. Especially in the middle of the prison cells, the wooden floors of the rooms collapsed several times, adding to the extreme danger and excitement.

Back inside the prison, although Nathan had found the cross, he didn't tell Bargas. Unfortunately, when Nathan, Sam, and another person named Rafe (who was mentioned earlier) reunited, they were surrounded by a group of prisoners.

After a brawl, Bargas, who had arrived, discovered the cross Nathan had hidden. Bargas, insatiably greedy for more profit, was directly stabbed to death by Rafe.

“I knew this guy wouldn't survive three episodes, but I didn't expect him to die before the first one even ended!”

“And you, Rafe, he was asking you for it, why didn't you just pretend to agree? Don't you understand the concept of feigning compliance? Now it's all screwed up!”

Watching Rafe stab the warden to death, Song Ren was instantly startled. This guy looked ruthless; would Rafe betray Nathan and Sam after they found the treasure?

What followed was a series of escape sequences. Facing a hail of bullets, it was incredibly exhilarating. At the same time, Song Ren's impression of Rafe instantly soured; he was 70% sure this guy would turn out to be someone like Micah.

Why? While climbing a ladder in the fire escape, this guy directly pushed Nathan aside and climbed first. Later, when Nathan fell into the prison, Sam, who could have escaped, jumped down to fight alongside Nathan, while Rafe just ran off on his own.

After a series of escapes, Sam was ultimately shot and fell inside the prison. Nathan and Rafe, however, successfully fled.

“No way? Sam died!?” Song Ren was instantly shocked. Mr. Chen used to deliver tragic plot twists in the middle or at the end, but now he's doing it at the beginning?

“Wait, no! Sam might not be dead!” But Song Ren quickly realized something. Being shot and falling into prison definitely felt like the end. But Song Ren remembered that during the previous sea sequence, Nathan and Sam were together, and they appeared significantly older than they were now. So, Sam probably didn't die, right?

After a series of tense and exciting events, Song Ren watched Nathan leap off a cliff into the sea, silently speculating about Sam's fate. As Nathan jumped into the sea, Song Ren's vision turned black, with only the gurgling sound of sea bubbles in his ears.

Accompanied by a soothing melody, a subtitle appeared: Fifteen Years Later.

Song Ren looked surprised; the timeline had suddenly jumped 15 years into the future? Nathan was now working for an underwater salvage company. After admiring the underwater scenery and salvaging a sunken truck, Nathan Drake returned to his attic at home.

“So, El Dorado, City of a Thousand Pillars, and Shambhala, these are stories from these fifteen years, which will be released as flashbacks or DLC later?” Song Ren explored the attic, finding several clues and making his own guesses.

Buddhist statues with three heads and six arms, golden skulls, Spanish silver coins, and a group photo of Nathan Drake with Sully and Elena Fisher. Clearly, these were Nathan Drake's past adventures, and now he had retired from the adventuring life. Yet, his brother Sam was nowhere to be seen. Had he truly died? It shouldn't be.

Driven by curiosity, Song Ren continued to explore, but apart from finding a toy gun to play a shooting game with, he discovered nothing else. After opening the attic door and exiting, Elena downstairs called out for Nathan to eat.

While descending the stairs, Song Ren noticed the paintings on the wall and a photo of Nathan with Elena. There was also their wedding photo in the room. Clearly, Nathan Drake and Elena were now married. The entire house exuded a warm, lived-in atmosphere. Well… it was a little messy. Clothes and books were scattered everywhere.

In the living room, Nathan and Elena chatted idly, but during dinner, Nathan seemed somewhat lost in thought, clearly immersed in memories of past adventures. However, Song Ren also noticed that while Nathan often got lost in adventurous recollections, he also seemed to restrain himself. But something wasn't right!

They had talked about adventure stories, so why did Nathan seem reluctant to go on new ones? As the two sat on the sofa chatting, perhaps trying to find a topic to distract themselves, Nathan quickly turned the conversation to video games. On the sofa was a Switch.

“He can even play games!?”

“I'm playing a game inside a game??” Song Ren's eyes widened as he watched this scene. To his surprise, there wasn't just one game; he could switch between them. In his previous life, this spot had a PlayStation 1 and Crash Bandicoot, also developed by Naughty Dog, the same team behind Uncharted.

Now, Mr. Chen had replaced it with a Switch, and the built-in game was Super Mario Bros. 1-1. As someone who struggled with platformers and had only beaten ‘Odyssey’ using Assist Mode, Song Ren promptly failed in the middle of 1-2. A green dead turtle took his last life.

After some domestic chitchat, Nathan returned to work at the salvage company the next day. However, that evening, an unexpected person arrived: Sam, who had been out of contact for fifteen years.

The two brothers talked all night, during which Nathan recounted his adventures of the past fifteen years to Sam.

“So, El Dorado, City of a Thousand Pillars, and Shambhala – these are all DLC content? I can't outplay you, Mr. Chen!”

Song Ren was speechless looking at the 'tell a story' option. Wow, the game had just been released, and the DLC content was already arranged? But it was actually expected, as these were all major legendary treasure ruins. If they were presented as flashback mode, whether too long or too short, it wouldn't be quite right.

If too short, it wouldn't convey the feeling of searching for a great treasure; if too long, it would be separated from the main storyline.

Facing an excited Nathan, a solemn Sam explained how he managed to escape from the Panamanian prison. In prison, Sam was incarcerated with a notorious Panamanian warlord. However, due to Henry Every's treasure, the warlord subsequently broke out of prison, taking Sam with him.

A series of gunfights, escapes, and explosions thrilled Song Ren to no end.

“Indeed, after calm comes passion; this is the taste, this is the vibe!”

Following the escaping militants, controlling Sam and fighting his way out with a gun, Song Ren instantly became excited. Various thrilling and dangerous scenes, gun battles, explosions, action sequences, and a full dose of escape parkour and climbing. Watching the prison completely overrun by the militants' firepower, Song Ren let out a long breath. Overall, having played it so far, he had only one word for this game: awesome.

One of Uncharted's most successful aspects was the perfect 4:4:2 distribution of story, combat/parkour, and puzzles, combined with seamless camera work and level transitions, and the game's color palette, which gave players a well-paced gaming experience. This was also why, after Crystal Dynamics took over, the rebooted Tomb Raider trilogy leaned towards Uncharted's pacing. Although many veteran Tomb Raider players couldn't accept it, the rebooted trilogy's nearly 30 million global sales were a huge success.

“So the story naturally follows: Nathan Drake retired from the adventuring life, but was forced to return due to his brother's crisis.” Watching Sam recount his experiences, Song Ren, having recovered from the recent intense scenes, summarized. It also made him more eager for what was to come.
