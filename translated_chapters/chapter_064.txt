“Qin Yi, the rice is burnt, and you're still chopping vegetables!”

“What am I supposed to do then? You said you'd wash the plates, but there isn't a single plate to put anything on! What else can I do but chop vegetables?”

“You're driving me crazy!”

“You're driving *me* crazy too!”

Inside Nebula Games' office, Zhao Zhuo, responsible for level design, and Qin Yi, responsible for numerical design, had the following conversation.

This was the fourth such incident to arise during testing after the game DEMO was released.

“Mr. Chen, is this game of ours really for couples, meant to foster their relationship?” Yang Xin looked at Chen Xu with a very strange gaze.

Ruan Ningxue, standing beside her, said nothing, but her head bobbing like a woodpecker fully conveyed that she shared Yang Xin's sentiment.

“Ahem, of course, it's not just for couples; friendships and brotherhood can also enjoy this game,” Chen Xu concluded earnestly.

“The reason it's like this is simply that Qin Yi and Zhao Zhuo are both quite competitive,” Chen Xu added.

“I just feel like something's not right,” Yang Xin muttered, looking at the *Overcooked* game screen in front of her.

At first, she felt this game was truly beloved by everyone.

But now?

She remained reserved because she had also played it.

Playing on easy difficulty and clearing levels wasn't much of a problem.

But when aiming for three stars, her blood pressure shot up instantly; sometimes she couldn't help but get a little frustrated.

“Alright, regarding the game's promotional video, Sister Xin, you and Senior Sister can keep an eye on it. I also have a media interview to attend,” Chen Xu said, changing the subject as he looked at the two who wanted to continue discussing *Overcooked* with him.

“Media interview?” Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue were a bit surprised.

“It's an exclusive interview with Game Timespace, also to prepare for the new game's promotion,” Chen Xu explained.

Hearing this, the two suddenly understood.

After a brief chat with Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin, Chen Xu headed towards the office.

This interview, although ostensibly for the promotion of *Overcooked*, was actually driven by the genuine interest of quite a few media outlets in him.

After all, in the broader gaming world, he still lagged a bit behind the top game designers and masters in terms of renown.

But at least within the independent game scene, the name Chen Xu still carried some weight.

“Teacher Chen, a pleasure to meet you! A pleasure!”

Pushing open the office door, Wu Tian, an editor from Game Timespace, greeted Chen Xu with an excited expression.

Ever since he accidentally encountered *Undertale* and experienced the shock it delivered, he had been quietly following Chen Xu. And Chen Xu's subsequent works had not disappointed him.

*To the Moon* brought tears to even tough guys' eyes, and as for *Outlast*...

While personally, he wasn't particularly fond of horror games, he had to admit that it was an absolutely excellent horror game, one that could make even tough guys wet themselves.

One could say he had long admired Chen Xu as a game designer.

So, upon learning of the interview opportunity, he immediately applied to his editor for it.

“No need to call me Teacher Chen, just my name is fine,” Chen Xu said, feeling a bit awkward internally when Wu Tian called him “Teacher Chen.”

Although in his previous life, with the emergence of various rising stars, “Teacher Chen” and his glorious photos on his computer hard drive were no longer a big deal, in the photography industry, “Teacher Chen” was still considered a pioneering master.

So, whenever he heard people call him “Teacher Chen,” Chen Xu always felt the title sounded somewhat improper.

Wu Tian paused, a little unsure what to do, because from his perspective, “Teacher” was just an honorific, a perfectly normal address in the gaming industry.

“Uh... then Mr. Chen, first of all, thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to accept our interview.”

After a moment of thought, Wu Tian changed his address. Although he didn't know why Chen Xu disliked the title “Teacher,” he couldn't very well just call him by his first name.

“No need to be so tense or formal; we can just chat casually first,” Chen Xu said with a smile, taking a bottle of Coke from a nearby box and offering it to Wu Tian, then taking one for himself.

“Uh... o-okay,” Wu Tian replied, unconsciously taking the bottle of Coke and placing it in front of him, looking at the smiling Chen Xu.

“Well, let's start by discussing *Undertale*. After all, the previous *Mirror (Game)* wasn't very convenient to report on. The main reason for developing *Undertale* was discovering a niche in the market for a certain type of game. Before that, the 'meta-concept' appeared more in novels and films, so I pondered why this approach couldn't be used in games. Furthermore, in terms of immersion, games have a greater advantage.”

“As for *To the Moon*? How it truly is, I believe countless players have already given their answer. For *Outlast*, I indeed developed it with immense passion, and judging by player feedback, they clearly must have felt it too.”

“Players want it, and the market lacks similar games, so we make them. That's why I say I consider myself a Warrior of Love; every one of our games is filled with a volcano-like passion for our players, ready to erupt.”

“The same goes for the new game; it also harbors my 'love' for the players.”

A new game?!

Hearing Chen Xu's words, Wu Tian, sitting there, his eyes lit up.

Finally, there was a captivating hot topic! Although he knew that Nebula Games' main purpose was likely to promote its new game, at least there was a 'scoop,' something exclusive to release.

Wu Tian, filled with anticipation, asked, “Mr. Chen, could you perhaps reveal a little information about the new game?”

“Of course, the new game will be an all-ages cooperative game, launching on February 14th, Valentine's Day.”

“We hope this game can deepen the relationships between couples. Of course, if you don't have a partner, you can still experience and enjoy the wonderfulness this game brings with your good brothers, sisters, and friends,” Chen Xu said with a sincere smile.

At the same time, Chen Xu also displayed two pieces of *Overcooked*'s Concept Art.

The adorable Crocodile Chef, Onion King, and Kevin the Dog, alongside two chefs in hats in a bustling kitchen, all wore smiling expressions.

To summarize in four words: harmonious and loving.

To add another four words: full of joy and warmth.

It made one immediately feel that the game was incredibly heartwarming, the kind of game friends absolutely must play together.

...

The interview wasn't particularly long, lasting less than 20 minutes.

With a refreshing smile, Chen Xu personally escorted Wu Tian to the main entrance, watching him enter the elevator.

“Ah, youth!” Chen Xu sighed with emotion.

Meanwhile, inside the elevator, Wu Tian held his recording pen and the unopened bottle of Coke.

At this moment, he snapped back to reality and recalled the entire interview process.

He felt a little dizzy.

Shouldn't he have been the interviewer? Why did it feel like he had become a stenographer?

Looking at the recording pen and Coke in his hand, Wu Tian fell into deep thought.

When did he lose control of the conversation?

It seemed to have started with this bottle of Coke, didn't it?

“But at least it wasn't without any gains. The information about Chen Xu's new game is quite substantial! I need to quickly draft the news article!”

“I'll use 'The Transmission of Love' as the main title. And looking at the Concept Art for *Overcooked*, it feels incredibly heartwarming. It seems players with girlfriends will have a great Chinese New Year this year!”
