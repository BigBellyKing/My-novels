Chapter 111 The Grand Promise is Finally Being Delivered

“This combat mode feels a bit like a knight’s duel!”

“The moves aren’t flashy at all, very simple and straightforward!”

“But the battles against massive BOSSes are quite thrilling.”

“Yeah, that Ash Judgment Gundyr looks really formidable.”

“But does the game’s difficulty feel off? Or did they just wear too good equipment during the demo? The BOSS battle seemed too short.”

“Exactly, it felt unsatisfying! Even though massacring the BOSS felt amazing, taking half its health in just half a minute is too fast.”

“It’s just a game demo. When players actually play, the progression based on equipment and level will definitely be different. Right now, it should mainly be showcasing the Combat System.”

“That’s true. The Combat System seems pretty good; at least to me, it looks fine.”

“Yeah, when the official version launches, the difficulty will definitely increase a bit. At the very least, we can play the highest difficulty mode, right?”

“I, for one, hope the game has some challenge. A short playthrough always feels unsatisfying.”

“You’re right!”

Many players were exchanging their opinions in the live stream room via bullet comments.

Their discussions mainly focused on the BOSS battle progression and the visual presentation.

After the video finished playing, Chen Xu selected some highly-liked questions from the bullet comments to answer, and also introduced *Dark Souls*.

“I believe everyone has seen the actual gameplay demonstration of *Dark Souls*. What we can tell players now is that this will be a level-driven game.”

“Additionally, I’ve noticed players asking if the BOSS progression is too short and if the game’s difficulty curve is too simple.”

“This concerns the core Gameplay, which is what makes *Dark Souls* different from other ARPGs. I can only reveal that *Dark Souls* will be a rather special game. As for the length of BOSS battles, that depends on the player; whether you defeat it quickly or slowly is up to you.”

“I also noticed some players questioning if this is a Hack-and-Slash Game. I can only say that this game *can* be played like a Hack-and-Slash, but it still depends on the player’s skill.”

“In reality, for some players, *Dark Souls* will still be quite challenging.”

Listening to Chen Xu’s words, the audience watching the live broadcast all sent bullet comments.

The popularity of the live stream room was also steadily rising.

Although most players, recovering from Chen Xu’s answers, felt like they had heard something but understood nothing, the atmosphere was certainly electric.

The online game press conference was still underway.

After a brief demonstration of the Combat System content.

Chen Xu also displayed many in-game scenes to all the players on the big screen.

From the initial Firelink Shrine, players traversed through it to the High Wall of Lothric, and further to the Catacombs, Deep Cathedral, Irithyll of the Boreal Valley, Farron Keep…

These scenes, transitioning from close-ups to distant views, allowed players to fully appreciate the details within, and the grand, magnificent presentation when zoomed out left everyone present in awe.

Because these visuals were clearly not the Concept Design Art or similar images Chen Xu had previously released on the official Weibo account.

They were actual in-game scenes.

This astonished not only players but also industry designers who had been following the game.

In a designer chat group, a crowd of people was also discussing *Dark Souls*.

“Chen Xu’s *Dark Souls* art style is exceptional!”

“Indeed, it can absolutely be called top-tier.”

“But judging by so many scenes, *Dark Souls* shouldn’t be a small-scale game. I’m actually a bit doubtful.”

“Yeah, is Chen Xu going this big for his first ARPG? So many scenes would definitely be a significant challenge.”

“There are already seven or eight game scenes, aren’t there?!”

“I wonder how long the entire game will be!”

“As long as the story and Gameplay aren’t a major hindrance or heavily criticized by players, *Dark Souls* can be considered half a success.”

“Yeah, the game’s environmental art design is truly fantastic.”

“Especially the Irithyll of the Boreal Valley scene, it’s absolutely stunning.”

This was the sentiment among Game Designers in the industry, and players were even more excited, filling the official live stream room with exclamation marks.

Without a doubt, simply from the actual combat performance and the game’s art environments, *Dark Souls* was already half a success.

As for whether it can become an excellent game, that depends on its subsequent performance.

After all, a game isn’t judged solely on one aspect; one must evaluate the game as a whole, its game content’s depth, and its deeper expressions.

If a game, despite utilizing top-tier industry technology to push visual effects to the extreme, falls short in its game content—for example, a weak story—it will still struggle to gain player approval.

For instance, even if a certain game’s visuals and other aspects are first-rate.

But as a story-driven game, if the plot first has players control the protagonist and watch their loved ones get their heads blown off, then go through a drama of revenge, retirement, and then returning for revenge, only to realize at the successful end of their revenge that endless vengeance never resolves anything – can such a game be called a masterpiece?

Clearly, most players have a very clear judgment in their minds.

So for Dark Souls, it currently only possesses its minimum baseline.

As for whether the game can become an excellent work and to what extent, that still depends on its story and Gameplay content.

At the end of the press conference live stream, under the expectant gaze of countless players in front of their computers, Chen Xu officially announced the game’s release date.

“*Dark Souls* will officially launch on October 1st, priced at 268 Yuan!”

Of course, this was the public price, but as the first blockbuster on the Nebula Games Platform.

It was both a flagship title and a traffic-driving product.

Considering Sales Volume, Chen Xu did not choose an exclusive strategy.

After all, it wasn’t a completely stable bet.

However, a money-based strategy was fine, as Nebula Games’ current capital reserves were still abundant.

It was publicly announced at 268 Yuan, but players who chose the Nebula Games Platform would also receive an additional 69 Yuan discount coupon.

For the current Nebula Games Platform, it was crucial to accumulate a user base and gradually incentivize these new users to make purchases on the Nebula Games Platform, thereby increasing the cost for players to abandonment the game.

Players watching the online live broadcast naturally weren’t aware of this; they were simply delighted that the long-awaited “grand promise” (the game) was finally going to be released after months of waiting.

After months of agonizing wait, this “grand promise” was finally about to be delivered!
