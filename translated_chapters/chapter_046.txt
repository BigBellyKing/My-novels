Chapter 46: Grounded, Not Graveyard-Bound!

Contacting the Motion Capture Studio for the output of various assets.

Meanwhile, Chen Xu led the entire team in the development of *Outlast*.

The cost of this game was not low, but not as high as imagined.

After completing the Budget Report, the total development cost of the game, including subsequent Promotional Costs, was tentatively set at 6 million Yuan.

Of course, it might increase somewhat later, but it wouldn't exceed 8 million Yuan.

For a horror game, this figure is quite substantial within its genre.

The team members were all very excited about this. After all, this was their first Big Project.

...

As time progressed day by day, art, actions, and resources were steadily produced.

The Story Dialogue in the game has also been produced, awaiting secondary Voice acting.

Various actions of the protagonist in the game were also undergoing trial and error.

"Now I already feel a little creepy. How terrifying will the finished product be?"

In the office, Ruan Ningxue sat in front of her computer, looking at the Concept Design Art on her secondary monitor, a lingering fear in her heart.

These Concept Design Art pieces were mainly scene images: the Asylum building in the dark, scenes filled with blood and corpses, mental patients hiding under hospital beds in dark rooms, and footage shot with DV in night vision mode.

These few pieces of concept art perfectly showcased *Outlast*'s eerie atmosphere. Just looking at them, let alone playing, sent a shiver down one's spine.

During the development of *Outlast*, she often went to bed late. Why? Because she was scared!

That day, she didn't know what she was thinking, but she actually took the DV Chen Xu gave her and tried it out at night. The extremely hellish atmosphere immediately made her feel completely unwell.

After all, visualizing things in her own mind and then scaring herself, that's the most terrifying thing.

Of course, it was precisely because of this that the concept art designs she created, following Chen Xu's requirements, all had a very good feel.

"That's right! And in the game, players can't fight back; they can only run away," Yang Xin, who was nearby, also sighed, listening to Ruan Ningxue's words.

Chen Xu, who was working on an action design, smiled: "Isn't that engaging? If there were guns, it would easily turn into an FPS game. After all, fear stems from insufficient firepower."

Why do general horror games feature firearms? On the one hand, it's to enrich the game's content, and on the other, it provides players with an appropriate outlet for venting. This approach is actually very suitable; the previous life's *Resident Evil* adopted this model.

But doing so also has a major flaw: it easily turns horror games into FPS games. After all, terror comes from insufficient firepower. With enough firepower, fear can be suppressed.

This includes how the *Resident Evil* series in his previous life gradually went astray in this area. From the fourth installment onwards, it leaned towards the "Bang Bang Bang" action, until the remakes returned to the path of horror, and *Resident Evil Village* managed the pace perfectly.

Of course, for most players, their focus wasn't on how scary the game was or how good the pacing was. All their attention was drawn to Lady Dimitrescu and her three daughters.

"But Mr. Chen, when should we warm up for *Outlast*? I see many players online asking about news of a new work," Yang Xin said.

Unlike before, when there were just the three of them in the R&D department, now that new employees have onboarded into the company, they officially address Chen Xu as Mr. Chen, instead of using first names as they used to.

"Yes, the development progress feels very fast. It should be launched around December," Ruan Ningxue added.

*Outlast*'s scale wasn't huge; the main workload was concentrated on various actions and art asset production. Because the gameplay mode was incredibly fast, there was almost no content requiring trial and error. Development had been smooth sailing all the way.

"There's no rush to spend money on promotion and warm-up yet. We'll start in mid-to-late November."

"Also, my official Weibo account has a lot of followers now. And you two, have you forgotten what day tomorrow is?" Chen Xu said with a smile.

What day?

Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue paused, then looked at the bottom right corner of the computer desktop.

October 30th?

"It's Halloween! I've already pre-recorded the Pre-release Promotional Materials specifically for this day to announce during the festival."

"After all, players have been looking forward to it for a month. Announcing news of our new work on this holiday, isn't that quite down-to-earth?" Chen Xu said to Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue with a smile, simultaneously clicking on a short video he had on his desktop.

The video wasn't long, only ten seconds in total. Initially, the screen was completely dark. The next moment, a picture appeared on the screen, but it wasn't a normal picture. Instead, it was DV footage in night vision mode. In the upper right corner, a battery indicator was visible, and in the upper left corner, a red dot continuously flashed, indicating that the DV was recording. The DV footage showed Chen Xu's office. Chairs were overturned on the floor, and various documents on the desk were intentionally scattered. The entire video was completely silent.

Coupled with the DV's night vision footage, it created an incredibly horrifying and eerie sense of unease. At the ninth second, the DV footage suddenly trembled, as if the person filming had been attacked, yet eerily, there was still no sound. Then the entire video finished playing and went dark.

The office fell silent. Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue stared at Chen Xu for a long time without saying a word.

"Mr. Chen, I think 'grounded' shouldn't extend all the way to the Underworld," Ruan Ningxue said slowly to Chen Xu after holding back for a long time.

This warm-up promotion was clearly a blatant announcement to players that they were developing a horror game. But the crucial question was, could this method of warm-up truly be considered "down-to-earth"? This was probably already "received into the Underworld."

Released on Halloween, and a DV recording like this specifically shot at midnight. You're really something else, Mr. Chen!

Yang Xin next to her couldn't help but say what she was thinking: "And Mr. Chen, didn't you say you were a Warrior of Love? *Outlast* has nothing to do with love, and for this warm-up, can't we do something from the living world?"

"How does it have nothing to do with love? Haven't horror game enthusiasts been saying for the past few years that there are no good horror games? Why am I developing *Outlast*? This is my love for these players! Can't that be considered a Warrior of Love?"

"As for something from the living world, don't you think this promotion aligns perfectly with *Outlast*'s theme? And this will attract greater attention than a normal announcement. We must seize this popularity!" Chen Xu said solemnly.
