Chapter 124: Has Mr. Chen Cast a Spell?

Chen Xu remained as steady as Mount Tai. Regarding how to guide the online player discussion, he was temporarily observing and preparing to find an entry point, as he could clearly see the relevant data for Dark Souls.

However, for many designers in the gaming industry who had been following Nebula Games, they were unaware of the game's relevant data. They could only judge the game's quality based on current online player reviews and Dark Souls' superficial content, which led to a wave of emotions.

“Sure enough, even though Chen Xu has been a killer in the independent game scene, it's still his first time dabbling in large-scale game development. He still can't quite get a handle on it!”

“You can't say that. The art design is completely flawless, and the combat system is quite excellent. As for the plot, it's unclear for now, but judging from the world view, it shouldn't be too bad. The main issue is the numerical design.”

“Yeah, I think so too. Dark Souls actually has high-quality graphics and art, but the difficulty seems way too high!”

“It's not just that! There's also the level design and the detailed experience. The game doesn't even have a mini-map, and the difficulty can't be adjusted. Chen Xu was too willful this time.”

“Dark Souls' player rating has already fallen to 8.3. Compared to Chen Xu's previous games, it's a world of difference!”

“Indeed, this must be Chen Xu's lowest rating record, right?”

“This time, Chen Xu has met his Waterloo. Not to mention a major setback, with Dark Souls' promotional scale and production costs, it's probably quite painful, isn't it?”

“Actually, not necessarily. The main issues with Dark Souls currently are its difficulty and detailed experience. It's hard to say if Chen Xu will appropriately lower the difficulty later or offer selectable difficulty options.”

“But ultimately, it's a step too late.”

“I guess many game developers from the same period are feeling a bit regretful now, right? Before, they felt Dark Souls' promotional efforts were very strong and worried their own games would be affected, but now Dark Souls has fallen short.”

There were indeed quite a few designers in the industry paying attention to Dark Souls. Previously, Nebula Games had various smash hits, but most were small-scale productions. As Nebula Games' first major title, Dark Souls naturally attracted countless eyes. But as it stood now, it was clearly filled with controversy, and might even fail to meet expectations. This also made some game developers and designers start having second thoughts. Previously, TengHua and NetDragon, two major companies, had already explicitly announced the launch dates for their VR blockbusters, which were in early and mid-December. They were clearly preparing for a tough battle. Although Nebula Games was not a large game developer, its previous successful independent small games and Dark Souls' promotional buzz similarly caused many game developers and designers to avoid confronting it head-on. After all, no one knew what kind of game it was; if the quality was excellent, wouldn't running into it be like serving oneself up on a platter? But Dark Souls' current performance made some game designers and developers start having second thoughts.

Hawkwing Entertainment, a domestic game developer specializing in ARPG and ACT genres, had its lead designer and head, Li Xiang, also closely following Dark Souls. This was because their new ARPG title, ‘Mind's Dawn’, which he led, was about to be released soon. Unlike some game developers who specifically avoided Dark Souls, they had already announced their game's release date in advance, two weeks after Dark Souls' launch. However, there were still some disagreements within the company about whether to delay the release. After all, if Dark Souls truly had excellent quality, being an ARPG itself, ‘Mind's Dawn’ might be relegated to a supporting role, affecting subsequent sales.

But now the situation should be relatively clear. Especially when, at the first opportunity, Li Xiang personally purchased Dark Souls and thoroughly experienced it. And after the experience, he was utterly stunned. Like players complaining online about the game's difficulty, Li Xiang sheepishly quit the game after experiencing the tyranny of Gundyr the Ash and the Crystal Lizard. He only had one feeling: was there truly no problem with this game's difficulty? Did Chen Xu really not make a mistake with the numerical design when developing this game? For an ARPG, even one focused on action, wasn't this difficulty a bit too exaggerated? Especially after he looked up some game-related information online and learned that the later parts of the game were actually full of malicious traps, and the initial content was just an appetizer, this instantly gave Li Xiang a sense of bewilderment.

With Dark Souls designed this way, Li Xiang could somewhat guess Chen Xu's intention: to make this game a more hardcore ARPG. This also led Li Xiang to believe that Dark Souls would be a niche game, without much popularity. And based on current online player reviews, it seemed to be heading in that direction. Well, there was nothing more to say then. Originally, he was hesitant, worrying that Dark Souls might become a popular major project. But now that all the stars were aligned—the right time, place, and people—not to take advantage of this opportune moment and take off would be a disservice to himself! Soon after Li Xiang made his decision, ‘Mind's Dawn’ began its high-profile promotion. It wasn't just Hawkwing Entertainment; many other games that were originally planned for release during this period, but had temporarily retreated and watched due to Dark Souls' strong promotional momentum, also began their warm-up promotions. After all, December would feature two massive monsters, and even though they were VR platforms, they would definitely have a significant impact on the PC platform. Moreover, judging by Dark Souls' current player reputation, it was clearly a husky in wolf's clothing. The initial promotion looked fierce, but after a real battle, it instantly fell short. By the time their games launched, the reputation would likely be even worse.

Meanwhile, inside Nebula Games.

Chen Xu was discussing the subsequent popularity operations for Dark Souls with Zhang Yida. Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin, who had been closely monitoring the game data, discovered something that excited them: Dark Souls' player rating and reputation seemed to be slowly turning around. Although many angry players still gave low scores and complained endlessly about Dark Souls' high difficulty on forums, Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin excitedly discovered through Nebula Games' backend data that many players who had previously given low scores did not immediately abandon the game but continued playing. The longest playtimes among this batch of players had already exceeded 12 hours. And most of these players had also changed their previously given low scores back. Including on the official community forums, these players also came forward, changing their previous attitudes, and began speaking highly of Dark Souls. This shift in attitude made them happy but also a little puzzled.

“What's wrong with the players?”

“Has Mr. Chen cast a spell on them?”
