# Chapter 10: Who Could Resist a Bishōjo Match-3 Game?

"Whew, this is unexpected!"

Inside his rented apartment, Chen Xu looked at the sales statistics in the backend of his official platform, feeling a bit surprised.

Because the overall growth in the data had truly exceeded his expectations.

On the first day, sales were 162 copies, a number neither high nor low.

On the second day, sales directly quadrupled, reaching a full 610 copies.

The main reason for this was his promotion.

With a budget of twenty thousand yuan, a normal advertisement certainly couldn't have been run.

On one hand, the money wasn't enough; on the other hand, the game had a slight peculiarity.

So Chen Xu's gaze immediately turned overseas, to a forum frequently visited by gentlemen.

After all, for Chen Xu, what he wanted was exposure.

As for the method, it was a relatively primitive approach of elite astroturfing posts.

Chen Xu hadn't considered large-scale astroturfing bombardment.

Because that wouldn't achieve a good effect, and might even backfire.

So the method Chen Xu adopted was to buy accounts and go for an elite approach.

Buying some older accounts on the forums, then publishing review posts.

After posting, astroturfers from other platforms would then bump the posts' content.

Of course, the most crucial point here was that the game's quality had to be up to standard.

Otherwise, this promotion method would not be as effective as large-scale astroturfing.

The most crucial point for this model's success was to convert players who learned about the game into allies, making them spontaneously recommend it to their friends and fellow gentlemen.

And as a professional Game Planner and an honest and simple player in his previous life, Chen Xu naturally understood a principle very well.

That is, what are players interested in?

A very simple theory: as players, most of them like to do one thing.

That is, to do some risqué things in normal games; and to do some normal things in risqué games.

This sense of contrast could be said to make these players addicted.

Just like a teasing remark made by players online: Men have two major hobbies, leading respectable women astray, and urging women of the night to reform.

Players are the same.

There are always some players who like to pull off some tricky moves in games.

Of course, relying solely on this is clearly not enough to make a game successful; ultimately, it relies on the game's quality.

But at least this characteristic can attract players, and that's already enough.

Judging by the current sales of *Mirror (Game)*, such a promotional strategy has so far proven to be entirely successful.

After all, choosing *Mirror (Game)* was a decision Chen Xu made after careful consideration, not on a whim.

How similar competing products performed in the market, whether gentlemen's preferences differed from his previous life, including release platforms and the feasibility of promotion – all these aspects were investigated beforehand.

Everything, Chen Xu had already calculated.

Under these circumstances, the success of *Mirror (Game)* could be said to be entirely within Chen Xu's control.

The only thing he hadn't anticipated was that the enthusiasm of gentlemen was far higher than Chen Xu had imagined.

With 610 copies sold on the second day, Chen Xu believed this increase was just the beginning.

As time progressed, word-of-mouth among players would definitely boost *Mirror (Game)*'s sales little by little.

"Hmm, at this rate, I'll be able to pay back the money owed to the payment app next week."

"Fortunately, the settlement method of the overseas official platform is real-time deposit; as long as players pass the refund period, the funds are immediately transferred to the account."

"But just like in my previous life, the commission from these third-party platform channels is really a bit hard to bear."

Thinking of this, Chen Xu couldn't help but click his tongue.

The official game platform takes a 30% commission, mainly for daily platform maintenance, as well as game engine upgrades and iterations, and the development of the latest technology.

As for other third-party game platforms, they are far more exploitative.

Especially when it comes to mobile channels, they typically start at 50%.

Some even go as far as a 70-30 split, where the developer gets 30% and the platform takes 70%.

This is comparable to the Goose Factory and major mobile app store channels in his previous life.

However, there are benefits, of course: these third-party platforms have a considerable user base, and the official platform offers fewer recommendations and its algorithms are not scientific.

So, even though these platforms have high revenue shares, game studios and companies can still make a profit.

It's just that they only get the broth, while the platforms take all the meat.

But for Chen Xu currently, these platforms were only briefly considered and held no interest at all.

It wasn't that he thought they were too exploitative and didn't want to get involved.

In fact, if he were to join them, it would definitely accelerate the accumulation of initial capital.

The main reason was that *Mirror (Game)* was a bit special; even if it were on those platforms, they wouldn't grant any recommendation slots.

Of course, this applies to domestic platforms, whereas overseas platforms have less strict restrictions.

But with the official platform available, there was no need to use third-party channels.

Because those domestic platform operators actually have no significant influence overseas.

Their main focus is domestically.


From afternoon to evening, Chen Xu was constantly monitoring the game's sales data.

This period was also the golden hour for sales growth.

Refreshing the backend data every hour, he could see *Mirror (Game)*'s sales steadily rising.

From an increase of over 100 in the previous hour, it had now climbed to over 200 during this golden period.

Clearly, through various information channels, the name *Mirror (Game)* was slowly reaching the ears of various gentlemen.

Each increment in sales represented the support of these amiable gentlemen for the game.

And with the lifting of the player review embargo, *Mirror (Game)*'s rating was successfully displayed.

A score of 9.7, a truly phenomenal score.

However, Chen Xu wasn't overly excited.

The primary reason was that as an 18R game, players were incredibly tolerant of such games, and their tolerance level was much higher.

Compared to traditional games, this score actually had little reference value.

Just as some forums are filled with various curses and controversies, in forums frequently visited by gentlemen, it's different.

User comments were incredibly harmonious, either praising the OP as a good person with wishes for a safe life, or discussing their viewing experiences and their love for certain 'teachers'.

The only thing *Mirror (Game)*'s score could prove was that, in the eyes of players, this game was definitely worth buying and recommending.

After all, who could resist such an interesting Bishōjo Match-3 game?
