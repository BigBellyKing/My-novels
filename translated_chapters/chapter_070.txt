Chapter 70: The Ship of Friendship Capsizes Easily

As the game progressed, the bullet comments in the live streaming room grew more numerous, but the few people in the game clearly had no time to watch them, completely immersed in the game.

The Da Zhou siblings on the other side had tentatively reached an agreement for reconciliation.

Of course, the actual situation was that under the strong hand of Empress Da Zhou, King Zhuang, who intended to rebel, was directly suppressed, further solidifying the regime of the Da Zhou Dynasty.

But no matter what, with Liuliu taking the lead, their group had already begun to move towards a proper culinary path.

Meanwhile, Dong Zhen and A'Shu were still in a state of warlord chaos, bickering verbally while fumbling frantically in the game.

“What do we do? Think of something, we’re going to lose!”

Seeing their score drop to -140, while Zhuangzhuang and Liuliu’s score had risen from -140 to -70, A'Shu grew a little anxious.

“What the heck, how can I help when we’re behind? We can’t have real-person PK while cooking! Quickly plate and serve, this dish is done!” Dong Zhen said, combining the food.

“Plate! How can I serve without a plate? Only you have a dishwashing sink to wash plates!” A'Shu ran towards the serving counter with the dish, but was prompted that plating was required.

“What the heck, why is there so much trouble? Can’t we eat without a plate? Can’t we just shovel it into our mouths with our hands?” Dong Zhen looked exasperated.

“My Squad Leader Dong, stop talking nonsense, quickly wash the plates!” A'Shu shouted urgently.

“Wash what plates? What’s there to wash! Isn’t this a waste of time?”

Dong Zhen was overcome with anger, and evil thoughts sprang forth. A sudden idea struck him, and he tossed the dirty plate in his hand directly to the side. Then, he controlled the Bearded Chef in the game and ran towards Liuliu and Zhuangzhuang's area.

Without a word, he simply snatched a new plate.

“Squad Leader A'Shu! Catch the plate!” Turning around, Dong Zhen controlled the chef to throw the plate over.

Then, looking at the menu at the top of the screen and glancing at the dishes that had just been prepared on the outer stove, but not yet served, he directly performed a 'nimble hands, empty pockets' move. “Squad Leader A'Shu! Catch the dish!” Holding the snatched dish, Dong Zhen ran towards A'Shu.

“Squad Leader Dong, you’ve got something there!” After serving two dishes consecutively, their score directly changed from -140 to 0.

At this point, Zhuangzhuang, who was still diligently chopping vegetables and washing dishes, also discovered that the fruits of her hard labor had been stolen.

“Sis! Our dishes and plates were stolen!” Without a word, Zhuangzhuang threw the dirty plate in her hand towards Dong Zhen. Though it was useless.

“This is outrageous! How could you two steal our food?!” Liuliu also looked bewildered.

When she first encountered this game, she thought it was a warm and harmonious experience.

But with the actual gameplay experience, she had to admit one thing: playing this game was truly a bit blood-pressure-raising.

Especially when her teammates didn't share her ideas, it was truly a bit maddening. It was easy for her mentality to develop a tiny bit of a problem.

But now, she realized that this game wasn't just about teammates raising her blood pressure; even opponents could do it. Her team's plates and dishes could actually be snatched by opponents, who could then serve them to customers and earn points?

Their fruits of labor were being stolen!

“A'Shu! You’re good at this, I’ll leave it to you!” Dong Zhen, seeing his actions condemned, quickly shouted to A'Shu.

“How can a scholar’s matter be called stealing?

Besides, what does 'steal' mean? It refers to something done without being known. Squad Leader Dong borrowed it right in front of you!

And one more thing, Liuliu, Zhuangzhuang, listen to me, and all the viewers in the live streaming rooms too, this game isn't just for watching. As streamers, what we broadcast has depth!” A'Shu’s tone suddenly became profound.

“When we stream a game, we aim to impart some wisdom to our audience, to teach them many things. In today’s society, various marketing accounts are constantly spoon-feeding everyone motivational speeches.

Squad Leader Dong’s behavior is actually meant to tell everyone that society is treacherous! We may act righteously, but some people don't! You work at a company, you do the work, but there are always some people who—oh, they steal your credit. They dilly-dally normally, but when the boss arrives, they swoop in and snatch your almost-finished work. And then what? They claim credit!

We’re not telling you to act this way, but to show you that the professional world is full of such wicked people! Never harbor intentions of harming others, but always be wary of others’ intentions!

So we’re telling everyone this to make them vigilant! This is what true BEST Live Streaming is about; it teaches life lessons. How many bosses went bankrupt, watched our stream, and went back to start a business? How many divorced couples reconciled? This is what live streaming should be. Do you feel surrounded by darkness in this society? That’s because your spiritual strength isn’t enough; you only have material, not spirit.

So we need both spiritual and material sustenance. Ah, at this point, someone might ask, ‘Tree Bro, how do we keep up with this spiritual aspect?’ The method is simple: 6 yuan! For 6 yuan, you can get a card and become a 'Little Sapling.' Every afternoon to evening, enjoy the purest spiritual baptism in our live streaming room!”

Listening to A'Shu’s speech, the live streaming room fell into a silence.

“A'Shu! It’s a real shame you’re not in a pyramid scheme!” Dong Zhen couldn’t help but exclaim, even forgetting that he was, in fact, the negative example in A'Shu's sermon.

However, this speech clearly failed to trick Liuliu and Zhuangzhuang.

Facing Dong Zhen, who was still trying to snatch plates, Zhuangzhuang also ran over, biding her time, ready to grab them.

In an instant, the kitchen, originally for cooking, suddenly turned into a battlefield. All sorts of ingredients and plates flew everywhere, and the pots on the stove were left unattended.

That little sailboat of friendship, it capsized easily.

………………

Valentine’s Day, coupled with the recent lack of particularly interesting games beyond NetDragon and TengHua Games' VR offerings.

Moreover, from a live streaming effect perspective, those two games were only interesting when streamed by a select few live streaming geniuses. Most players just watched the visuals and story, joining in for the fun.

Thus, the game Overcooked entered the view of most streamers.

In just one day, combined with prior promotional warm-ups and platform streamer broadcasts, Overcooked rapidly spread and became popular across major game live streaming platforms.

After all, it was a multiplayer game launched on Valentine's Day, and it had previously given off a rather warm impression.

Of course, these labels were merely what they imagined. Once they called their friends and entered the game two by two, the stable ship of friendship, in the sacred space of the kitchen, encountered severe storms and capsized easily.

In various live streaming rooms, streamers who were originally very close instantly 'turned into enemies.'
