Chapter 862: It's a Fighting Game, But Not a Fighting Game

No depth?

Hearing the questions raised by Qin Yi and the others, Chen Xu smiled and shook his head. Indeed, at first glance, the Smash Bros. series seems to have simplified many aspects as much as possible. It appears to have removed command inputs, along with a percentage health bar setting, seemingly giving it a shallower feel.

But quite the opposite, this game has an extremely high skill ceiling, even surpassing traditional fighting games. Because the rules revolve around knockback, it means the game isn't simply about emptying an opponent's health bar. Being able to be launched up, down, left, and right also means the game's maps have the concept of environmental kill. If players can be knocked off a cliff, there are naturally corresponding counter-measures.

Neutral game is extremely important in the Smash Bros. series; one can tell if a player is skilled by observing their neutral game techniques. The introduction and combination of these elements lead to a specific situation: since failure is only determined by being knocked off-stage, most casual players will primarily fight in the center of the stage. Coupled with the absence of a health bar, two players can fight endlessly. High-level players, however, will lead the fight to the edges, or even finish opponents off-stage or in the air, which involves psychological warfare and on-the-spot operational reactions.

Regardless of the system, a fighting game is essentially a rock-paper-scissors game, relying on real-time operational reactions and psychological prediction. As long as these elements can be displayed, and as long as the balance of the fighting characters is decent, there will absolutely be no lack of so-called game depth.

"Regarding game depth, everyone needn't worry. In fact, compared to these aspects, the most difficult part is the game's representation of game culture," Chen Xu said, looking at everyone.

"Representation of game culture?" Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin looked a bit confused.

"Because in this game, it won't just feature Nebula Games' IP; it will also include memorable IP characters from game history. We'll incorporate their music, stages that represent their respective series, items, and fighters. Furthermore, in this game, we need to offer players extensive single-player content, showcasing the unique characteristics of each game character's series," Chen Xu explained in detail.

"So, that's why Mr. Chen made us play all those old games before!"

Qin Yi and the others immediately remembered how Chen Xu had made them, the core members, thoroughly experience those old games.

"Exactly. Aside from multiplayer versus, the game will feature a single-player story called 'World of Light'. We need to specially design a unique large map and incorporate stages from various IPs into it," Chen Xu nodded.

For single-player content, the story in the Smash Bros. series isn't complex; it's simply a tale of saving the world and heroes. The core single-player gameplay still revolves around traditional collecting elements: classic characters from various IPs are transformed into Spirits, categorized by different attributes for players to collect and enhance. This allows the single-player story to feel like an RPG, where even clumsy players can enjoy and complete the game by constantly collecting and enhancing Spirits, and by choosing to lower the difficulty.

Compared to typical fighting games, the single-player content of the past Smash Bros. series was incredibly extravagant. Not to mention the classic characters from various IPs, each character's IP had different maps, and each map even had three different forms, which could seamlessly switch during battle. The game alone boasted hundreds of maps, and this count didn't even include the maps with switched forms. Simultaneously, there were over a thousand original music tracks, leading players to jokingly call the Smash Bros. series not a fighting game, but a music player.

Additionally, the map styles vary according to different characters, and even the items and Spirits in the game need to have unique characteristics, rather than just being a mere model with a name. For instance, the mushroom and Super Star from Super Mario... Every item should evoke a sense of familiarity for players who have played those games. No introduction is needed; even if they don't immediately recognize it, they will once they use it and realize they've played the corresponding game.

This is the charm of the Smash Bros. series. Chen Xu didn't explain these details to Qin Yi and the others, as the main fighters and various moves and techniques would later be personally handled by Chen Xu. Qin Yi and his team's main focus was on designing the levels, scenes, and art.

For games like the Smash Bros. series, this is crucial. For example, the consequences of different IPs are extremely diverse art styles: cartoon, realistic, fantasy... There are fierce characters like Pyra and Mythra, as well as family-friendly characters like Mario and Yoshi, and more realistic ones like Cloud and Sephiroth. Therefore, figuring out how to blend these characters with different art styles so that players don't feel it's incongruous is also a very important task.

In the previous life, for IP-driven games, especially those combining many IPs, after the Smash Bros. series' success, many game developers also targeted this area. Some started new ventures, while others constantly created crossovers and collaborations, such as Jump and PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale. However, these games purely became simple fan cash grabs; none achieved the same success as Nintendo's Smash Bros. series. Its core, beyond the gameplay framework and content, also lies directly in its art style.

Among them, games like Jump were still acceptable because they were based on Japanese anime/manga. For fan players, being able to control their favorite manga or anime characters, listening to voice actors shout exciting lines, and witnessing flashy ultimate abilities was satisfying enough. However, PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale was a prime example of a negative case. It strived to perfectly recreate each original character in the game, which sounds faithful to the source material. But in the end, it made the entire game feel out of place, giving players the impression that the characters were directly pulled from their respective games. Forget playing it; just looking at it felt strange.

"The workload for this seems immense!" Qin Yi exclaimed after hearing Chen Xu's introduction to this fighting game. If they were to follow this model, wouldn't they have to exert their utmost effort to recreate the scenes from those classic IP games? And not just imitate the surface, but delve deep into the essence.

For instance, if they wanted to incorporate Dark Souls elements into this fighting game, how would they make players who have played the series smile knowingly? There are many points: the Fire Dragon Bridge, the justice story kill from above, the storm that brought down the Greatwood, Praise the Sun, Moonlight Greatsword... From Dark Souls to Bloodborne, Sekiro, and Elden Ring, common threads can be found, but these things are only clear to players who have experienced them. It's not about staying on the surface, like just adding a Sculptor's Idols or a bonfire.

"No need to rush. Didn't we just release the new version of World of Warcraft? Players can grind slowly, and we'll take our time making this," Chen Xu said with a smile. "However, one thing you all must understand is that while this is a fighting game in terms of gameplay, I want you not to approach it with a fighting game mindset. Instead, maintain the same mindset we had when developing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey," Chen Xu said very earnestly.

This is the unique characteristic of the Smash Bros. series. Although almost all players consider this game a fighting game, neither its creative philosophy nor its official marketing has ever promoted it as such. This is because the game's initial positioning was for a broad audience of casual players.

In its previous life, Nintendo's promotion and operation of the game were entirely centered around this. Their self-hosted official tournaments did not ban items, ultimate abilities, or stage hazards, greatly increasing the element of chance. Originally, they wanted the Smash Bros. series not to be a professional fighting esports event like EVO, but they couldn't find a good excuse. So, after Sony Interactive Entertainment acquired the EVO fighting event, they immediately found a reason and officially announced overnight that the Smash Bros. series would withdraw from EVO.

If one were to approach the Smash Bros. series with the mindset of making a fighting game, it would inevitably lose its essence. Its core can only be: a light action game that anyone can pick up and enjoy.
