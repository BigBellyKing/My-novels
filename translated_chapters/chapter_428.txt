Chapter 427: Choosing a New Game (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Hearing Yang Chen's words, Chen Xu was a little puzzled.

The loading aspect was quite a significant breakthrough. However, Chen Xu was even more curious about what kind of black technology this 'Awakening Mode' truly was.

“Compared to other platforms, the biggest advantage of the VR platform can be said to be immersion. But similarly, this isn't always a good thing for certain games,” Yang Chen introduced to Chen Xu.

Chen Xu wasn't clear what kind of technology this mode was, or how it was implemented. However, he understood the gist of it. Just as he had said before, the biggest advantage of VR gaming pods was the immersive experience.

But when it came to certain special games, sometimes excessive immersion wasn't ideal. The most direct example was horror games. Dying purely from fright was almost nonexistent; it was more likely to trigger other conditions, such as heart disease. Furthermore, few players actively sought the thrill of extreme fright. But not seeking it didn't mean it wouldn't happen. For instance, in the 'Warzone' mode of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, which Chen Xu previously developed, while players enjoyed the parachuting gameplay, it wasn't ideal for those with acrophobia. That's why an automatic parachuting function was specifically added for it. This also included the Dark Souls port to the VR platform, where some grim scenes like the Undead Asylum were optimized to ensure players wouldn't be too scared. This new technology, however, was designed to ensure players had a better experience in regular games, preventing overly intense emotions due to excessive immersion that could lead to physical and mental strain.

“In that case, many aspects of game development can be fully unleashed,” Chen Xu said, rubbing his chin.

“By the end of the month, Mr. Chen, you can try to check it out,” Yang Chen said with a smile.

The two then chatted a bit more, mainly about the development trends in the gaming industry and some technologies that might be realized in the gaming field.

………………

By the end of the month, the Game Department and Zeus overseas simultaneously announced a major patch update for the VR gaming pod. This sparked widespread discussion within the industry and among players.

Within Nebula Games, Chen Xu, who had already received the news, didn't pay much attention to it. Instead, he experienced it himself. It was a rather special feeling; the sense of immersion hadn't decreased much, but when facing uncomfortable scenes, enabling Awakening Mode brought about a very noticeable change.

“I feel this new technology is incredibly useful for developing game types and themes!” Meng Zuo exclaimed from the project office after emerging from the gaming pod.

“Indeed, the main thing is that it can save a lot of content for later testing,” Qin Yi said.

Previously, a lot of testing was required before a game's release. Besides game content, there was also the player experience. For example, scenes that could cause psychological discomfort to players, such as the high-altitude fall in 'Warzone'. Now, with this new mode, even players with acrophobia mostly experience it as a spectator, though it's still thrilling. But they no longer feel fear due to the height. Because with Awakening Mode enabled, they can clearly understand that they are actually playing a game. Similarly, in Rainbow Six Siege, suddenly turning a corner and getting ambushed with a 'bang bang bang' would give many players a fright. But with Awakening Mode, it was much better.

“Besides that, the optimization of loading progress is actually very important too,” Ruan Ningxue interjected.

“Optimize Red Dead Redemption better, and regarding Awakening Mode, use the ported Dark Souls, as well as Rainbow Six and Warzone to observe player reactions,” Chen Xu said to everyone.

Hearing Chen Xu's words, everyone nodded. This was considered the first task direction after the New Year. From the current feedback, the new technology is indeed quite excellent. However, its current effectiveness is still unclear.

Updating existing games with it was a relatively safe approach. In fact, not just Nebula Games, but domestic game developers like NetDragon and TengHua, and overseas ones like Atrai, all made the same decision. Their teams updated their older games using the new technology. Many players online were also discussing related news.

………………

In the office, Qin Yi and Meng Zuo returned to the project office, each responsible for their respective projects. Meanwhile, Chen Xu began a long-awaited gacha pull.

【Director Professional Knowledge * 14】
【Archaeology Professional Knowledge * 21】
【Action Performance Professional Knowledge * 5】
【Rock Climbing Professional Knowledge * 12】
【Ancient Architecture Professional Knowledge * 5】

It has to be said that Super Mario Odyssey and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild were truly two major powerhouses. As soon as they were released, the points visibly soared. By now, Chen Xu had saved up almost two hundred pulls. This time, he directly had a satisfying draw. Among these, the most useful for Chen Xu were various professional knowledge items and Memory Capsules. Unfortunately, as someone prone to unlucky streaks, he didn't pull any black technology items this time. Of course, Chen Xu wasn't too disappointed by this. Mainly because Nebula Games' development had already entered the right track.

Moreover, Nebula Games had continuously conducted research into cutting-edge technology. Leading the charge was AI performance; with substantial investment, Nebula Games was currently at the global forefront in this area. Next was physics engine performance, which Nebula Games had also been researching. In terms of technology, Nebula Games was already considered a top-tier entity.

“This gacha pull... is it an omen?” Chen Xu couldn't help but rub his chin, looking at the pile of skill books he had drawn.

Originally, he was still a bit conflicted about his project for the first half of the year. After all, he had previously discussed it with Yang Chen, and Chen Xu planned to develop a game for Huanyu VR, aiming to be the first major release of the year. However, Chen Xu was still contemplating what type of game to develop. Especially with the emergence of new technologies, Chen Xu had many options. He had initially thought of developing a Souls-like game, as Awakening Mode aligned well with the game's theme he had in mind.

However, while it fit, sales were also a concern for Chen Xu. After all, Huanyu VR held significant importance, and while Souls-like games had considerable popularity, their sales weren't actually very high. Compared to other blockbusters developed by Chen Xu, the sales of the Dark Souls duology were the lowest.

But now, this gacha pull made him feel he didn't need to overthink it. Furthermore, players had always complained about his 'love for knives' (referring to his tendency to make difficult games), and even The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on Switch had a hidden 'knife' (difficulty/challenge). So now, he would give them a truly wholesome game, a family-friendly story.
