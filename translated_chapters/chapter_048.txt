Chapter 48: Horror Games Are As Easy As Breathing For Me

By mid-November, roughly seventy percent of the game content for *Outlast* was essentially complete.

The remaining thirty percent primarily involved voice acting, corresponding scene construction, and performance aspects.

For Chen Xu, the biggest gain from *Outlast*'s development was a deeper understanding of how to use the editor.

At the same time, *Outlast*'s game content, with his current 2048M resource access, meant the monthly quota was entirely sufficient.

Besides game development, the Nebula Games Platform also quietly launched during this period.

Chen Xu promoted it on his official Weibo account.

However, it didn't cause much of a stir.

There was no talk of industry giants taking notice or media outlets reporting on it; none of that actually happened.

Some media outlets, having run out of news, simply placed this information in a sub-section.

If you didn't specifically look for it, you wouldn't even see it.

Currently, the only games launched on the platform were *To the Moon* and *Undertale*.

As for sales, the two games combined sold a total of 172 copies.

However, the cumulative playtime was less than 50 hours in total.

Clearly, the players who bought them must have been Chen Xu's fans, simply purchasing an extra copy on his platform to support their favorite designer and game company.

Chen Xu wasn't particularly discouraged by this, as platform development doesn't happen overnight.

Days passed, and it was early December.

The entire development of *Outlast* was also drawing to a close.

Corresponding promotions began one after another.

One day, Chen Xu suddenly posted on his official Weibo account.

The Weibo post was very simple: a paragraph of text and a game poster.

'Only by escaping can you survive the ordeal!'

'December 15th, Outlast begins!'

Below this text was the game poster for *Outlast*.

The poster's background appeared to be a hospital room, with scattered medical equipment covering the floor and tables.

On the wall were two large characters: 'Escape'.

The color, in night vision mode, appeared black, immediately making people think of bloodstains.

Meanwhile, under the bed in the corner, a person with a face full of fear was cowering, their right index finger pressed to their mouth, looking extremely eerie.

As Chen Xu's Weibo post went out, major media outlets began reporting on *Outlast* one after another.

Moreover, *Outlast* was launched early on the Official Game Platform.

Of course, it was currently in pre-sale mode.

Priced at 65 Yuan, it wasn't a particularly high price.

After all, *Outlast* wasn't a very large game in terms of content.

At the same time, major gaming communities and forums were buzzing with discussions about *Outlast*.

Of course, this wasn't spontaneous player activity. Although *Undertale* had gained some minor fame and *To the Moon* had won first place in the Sci-Fi Game Design Competition.

Merely relying on reputation wasn't enough to generate a hot topic; Chen Xu's current fame wasn't sufficient for that.

What caused all this, naturally, was Money Power.

………………

As time progressed day by day, *Outlast* finally ushered in its launch.

On Shark TV's gaming section, a livestream room named
