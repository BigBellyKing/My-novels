Chapter 624: Excited Players (Please Subscribe for Monthly Passes)

Upon entering the Nebula World, Song Ren quickly discovered something different.

That was, the parchment Chloe had given him earlier now had a new icon.

It was a yellowed Azeroth map.

To the left of the map was Kalimdor, featuring Thunder Bluff, Orgrimmar...

To the right were the Eastern Kingdoms, with Stormwind, Ironforge...

And in the very center was a giant Maelstrom.

'Since the Alliance and Horde fought side-by-side to resist the invasion of the Burning Legion.'

'Four years have passed since then, and although Azeroth was successfully saved,'

'the fragile truce between the Alliance and Horde has long since vanished.'

'Now, the thunderous war drums echo once more, and war will ignite Azeroth…'

Accompanied by the slow narration, the scene before Song Ren's eyes gradually changed.

The original island transformed into icy mountains. Amidst the howling wind and snow, a Dwarf appeared in Song Ren's vision.

Song Ren was no stranger to Dwarves, as he had seen many in the Stormwind scenario within the Nebula World.

However, in this close-up shot, he couldn't help but chuckle.

This was because the nose on the Dwarf's large head was too prominent, occupying about one-sixth of his face.

Beyond that, the incredibly realistic visual effects also left Song Ren amazed.

Brown beard covered in ice shards, and the fine lines on his face were all clearly visible.

Yet, despite his astonishment, he knew this wasn't actual in-game footage.

Nebula Games had very honestly placed a disclaimer nearby: *Video footage does not represent actual in-game graphics.*

Amidst the howling cold wind, the Dwarf twisted his neck, surveying his surroundings, and his camera perspective slowly zoomed out.

The Dwarf Hunter, rifle in hand, traversed the snowy plains with his pet brown bear, heading towards Ironforge.

The camera pulled back higher and higher amidst the swirling snow, revealing the magnificent sight of Ironforge before the players.

Nestled in the snow-capped mountains, one could vaguely discern through the blizzard that the entrance to Ironforge seemed to be grand and majestic, situated halfway up the mountain.

Next, as a gust of wind kicked up a flurry of snowflakes, obscuring the view.

The scene shifted to a tranquil forest.

A scantily clad Night Elf was inspecting a broken blade in her hand within the jungle.

But the next moment, seemingly hearing something, the Elf turned and sprinted into the distance.

Through the tranquil forest, across mountain streams, and over broken cliffs, the Elf finally transformed into a black leopard and charged forward.

In the next second, the scene shifted again, showing an Undead Warlock chanting spells and meteors continuously falling from the sky.

The meteors fell, transforming into a green Infernal that appeared behind the Warlock, emitting an earth-shattering roar.

A Tauren on Thunder Bluff.

Orc warriors before a war-torn fortress.

Human Mages defending against Infernals on the city walls.

A series of thrilling combat scenes showcased different races and classes.

The video concluded with a Tauren's totem slamming down.

The four large characters “World of Warcraft” and the Nebula Games LOGO appeared in the center of the screen.

………………

It didn't even take a full day.

Less than an hour after Chen Xu posted on the official Weibo account,

keywords like “World of Warcraft” and “Azeroth” had already topped the trending searches.

Regarding Warcraft, despite it being an old game returning after six years,

many players still remembered the associated memories to this day.

Moreover, after the Nebula World launched, although not all scenes from Warcraft were fully integrated, some nostalgic scenarios were added after Stormwind.

At the same time, the related dungeons and class gameplay styles had, in essence, already been in operation.

In addition, while Nebula Games hadn't focused all its energy on merchandise and crossovers, it hadn't neglected them either.

Therefore, Warcraft's fanbase wasn't solely comprised of Warcraft players.

It also included players who had encountered Warcraft culture through Nebula World or learned about it through various RPG maps.

Another factor was the exquisite promotional CG animation for this new World of Warcraft.

The visual impact of this promotional CG animation was truly overwhelming.

It even captivated some players new to the gaming industry.

As for the veteran players, they smiled knowingly, displaying nostalgic expressions.

Nebula Games Film Studio truly didn't forget its roots!

One must remember that Nebula Games was once jokingly called an animation company delayed by games by players.

In the comments section of Chen Xu's official Weibo post and on relevant forum websites, countless players expressed their inner excitement and curiosity through words.

'After six long years, Mr. Chen finally remembered Warcraft!'

'With this CG animation, Nebula Games is finally returning to its old trade!'

'But what does 'World of Warcraft' signify?'

'What about Arthas and Illidan's后续 stories? Why aren't they in the trailer?'

'But this promotional CG is absolutely amazing! It brought back that shocking feeling from back then!'

'+1, when I saw the CG animation of Arthas returning to Lordaeron and killing the old king, it absolutely stunned me. I never thought an RTS CG story animation could be so incredibly awesome!'

'Cough cough, stop talking about story animations, everyone. Is no one going to pay attention to what type of game World of Warcraft actually is?'

'There's no point in paying attention, Mr. Chen only released a promotional video, and besides the background narration and race showcases, there's nothing else.'

While excited, the content displayed in the game also sparked curiosity among many players.

In fact, Nebula Games had not yet revealed any of the game's true content.

And the various characters appearing in the game were basically just the races and classes that had previously appeared in Warcraft and Nebula World.

For example, the Dwarf with his brown bear companion at the beginning, the Night Elf who could transform into a black leopard later, and the Undead Warlock who summoned an Infernal, as well as Tauren, Mages, and so on.

Popular characters familiar to players, such as Illidan, Tyrande, and Arthas, did not appear, and not much of the story was revealed.

It could only be inferred from the promotional CG animation:

Four years have passed since the Alliance and Horde jointly resisted the Burning Legion's invasion of Azeroth.

And the relationship between the Alliance and Horde had become fragile.

So, it was evident that conflict was brewing, and war was imminent.

The new game's storyline should revolve around the conflict between the Horde and the Alliance.

It was precisely this that left many players curious and puzzled.

What kind of game would World of Warcraft be?

First, RTS could be ruled out.

Because neither its performance in Nebula World nor the promotional video suggested it was an RTS game.

'Do you think it could be an ARPG? Doesn't the Stormwind performance in Nebula World feel a bit like it?'

'It's not impossible! The Warcraft story is vast and very suitable for an RPG!'

'I think it might be an open-world game, after all, isn't it called World of Warcraft? And when it comes to open-world, Nebula Games is quite experienced!'

'It could be something like The Witcher: Wild Hunt, where players can choose between the Alliance and Horde factions, and then their progress through quests influences the outcome of the final war.'

'Speaking of which, does no one think it might be an MMORPG?'

'It's not impossible. The Stormwind in Nebula World felt quite like it, with high-end dungeons requiring team and class cooperation.'

'Now that you mention it, that's certainly possible!'

Across the globe, regardless of time or region, all Warcraft fans were discussing news about World of Warcraft at this moment.
