Chapter 868: This Game Is So Simple!

"This is really exciting!"

Looking at the cutscene before him, Song Ren couldn't help but sigh with emotion. He had already watched this particular cutscene countless times over the past few days. However, watching it in VR mode still offered a slightly different experience, especially since these were all classic IP characters he was intimately familiar with.

He didn't choose to skip it. Only after watching the final Kirby gaze out at a ruined world, and the Smash Bros. LOGO pop up, did Song Ren formally enter the game.

Amidst the stirring background music, several options appeared before Song Ren. There was the Smash Bros. entrance for battles against AI; the 'World of Light' entrance for the single-player story mode; and the multiplayer mode for competing against other players online. Additionally, there were options for players to engage in training gameplay, and each fighter character's unique winning Smash. Another point that surprised Song Ren was that, just like in Super Mario Maker, players could customize their faces and create their own exclusive custom fighter in Smash Bros. Of course, Song Ren didn't choose this custom fighter. After all, the game was called Nebula All-Star Smash Bros.. With so many popular and appealing IP characters available, why would he bother creating a custom one? He'd at least wait until he got tired of playing all those characters before trying out a custom one.

"First, let me try a match against the AI, I'll use Cloud as my character for the first brawl."

Song Ren happily clicked open Smash Bros., ready to try his hand. Although Song Ren wasn't entirely clear on which fighters were actually in the game yet, one thing was certain: Cloud had to be in it, as he had appeared in previous promotional CG animations. As for why he chose Cloud? Naturally, it was because Cloud was handsome! And he also looked very similar to him, which gave a sense of immersion.

"Huh! Can't I choose directly? Do I have to unlock them one by one?"

After selecting the regular Smash Bros. option, creating a room according to the default rules, the content displayed on the screen made Song Ren pause. Because, unlike the multitude of fighters he imagined would be available, he could only choose from eight fighters at the moment. These were Mario, Donkey Kong, Link, Yoshi, Kirby, Bowser, and two games integrated into the premium membership on the Switch platform: Fox McCloud from Star Fox, and Samus Aran from Metroid. Unlike ordinary fighting games, Smash Bros. itself only offered a few starting characters for players to use at the beginning, requiring players to choose one themselves. The remaining characters needed to be unlocked by players little by little as game time progressed. The single-player 'World of Light' mode used a different unlocking system, where players controlled Kirby to gradually explore levels and rescue fighters trapped in various locations. This design was intended to familiarize players with the game, at least to understand how to use certain fighters. It also aimed to give players a sense of accomplishment. For many new players, this design was quite necessary. Furthermore, these characters ranged from the relatively simple to control Kirby, Bowser, and Donkey Kong, to the more complex Link, Fox, and Samus, covering all bases. Besides these, the game also contained some RPG elements. Players would earn a certain amount of gold coins after each battle. These gold coins could be used in the in-game store of Smash Bros. to purchase randomly refreshed outfits, extra music soundtracks, as well as Spirits and snacks for nurturing Spirits. Unlocking new fighters and purchasing collectibles with gold coins were primarily intended to divert players' frustration after losses, as Smash Bros. was, after all, a competitive action game. However, as a player, Song Ren obviously didn't need to overthink these design choices. Although he regretted not being able to use Cloud for his first battle, he still maintained his anticipation for the game.

Looking at the eight fighters before him, Song Ren thought for a moment and chose Kirby as his character. As for why? Does it even need to be said? In the game's CG animation, it was the central protagonist. Although Samus was indeed beautiful, Kirby was strong! Otherwise, how could it be its turn to save the world? And this pink demon was formidable; it could eat anything and then use the opponent's abilities. After confirming his selection of Kirby, Song Ren looked at the nine levels of AI opponents and, without any hesitation, decisively chose the lowest difficulty, Level 1 AI. A towering building starts from the ground up; as someone who struggles with fighting games, he knew his limits.

"This map is packed with details!" Entering the game, his opponent was Link, and the map was also the Great Plateau from Breath of the Wild. The VR mode's perspective, compared to previous first-person and third-person views, felt a bit strange with its scroll-like map. But the game map was full of details. The maps in the game were divided into three modes: Normal mode, Battlefield mode, and Final Destination mode. In Normal mode, the in-game map would change naturally, and random events would occur as players battled. Simply put, Normal mode had more variables, and stage hazards would introduce many uncertainties to the battle. In Battlefield mode, the map remained constant and featured platforms for standing, making it a common competitive map. As for Final Destination mode, it had no platforms, so players didn't need to consider platforming, making the fight more intense and exciting, but eliminating the skill of moving between platforms. Currently, Song Ren had chosen Item + Normal mode. The fighters' movements on the map, the dust they kicked up, and the dynamic feedback of plants swaying in the wind were all very well done. Moreover, the camera wasn't fixed during combat in the game. It would zoom in or out with the character, which was perfect. If it were just about the graphics, Song Ren, who had played top-tier blockbusters like The Elder Scrolls and Uncharted, could only say that while Smash Bros. wasn't stunning, it was far from lacking. However, it was incredibly rich, with every detail meticulously crafted. Especially the recreation of character movements, which was simply peerless. As for Kirby, Song Ren had only cleared Kirby's Dream Land on the Switch platform but hadn't delved deeply into it. But The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was extremely familiar to him; as a member of Hyrule's Old Rogue, he had invested hundreds of hours into it. And Link, controlled by the computer, whether drawing his sword, charging, drawing his bow, or throwing bombs, was almost perfectly recreated. Furthermore, what made Song Ren a little excited was the game's overall experience.

"Kirby is indeed strong!"

In the game, Song Ren was practically thrashing Link. This gave him an indescribable sense of exhilaration. Of course, he subconsciously overlooked the fact that he was actually fighting an AI opponent, and the lowest level one at that. In the game, this lowest-level AI was not the typical kind that wouldn't defend, attack, or dodge. Because such an AI wouldn't be much different from a wooden dummy. As a designer who deeply understood player psychology, Chen Xu knew that a dummy-like AI wouldn't bring much joy to players, so the game's AI was significantly improved. This applied not only to high-level AI but even more so to low-level AI. Although it was just a Level 1 AI, it was quite intelligent. It could even read player commands, much like the lion in Elden Ring: if a player shot arrows at it, the lion would sway left and right; if you shot directly at it, you'd never hit, requiring prediction. A more direct example was Psycho Mantis, a BOSS from Metal Gear in his previous life. Players could never defeat him with a 1P controller because Psycho Mantis would read their input commands and dodge, but if they switched to a 2P controller, Psycho Mantis would be helpless and get blown up like a target. Now, the low-level AI in Smash Bros. gave players a feeling that no matter how they attacked, it would connect. Under such meticulous design, first-time players like Song Ren felt only one word: exhilarating! Controlling Kirby in the game, he relentlessly thrashed the AI-controlled Link, even though it was just with basic attacks. But the visual effects of the combos, and the vibration feedback from the gaming pod, left him with only one feeling—exhilaration! Charged smash attacks, Side Specials, Up Specials, and dazzling finishing moves after accumulating energy. Song Ren had never felt such exhilaration playing a fighting game before. Especially with Smash Bros.'s highly integrated controls, there was no need for complex input commands at all. He knew that in some past fighting games, let alone ultimate moves, he couldn't even execute basic skills. His only attack method was basic attacks.

"This game really feels so simple!"
