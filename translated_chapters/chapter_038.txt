Chapter 38: The True Meaning of Going to the Moon

Why did Johnny want to go to the moon?

Because even though his childhood memories were blurred by Beta-blockers.

Even though he had forgotten that he had actually met Liva long ago.

But he still remembered that promise.

“What if we get lost, or forget?”

“Then let's meet on the moon!”

In the days after Liva left Johnny, this thought slowly emerged from the depths of his memory.

He had forgotten everything; he had forgotten how he first met Liva, he had forgotten their conversations.

But the only thing he remembered was that he had to go to the moon, because Liva had gotten lost in his life, and he had to go to the moon to find Liva.

Similarly, why did Liva keep folding paper bunnies throughout her life?

Because through Johnny's words, Liva realized that Johnny couldn't remember their first meeting.

So throughout her life, Liva had been folding paper bunnies, using her own way to remind Johnny that they had actually met long ago.

Likewise, Liva was willing to sacrifice her own health to build houses, also to help Johnny remember everything.

Because at their first meeting, Liva had opened her heart to Johnny, comparing stars to lighthouses gazing at each other.

And Johnny felt there was something special about Liva, something he needed.

It was also because they had already met.

All the mysteries were finally unveiled.

What Johnny wanted wasn't to go to the moon, but to be by Liva's side.

I cannot articulate my feelings, but I will spend my life trying to make you remember, shining upon you like a beacon. This is a kind of obsession, an obsession misunderstood by others.

Even though I have lost my memories of you, I have never forgotten our promise to meet on the moon.

Looking at Liva, holding a platypus toy in her hand and gazing at the distant moon.

In an instant, all the players' eyes blurred.

‘Damn, what kind of game is this! I can't see the game screen anymore!’

‘Can't see the game screen +1.’

‘F*ck, my eyes are stinging! I must have been watching the live stream for too long!’

‘The game experience felt a bit boring before, but now all I want to say is why!’

‘Tears are gushing! I can't hold it back anymore!’

‘It's not a sin for men to cry, look, even the boss's eyes are red.’

‘What does it mean for a tough guy to cry? This is it!’

‘This is too much! I can't take it anymore!’

The game used a flashback narrative, starting with the suspense of going to the moon, piquing players' doubts and curiosity.

Slowly, the final secret was peeled back and revealed to the players.

Coupled with the in-game background music, it instantly moved countless players.

Especially some emotional players, with everything revealed, couldn't help but burst into tears.

Whether male or female.

Everyone was moved by the story between Liva and Johnny.

“What the heck, I never thought this game would break me!” Dong Zhen pulled a tissue from beside him, blew his nose, his eyes red from trying to hold back tears.

However, to everyone's surprise, the game didn't end there.

As Dr. Neil and Dr. Eva conversed, everyone suddenly remembered.

This was all happening within Johnny's memories.

They still had a contract with Johnny: to go to the moon.

Neil: ‘What if they actually got lost?... Wait, does that mean?’

Eva: ‘Don't tell me you haven't guessed.’

Neil: ‘I originally thought this would be an inspiring fairy tale...’

Eva: ‘I should have known some little girl would join in and turn it into a farce... I think now we know how to send him to the moon.’

Neil: ‘Wait, you're not actually thinking of doing that, are you? You wouldn't!’

Eva: ‘It's our job, Neil... It's our obligation under the contract.’

Neil: ‘Damn it... Eva, wait!’

As the two conversed, Eva's figure vanished from Johnny's childhood memories.

Neil then chased after her.

Sitting in front of the computer, Dong Zhen suddenly had a bad feeling.

“Wait, what does this female doctor want to do?”

Through memories, Neil found Eva in high school.

At the same time, the game's background music became tense and urgent, and the screen turned into an old, dark yellow photo-style filter.

Neil: ‘I know what you're planning to do!’

Eva: ‘Listen, our contract requires us to send him to the moon, and the only way to achieve that is to give Johnny the motivation to go to the moon.’

Neil: ‘So this means Liva must be removed, but if we do that, what's the point of going to the moon? The real reason he wants to go to the moon is because Liva left him.’

Eva: ‘I understand, but we are bound by law and contract, especially...’

Neil: ‘To hell with the f***ing contract! My job isn't to make him miserable! Eva! I don't know about you, but I do this job so those strange old guys can leave this world happily! What about you?’

As the two conversed, Dong Zhen's ominous feeling was finally confirmed.

This female doctor actually wants to remove Liva!

Although her reasons were quite legitimate.

Because the law and contract did not explicitly state otherwise.

However, players who had spent several hours experiencing the game and understood the story between Johnny and Liva clearly couldn't accept such a situation.

“How can this old hag be so cruel?!”

“How can this old hag be so rigid?!”

“Oh my god... I can't stand this anymore!”

If they were moved by Liva and Johnny's story before.

Then now they could be just as angry.

Dong Zhen, who was live streaming, couldn't help but bang on the table.

Including the bullet comments in the live stream, which were now flooding the screen.

Clearly, no one could accept such a situation.

What the hell is this!

What kind of f***ing contract, what kind of f***ing law is this!

What Johnny wanted wasn't to go to the moon, he needed Liva!

And now, this old hag actually wants to remove Liva, how the f*** can anyone tolerate that?

However, whether it was the viewers watching the live stream, or players like Dong Zhen, or even Neil in the game, no one seemed able to stop it.

Eva, who had higher control over the machine, continuously removed and modified Liva from every corner of Johnny's memories.

And in this process, she also created many traps to block Neil.
