Chapter 204: The Choice Is: Minecraft (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Without fully explaining to the curious crowd, Chen Xu simply chatted for a while before returning to his office.

Leaning back in his chair, Chen Xu gazed at a set of platform data Lin Rou had just sent him on his computer, then narrowed his eyes in thought.

The Nebula Games Platform currently boasted 91 million registered users. Its daily active users hovered around 17 million. The highest peak concurrent user count reached 4.1 million after last year's gameplay Expo, when Fall Guys was released. Of course, this figure wasn't for a single game, but the cumulative total of multiple games. For a single platform, this number was already quite impressive. However, compared to distribution platforms, it was nothing.

Currently, the top-tier competition among domestic channels was primarily between the two giants, TengHua and NetDragon. Some second and third-tier channels maintained independent operations, but many had also joined the ranks of these two companies. After Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame launched, both TengHua and NetDragon had proposed acquiring a portion of Nebula Games' shares and integrating them into their respective ecosystems, but Chen Xu had politely declined them all.

Now, Chen Xu felt it was time to take another step forward. However, this was by no means an easy step. In Chen Xu's plan, the games they would release next would primarily focus on player-to-player connections. They wouldn't be purely multiplayer games, but they needed to offer features and content that allowed players on the platform to interact and share experiences with each other.

Don't Starve, in this regard, served as a multi-faceted trial run. It was a test of player purchasing power when only available on the Nebula Games Platform. Simultaneously, it was a trial to see if players in the Parallel World could accept sandbox gameplay. With 1.9 million sales in two weeks, reaching 4 million sales in the first month wouldn't be difficult, and the sales trend remained relatively stable, with various player MODs slowly starting to be released.

Players of both Overcooked and Fall Guys had demonstrated their creativity, and for Nebula Games Platform players, the Workshop had become a very distinctive selling point and feature of the platform. Under these circumstances, considering various factors, Chen Xu felt it was almost time to launch a sandbox game that would captivate players. And this would also be Nebula Games' trump card weapon to further advance the platform. Therefore, Chen Xu's choice was: Minecraft.

As for the reasons behind choosing this game, they were quite simple, primarily revolving around three aspects.

The first point was its overwhelming success. How successful? From a commercial performance perspective, in his previous life, Minecraft achieved over 200 million global sales within ten years. Whether on mobile phones, PC, consoles, VR, or handhelds, Minecraft's presence could be felt almost everywhere.

The second point was Minecraft's unique charm. The world presented in Minecraft wasn't about flashy graphics and special effects; rather, it focused on gameplay. Take building blocks, for instance; most people have probably played with them, or even if not, they've had a similar desire to create a world of their own. Building with blocks, constructing on paper with a paintbrush, or even visualizing it in their minds with closed eyes. Minecraft offered precisely that, providing players with such a channel in an extremely simple way. Players could create and destroy blocks within the game's three-dimensional space, crafting exquisite buildings, creations, and works of art.

Of course, if that were its only feature, Minecraft wouldn't have reached such heights. Its almost limitless modes allowed players to create on various multiplayer game servers or in their Single-Player Mode, and it even boasted many special functions, such as Redstone circuits for logic operations and remote actions, as well as minecarts and tracks. Beyond these, players could also embark on adventures within the game, defeat fearsome BOSSes, and play it like an RPG. But no matter the gameplay style, Minecraft always revolved around one core principle: creation.

It wasn't just about building with blocks; it also involved scientific creation, encompassing Redstone circuit gameplay with its logic operations and remote actions. One could say Minecraft was more than just a simple game; without aesthetic design and spatial thinking, you couldn't even build a good-looking house. For example, others' bases were always luxurious large villas, while your house looked like a prison from the outside, and walking inside... well, it looked even more like one!

Just as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time in his previous life defined what a 3D game was, Minecraft defined what a sandbox game was. As a result, when people in his previous life discussed sandbox games, they inevitably associated it with Minecraft. Even though Minecraft didn't invent the sandbox genre, its success and perfection practically tied the genre to itself. In the words of many MC players, playing MC wasn't merely treating it as a game, but as a toy, and its essence lay in providing gameplay as a toy.

What kind of game it was depended entirely on what players perceived it to be.

As for the third point, it was naturally to further enhance the Nebula Games Platform's influence through Minecraft, which itself was arguably the game most perfectly suited for MODs.

Currently, the Nebula Games Platform's operation of the Workshop was already sufficient to support this game, which could be called a masterpiece.

……………………

After deciding on the game, Chen Xu began drafting the concept for Minecraft in his office.

Although it was an incredibly successful game, drafting Minecraft's concept was actually simpler than Dark Souls had been.

Because the game as a whole primarily revolved around creativity. Everything centered on this point.

Compared to Dark Souls, which involved every aspect like art, numerical design, story, and combat system, Minecraft, while not exactly simple, wasn't as complicated as one might imagine.

After about two days, Chen Xu had completed the initial draft of Minecraft's design concept. Meanwhile, Ruan Ningxue, Qin Yi, and others were still busy with Don't Starve's MOD community maintenance.

After confirming there were no omissions, Chen Xu called Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, and others who were still working into the meeting room for a conference.
