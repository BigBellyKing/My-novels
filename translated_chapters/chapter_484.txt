Chapter 483: Contents of Nebula World (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

“Please give it a rest, you’re not much better than me!” Song Ren pouted, but he too had opened the in-game store.

He could purchase items now, but he couldn't equip any decorations.

He also noticed that the store had a wide variety of categories, covering all games under Nebula Games up to that point.

However, he found that he couldn't claim many items because he hadn't achieved the corresponding accomplishments in those games. Looking at the numerous items, he quickly spent the 10,000 gold coins the system had given him.

Then he used some tokens to buy a few more things. After all, Nebula Games had refunded a lot of tokens previously, and he had purchased most of Nebula Games' titles at launch. As for third-party games, he honestly bought anything that interested him immediately. He knew that any discounted games he bought were basically just to add one more to his collection, so he hadn't bothered with them, leaving him with plenty of tokens. Now was a good time to use them on these decorative items, and with discount coupons, it was quite cost-effective.

“Eh… why is there also a skill tree here?” Song Ren suddenly noticed something. Besides the store interface, there was also a skill tree panel.

However, upon clicking into it, most of the entries were question marks. The only visible icon resembled an eye, which looked a little creepy, and he had no idea what it was.

“I’m not sure, it probably hasn’t been updated yet. I feel like this Nebula World will continue to receive updates in the future,” Zhang Yi exclaimed, looking at the surrounding scenery. The graphics were no worse than Uncharted!

“Stop talking nonsense, let’s go check out the VR theme. I wonder if there’s any new content,” Song Ren suggested. When the VR theme first came out, it was completely different from other game developers', and he had been obsessed with farming and husbandry for a while. However, once the novelty wore off, even though he heard Nebula Games kept updating it, he mostly just logged in occasionally to harvest crops.

Now, with the emergence of Nebula World and this so-called Plane Exploration, it felt like a sci-fi movie. Although Song Ren felt this feature was probably just like a demo version of a game, it didn't stop him from being interested.

“Which one should we check first?” Zhang Yi had no objections.

“Warcraft, I guess. Damn it, all the other themes have actual games, but Mr. Chen never ported this one to VR, yet he made a VR theme for it. It's truly his favorite child!” Song Ren grumbled inwardly.

“RTS games aren’t very suitable for VR gameplay, so it makes sense,” Zhang Yi said.

“You're right,” Song Ren nodded. Soon, the two stepped into a portal, and the Starry Sky scene reappeared. To Song Ren's surprise, he could actually see Zhang Yi’s character beside him. Previously, he was in a first-person perspective and couldn't see what he looked like. Now, through Zhang Yi, he saw a circle of white light enveloping Zhang Yi, carrying him through countless stars, eventually arriving at one of the planets. Finally, two beams of light descended at the gates of Stormwind, and at that moment, a prompt appeared before Zhang Yi and Song Ren.

“To prevent detection and expulsion by the World Consciousness, please choose an identity to merge with the world.”

Following this, a series of options appeared before Song Ren and Zhang Yi, representing various classes and races. However, there weren't many choices, only the basic classes of Mage, Warrior, and Priest. As for races, there were only Humans, Dwarves, and Night Elves.

“Damn it! There’s actually a race system and a class system?” Song Ren was stunned. This was new; previously, the Stormwind theme was just a tourist scene. But now, you could even choose a race and class? Does that mean there’s also combat content? Zhang Yi was equally surprised. As for the explanation about the World Consciousness, neither of them paid it much mind, as it was just a lore setting.

After all, in Nebula World, they had all sorts of outfits. Wouldn't it be too out of place to enter a fantasy world wearing a suit? Similarly, if it were a game like Uncharted, wearing medieval armor would also be jarring. But if it were mandatory, it might make players feel disgusted, thinking, 'Why can't I just enter as I am?' Using this 'World Consciousness' concept provides a perfect explanation: it's not that Nebula Games won't let you enter that way, it's the game's World Consciousness that won't—it's all the World Consciousness's fault!

“What class did you pick?” Song Ren curiously asked Zhang Yi. He himself chose a Warrior. There were four skills in total: Heroic Strike, Rend Armor, Charge, and Taunt. He briefly looked at the descriptions, which were roughly Attack, Armor Reduction, Charge and Stun, and drawing monster aggro—four skills with different characteristics.

“Definitely a Mage! How cool!” Zhang Yi replied.

“Hmph, little Mage. If we could PvP, I’d chop you to bits with one strike!” Song Ren said dismissively. A Mage? A class that ambushes people from behind with hidden arrows—how could it be as awesome as his mighty Warrior? Just think of Hellscream in Warcraft, how powerful he was! It was a shame there didn't seem to be PvP.

Song Ren and Zhang Yi chatted away, unaware that the Stormwind setting was actually Chen Xu’s attempt at various experiments, including combat and skill design tests. As for content, Stormwind did offer quite a bit of gameplay. For example, players could learn about the stories of Azeroth here. They could also enter a simple dungeon, fight some monsters, earn some gold coins, and then return to Nebula World to buy decorative items. Of course, this had a weekly cap; the amount given at once was generous, but players couldn't grind it repeatedly.

Currently, Nebula World, including these main scenarios, was primarily a form of easter egg content for players, still in an incomplete state. As for pay-to-win elements… *cough, cough*, servers cost money, too. Moreover, even without spending money, items were relatively easy to obtain; it wasn't a case where only paying players could acquire them. Additionally, the discount coupons served as a crossover with merchandise, as the official collectible figures often had various discounts anyway. Nebula World was still in Chen Xu's trial run phase. Primarily, current technology couldn't fully support it, so this was more of an experiment. When other game developers eventually wanted to create similar Metaverses, Nebula Games would already have a significant advantage.

Secondly, there was another important aspect: some new work content was hidden within. Wandering around Stormwind, Zhang Yi and Song Ren soon found a location related to combat. By the canal next to the Mage District, there was a heavily guarded prison. Upon approaching, they could talk to the warden, Selvert, to receive a quest.

“They’ve had riots before, but this time it’s unusual. Some evil and terrifying power seems to have driven them mad, and some have even turned into beasts… No, something even more cruel and terrifying than Orcs. Warrior, can you help me quell this riot and find out the cause?” With Warden Selvert’s worried words, Song Ren and Zhang Yi accepted a quest.
