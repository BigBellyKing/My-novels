Chapter 82: Your Art Style Has Changed!

On the day of the exhibition, the weather was excellent, overcast with a moderate temperature. Players from Modu and all over the country gathered here, lining up to enter. The entire venue was a sea of people.

However, for exhibitors like Chen Xu and his team, there was no need to queue with the players, as there was a dedicated entrance for vendors.

Arriving at the exhibition hall in Zone Six, invited media and exhibitors were preparing to enter early through dedicated channels.

“NetDragon has a strong lineup! It seems they've prepared a brand new VR blockbuster!”

“Not just NetDragon, TengHua also has a blockbuster.”

“These two are really going head-to-head!”

“Ah, it's tough for us ordinary small studios this year.”

Even though it was a dedicated channel, the crowd was still considerable, as it included not only staff from game developers but also their respective showgirls and cosers, so people still had to queue to enter the hall.

During this time, some designers and representatives from game developers who knew each other started chatting.

Chen Xu also glanced at the exhibition halls of his two neighbors to his left and right.

It was clear their personalities were distinct. TengHua had a massive LCD screen directly displaying a cool promotional video, which was likely their main attraction for this exhibition.

NetDragon was no less impressive. Besides promotional videos and posters, they featured a uniformly glamorous lineup of long-legged showgirls, whose heights seemed indistinguishable, making them quite eye-catching.

As for Zone Six, where Chen Xu and his team were sandwiched in the middle, it was a bit of a hodgepodge.

“Teacher Chen? Is this your first time attending an exhibition? Your coser and showgirl costumes aren't fully prepared?” Someone came over to strike up a conversation.

After all, the buzz generated by Nebula Games in the second half of last year and during this year's Spring Festival was still fresh in everyone's minds.

Basically, everyone in the gaming industry, especially independent game designers, had studied Chen Xu's works.

Nebula Games' logo was still very noticeable.

Of course, there was another reason: compared to the lineups of other exhibitors, Nebula Games' presence was indeed a bit unconventional.

What was the situation with the other game developers?

Cosers were dressed in various coser costumes, holding some lighter cosplay props in their hands.

Showgirls wore various OL and JK uniforms, which were very pleasing to the eye.

But what about Chen Xu's lineup?

A few were relatively normal, carrying weapon props and wearing armored cosplay costumes.

But what about the rest?

There were both men and women, tall and short, all wearing sneakers and casual outfits.

It was only because they were wearing ID badges.

Otherwise, people would have thought that players had come to the wrong place, or that the entire Nebula Games company had come to exhibit.

“They're all prepared, but they're inside the exhibition hall. We'll change into them later,” Chen Xu explained with a smile.

Hearing Chen Xu's words, various expressions appeared on people's faces.

Shock and bewilderment; they wondered what on earth Chen Xu was thinking.

However, no one delved deeper into the topic.

“Our exhibition area's location this time is really a bit awkward!” someone next to them exclaimed.

“Yeah, I feel like all the attention will be snatched up by these two!” commented a designer from one of the exhibitors, looking at the halls of the two giants next to them.

“No choice, they're giants after all, and this time they've even brought new VR blockbusters.”

Hearing their conversation, Chen Xu chuckled and interjected, “Not necessarily. After all, there are so many players attending the exhibition; NetDragon and TengHua might not be able to capture all the players' attention. Besides, there will be queues at the exhibition areas, so some players definitely won't want to wait in line. From a certain perspective, this could actually be more advantageous for us.”

“Teacher Chen makes a good point!”

“That's true when you put it that way!”

“When the first and second place fight, the third place dies, but that also depends on the situation!”

“Teacher Chen, can you leave us your contact information? We can have more in-depth discussions in the future.”

“Exactly, we can all have in-depth exchanges with each other.”

The designers around them chatted while queuing.

Chen Xu also exchanged contact information with the people present and joined a newly created group.

Although it was the independent game exhibition hall, those invited to attend were generally designers and exhibitors with some capability in the gaming industry.

Getting to know more people certainly had its benefits.

What's more, since they had already decided to gradually start operating the Nebula Games platform.

It was naturally inevitable that they would need to engage with third-party game developers later on.

Early-stage second and third-tier companies were not Chen Xu's initial consideration, but a large number of independent game designers were an excellent entry point.

After chatting with the various designers and exhibitor representatives present.

Soon, Chen Xu and his team also entered the exhibition hall.

Because players hadn't entered yet, the entire hall was still very spacious.

Chen Xu's cosers and showgirls were also preparing to change into their costumes.

“What exactly are these people staring at?” Yang Xin, who was accompanying them, grumbled.

“Exactly, why are they all looking at us?” Ruan Ningxue also found it a bit strange.

Because they noticed that people at other booths in the exhibition area were all looking at them with curiosity.

“After all, we have the largest booth in this exhibition area, so it's natural for them to be a bit curious. Didn't you two keep staring at NetDragon and TengHua's areas earlier?” Chen Xu said.

“Ah, I see!” Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin nodded in understanding. That made sense.

But if that was the case, Nebula Games had quite a reputation now!

Both of them felt a surge of emotion.

At this moment, staff members pushed over the mascot costumes that had been prepared earlier and stored in the exhibition hall.

The accompanying cosers all stepped forward, took their respective mascot costumes, and put them on. At the same time, staff members hung up the prepared game promotional posters.

The most prominent among them were posters for Sanguosha and Fall Guys.

When seen together, they actually felt a bit incongruous.

After all, one featured a realistic art style, while the other was completely cartoonish.

But separated, they looked much better.

So, at the booth, Chen Xu had specifically arranged one on the left and one on the right.

In the middle were displays of Nebula Games' older titles.

Many other game developers had been keeping an eye on Chen Xu's situation.

When they saw the cosers, who previously weren't wearing cosplay costumes, directly putting on mascot suits and transforming into comical Fall Guys characters and chefs like the little crocodile from Overcooked, many people from the game development companies were stunned.

Because this was just too unique!

Even though their section was the independent game zone's exhibition hall, looking across the entire venue, it was almost uniformly filled with various long-legged figures.

But what about Chen Xu's side?

It was as if they had arrived at a children's playground; the art style felt completely different!

However, they didn't have much time left for such exclamations.

Because as time drew near, various areas of the exhibition opened to the public, and players began entering in succession.
