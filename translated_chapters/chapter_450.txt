Chapter 449: Enthusiastic and Excited Players (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Zhang Yi wasn't the only one bewildered; many players who had logged into Huanyu VR, downloaded the Animus from the Nebula Games Platform, and experienced it were completely dumbfounded.

At first, everyone was startled, not understanding what this Animus thing was, but it sounded incredibly impressive.

However, with the introduction, players quickly realized that this device was merely a preview for Nebula Games' new title.

Using a machine called Animus to read ancestral memories and then re-experience magnificent history. It was made to seem like some genuine black technology.

Despite this, the Animus concept surprised many players, as it was quite astonishing.

But before they could finish being surprised, the twist immediately followed.

The final mechanical line, 'You have been chosen!', implied that things weren't as simple as they thought.

This machine seemed to have some mastermind behind it. And that mysterious symbol was clearly the mark of the mastermind.

But the crucial issue was, it just ended there!

Many players erupted in frustration over this.

"I'm utterly impressed! I initially thought it was some black technology, but I never imagined this thing was Nebula Games' promotional program!"

"+1, I didn't expect it either, but the key is, if it's a promotional program, then just promote it. Why do they have to make grand promises and keep us in suspense even for a promotion?"

"Exactly, it's too much! If it were a game demo teasing us, fine, but even a promotional video teasing us like this is just excessive!"

"Damn it, we can't encourage Mr. Chen's malicious practices. We must strongly resist, otherwise, Mr. Chen will turn into a Riddler-like figure for every game, and that's just going to drive us crazy!"

"Right! And I don't know if you noticed, but this promotional video seems to reveal a lot of content, but in reality, besides a background, it reveals nothing at all!"

As the Animus content was released, many players expressed their strong disapproval.

It revealed absolutely no specific information, yet it intentionally heightened their anticipation.

They had foolishly thought that Animus was some incredible program at first.

In the end, it turned out to be a promotion for a new game, and if you're promoting, just promote.

Why be a Riddler-like figure!

Aside from guessing that players might eventually experience history through this Animus machine, everything else was unknown, even the game's name.

………………

"Players are truly passionate! Thankfully, I anticipated their excitement and was well-prepared."

In Nebula Games, Mr. Chen looked at the comments below his official Weibo account and couldn't help but sigh with emotion.

"Mr. Chen, this player enthusiasm scares even us," Ruan Ningxue, who was beside him, couldn't help but grumble inwardly.

They were too enthusiastic; so much so that not only Mr. Chen's official Weibo account and Nebula Games' official Weibo account, but even their staff members' Weibo accounts were overrun by excited players.

They constantly threatened to send local specialties like razor blades and grenades. Who could handle that!

"Don't worry, we released Animus first because the promotional video wasn't ready. Now is the perfect time to satisfy their craving," Mr. Chen said with a smile.

As for the game content? He had only recently returned from Italy, so development certainly hadn't started yet!

And isn't it common sense to create promotional CG before developing a game?

………………

The highly emotional Nebula Games players online immediately discovered Mr. Chen's Weibo post.

Seeing a video attachment on it, all the players instantly perked up.

Because they knew, this was what they wanted!

"Holy cow, it actually came!"

"What's this called? The squeaky wheel gets the grease?"

"Damn, who compares themselves to a child?"

"Stop it, hurry up and take a look!"

With excited hearts, players who had been tormented by the Animus for almost a week eagerly clicked on the video.

After a brief darkness,

The screen showed a cluttered room, surrounded by messy equipment.

Near the corner was an Animus machine.

On it lay a young man.

Suddenly, the young man sat up, and his internal monologue began.

'My name is Desmond Miles, a prisoner of this war.'

'It is a war I've known, waged by two factions I once believed were never real.'

'Assassins... and Templar Knights.'

'This is a war that has lasted for thousands of years, perhaps since the dawn of human civilization.'

Desmond sat on the bed, staring expressionlessly at the gleaming metal wall.

'Before this, I was forced by them to awaken the memories of my ancestors through the Animus.'

'And it showed me the truth of this war that has lasted countless years, something I never believed in, something I once wanted to forget.'

'Thousands of years of history flowing in my blood were presented by this machine.'

As Desmond's internal monologue continued, the screen's image suddenly shattered like a broken mirror.

Then, reassembling, the scene began to shift.

Armies bearing the Crusader emblem, and Assassins in white hoods.

Notre-Dame Cathedral, Egyptian Pyramids, ancient attire like that of Spartan warriors, ships and cannons from the modern era sailing across oceans.

Renaissance era Florence, the Sacred Land of Jerusalem... countless fragments of memory, finally settled in a dimly lit underground chamber.

In the center, something resembling an apple or a disc, shimmered with a golden glow.

'They are using the Animus and me, to find something by reading the memories of my ancestors, flowing in my DNA.'

'The Apple of Eden, one of the Pieces of Eden.'

'The Templar Knights collected it and showed me its terrifying power.'

'If they obtain all the Pieces of Eden, everything will change; they want to enslave all humanity.'

Innumerable images intertwined; the Assassin in a white hood stood atop the Florence Cathedral, overlooking the entire city.

The Assassin's memories mixed with Desmond's, making his gaze gradually firm.

'When they brought me here, I was afraid they would hurt me if I resisted.'

'But now... I worry that if I don't resist, something I don't want to see will eventually happen...'

'I can't do all of this alone...'

'But fortunately, I am not alone in this fight. I met a person named Lucy, and I think she is on my side.'

The memory screen switched to a blonde woman. She looked at Desmond, her right hand subtly placed on her chest.

At the same time, she slowly bent her right ring finger, concealing it within her clothes.

At a glance, it looked as if she was missing a finger.

'My time is running out, but thankfully, the Animus's miraculous power allows me to uncover the instincts buried in my DNA.'

'Though there are some hidden dangers, this is the fastest way for me to master Assassin techniques.'

Taking a deep breath, Desmond lay back down and slowly closed his eyes.

The video then faded to black.

After watching this video, players finally became truly excited, because unlike the previous Animus teaser, this video genuinely gave players a lot of information.

First, the main story content of the game was more or less confirmed for players.

It was about the Assassin and Templar Knight organizations, engaged in countless years of war, extending through various historical conflicts.

And in modern times, both the Assassin organization and the Templar Knight organization still exist.

Desmond is a member of the Assassins, and the Templar Knights found Desmond, using the Animus machine to activate the memories of Desmond's ancestors.

The purpose was to find the whereabouts of the Pieces of Eden, and players would clearly be playing as characters from the Assassin faction.

At the same time, the main gameplay of the game would likely involve experiencing various historical events.

The Crusades and the Renaissance were some of the contents already shown in the promotional video.

Innumerable players cheered and rejoiced, and the forums were filled with all sorts of player discussions.

But two consecutive rounds of promotion still left players unable to suppress their excitement.

In contrast, Zeus felt as if they'd been hit by a truck.

The hype was stolen again!

Nebula Games, why do you have so many flashy and gaudy tricks?

And you even made something called Animus!

And why are you players so excited?

Didn't you notice that while Nebula Games' promotion seems powerful, with two consecutive rounds within a week, you still know nothing?

You don't know the game's development progress, its genre, its gameplay, or even its name. Why are you so excited? Seeing the excited players, Zeus felt utterly exhausted.
