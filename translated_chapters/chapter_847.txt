Chapter 846: It's No Longer Your Era, Melina

It can be said that in Elden Ring, anyone who loves Souls-like games will find a considerable number of easter eggs.

For example, armor sets similar to the Onion Knight from Dark Souls, and the "Praise the Sun" emblem.

The chainsaw from Bloodborne, the Mortal Blade from Sekiro—all these can be found in the game.

Furthermore, in terms of plot, the downfall of the Nox shadows the Cthulhu Mythos. The Nox discovered a Supreme Being, and curiosity drove them to constantly explore, delve deeper into the unknown, and seek the truth behind it.

But because the Nox and this Supreme Being were not creatures of the same dimension, not only did glimpsing the entity drive them to madness, but it also brought disaster to the Lands Between.

Secondly, the game boasts excellent plot design, character design, and level design.

In Elden Ring, players immediately feel that familiar Souls-like flavor.

While the game contains stories of immense oppression and despair, it also features some heartwarming tales. Although most often ending in despair, the Tarnished, as the player, witnesses all these stories.

Master Sellen, located in the Sellia Underground, serves as the player's early-game magic instructor and leaves a profound impression.

She constantly cares for the Tarnished, her apprentice, and even when trapped, only asks her beloved apprentice for help. When she returns to the Raya Lucarian Academy after defeating Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, Sellen makes a promise to the Tarnished: "I only hope you remember, even if you become Elden Lord, I am still your teacher, and you are still my beloved apprentice. If you fail to become Elden Lord, return to me. Don't worry, even if an apprentice is not cut out for it, there is still a place for them."

Then there's Alexander the Warrior Jar. The first time you meet Alexander, on Saintsbridge in Limgrave, this large jar is stuck in the ground and needs the player's help.

Later, the Warrior Jar reunites with the Tarnished at Redmane Castle, participating in Starscourge Radahn's farewell celebration, and gathering the corpses of fallen powerful warriors to further himself.

Throughout the journey, Alexander the Warrior Jar, this honest and valiant warrior, forms a deep friendship with the Tarnished, much like the Onion Knight in Dark Souls.

Finally, in Crumbling Farum Azula, Alexander asks for a battle against the Tarnished—a true warrior's battle.

Alexander's body is shattered in this fight, but he expresses no resentment, only some regret.

"I truly could not reach that realm after all. My current vessel cannot bear it!"

"Thank you. You truly are the hero I acknowledge. This battle was magnificent. Please accept the contents within me."

"A jar cannot escape the fate of shattering, and I, Alexander, will be a Warrior Jar until my last breath! Carry me forward, brave warrior!"

After receiving Alexander's contents, you head to Jarburg near the Carian Study Hall. There, you meet a small jar, one of Alexander's kin. It thanks the Tarnished for bringing news of Alexander and decides to embark on its own journey to become the new Warrior Jar.

There's also the Spirit Jellyfish Ashes given to the player by Roderika at the beginning. From battling Margit, the Fell Omen, it accompanies the player. Although its power quickly becomes insufficient to aid the Tarnished, it silently guards the Tarnished until they reach the Stargazer's Ruins in the Mountaintops of the Giants, where another jellyfish named Clarissa has been waiting.

And here, the Tarnished learns the name of the jellyfish accompanying them: Claral.

Their reunion, after countless years, is all thanks to the Tarnished. The two jellyfish happily circle around the Tarnished, then present a Crystal Knife—one of the few truly heartwarming scenes in the game.

In addition, there's Ranni, for whom the Tarnished willingly transforms into a werewolf-like figure; Miriel, Pastor of Vows, the turtle elder who guides players at the Church of Vows; and the Black Knife Blacksmith, who forged the Black Knives and eventually coexists with the Great Blessing after his consciousness becomes hazy from burning the Erdtree.

There are too many memorable moments for players in the game.

However, Elden Ring differs from Bloodborne and Dark Souls in one aspect.

In Bloodborne and Dark Souls, two classic Souls-like games, besides their obscure plots and vast worldviews, players' discussions about the endings could metaphorically lead to them beating each other's brains out.

In Dark Souls, some believe linking the Fire to continue Lord Gwyn's Age of Fire is the correct path, others think ending the Fire is the true way forward, and still others argue that the Lord of Hollows represents the world's true development. Among them, it's like their brains are being hammered out in debate.

Players in Bloodborne are no better, arguing whether becoming a newborn Squid Old God or leaving Yharnam constitutes the better ending.

When it comes to Sekiro, most players tend to favor the Dragon's Homecoming ending.

Because in this route, neither Emma the Physician, who serves as the Fire Keeper, nor Wolf, the Young Lord, and the Divine Child of Rejuvenation die.

Finally, the Young Lord merges into the Divine Child's body, becoming two souls in one body—how satisfying is that?! Just thinking about the journey of the Dragon's Homecoming feels like a solid choice.

As for Elden Ring, there's absolutely no suspense regarding the endings.

There's the Dung Eater's Blessing of Despair, symbolizing the 'small hamburger', which, apart from players with a taste for the grotesque and unique XP, is basically chosen either by accident or out of curiosity for achievement hunting.

As for Fia's Age of the Duskborn and the default Age of Fracture, there's essentially no significant difference from the Age of Order.

If there were no other endings, most players would likely debate between the Age of the Duskborn and the Age of Order.

These are the two most controversial endings, along with the future direction of the Golden Order.

But the crucial point is that there are two other endings that have captivated countless players.

The one with the highest popularity is undoubtedly Ranni's Age of Stars.

And players who believe this is the best ending are clearly not judging it based on the plot.

You say Ranni is too scheming? But she called me Elden Lord and held my hand!

You say Ranni's Age of Stars is bad? But she called me Elden Lord and held my hand!

You say Ranni...? But she called me Elden Lord and held my hand!

That's right, it's that unreasonable. Who can argue when Ranni held my hand and called me Elden Lord?

As for the other Frenzied Flame Ending, most players who choose this path don't necessarily believe that world destruction is the ultimate truth. More often, they simply want to see Melina's slightly whimpering expression before embracing the Frenzied Flame.

"Before, you, Melina, ignored me. Today, I'll make sure you can't reach me. You told me not to touch the Frenzied Flame? Hmph! I'm going to burn everything just for fun!"

"Did you think that just because you approached me first, I, the Tarnished, would follow you for life? I gave you a chance, but you were useless!"

"Now you regret it? Too late! What were you doing earlier?"

"We're already in the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds. It's no longer your era, Melina, understand?"

"Forget Ranni with her four arms who calls me Elden Lord, forget Fia who asks for hugs, even my jellyfish Claral can utterly defeat you!"
