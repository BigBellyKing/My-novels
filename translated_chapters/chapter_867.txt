Chapter 866: You're Telling Me This Is a Fighting Game?

Chapter 866: You're Telling Me This Is a Fighting Game?

Listening to Chen Xu’s words, countless players watching the direct presentation were filled with anticipation.

Accompanying Chen Xu’s explanation, corresponding demo footage would appear on the large screen behind him.

First up was the highly integrated button system. Players would only use a total of six functional buttons:

Directional buttons, Jump button, Normal attack button, Special attack button, Guard button, and Grab button.

There was no Command input system; instead, different skills were activated simply by combining directional buttons with the Normal attack button and Special attack button.

Moreover, the move release buttons were the same for every character.

In addition, the game's Knockback percentage system and Item system were also demonstrated one by one to the players at the direct presentation.

High-end content, such as the game's Follow-up attacks, was naturally not covered in the direct presentation.

However, for most players, it was enough to understand what kind of game this was.

Ordinary players didn't feel much, but some perceptive game designers and media outlets recognized the purpose of this design.

Clearly, Nebula Games aimed to lower the barrier to entry for the game.

Even though Nebula Games never explicitly stated it, it was quite obvious that this was still a fighting game's gameplay.

But could it truly succeed this way? Many felt a touch of doubt.

However, before they could delve too deeply into this, everyone was shocked by the content Chen Xu introduced next.

'As an entertainment-focused action game, we will bring players the richest content in history within the game.'

'The game will feature over 800 original music tracks from various classic IPs!'

'Hundreds of uniquely styled maps will be available for players to choose as battlegrounds, with each map having three different dynamic variations.'

'And nearly a hundred popular game characters from various IPs and worlds will transform into fighters for players to control in intense battles.'

'Finally, the game will also feature a massive single-player story mode.'

'Hundreds of levels with different characteristics, thousands of classic characters from various IPs transformed into Spirits for players to collect.'

As Chen Xu's words fell, the large screen behind him displayed the content he spoke of, one by one.

Global players, including media and the entire gaming industry, were stunned!

This... is this really a fighting game?

This content... you're telling me this is a fighting game?

Nebula Games, is this what your fighting games are like?

All the players, designers, and media watching the direct presentation were in a state of shock.

It was simply too far beyond their expectations.

Based on the content Chen Xu described, they could only use one word to describe this game: lavish.

Indeed, everyone used the same word: lavish.

Characters from different series had their exclusive game maps, and each map had three different forms.

A total of over a thousand BGM theme songs were available to players; one could even treat this game as a music player.

Furthermore, nearly a hundred IP characters set a new record for this genre of game, and each character wasn't merely a superficial skin of an IP.

Despite being a side-scrolling action game, in this Smash Bros.-like title, every character was intricately designed with details reflecting their unique game culture.

Players who had played any game in these series would surely discover these elements of game culture within.

And aside from the meticulously designed World of Light levels, each character also had their own exclusive Trial Path.

Each character would eventually face their destined rival, or the mysterious Master Hand.

A fighting game.

Well, although Nebula Games publicly called it an action game and didn't acknowledge it as a competitive fighting game.

Most players and media, in reality, implicitly considered it a fighting game.

And for a fighting game to feature nearly a hundred playable characters and hundreds of maps, wasn't that a bit too exaggerated?

As for the characters, that's not even a question; the more, the better. Fighting games actually need a sense of novelty.

And what is novelty?

Isn't it different characters? Most players who play fighting games surely do this: in training mode, they select a character they've never played before, one that looks cool, just to see how flashy and awesome their ultimate moves are.

That's the so-called novelty.

So, characters aside, is it really necessary for a fighting game to have hundreds of maps?

Before those present could ponder too long, new footage was quickly displayed on the large screen behind Chen Xu's introduction.

Unlike the previous explanations of game mechanics, this time it was a demonstration of the maps in the game.

Soon, players familiar with certain games began to notice the unique characteristics of these maps.

In typical fighting games, especially side-scrolling ones, the map is essentially just a background.

But in this Smash Bros.-like game, it was completely different.

These maps perfectly recreated the themes of their original games.

As each map appeared, various exclamations erupted from the players below.

'This is High Wall of Lothric, and Aldrich even appears to breathe fire!'

'Haha, Great Plateau is here too!'

Unlike ordinary fighting game maps that serve as mere backgrounds, the maps in this Smash Bros.-like game featured corresponding traps and interactions. It could be said that among these more than 100 maps, no two shared the exact same characteristics.

Furthermore, when battling on these maps, if the switch mode was activated, players could even transition between different forms of the map.

“The unique single-player story mode: World of Light. Heroes from various IPs are controlled by Galeem, and different worlds have merged. Go rescue these trapped heroes!”

As Chen Xu’s words concluded, countless excited players saw the World of Light’s main map appear on the large screen. Unlike the previous incarnation of World of Light, which blended most IPs into themes like jungles, snowy mountains, lava, cities, and deserts, Chen Xu had made slight changes here. This was for the VR version mode. As for Nintendo's VR version on the Switch in the previous life, that was truly just for fun.

Therefore, in the game's background, Chen Xu designed the World of Light as an Open world game, following an Open-world mode, and reasonably planned different levels. For Chen Xu, this part was relatively easy, as most assets in the asset library could be reused; only some artistic compromises were needed.

High Wall of Lothric, Yharnam, Whiterun, castles, Great Plateau—familiar scenes appeared on the big screen one after another, thrilling countless players. The entire direct presentation had become a player's carnival.
