# Chapter 296: The RTS Achilles' Heel (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

In the days following Chen Xu's demonstration of the balance in `Warcraft`.

Various online gaming communities, as well as Chen Xu's official Weibo account, were filled with all sorts of comments.

And from these comments, one could see the countless grievances of players.

'That's just too damn unethical! Mr. Chen is something else!'

'Exactly! Exactly! He just dropped a line about a new version launching soon, then played dead!'

'It's agonizing!'

'But what do you guys think this new version will contain? A brand new race? It seemed like we could already control the Naga race in the campaign mode!'

'Yeah, right? And don't you think the Naga race is highly complete, with comprehensive building functions, and units from peasants to Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 are all there? Plus complete offensive and defensive tech, unit skill tech, and even their own shops and heroes. They could totally be released as a new race.'

'I don't think so. The Naga units are simply too strong. I feel like adding them to the game would somewhat break the balance.'

'Exactly, with their performance in the campaign, if the Naga are added, it'll probably really turn into Naga Supremacy.'

'I, for one, think it might be a new story campaign. Could it be the story after Arthas became the Lich King?'

'That's hard to say for sure!'

Players were discussing animatedly, guessing about the information and content of the new version that Chen Xu had previously revealed.

Meanwhile, in the Nebula Games office, Chen Xu was feeling very comfortable and relaxed.

At this moment, he was checking the several RPG maps that Qin Yi and Ruan Ningxue had created.

Chen Xu could tell that the few of them had put a lot of effort into these maps.

Including their level of detail and numerical balance, they were better than in his previous life, as the available resources were different after all.

Additionally, some of the heroes in these maps were also distinct, and they even included several easter egg-like heroes from Nebula Games' own titles.

For example, the Undead from `Dark Souls` and the Azure Star from `Monster Hunter`.

And these maps each had their own unique characteristics.

`Defend the Sword Pass`: Players choose heroes from the Shu Kingdom of the Three Kingdoms to defend against Wei's attacks, with content like dungeons, quests, and grinding for equipment, just like typical RPG gameplay.

`Calamity of the Western World`: Players can choose various heroes and gradually advance the plot, just like a normal RPG. The entire game even spans four to five hours.

`Demon Hunter Chronicles` was divided into different phases: grinding monsters and equipment for progression, then entering a defensive phase, and finally an offensive phase.

As for `Monopoly of the World` and `Pyramid Escape`, the former featured a board game-like gameplay similar to Monopoly, while the latter combined numerous casual mini-games where survival was achieved by maneuvering to avoid traps.

Of course, Chen Xu also made some changes in this aspect.

In his previous life, the RPG maps, mini-games, and tower defense maps in `Warcraft` were generally fine, usually lasting around an hour and a half.

However, some defense maps and RPG maps often had durations of two to three hours, or even four to five hours.

This would often lead to players quitting midway, and once a player quit, especially on a high difficulty, it would become nearly impossible to clear the game.

Therefore, Chen Xu also added a save mechanism to the game.

Players could save their progress if they quit midway and then continue their unfinished game later. Of course, considering server issues, there was also a time limit for this.
