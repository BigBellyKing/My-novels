Chapter 213 Playtest Experience (Fifth update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Inside the Nebula Games office.

Most of the previously planned constructions had been completed, with only a small number still being finalized.

"Mr. Chen, look, TengHua's 'Voyage' has also announced its launch date, on January 21st!" Qin Yi said a little nervously.

"It's fine, don't forget our plan. You don't need to worry about 'Minecraft's' subsequent promotion; I've already arranged everything with the Operations Department," Chen Xu said with a chuckle.

"As for 'Voyage,' that game is completely different from 'Minecraft,' and with this launch date, I think they will feel quite awkward," Chen Xu said with a confident smile.

With only "Don't Starve" as a reference, and "Don't Starve" itself being a rather special sandbox game with strong objectives.

This also led many game designers to only see the survival characteristics.

As a result, all elements instead focused on survival, thus neglecting creation, the greatest feature of sandbox games themselves.

For example, Meng Zuo's "Wasteland."

Including TengHua's newly launched "Voyage," just from the promotional video and materials, Chen Xu could tell that the other party had clearly gone astray.

They completely ignored creation, violating the characteristics of sandbox games.

To be honest, Chen Xu felt that based on the content the other party had released so far, it leaned more towards box garden games like Shenmue, creating a delicate game world and then letting players explore.

However, that being said, Chen Xu felt that these games would generally sell well.

On one hand, the quality is there; on the other hand, although they went astray, they incorporated some sandbox elements, and coupled with the game's own gameplay, it indeed has some appeal.

But if they want to be explosively popular, the probability is not very high.

And now, if 'Voyage's' launch time were after 'Minecraft' officially launched, or synchronized with 'Minecraft's' demo, Chen Xu felt the impact wouldn't be too significant.

Because, still, the gaming industry is not a zero-sum industry, and although "Voyage" is outwardly declared as a sandbox game, its gameplay is completely different from "Minecraft." As for now?

Then Chen Xu could only wish them good luck.

………………

On January 3rd, "Minecraft" officially opened for demo downloads.

It was available for a total of five days.

Players who had been following this game began downloading one after another and couldn't wait to experience it.

Sitting in front of the computer, Wang Han looked at the unlocked game screen and happily took out her phone to snap a photo.

What? Use the system's and game's built-in screenshot key?

No way, I just want to use my phone to take a picture, and even took it upside down, the kind where the focus isn't right.

After taking the photo, Wang Han sent it to Zhang Yi: "When do you get off work!? I've already started playing here!"

Almost instantly, Zhang Yi on the other end of the phone sent a message: "Soon, half an hour. It should take more than an hour to get home. Do you want me to bring you something to eat?"

This was the sentence she was waiting for. Seeing Zhang Yi's message, Wang Han happily typed in her reply: "Get me a roasted duck rice from downstairs when you come back, with cumin on the duck frame, no chili powder."

After a brief chat with Zhang Yi, Wang Han, without hesitation, clicked on the "Minecraft" icon.

I have to say, the previous "Don't Starve" truly amazed her.

The last time she was so engrossed in a game was with "Fall Guys" and "It Takes Two."

In between, she also looked at some sandbox games from other game developers, but they were basically uninteresting.

And she had been looking forward to "Minecraft" for a long time.

Although it was pixel style, and the previous promotional trailer didn't seem to show much, she was still very much looking forward to it.

After all, the previous "Don't Starve" didn't even have a promotional trailer; it was just a text promotion on Chen Xu's official Weibo account.

After entering the game, the Nebula Games LOGO was skipped.

What then entered her sight was a scene like a prairie, only rendered in pixel graphics.

White clouds drifted across the distant sky, and sunlight penetrated them, shining down on the earth.

The clouds in the sky formed the game's name and LOGO: "Minecraft."

At the same time, the shadows cast by the sunlight were also reflected on the ground.

And the opening loading screen was also quite interesting, because it wasn't a typical flat UI interface; it was actually an interactive game UI interface.

In this interface, players controlled Steve, located on an isolated and helpless island.

It wasn't very big, and it was surrounded by invisible walls.

In the distance was an endless sea and the slowly rising morning sun.

And on this island, there were also a few houses.

On them were written "Exit Game," "Options Settings," "MOD Modules," and "Start Game," and so on.

All things were composed of individual blocks.

Wang Han had previously thought that the pixel style would be hard for her to look at.

But now, after entering the game, she realized it was just like the promotional video on Chen Xu's official Weibo account.

Although the game was pixel style, with high-definition textures and the combination of lighting and shadows, these pixel blocks actually had a unique charm.

"It seems a bit different from what I imagined. The scenes in the trailer should also be real."

Looking at this ingenious UI interface, Wang Han couldn't help but sigh in her heart.

Previously, after learning that "Minecraft" was a pixel game, her biggest concern was the visual content.

Although she wasn't a graphics-obsessed player herself, she still hoped to play games with better graphics.

And while "Minecraft" was pixelated, Chen Xu had also meticulously handled the art presentation.

Besides various high-definition textures and lighting and shadow effects, some detailed adjustments were also made.

In "Minecraft," players could clearly see the changes in lighting and shadows, especially since "Minecraft" also had a weather system.

Sunny days after rain, an effect of rainbows and mist combined with lighting and shadows, could be said to be very outstanding.

Especially this loading screen, even more directly allowed players to experience the game's graphics.

Without thinking too much, Wang Han first checked the MOD modules; there wasn't much content, just like with the previous "Don't Starve."

Then she came to the house to start the game.

There were a total of four selectable modes.

The first was 'Single-Player Game,' the second was 'Multiplayer Game,' and the third was 'LAN Game,' allowing players in the same network environment to play together online.

The fourth was 'Community Game,' where players used their own hosts as servers built from game saves.

However, currently it was Early Access mode, so only Single-Player Game and LAN Game were available.

Of course, although it was a single-player game, players could also invite friends through the Nebula Games Platform to join their server.

It sounded like the LAN mode wasn't very useful.

But this mode was mainly prepared for future mobile players, and although PC players generally wouldn't use it, in the words of players, "I can choose not to use it, but you can't not have it," and it wasn't much trouble to add, so it was developed together from the start.

"I can only play single-player mode," Wang Han muttered to herself, then selected the mode and entered the game.
