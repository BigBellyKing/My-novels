Chapter 470: Since We're Here, Why Not Play? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

As Song Ren remained bewildered, Ethan in the game had already reached his destination.

With a 'thump' as the car door closed, Ethan stepped out. Before him lay a country path, and behind, a wide continent.

Song Ren instinctively retreated two steps, then heard Ethan in the game mutter, “Mia… is she really here?”

Hearing Ethan's words, Song Ren felt a pang of frustration. He didn't know if Mia was there, but he was sure nothing good awaited him further on.

He wanted to quit the game immediately, but at the same time, Song Ren was a little curious. After all, it had been several years since Chen Xu last made a horror game. *Outlast* had made Mount Massive Asylum a nightmare for many. As for the later *Silent Hill PT*, it was, after all, just an incomplete DEMO.

Now, faced with this game called *Resident Evil*, Song Ren was both curious and a little scared. After pacing back and forth a couple of times, Song Ren finally decided to test the waters. There was an old saying: 'Since we're already here.' He had specifically waited until midnight to play this, so shouldn't he go in and take a look?

Besides, unlike the Mount Massive Asylum back then, at least it was broad daylight here, and the surroundings were bright. Looking at the environment, Song Ren let out a slight sigh of relief, feeling relatively at ease here.

Song Ren controlled Ethan as he walked deeper into the forest path, encountering many mosquitoes and insects along the way. However, there were no high-tension scenes. Eventually, a large villa appeared in sight, but a big iron gate blocked the way. He went to investigate; the iron gate was locked with chains, making it impossible to open from the front.

“Isn't this the same old trick from *Outlast*?” Song Ren muttered to himself, looking at the impassable main gate and the very obvious small path beside it. He was familiar with this!

Continuing forward, as he rounded a corner, Song Ren saw a figure flash by. But this time, it didn't scare him. Why? Because the figure was too fast; he only heard footsteps and by the time he turned his head, it was gone.

He followed the path further, and along the way, Song Ren also found some decayed corpses and various animal carcasses bound together with blades and iron chains. Under normal circumstances, Song Ren felt he wouldn't be able to handle it. But in Awakening Mode, he felt okay, and these corpses had actually been specially treated, not truly that bloody, just a little disgusting at most.

On the way to the house, controlling Ethan, Song Ren also found Mia's handbag in a pile of trash, along with her driver's license inside. Of course, that wasn't the key point; the real crucial thing was that Song Ren also found a treasure map fragment in Mia's handbag.

“Treasure Map Fragment: If you can find the other eight fragments, you might discover some incredible treasure.”

Looking at the description, Song Ren was very surprised. Chen Xu had mentioned on his official Weibo account that treasure map fragments would appear randomly in various scenes for each player. Of course, they wouldn't be hidden too obscurely; they would generally be in collectible places like trash heaps, tables, or bedside tables, not intentionally tucked away in some corner. He had such good luck! He actually found a treasure map fragment right at the beginning!

Song Ren expressed great surprise, which even washed away some of the lingering fear in his heart. Of course, this good mood lasted only until he opened the front door of the house. The outside scene was bright, but after opening the door to the house, Song Ren fell silent. Standing at the doorway, the room inside was pitch black, not at all welcoming!

And the most crucial point was that the visual presentation of *Resident Evil* was truly excellent, no less than the previous *Uncharted*. The moment he pushed open the door, he could clearly see dust particles floating in the air under the light. Especially with the VR immersive experience, the creaking sound of the door perfectly showcased the emptiness of the house. It could only be described as making one feel truly present.

“Mr. Chen is really something! For an event game, why make it so good?! With this game's visual performance, buying it for 88 Yuan is a huge loss, isn't it?” Song Ren felt a pang of frustration. After all, the better the graphics of a horror game, the more realistic it is, and the more realistic, the stronger the fear it brings! The visual performance, no less than *Uncharted*, made Song Ren's heart shiver. Continue playing, or simply admit defeat and stop?

Song Ren was engaged in a psychological battle, but soon he felt what he called 'Mr. Chen's love'. Players couldn't make up their minds? No problem, Mr. Chen would help!

After hesitating at the door for a long time, to Song Ren's astonishment, Ethan in the game began to move on his own. “I'm already here, there's no turning back… Mia, I'm coming for you…” Ethan said as he stepped into the house.

'Clang…'

After stepping inside, he closed the big door behind him. The screen instantly plunged into darkness, and Ethan in the game let out a gasp, pulling out a flashlight from somewhere.

“Mr. Chen, I really thank you!” Song Ren greeted him cordially, looking at the pitch-black room. Clearly, this was a forced action to prevent players from abandoning the mission at the last minute; this setting was simply evil!

Song Ren tried to twist the doorknob, and sure enough, the door leading outside wouldn't open. Now he was a trapped turtle. He'd entered? Unless he quit the game, he wasn't getting out!

Having reached this point, Song Ren no longer thought about quitting, and in Awakening Mode, he actually felt quite good so far. He explored the house, taking every step cautiously, afraid that something would suddenly jump out and get him. He wasn't scared by anything, but in one spot in either the living room or the kitchen, Song Ren was disgusted.

Here, the microwave contained rotting animal corpses, the sticky, filthy refrigerator door held piles of yellowish, unknown substances, and an open container on the table was filled with cockroaches and filth. Coupled with the VR immersive experience, Song Ren simply couldn't stand it. He had been a little hungry earlier, thinking of making some dumplings later, but now he had no appetite at all.

After a quick search around the room, Song Ren soon found a clue. There was a videotape on the second floor. He put the videotape into the TV and started playing it. It was a recording from three years ago by an unknown production crew, with three people heading to a haunted house for a show. In the original game content, this segment allowed the player's perspective to become Clancy, the cameraman in the videotape. However, in the VR version, Chen Xu did not use this mode.

Mainly, this change in perspective would actually make players feel a sense of detachment. At the same time, the content of this segment was not very important; its main purpose was to introduce some background to the player, reveal some puzzle-solving gameplay, and indicate the path forward. So Chen Xu also had the player, like Ethan, sit in front of the TV and watch the videotape. And actually, in terms of horror, watching the videotape was even more intense than becoming one of the people in the tape.

The sounds from the videotape echoed in the empty room. Song Ren would glance at the in-game screen, then turn to look behind him, fearing that a monster might suddenly appear behind him and startle him while he was watching the tape. Luckily, such a scene did not occur.

As Song Ren expected, none of the three guys who courted death in the videotape escaped. One went missing, one was impaled by a steel pipe, and the fate of the other was unknown. Song Ren was still relatively calm at this point; aside from the slightly terrifying environment, it was still within his tolerance. Although the unlucky guy impaled by the steel pipe had a somewhat frightening death, Song Ren remained relatively composed, having prepared himself mentally.

Following the hints in the videotape, Song Ren found a handle under the fireplace and opened a secret room in the wall. “It must be down from here.” Song Ren came to the secret room behind the wall, looked down, and saw it was pitch black with what looked like a pool of water.

Song Ren lingered for a moment, then stepped onto the ladder to descend. Aside from the ladder breaking with a crack, causing him to fall, there were no jump scares. “Huh… Has Mr. Chen changed his ways? There's nothing too scary here! It's rather similar to *Silent Hill PT*; is this just making me scare myself?” Song Ren explored, looking quite surprised. People can be like this sometimes. Before playing, he was afraid of being scared, but now, after a long time with no high-tension scenes, Song Ren actually felt a little unaccustomed to it.

As he mused, Song Ren waded through the water, moving forward. As he advanced, the water level gradually rose, the murky water obscuring what lay beneath, while the rock ceiling overhead pressed down on him. 'Splash… splash…' The sound of water was particularly jarring in the quiet environment. “It's a shame Old Zhang can't see me now, otherwise he'd definitely be surprised,” Song Ren lamented.

But as soon as his words fell, a scream burst from Song Ren’s mouth. “Shit, holy cow!” The murky water's surface bubbled. A highly decomposed, maggot-infested head filled Song Ren's entire vision, getting right up close to him. Even in Awakening Mode, it made Song Ren shiver in fright.
