Chapter 237: It makes perfect sense, but something just feels off! (Seventh update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)

It wasn't just Qin Yi; others like Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin were also looking at Chen Xu with the same expression.

After all, the sense of déjà vu was simply too strong! And it was common knowledge that, so far, Nebula Games' two major titles were *Dark Souls* and *Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame*.

As for *Minecraft*, while it continued to create sales miracles daily, it clearly couldn't be called a major title in terms of scale. But looking at this game called *Monster Hunter: World*, observing its cold weapon setting, and then its gigantic Elder Dragons...

One had to remember that in *Dark Souls*, BOSSes were generally enormous to give players a sufficient sense of oppression. Combined with the so-called unique action system, the more they looked, the more they thought of Souls-like games.

"Don't talk nonsense, how could this be a Souls-like game?" Chen Xu shook his head, denying it.

"This is a very special game. Players will quickly get familiar with the gameplay mode. You could say *Monster Hunter: World* will be much easier to pick up than *Dark Souls*."

"Moreover, in *Monster Hunter: World*, players have a variety of weapon choices and can craft stronger armor and equipment, which can also be upgraded. Unlike the *Dark Souls* series, where armor is virtually useless against BOSSes, in *Monster Hunter: World*, players can reinforce and craft armor with superior defense, and even further enhance it based on its properties to counter monsters."

"In the game, players can also use various items to make hunting easier, and they even have a Palico companion that can assist in battles," Chen Xu explained one by one.

"In addition, there will be a rather special mechanic in the game: Hitzone and Hitzone determination based on cut and blunt damage," Chen Xu said, introducing the relevant settings of *Monster Hunter: World* to everyone.

Simply put, Hitzone refers to weaknesses, and different types of attacks are needed for different Hitzones. The same applies to body parts; by attacking various parts of a BOSS, players can achieve things like breaking horns or severing tails to obtain corresponding materials.

"Another thing is the application of the AI system. In the game, we need to create a complete ecosystem, not just a static background, but a truly interactive world."

"The Paralysis Toads, Vigorwasps, Flashflies... all sorts of creatures, plants, and environmental factors in the forest will affect the hunt. This is a truly fantastical world," Chen Xu simply explained some conceptual content to the group.

Everyone was filled with excitement and anticipation. From the perspective of game scale, *Monster Hunter: World* would clearly be the largest game they had ever developed.

Listening to Chen Xu's detailed explanation of the game's systems, Qin Yi and the others finally understood why Chen Xu said *Monster Hunter: World* was easier to get into than *Dark Souls*.

Because there seemed to be very little malicious content!

From Chen Xu's current introduction, *Monster Hunter: World* was completely different from Souls-like games. The difficulty in Souls-like games, besides the BOSSes, largely came from the maps and various mobs. All sorts of traps, environmental kills, and mob combinations drove players to despair.

In *Monster Hunter: World*, there weren't as many malicious traps on the map. What players had to do was outwit and outfight the BOSSes. In fact, traps on the map could even become powerful tools for players to deal with BOSSes.

To optimize the player experience, hunters in *Monster Hunter: World* would not take damage no matter how high they fell from. This was much better than the Undead!

At the same time, AI technology was used to make the BOSSes in the game more agile and lifelike. This meant that each battle location could be a different geographical environment. More importantly, players needed to understand the monster's attack patterns and solve them with their own skill and wisdom.

Listening to Chen Xu, everyone showed an expression of sudden realization. From this perspective, *Monster Hunter: World* was indeed much more user-friendly than the previous *Dark Souls*.

However, as Chen Xu continued his explanation, everyone's expressions slowly changed. Initially, Chen Xu briefly introduced the game's monsters: the docile Aptonoth that wouldn't actively attack, the Great Jagras, and the Kulu-Ya-Ku that wielded stones like an ostrich.

These weren't particularly special, but what was happening later? The Tobi-Kadachi with lightning powers, the massive and ferocious Anjanath, and the incredibly agile and poisonous Odogaron.

The art style suddenly felt off!

Not to mention the later Diablos, Rathalos, Rathian, and Nergigante. Even without seeing the corresponding stats, just the descriptions alone were enough to make them shiver.

When Chen Xu finished explaining the concept design art, the meeting room fell silent.

Now everyone understood the characteristics of *Monster Hunter: World*.

Indeed, this game was truly completely different from *Dark Souls*.

*Dark Souls* was like going to a Foot massage parlor, and the technician brings you a basin of scalding hot water. You test it with your foot. Ouch! Too hot! I'm not getting a massage!

*Monster Hunter: World*, on the other hand, was a basin of lukewarm water. You test it with your foot. Oh, so comfortable! I'll take technician 13, that's a good number! Make sure to give me a good massage when you get here. Where's the QR code? Scan it!

But as players encountered the Anjanath, saw the Odogaron, and faced the Diablos, the entire game's difficulty suddenly increased by a notch. This was equivalent to pouring scalding hot water into the warm water. The water temperature unknowingly became hot.

And by the time they reached the Rathian, the first encounter with Nergigante, Teostra, and other Elder Dragons, all the hot water had been poured in. Scalding hot feet! At the same time, technician 13 also arrived, completely unlike the young lady they imagined, but rather a hulking brute. "Foot massage, huh? Close your eyes and feel it!"

"Mr. Chen, isn't this difficulty a bit too high?" Qin Yi suggested tactfully.

"How could it be? The difficulty curve is perfectly reasonable. And didn't players of *Dark Souls* always say they wished it was more gradual? See, I've learned my lesson! Look at the monster arrangement: from the Aptonoth and Great Jagras at the beginning, to the Anjanath and Diablos later – it's all progressive."

"Plus, in the game, players get three chances. Only after carting three times is the hunt considered a failure. There are even Palico companions. Such player-friendly designs!"

"It's all for the players!" Chen Xu exclaimed with emotion.

"Furthermore, if you encounter a monster you can't beat, you can call upon your companions in the game, and everyone can tackle the monster together. Doesn't that lower the difficulty significantly?"

Listening to Chen Xu's words, they remained silent. It made so much sense, they didn't know how to refute it.
