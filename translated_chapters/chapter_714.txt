Chapter 713: This Hero Is Really Interesting! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Inside the project studio.

The majority of DOTA’s development, including the map, game mechanisms, heroes, and equipment, was already complete.

Only some minor details needed gradual adjustments, along with additional accessories.

However, despite being a semi-finished product, members of the team often played a few rounds of DOTA during their breaks, citing it as 'game testing.'

"Don't be scared! We all have AOE spells, they can't get up the high ground!"

"No, this game requires destroying the enemy base to win. We can't win by defending for 100 minutes!"

"I'll initiate. I sold my Boots and bought a Blink Dagger! Who should I Skewer? Speak up!"

"The easiest one to kill!"

"Damn it! I told you to Skewer the easiest one to kill, not a creep!"

"Sister Xin, run! Don't stand there dazing! Magnus is about to Skewer!"

"Why didn't you BAN Magnus?! Old Meng is only good with this hero and that Watermelon Tidehunter!"

"It's fine, it's fine! Their Morphling waved high ground! I cut off their backline! Kill the Morphling!"

"Don't panic! I'm still alive! Watch me fight five! I'll fight all five of you, what's wrong with that?"

"Kite him, play with him! Come on, come on, come hit me!"

Inside the office, everyone was incredibly excited.

Comebacks and being turned around happened in an instant, and that was the greatest charm of DOTA-like games.

Compared to the original DOTA, Chen Xu also incorporated role settings and tutorials.

Initially, DOTA didn't really have concepts like carry or support, but sometimes this lack of clear division led to situations where players would shift blame onto each other.

For example, if a match had five carry heroes who all needed farm, it would be impossible to win unless their raw skill was overwhelmingly superior to the opponent.

In such cases, every player would believe they were right, leading to endless arguments. However, with clear roles, it became much simpler.

Of course, these were just suggestions, as the flexibility of hero roles was one of DOTA's biggest features.

Different heroes, in different situations, played different roles.

However, for now, everyone was still largely in the beginner phase, playing strictly according to the novice recommendations.

They understood the importance of last-hitting and denying, and were familiar with item effects and hero abilities, but deeper mechanics and detailed aspects were basically non-existent.

For instance, no one really understood mid lane creep blocking to keep the creep wave closer to their own high ground, side lane jungle pulling to control the creep wave, or timed jungle stacking for efficient use of neutral resources.

Naturally, most of their comments were complaints about heroes.

"Mr. Chen, this is unscientific! When you told me to pick this hero, you clearly said they had long range, crowd control, mobility, burst damage, and creep clearing/gold farming skills, but why is this thing a support? And why is its playstyle so sneaky?"

Yang Xin, who had lost three consecutive matches in the team and strongly demanded an off-field coach, looked at the three little cart brothers on the screen with a pained expression.

Engineer! A hero she thought was a ruthless carry machine, but turned out to be the exact opposite in reality.

"Cough, cough... DOTA only has role divisions. It's just that you were assigned to the support role," Chen Xu lightly coughed.

"But this is too sneaky! I've been hiding for two minutes; if I hide any longer, the system will detect me as AFK. And this hero is just too boring," Yang Xin complained after using a Clarify Potion and planting a mine.

"Mid lane, prepare to detonate," Chen Xu reminded, noting the mini-map as he listened to Yang Xin's words.

She quickly switched her screen over, only to see three enemy heroes swarming and killing their mid-lane Invoker Carl, then happily pushing the Tier 2 Tower.

In the middle, a pile of green mines had already been planted. The three Radiant heroes hadn't brought a Sentry Ward and were completely unaware of Engineer's presence.

'Boom! ...Explosion is art!'

Accompanied by Engineer's excited line in the game.

With a thunderous crash, the three enemies instantly evaporated.

'Triple kill!'

'Rampage!'

Suddenly gaining 1000 gold and two levels from the triple kill, Yang Xin's eyes lit up, having achieved a title and a triple kill for the first time.

"This hero... is really interesting!"

As if she had taken a memory-loss pill, Yang Xin grinned widely.

This unremarkable Engineer, who started with only 30-odd attack damage, was simply too much fun!

One mine for a creep wave, two mines for a jungle camp. Hide and plant mines where the enemy has no vision, and their strongest hero would just explode.

So fun!

As if she had discovered an amusing toy, Yang Xin laughed heartily.

Of course, the players on the opposing team were in agony.

Because often, mid-fight, accompanied by a 'BOOM,' they would see their heroes instantly evaporate in a shower of fireworks.

This wasn't DOTA they were playing; this was clearly a horror game.

Walking along, a person suddenly disappeared. A few teammates agreed to push a tower together, and suddenly one or several teammates were gone. How was one supposed to play this game?!'

"Sister Xin, can you please stop playing this hero!"

"+1!"

Hearing the protests from the other team, Yang Xin's smile grew even wider.

"What do you guys know? This is a hero Mr. Chen specifically made for the New Year's special. And according to Mr. Chen, DOTA isn't just about skill; it's more about intelligence. This hero is clearly designed for brainy players!" Yang Xin declared righteously.

The opposing team members showed pained expressions, but as part of the game development team, they were clearly well-versed in the game's mechanisms and various settings. They quickly found a counter-strategy: buying Sentry Wards and an item called Gem of True Sight, which, when carried by a hero, reveals invisible units in the surrounding area, allowing them to clear Engineer's invisible mines.

Yang Xin felt a pang of annoyance when a Sentry Ward easily cleared her Engineer's two to three minutes of planted mines. However, she quickly found a new counter-strategy. That was to plant mines on high ground, or sneak out to plant mines in the enemy's jungle. After all, the enemy only had one Gem of True Sight, and they couldn't always stick together 5v5.

Watching everyone, Chen Xu smiled, stretched, and prepared to leave.

As for the fact that he had cultivated an explosion maniac in the DOTA world, he could only say, don't worry about the small details.

Besides, unlike his previous life, players in the Parallel World might not harbor such strong resentment towards Engineer.

...Probably?

Looking at Qin Yi, who had just farmed enough gold, was about to buy equipment from the neutral shop in the jungle, and then was blown up by a pile of mines, letting out a painful wail.

Chen Xu smacked his lips as he prepared to leave.
