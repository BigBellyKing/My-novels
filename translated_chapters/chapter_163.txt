# Chapter 162: The Looping Corridor (Fourth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

What met his eyes was darkness, and there wasn't the slightest sound in his ears.

At the same time, Li Yue felt a wave of cold air.

The semi-enclosed gaming pod also came with its own cooling system, which players could choose to turn on or off, while some games could self-regulate once activated.

‘Be careful, that gap in the door... that’s another parallel reality.’

‘I am I. Are you sure you are the only you?’

Two lines of subtitles appeared before Li Yue, leaving him a little bewildered.

But before he could figure out what these two sentences meant, the game screen appeared.

As the game began, it was clear the protagonist awoke on a cold floor. Combined with the cooling effect of the VR game pod, Li Yue shivered involuntarily.

And with that shiver, the in-game screen also shook in sync.

A very realistic cockroach crawled past him, making Li Yue's mouth twitch.

Although he was a tall man of 1.85 meters, he genuinely found cockroaches, spiders, and similar insects a bit creepy.

It wasn't fear, but simply that he found them disgusting.

At the same time, the tightly closed wooden door of the room suddenly creaked open by itself.

Li Yue's heart felt no ripple of emotion.

After all, the game had just started, and such a scenario wasn't uncommon, so Li Yue remained relatively calm.

He looked around. The starting area of the game was a pitch-black room, with cement walls like a bare shell apartment all around. Directly opposite was a wooden door open just a crack, and on the doorframe hung an incandescent light bulb.

But it only emitted a faint, pale white light.

Without rushing forward, Li Yue performed some actions on the spot.

He found that he could only do basic operations, such as walking, controlling his hands for simple movements, and crouching.

As for crawling, jumping, running, etc., there was no response; clearly, the game did not include related action systems.

There were no UI tips in the game, which didn't surprise Li Yue much, as it was just a test DEMO, not a full game.

He hoped the later content would be more intense and interesting.

Li Yue's mood was still very relaxed.

Pushing open the door, he found himself in a narrow corridor.

Its space could only accommodate two people walking side-by-side. Incandescent light bulbs glowed on the corridor walls and at the end.

However, the light's propagation distance was eerily small; it was very bright only in the immediate vicinity of the bulb.

Other areas, meanwhile, appeared extremely dim.

The stark contrast between brightness and dimness filled the entire game scene with an eerie atmosphere.

Furthermore, Li Yue noticed that some of the murals on the game walls were very clear, while others seemed intentionally blurred, making it impossible to discern their content.

At the same time, due to the significant performance improvement of the new VR equipment, the most direct manifestation was that the overall VR presentation of the game was much closer to reality.

This realistic imagery, combined with the eerie atmosphere, immediately heightened the sense of tension.

However, as a hand-picked tester, Li Yue had witnessed many grand scenes. He merely paused slightly, surveyed his surroundings, and then continued forward.

In the middle of the corridor, to his right, there was an alcove with a table.

On it rested a digital clock, displaying the time – 23:59.

On the wall above the digital clock hung several very blurry paintings; one of them looked like a 'U' with a black dot in the middle, appearing very eerie.

Next to the corner of the table, many empty wine bottles were piled up, seemingly hinting that the house's owner frequently drank heavily.

It didn't seem particularly special.

Yet, there was something unsettling about it.

Mainly, the surroundings were too quiet.

Every step he took, the sound of his footsteps on the floor, felt as if it echoed directly in Li Yue's heart.

This silence, broken only by his footsteps, made the entire game experience somewhat oppressive.

After confirming there was nothing special about the digital clock, Li Yue continued down the corridor.

Soon, Li Yue reached the end of the corridor, which was a corner.

Beyond the corner was still a narrow corridor.

At the same time, on the left, there was a wooden cabinet, cluttered with items.

There was a seemingly broken phone, what appeared to be photos of the house's owners, and many white pills scattered on the table—a complete mess, to say the least.

As before, Li Yue found nothing and continued walking forward.

Around the corner was a tightly shut, impassable door. Further ahead, a large door seemingly leading to the basement stood open. To the left of this opening was a coat rack, and to the right were combined photos of the male and female owners, a radio, and many cigarette butts.

Directly above was the second floor and a chandelier with dim light.

Just as he approached, a cacophony of sounds emanated from the radio, gradually becoming clearer.

It seemed to be broadcasting some news.

‘On the day of the murders, the father walked to the car's trunk, pulled out a hunting rifle, and shot his wife, who was cleaning the kitchen after lunch.’

‘When his 10-year-old son came to check on the commotion, the father shot him too.’

‘His 6-year-old daughter cleverly hid in the bathroom, but reports indicated he told her it was just a game and lured her out. The daughter was shot in the chest at point-blank range.’

‘The wife, killed by the father, was pregnant at the time.’

‘Police arrived at the scene after receiving an emergency call from neighbors, finding the father listening to the radio in his car.’

‘In the days leading up to the murders, neighbors reported hearing the father loudly repeating a series of numbers, saying he sounded as if he were chanting strange spells.’

‘Last month, in the same state, another family shooting occurred, and there was also one last December.’

‘A man used a hunting rifle and a meat cleaver to kill his entire family. In every case, the perpetrator was the father.’

‘State police say this series of family tragedies appears unrelated, though it may be part of the common household problems of unemployment, childcare, and other social issues.’

Standing still, Li Yue waited for a while and gathered quite a bit of crucial information from the radio.

Could it be that this house I'm in is the house from that previous tragedy, and am I playing the role of the murderous father?

Li Yue discreetly looked around, and just like before, there was nothing unusual.

Yet, even so, his heart began to thump a little.

He kept feeling that a monster might jump out from somewhere and scare him.

But precisely up until now, there hadn't been any particularly intense scenes.

He had played *Outlast*, developed by Chen Xu, and had been startled by many of its contents.

But it was just a scare.

However, this simple DEMO called *Silent Hill PT* gave him a completely different feeling.

It wasn't just because it was a VR game, but more importantly, the overall atmosphere of the game.

Taking a deep breath, Li Yue forced himself to stop thinking about these messy things and focused his attention on the game at hand; after all, he still had to conduct the test.

He moved his feet forward little by little, slower than an old man strolling in a park.

Passing through the open door, descending the steps, and opening another door, Li Yue was completely stunned.

Because everything before his eyes was so familiar.

It was the corridor from the very beginning of the game.

He... was back again?

Two lights, one in front and one behind, the blurry painting on the left wall still hung, and the digital clock displayed 23:59.

A ghost, a supernatural loop?

Li Yue suddenly felt a chill run through him.

Up until this point, the entire game's setting was still in the corridor.

Aside from the opening cockroach, nothing else movable had appeared, yet a sense of oppression and something named panic had already begun to grow in his heart.
