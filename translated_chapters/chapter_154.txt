Chapter 153: Sales Boom (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

All sorts of comments poured in, some focused on the game's Level Design, some on its plot understanding, and others simply playing along with memes and sharing their actual experience outside the game.

But it must be said, *It Takes Two* delivered an unforgettable experience to all players.

Although there were some moments during the journey that left players distressed and sad.

Yet the game's process was incredibly exciting and thrilling, just like an animated movie.

The final ending was a happy ending, as expected, which left many players very satisfied.

On the fourth day after the game's launch, major media reviews were successively released.

Many game media professionals were also moved to tears.

After all, with the recent game drought, there really hadn't been many eye-catching news reports that could capture players' attention.

Furthermore, many game media still remembered how awkward it was when they reviewed *Dark Souls* back then.

This was because Nebula Games, unlike some game developers, didn't specifically prepare a media review version of the game in advance for early reviews, to allow them to publish game reviews before or on the day of release.

So, the media could only experience the game firsthand, just like ordinary players, and then publish their respective review articles.

However, for these game media outlets, playing games was different from ordinary players.

Ordinary players could simply play for fun, but as media, when conducting a game review, they had to pay attention to all sorts of game content and thoroughly understand its intricacies.

This was clearly a substantial workload, and the period when *Dark Souls* was released could be described as the darkest hour for domestic game media.

Its extremely high difficulty, fragmented narrative, and the high probability of missing side quests during a first playthrough without a strategy guide, all contributed to this.

This directly resulted in *Dark Souls* being online for over half a month domestically before some authoritative game media even released their reviews.

But by the time they finally cleared *Dark Souls* and understood its various in-depth content.

A more awkward situation arose: *Dark Souls*'s reputation had completely shifted from mixed reviews to overwhelmingly positive reviews.

For the players, they already fully understood the characteristics of *Dark Souls*.

So-called media reviews were mainly for players unfamiliar with a game's type and characteristics, serving as a reference.

But once players already understood, the role of these reviews naturally became less significant.

Aside from players who particularly liked the game or wanted to use scores to badmouth a game, ordinary random players mostly used reviews as a reference for whether to buy a game or not.

Thus, *Dark Souls* at that time left many game media deeply impressed.

But now it's different!

Now, for *It Takes Two*, although these game media outlets also didn't receive an early media review version.

This resulted in the game's reviews not being released on the same day.

However, they at least caught *It Takes Two* at the peak of its popularity, and also due to its two-player requirement, a considerable number of players had previously been in a wait-and-see state.

Their reviews this time could be said to be released just in time!

This wave of popularity, they seized it!

Among the scores from numerous domestic media, the lowest given was a 9-point rating.

Game Timespace, which had previously interviewed Chen Xu, even directly gave it a perfect score.

In its review, Game Timespace commented on *It Takes Two* as follows:

'Without a doubt, *It Takes Two* absolutely deserves to be called the best two-player cooperative game in recent years, yes, none other! From the moment players dive into this wonderful world, they are constantly bombarded by sensory experiences from all directions, enjoying this carefully crafted delicacy of creativity and imagination.'

'For over ten hours, gameplay and scenes constantly switch; one moment you might be galloping among the stars on railway tracks, the next you're piloting warships and bombarding giant octopuses like mountains in a building block world. You'll never know what novel gameplay awaits you around the next corner.'

'And a gameplay mechanic strong enough to carry other games might just be an appetizer here, never to appear again in the journey. This unpredictable sense of surprise and dreamlike scenes make the entire game process a winding rollercoaster ride.'

'Undoubtedly, this is a magnificent cooperative adventure game; it laid the foundation for a path of great gameplay innovation! It is magnificent and beautiful, fast-paced, full of creativity, with gameplay and experimental nature rewarded in every segment.'

'Returning the focus to the game's plot, *It Takes Two* is equally excellent, perfectly combining gameplay and story.'

'The game's plot is about eternal reflections on love, marriage, and family: When marriage is worn away by life, can family warmth rekindle love?'

'In the game, it revolves around three points: 'Facing the mundane aspects of life, will both parties still give each other enough time together?', 'Besides love, what else will keep them together?', 'If life extinguishes our passion, what meaning does life still hold?'

'And through the game's levels and plot, players also received answers to these three questions during gameplay, ultimately elevating the game's theme.'

'In a family, children are like a rope connecting husband and wife; of course, children are never the shackles of parents, but at the very least, they should be the last fuse.'

'It is somewhat cruel, yet very sincere. Similarly, for such a somewhat heavy real-world story theme, the game employs a clever worldview, using the adventure of fantastical little characters to examine the world from another perspective.'

As major media reviews were released, *It Takes Two*'s popularity showed no signs of cooling down.

Sales also steadily climbed, reaching 1.55 million units within two weeks.

This sales figure surprised Chen Xu a little.

After all, co-op games themselves, especially mandatory two-player cooperative games, are actually very player-specific.

Not all players are in pairs, and *It Takes Two* itself uses an invitation system, where one player who owns the game can invite another.

However, it still achieved such sales, which can be said to have exceeded Chen Xu's expectations.

However, Chen Xu briefly summarized *It Takes Two*'s launch performance, and he had a general understanding in his heart.

*It Takes Two*'s sales boom mainly stemmed from three factors.

The first factor was naturally the excellent quality of the game itself.

The second factor was the lack of this specific type; for many players, two-player co-op games aren't that special, but a co-op game like *It Takes Two*, rich in content and substantial in scale, was unprecedented.

As for the third factor, it was naturally the game drought situation. Although various game developers released games after the New Year, most of them weren't particularly impactful.

And the games that players had high expectations for were all still making grand promises.

In this situation, the appearance of *It Takes Two* naturally attracted players suffering from the game drought.
