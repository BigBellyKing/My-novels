Chapter 328: One Shot Red, Two Shots Gasping, Three Shots See the Famous Quote (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Zhang Yi grunted, controlling Soap to climb the ladder to the platform under Captain Price's urging.

He then swapped his firearm for an MP5 and four flashbangs.

In his headset, Captain Price's explanation of the CQB test content came through.

However, Zhang Yi himself wasn't paying too much attention.

"It's just a new player tutorial, isn't it?"

"What could I possibly not understand!?"

As Captain Price finished his introduction, the sound of "GO! GO! GO!" rang out.

Instantly, Zhang Yi sprinted forward.

Then... *splat*, he fell directly from the high steps on the second floor onto the ground.

[Hidden Achievement: Watch Your Step (0.0021%)]

Zhang Yi: ????

Looking at the gray death screen and the game interface reloading to the previous save point,

Zhang Yi was utterly bewildered.

"Wasn't that supposed to be a cool aerial drop!?"

"What the heck, I have to rappel down a rope?"

Looking at the interface with a prompt box instruction, Zhang Yi was speechless.

The only thing that brought him a little comfort was that when he earned this achievement, he was among that 0.0021%.

This meant that 0.0021% of players, just like him, didn't look where they were going and fell to their deaths.

After talking to Captain Price again and climbing back to the second floor, Zhang Yi took a deep breath.

This time, he was going to be serious!

Following Captain Price's "GO GO GO."

Zhang Yi immediately used the ascending/descending rope in front of him to fast-rope down.

At the same time, he switched his firearm to a pistol and shot through the steel plates representing enemies in front of him.

He ran down the stairs, shot through the raised steel plates, and used a flashbang when entering the room.

Following Captain Price's commands, Zhang Yi felt his speed was incredibly fast throughout.

However, looking at the final recorded score, it differed slightly from what he expected.

'25 seconds, alright.'

'I don't know how a rookie like you passed selection.'

'If you want to try again, climb back up the ladder.'

After the dialogue ended, a mission completion summary panel appeared before Zhang Yi.

It was 25 seconds, and that was even with an accuracy bonus of -3 seconds.

This meant he actually spent 28 seconds.

Especially the recommended difficulty below, which made him a little exasperated.

Recommended Difficulty: [Recruit]

There were four difficulty options in total.

Recruit, Regular, Hardened, and Veteran.

"How am I a recruit!?"

"This kind of rote memorization content can't be the basis for a veteran's combat experience. I want to play on Veteran!"

Zhang Yi's rebellious streak immediately flared up.

"You want me to play on Recruit difficulty?"

"Heh! I won't!"

"I'm going to choose Veteran difficulty!"

An FPS game, if the difficulty is too low, wouldn't it be too boring?

After selecting the difficulty, Zhang Yi triggered the subsequent cutscene that officially started the game.

'Bravo Team, intelligence for this operation comes from our Russian Federation informant.'

'The target item is on a cargo ship, which also has a security team in addition to the crew.'

On the electronic screen, the target cargo ship appeared, and Captain Price next to it arranged the operational guidelines before the mission.

'What are the operational orders?'

'No survivors!'

As Price's words fell, the game screen gradually faded to black.

Then, the sound of helicopter propellers spinning, thunder, and heavy rain came through the headset, mixed with the crashing waves below, instantly setting the atmosphere.

Fully armed SAS team members, under the cover of the rainy night, proceeded towards the target cargo ship in an armed helicopter.

Price, leaning by the doorway, cast his gaze outside the helicopter, brought the lit cigar in his hand to his lips, and took a deep drag.

'Weapons ready for fast-rope, GO, GO, GO!'

The still-burning cigar was tossed out the window by Price.

The next moment, Zhang Yi found he could control Soap in the game.

Under the cover of the heavy rain in the dark night, ropes were thrown from the helicopter, and the SAS team raided the target cruise ship in the Bering Strait!

They fast-roped from the helicopter onto the cargo ship/cruise ship.

Because of the cover of the heavy rain and it being late at night, the people on the cargo ship clearly hadn't noticed that a group of uninvited guests had already boarded.

Everyone's firearms were equipped with silencers. Following behind Price and the SAS team members, they used suppressed rifles to eliminate the enemies on duty inside the ship's cabin.

'Bridge deck clear!'

'Soap, move up!'

A nearby team member continued to remind Zhang Yi, who was still behind.

"This... this is the highest difficulty? It's too easy, isn't it? And the teammates have such flawless coordination!" Zhang Yi couldn't help but let out a scornful laugh.

"This is Veteran difficulty!?"

"Is this it? Is this it? Is this it?"

Three consecutive "Is this it?" questions.

From start to finish, the enemies didn't fire a single shot.

Moreover, for the first time, this game gave Zhang Yi a sense of being part of a team.

When he fired his weapon, his NPC companions would immediately provide covering fire, eliminating any enemies he missed.

The team members coordinated with each other, instantly taking control of the ship's cabin.

The teammates in front pushed forward, while those behind covered the rear.

Such tacit cooperation truly gave Zhang Yi the feeling of playing a high-tier match in Rainbow Six Siege.

And it was an experience he had never had before.

Because in his matches, his teammates were basically "pig teammates" with no coordination whatsoever.

Now, he finally felt something called tacit understanding!

Entering the dormitory inside the ship's cabin, Zhang Yi pulled out his suppressed pistol and, with the SAS team members beside him, eliminated the sleeping enemies.

Along the way, crossing the deck, the team members were also communicating with Captain Price.

Upon reaching the bow, it was clear that the previous commotion had alerted the enemies to their presence.

A group of armed guards stood on the second floor, laying down suppressive fire on them.

'Enemies on the second floor, Iron Hammer 2-4, enemies on the second floor, they're yours.'

'Received!'

In the team comms, Captain Price ordered the armed helicopter that had brought them there.

He clearly intended for the armed helicopter to deal with the enemies occupying advantageous positions on the second floor.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yi directly charged out with his gun.

"Who needs an armed helicopter?"

"Why use an ox-cleaver to kill a chicken?"

"Veteran difficulty is nothing more than this!"

"Let me take down this ship's cabin alone, so you, Price, know that Soap isn't a rookie!"

"But a battle-hardened veteran!"

But the moment he rushed out of cover.

Zhang Yi experienced what a hail of bullets and explosions felt like.

One shot hit his chest, and the feedback from Huanyu VR brought a strong sense of immersion.

The screen turned red.

A second shot hit his chest, still with a very realistic feedback.

Soap gasped for breath.

A third shot still hit his chest, but this time there was no feedback.

Because the screen went gray, a famous quote appeared before his eyes.

[Humanity must put an end to war, or war will put an end to humanity. —John F. Kennedy]
