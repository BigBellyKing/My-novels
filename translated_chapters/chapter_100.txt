### Chapter 100: Humor and Irony

Helping the black soldier out of trouble, Liuliu learned through conversation that he was from America and had joined the Allied Powers' camp.

This segment at the station was quite lively.

Especially seeing the soldiers swaying to the band's music, Liuliu couldn't help but chuckle.

But this humor and joy were only temporary, as the game's setting was World War I.

With the narrator's introduction, Emile's regiment was dispatched to fight the German army's 71st Division, led by Byron Von Dorf.

Everyone's sense of novelty was immediately dispelled by the fear of their first battle.

On the battlefield, Emile served as the flag bearer. With a command from the officer, the soldiers began their charge.

This segment's gameplay mode was somewhat similar to the bullet-hell dodging style of `Undertale`.

The entire game was a 2D side-scroller, requiring players to control movement back and forth to dodge artillery shells falling from the sky.

Shells rained down on Emile and his comrades like dumplings being dropped into boiling water, but they had no choice but to charge.

The commander, who was at the very front, was blown up on the spot. Emile, as the flag bearer, took his place.

But facing German machine guns and artillery shells, it was a desperate charge, and the battle was brutal.

Before the assault, the sky was still azure and sunny.

Now, the sky was overcast with dark clouds, and the ground was littered with French corpses.

The sound of gunfire and cannons, along with the BGM transitioning from majestic to tragic, made Liuliu feel the brutal atmosphere of war, even though the game was merely a cartoon-style 2D side-scroller.

During Emile's charge in the game, a bullet mercilessly struck him.

Amidst the heavy rain and the bleak BGM, the scene immediately shifted to the German ranks.

Among them, a blond soldier stood out conspicuously; it was Karl.

“So Emile was conscripted by France, and Karl, after being expelled, was conscripted by Germany. This family is going to pledge allegiance to their respective countries and kill each other on the battlefield?”

“And is Emile already dead?”

Seeing this, Liuliu immediately realized what was happening.

Could it be that `Valiant Hearts: The Great War`'s plot is structured this way?

A plot of family members killing each other, interwoven with national stances and familial bonds, ultimately reflecting the cruelty of war?

It felt highly possible, but if that were truly the case, wouldn't it be a bit too melodramatic?

Liuliu thought to herself, but didn't voice it, instead simply describing the current situation to her live stream audience.

Having played `Undertale` and `To the Moon`, she believed this game wouldn't turn out the way she was imagining.

Besides, the game had only just begun, about ten minutes in.

[Miss Marie Chelon, Private Emile Chelon of the 150th Infantry Regiment, was wounded by fire on August 21st and taken prisoner by the enemy.]

[Hopefully, we can get news of him soon.]

Amidst the mournful orchestral BGM, the narration began.

The scene shifted to Emile's farm, where Emile's daughter sobbed uncontrollably, looking at the letter in her hand.

However, seeing this made both Liuliu and her live stream audience breathe a sigh of relief.

He was only captured, not dead; that was good news.

Just as Liuliu was guessing whether the next plot would involve Emile and Karl escaping the German army together, or Karl helping Emile escape...

...the camera shifted to another character: the black soldier whom Emile had helped at the station earlier.

[Freddy, an American-born soldier, voluntarily joined the Allied Powers' forces at the start of the war.]

[Behind his brave exterior lay an inner self already deeply affected and destroyed by war.]

[He had only one conviction: to punish those who had ruined him.]

[It wasn't until the Battle of the Marne that Freddy finally found traces of the legion led by Byron Von Dorf.]

Listening to the narration and looking at the interspersed cartoon drawings, Liuliu pretty much understood the character's background.

Karl and Emile were both forcibly conscripted.

Freddy, an American-born individual, came to Europe and joined the Allied army, clearly not for any so-called justice.

He was an avenger, and it was highly probable that the German army, especially the one led by Byron Von Dorf, had killed his wife.

Thinking of the photograph that appeared during the character introduction, Liuliu guessed in her heart.

But whether it was truly like that, she herself wasn't sure.

After all, the feeling this game gave her so far could only be described as very special.

There was little, almost no dialogue.

The serious narration gave her the feeling of watching a documentary.

At the same time, the game was filled with humor that brought a knowing smile, but before players could even laugh happily...

...the cruel war was immediately presented to the players amidst its cartoonish doodle art style.

This, in turn, made the earlier humor feel utterly ironic.

Besides this, there was the game's gameplay, which differed from Emile's earlier bullet-hell dodging style.

After switching to Freddy, the gameplay became puzzle-solving and stealth.

As the game's description stated, `Valiant Hearts: The Great War` is a puzzle-solving game.

Emile's earlier segments hadn't shown much of this aspect.

But for Freddy, it required utilizing various game mechanisms to infiltrate enemy territory.

For example, in the current level, Liuliu quickly found the trick after a brief study.

First, use a grenade to blow down the ladder, then time it right during the machine gunner's firing interval to climb the ladder and reach the destination.

Afterwards, use items like stones to create a diversion, drawing the enemy's attention away, then seize the opportunity to go down the ladder and knock the enemy out with a powerful punch.

Clearly, like Nebula Games' earlier title `Outlast`, even though this was a WWI-themed game, players had no guns so far.

The only thing they could do was conquer with their bare fists, and also use pliers to cut open barbed wire.

Perhaps because it was the beginning of the game, the puzzle difficulty of the levels wasn't too high; Liuliu understood what to do with just a quick look.

However, she also noticed one thing.

While the game's visual style, with its cartoon graffiti, looked very humorous, it didn't preach any grand lessons through its plot and story.

Yet, it was filled with ironic undertones, such as needing to bribe officers with beer at the train station.

Also, in Freddy's level, while German soldiers were fighting at the front, Byron Von Dorf, as an officer, was inside a room tasting red wine. When the Allied forces broke through the defense line and closed in, he chose to immediately escape by airship.

After completing Freddy's level, watching him angrily tear the German flag in half, the game screen, as before, plunged into darkness.

At the same time, narration appeared, along with background presented through comic panels.

[Due to British reinforcements, the German plan failed. The front line shifted north, and winter arrived.]

[Karl's unit retreated to the outskirts of Neuve-Chapelle, which was also where Emile was being held.]

“Eh, so Emile and Karl can finally meet?”

Looking at this background description, Liuliu muttered to herself softly.

The next moment, the game screen appeared, and the player's controlled character returned to Emile.

Unlike before, when he wore a military uniform, Emile was now wearing a simple kitchen apron, his feet connected by shackles, and holding a large iron spoon in his hand, appearing to have become a cook for the German army.

Here, besides Byron Von Dorf, Liuliu also saw a relatively familiar character: the German search and rescue dog that had appeared in the game's description and the UI interface before entering the game.

First, Emile poured some water for the dog to drink, then he went to the warehouse to prepare food. At this moment, Karl also took the opportunity to come and see Emile.

The two reunited men were overjoyed. Karl inquired about Emile's wife.

Emile then handed Karl a letter and a photograph sent by his daughter.

But before the two could say much more, the soldiers waiting outside for food began to urge them, so Karl and Emile had to quickly separate.

But when Emile pushed the prepared communal meal outside...

...British artillery fire had already begun.

Amidst the British bombing, Emile was buried under collapsing stones.

The screen plunged into darkness and dead silence, causing Liuliu and the audience in front of their computers to feel worried for Emile.
