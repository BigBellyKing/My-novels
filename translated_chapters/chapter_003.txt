# Chapter 3: Even Capitalists Aren't Like You!

Sitting in front of his computer, Chen Xu now had a rough understanding of his current situation.

The gaming industry – that was the direction he was aiming for.

However, even though he had decided to make games, it wasn't that simple.

Although the black technology of this world allowed for game development without building underlying code, things like art, Music, and modeling were all indispensable.

Moreover, Chen Xu himself was in a rather awkward position.

Firstly, he didn't have a Game Designer Job Title, so the resources he could use were very limited.

Chen Xu estimated that for some classic small Independent Games from his previous life, these resources would be sufficient.

But there was another crucial point: he didn't have much money.

After all, he hadn't been long out of university, and living in Modu – even if it was the suburbs and not the city center – meant the cost of living was quite high. He had only saved a little over ten thousand in total so far.

He temporarily cast aside thoughts of the system; after all, he needed to produce his own works to collect points, and it didn't even offer a money-exchange function. How merciless!

"I need to figure out a way to make money," Chen Xu murmured, stroking his chin.

He simultaneously searched for various information online to understand the different aspects of this world's gaming industry, while also brainstorming ideas in his mind.

However, after exiting the web page and seeing a folder on his desktop, Chen Xu's eyes lit up.

Inside the folder were over a dozen already colored Strip Comics.

The content depicted stories of refreshing young women playing water volleyball.

The narrative was upbeat and positive, fully showcasing the vitality and fighting spirit of youthful girls.

According to the memories in his mind, these Strip Comics weren't drawn by him, but were given to him by a senior from his college to help color.

Looking at these invigorating Strip Comics, Chen Xu had already made a decision.

He had an idea for his first money-making work.

In his previous life, there was a domestically developed match-3 game featuring beautiful girls that was deeply loved by players: *Mirror (Game)*.

It was voted the second most positively reviewed game in 2018, topped the Steam Platform's global daily bestseller list, and accumulated 71,000 Cumulative Reviews, with nearly 69,000 of them being Positive Reviews. Even most of the other 2,000 reviews were negative ones given just for memeing.

The reasons for choosing this game were very simple.

On one hand, this game involved virtually no Game Modeling.

On the other hand, Chen Xu could largely produce most of the game's content himself with his skill level.

Furthermore, given its game characteristics, *Mirror (Game)* had an inherent advantage compared to other games, especially with limited promotional funds.

For quickly accumulating initial capital, *Mirror (Game)* was arguably the best choice.

Of course, some of the more explicit content would need to be modified.

"But doing it alone would still be quite time-consuming; I need to find a helper," Chen Xu mused after making his decision, an idea forming in his mind.

Before that, though, he needed to address his rumbling stomach.

Feeling a pang of hunger, Chen Xu got up, grabbed the keys and phone from the table, and prepared to head downstairs to find a restaurant to satisfy his basic needs.

***

"Never underestimate the meat slicer at any Lanzhou Lamian Restaurant; their knife skills are truly remarkable!"

Chen Xu picked up a slice of beef, as thin as a cicada's wing, with his chopsticks, marveling at it.

Dipped in the noodle soup, the beef even gave Chen Xu a translucent feeling.

Six slices of beef were laid over the noodles, accompanied by chopped green onions and cilantro.

Whether it was his previous life or this Parallel World, one word described the beef: thin.

Though the portion of meat was hardly enough to fill a gap between his teeth, the noodles themselves were delicious.

They were incredibly springy, and the beef bone broth was equally savory.

After eating his fill, Chen Xu paid and left the noodle shop, dialing a phone number on his way home.

After about three rings, the call connected.

"Senior, the drafts you gave me are finished. I'll send them to you later."

"Also, do you have time tomorrow, Senior? I have some things I'd like to discuss with you."

"No problem. Tomorrow at 1 PM, let's meet at Island Coffee at the crossroad of Garden Community."

Hanging up the phone, Chen Xu stretched.

He had decided that his first pot of gold would come from *Mirror (Game)*.

However, if he had to do all the work by himself, Chen Xu estimated that the workload would take him about two months to complete *Mirror (Game)*.

And that was under extreme crunch.

So, if possible, finding a helper would be ideal.

Whether it would work out or not, he couldn't say.

***

One o'clock in the afternoon.

Chen Xu arrived at Island Coffee at the appointed time.

By the window in the ground-floor lobby sat a girl, about twenty-four years old, wearing glasses.

She was dressed in a white casual outfit, sitting there listening to music with headphones on.

"Senior Ruan, I'm sorry to make you come all this way," Chen Xu said, walking up to her and greeting her.

"No trouble at all, my place is just nearby," Ruan Ningxue replied with a faint smile, shaking her head as she took off her headphones.

Before Chen Xu could continue, Ruan Ningxue looked at him happily and spoke, "So, Chen Xu, what did you want to talk to me about? Have you finally come around and decided to join my studio? Honestly, sticking solely to comics isn't very wise."

"You could totally hone your skills with Doujinshi first, and then switch careers! Many famous teachers in the industry used to draw Doujinshi under an Alias!"

"And I've seen your colored Illustrations, Chen Xu; you're very talented!"

Ruan Ningxue said to Chen Xu with great earnestness.

"Ahem... Senior, I appreciate your kindness, but I'm not here for that today," Chen Xu said, clearing his throat a little awkwardly.

She was one year his senior.

Just like the previous Chen Xu wanted to be a cartoonist, Ruan Ningxue also harbored the same ambition.

However, her path was slightly different: unlike Chen Xu, who persistently submitted his works despite repeated failures, Ruan Ningxue had started drawing Doujinshi.

Relying on this, she at least didn't have to worry about income. And in her words, becoming a bestselling doujinshi artist, building a reputation, and then transitioning into an Official Cartoonist was also a path to success!

As for what kind of Doujinshi?

Naturally, they were Doujinshi telling beautiful love stories, though sometimes they might not be *that* beautiful.

Ruan Ningxue, as his senior, considered Chen Xu very talented and had always wanted to recruit him to form a studio.

Noticing that the conversation was already veering off course and would likely revert to that topic, Chen Xu immediately brought up what he wanted Ruan Ningxue's help with today.

"Huh... switch to making games?"

Hearing Chen Xu's words, Ruan Ningxue's eyes widened, as if she had heard something unbelievable.

"My initial idea was just to present stories to others, whether it's comics or games, they are really just a medium," Chen Xu explained to Ruan Ningxue with his pre-planned reasoning.

"And aren't there plenty of examples in the industry of cartoonists or novelists transitioning to become directors or Game Designers?" Chen Xu said with a smile.

After all, unlike his previous life, the development of technology had significantly lowered the basic entry barriers for various industries.

So, in this world's entertainment industry, examples of cross-industry transitions were indeed not uncommon.

Of course, succeeding after such a transition was another matter entirely.

"That's not the point!" Ruan Ningxue rolled her eyes. "No food provided, no accommodation provided, and Illustration fees will be delayed! So, Chen Xu, are you trying to freeload off me?"

If the person sitting opposite her wasn't her junior from college, and if she hadn't constantly tried to recruit Chen Xu, Ruan Ningxue would definitely have left immediately, because he sounded exactly like a scammer.

These evil capitalists, trying to exploit her labor for free!

No, even capitalists wouldn't go this far!
