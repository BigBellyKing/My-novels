Chapter 281: Warcraft Craze (7th update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)

In a residential complex in the Imperial Capital.

Zhang Yi, taking out a cardboard box from the storage locker, had an excited look on his face.

Today was the official release date of Warcraft, but he didn't immediately wait in front of his computer as usual.

Because he had something more important to do.

“Oh wow, this thing is massive! Nebula Games, couldn’t you make it a bit smaller?!”

After unwrapping the outer packaging from the storage locker, Zhang Yi found himself in a predicament.

He realized Nebula Games was being too honest.

The Steelbook Collector's Edition of Warcraft really was a big metal box.

It was 30-40 centimeters long and wide, 15 centimeters high, with Frostmourne printed on the front, and a generally grim color tone.

This thing completely exceeded his imagination.

“Where am I going to hide this when I get home?” Zhang Yi wondered, looking at the collector’s edition tin box in his hands.

“Hide it in the wardrobe, under the quilt, where you always hide your money.” A familiar voice came from behind him.

Zhang Yi, holding the tin box, turned around to see a familiar figure behind him.

“Ahem, ahem… Weren’t you out buying groceries?” Zhang Yi coughed twice, trying to defuse the awkwardness.

“How long does it take to buy groceries? Come on, let’s go home. Don’t you think I know your little tricks? I won't even mention you hiding a small amount of money; you have no creativity at all,” Wang Han rolled her eyes and said irritably.

“Alright, let’s hurry home. I saw that the Collector's Edition seems to have some background stories about Warcraft, which will be good to read.” Wang Han walked ahead, appearing even more eager than Zhang Yi.

It must be said, she was really a little addicted.

Warcraft felt like watching a TV series to her.

If it were a typical RTS, she wouldn't be so addicted, but the key was she was curious about Warcraft’s plot!

For example, what would happen to Arthas later, and what was the origin of that mysterious wizard who could transform into a raven.

Back home, after plating the cooked dishes and noticing it was still early for dinner, Wang Han and Zhang Yi sat side-by-side in front of the computer. One opened the Nebula Games Platform to enter Warcraft, while the other opened the collector's edition tin box.

“So that’s it! The Orcs weren't originally a race of Azeroth!”

“The wizard is named Medivh. It said he once had the chance to save humanity but abandoned his humanity, meaning he was influenced by this guy named Sargeras, and then participated in building the Dark Portal, allowing the Orcs to enter Azeroth!”

As players who bought the collector's edition, Zhang Yi and Wang Han played the game while referring to the art book album inside the collector's edition.

At the same time, enthusiastic players online also posted the relevant content from the collector's edition online, letting more players know.

In the collector's edition, Chen Xu didn't reveal much, only explaining why humans and orcs were so hostile, the origin of Ner'zhul the Lich King, and Medivh's past, among other things.

But it was precisely these simple details that allowed players to better understand just how vast the Warcraft worldview was.

And on major live streaming platforms, just like with the previous Monster Hunter: World, Warcraft also created a craze.

On the day of its launch, streamers on all major platforms simultaneously played Warcraft.

Large numbers of players were attracted by the game's CG animation, excellent story, and groundbreaking gameplay.

………………

Under Medivh's guidance, Thrall managed to restore Grom Hellscream's sanity through a ritual. Then, Thrall and Grom Hellscream traveled to Demonfall Canyon in Ashenvale, attempting to defeat the mastermind saboteur Mannoroth.

During the battle, Thrall, filled with fury, swung his Doomhammer at Mannoroth, but the demon's power was so immense that it easily defeated Thrall.

Just at this critical moment, Grom Hellscream let out a furious roar. Relying on the power he gained from the demon blood, he poured all his strength into swinging his Gorehowl, shattering the demon's breastplate and slicing the demon's evil heart into pieces.

Mortally wounded, Mannoroth exploded in gushing flames, leaving behind only the continuously enraged Grom Hellscream.

Amidst the hellish flames swirling everywhere, as Mannoroth died, the deep crimson representing fanaticism in Grom Hellscream's eyes gradually faded. The demonic blood boiling within the Orcs settled, and the Orcs were finally and forever freed from the demon's curse, no longer its slaves.

In the last moments of his life, Grom Hellscream reclaimed his honor.

………………

“Traitor?”

“In fact, I am the one who was betrayed.”

Accompanied by a booming thunder, a blurry black figure appeared on screen, his twin wings and curved horns revealing his identity—Illidan.

Dark clouds and fierce winds roared and churned.

Terrifying waves continuously surged on the sea surface.

“Even now, I am still being hunted.”

“I am still hated.”

“But now, my sightless eyes can see horizons unseen by mortals!”

Illidan solemnly faced the distance.

“Sometimes, the hand of fate must be taken into one's own hands!”

Amidst the startling thunder and surging sea, a tightly closed eye in the deep ocean opened.

Countless Murlocs swam upwards from the deep.

“At the cost of my eyes, I will bring ruin to those who presume themselves wise!”

………………

‘The Frozen Throne belongs to me, demon, get out of my sight!’

‘Leave this world, and never return. If you dare come back, I will be waiting...’

In a vast expanse of icy snow, Arthas, who had transformed into a Death Knight riding a Skeletal Warhorse, confronted Illidan, who had transformed into a demon.

‘I have sworn to destroy it, Arthas, this must be accomplished!’ Illidan, wielding the Warglaives of Azzinoth, said unceremoniously.

Then ensued a fierce battle.

Frostmourne emitted a dark glow, and the Lich King within the Frozen Throne infused Arthas with ascending power.

On the other side, Illidan's demonic wings spread, and blue-green flames burned on his body.

The fight scenes, like those in a blockbuster movie, were incredibly exciting.

Finally, Arthas proved superior; Illidan was impaled through the chest by Frostmourne.

Arthas ignored Illidan, who lay grievously wounded on the ground, bleeding purple.

Holding Frostmourne, he advanced towards the towering Frozen Throne.

Innumerable chaotic whispers, their specific contents unintelligible, echoed around the ice prison confining Ner'zhul the Lich King.

Arthas, holding Frostmourne, ascended to the summit step by step.

‘Bring the sword back, so... I may be completely freed from this accursed prison.’

Ner'zhul’s evil whispers echoed in Arthas’s ears.

Before the final throne, Arthas gripped Frostmourne tightly with both hands and heavily struck the Ice Prison.

Whispers, roars; the screen went briefly dark, then the ice shattered, and a helmet slid down the steps to Arthas's feet.

Looking at the helmet by his feet, Arthas slowly picked it up and placed it on his head.

‘Now, we are one.’

The camera shot instantly changed: Arthas, clad in armor, one hand gripping Frostmourne which was plunged into the ground there, sat upon the throne at the top of the Ice Tower.

There was no background music, just dead silence. Then, the camera slowly zoomed out, revealing the Icecrown Glacier and the gigantic Ice Tower, as faint background sounds gradually began to echo.

………………

After Warcraft was released, many players who initially came for the RTS gameplay, after experiencing the single-player story and progressing through it, completely lost interest in playing multiplayer mode, becoming fully immersed in the narrative.

Because it was simply too spectacular.

The story itself had already thrilled countless players.

Not to mention that throughout, Warcraft had outrageously used various exquisite CGs.

Especially with the characters in various events, players felt that each of them had their own beliefs, their own burdens, and their own choices.

Online, characters like Grom Hellscream, Arthas, Illidan, Maiev Shadowsong, Sylvanas Windrunner, and Kael'thas were all unforgettable to players and had many fans.

Of course, there were also some more controversial characters.

For instance, Jaina, who helped the Orcs eliminate most of her father Daelin's armed forces, leading to her father's death at Rexxar's hands.

Grand Marshal Garithos, who sent Kael'thas and the Blood Elves on a suicidal mission, and upon learning they received Naga assistance, immediately ordered their complete execution.

Maiev Shadowsong, who completely tied her life's meaning to Illidan, utterly disregarding so-called good and evil.
