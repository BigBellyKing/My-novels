Chapter 105: Tears

After Karl's family of three reunited, the screen went black for a brief moment.

**[Marie, who had not heard from Emile, finally received a letter from her father a few weeks later.]**

A sorrowful BGM slowly started playing, and the camera moved to the cell where Emile was imprisoned.

The cell door opened, and an officer walked in to tell Emile that his time had come.

Here, Emile was in rags, with shackles on his feet.

There were no prompts; he could only keep moving forward.

At this moment, Liuliu, in front of her computer, had a terrible premonition.

Along the way, none of the soldiers showed contempt for Emile.

As Emile passed, they would salute, take off their hats, or turn their heads, unwilling to look at him.

Even if the player, controlling Emile, stopped walking, the soldiers and officers escorting him would not grow impatient; instead, they would wait patiently in place for him.

There was no forceful urging or shoving, just a quiet wait for Emile.

Accompanied by the melancholy piano music, Emile's narration slowly began with his footsteps.

**[Dear Marie, for me, the war is over. There are no regrets in my heart. I have witnessed too many horrors.]**

**[I hope fate will be kinder to you.]**

**[Though our days are so short, my life has been filled with happiness. I have only gratitude.]**

**[I have been so blessed, especially thankful to heaven for bringing you into my life.]**

**[This letter is my last.]**

**[I have been found guilty by a military tribunal for killing an officer.]**

**[Though I never intended to kill him.]**

**[War drives men mad.]**

**[Though I disappointed Karl, I know my sacrifice was not in vain.]**

As Emile walked on, soldier after soldier took off their hats in salute.

Freddie was among them, looking at Emile, who was about to walk to the execution ground, he took off his hat with a sad expression.

Memories of the past resurfaced one by one.

The dog, Anna, Karl, and his daughter and grandson.

**[I fought for my country and my freedom, and I upheld my dignity.]**

**[Since fate has brought us to this parting of life and death here,]**

**[Then I pray we will reunite in heaven someday.]**

**[Please continue to pray for me.]**

**[Forever loving you — Dad.]**

Standing before the cross used for judgment, Emile's face held only serenity, not fear.

The screen gradually faded into darkness.

'Bang!' A gunshot, followed by the sound of a body falling to the ground.

The next moment, a mournful melody played, and the scene shifted to a graveyard.

Under the setting sun, an endless expanse of wooden crosses lay before them, and in the distance, the flag of France fluttered in the wind.

**[Though their bodies have long turned to dust, they will forever live in people's hearts.]**

**[We must cherish these memories and never forget.]**

Finally, before Emile's grave, the dog, Karl, Marie, and their son stood silently.

With this, the entire game officially concluded.

And Liuliu, in front of her computer, was now completely in tears.

Her eyes red from looking at the ending screen, she pulled a tissue from beside her and gently wiped them.

"Emile... Emile never knew before he died that Karl wasn't actually dead. He still felt he had let Karl down," Liuliu's voice was slightly choked.

She hadn't not played tragic games before.

In fact, just last year, *To the Moon* had presented countless players with a poignant yet beautiful love story.

But the core of *To the Moon* was different from that of *Valiant Hearts: The Great War*.

To describe it in one word, it was 'heavy'.

There was no overtly emotional plot, just a gradual, insidious process, slowly eroding the softest parts of players' hearts through subtle groundwork.

What it showed was too cruel, making players feel a profound weight.

In Emile's final testament, there was no complaint about his own fate.

There was only love for his family and no regrets about his life.

Unlike some grand-scale war games, *Valiant Hearts: The Great War* didn't feature flashy content.

Nor did it use hyper-realistic graphics to depict the brutality of war.

Instead, it brought players closer to families torn apart by war and to those who had been tormented by it.

This had an even greater impact than stunning visual graphics.

And Emile was merely a microcosm of countless individuals.

One could even say that Emile and Karl in the game were already quite fortunate.

But precisely because of this, the cruelty of war and its profound weight were felt even more keenly.

………………

It wasn't just Liuliu; all players who completed *Valiant Hearts: The Great War* were utterly in tears.

Because the game had too many moments that could genuinely move them to tears.

One moment Emile befriended a German officer, and the next, that officer was blown up.

And the search and rescue dog had just reunited with its original owner, only for that owner to be killed by an explosion.

Karl's family of three had just reunited, but Emile was about to walk to the execution ground to be executed.

There were many such instances in the game where just as your heart warmed, it was instantly stabbed.

It wasn't just the plot; it was also the overall presentation of the game.

*Valiant Hearts: The Great War* wasn't a large game in terms of scope; the entire playthrough was only about three hours long.

In terms of sales, *Valiant Hearts: The Great War* wasn't initially very high, as it was a small-scale game and also part of a Game Design Competition, so many players were still waiting to see.

However, the game's overall score soared through the roof, reaching an impressive 9.8 points.

Thanks to this exceptionally high rating, *Valiant Hearts: The Great War* quickly began to spread among the gaming community.

Player reviews and related discussions also increased rapidly.

**'Chen Xu always knows how to fool us! This game once again showed us what a "Warrior of Love" means. It was supposed to be a heartwarming game, but after playing it, I was completely bewildered!'**

**'Although I really want to punch Chen Xu, I have to admit, by the end I was really in tears, the ending was genuinely moving!'**

**'At first, I was skeptical about how such a small-scale game could convey anti-war sentiment, but I have to say, Chen Xu achieved it!'**

**'There has never been a good war, nor a bad peace!'**

**'There is indeed a "Valiant Heart" in the game, but unlike another English translation of the subtitle, "The Great War," a war born of politics and self-interest can never be linked to greatness!'**

Of course, there were also some players who didn't like this style, as it's difficult to satisfy all tastes, and player preferences vary significantly.

Chen Xu couldn't possibly create a game that was all-encompassing and catered to every player's taste.

However, compared to the diverse preferences of players, the industry's game media uniformly gave the game extremely high praise.
