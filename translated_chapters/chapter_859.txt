Chapter 858: I Almost Believed It!

_Payday_'s interesting gameplay quickly became a hot topic among players.

In terms of scale, _Payday_ itself is a small to medium-sized game.

Yet, it gave players an extraordinary feeling.

First, there was the feeling related to its theme. The gameplay of being a robber and committing heists gave players a sense of breaking taboos. Moreover, as a game, players could run rampant within it without moral or legal constraints, making it arguably the best way to vent inner stress.

This is also why many games under Nebula Games have numerous nicknames. Setting aside the in-game story, Link became Hyrule's Old Rogue under countless players' control, and Arthur Morgan became a great villain in the West... There are many similar situations, and it can be said that such actions bring players an inexpressible sense of exhilaration. _Payday_, on the other hand, solidified this into its core gameplay.

Secondly, there's the sense of realism _Payday_ brought to players.

In the game, Chen Xu and his team incorporated many real-world cases and learned a lot of professional knowledge. Although, if it were truly to be treated as a robbery encyclopedia, it would definitely make players experience what it's like to be tired of living.

However, many of the detailed aspects in the game were incredibly well done. Many players, before playing _Payday_, might not even have known that there are emergency silent alarms under the counters in most banks. Additionally, bank teller windows are not ordinary glass, but bulletproof glass; not only bullets, but even typical homemade explosives like Ken's couldn't blast them open. Bank vaults usually have two doors and don't store as much cash as players might imagine. At the same time, the banknotes stored in banks often contain tracking chips and specially placed dye packs. It can be said that after playing this game, many players learned a lot of new knowledge.

Furthermore, as more and more players pulled off heists in the game, and the frequency and duration of their participation in robberies increased, discussions about _Payday_ saw a major explosion. The unique theme of _Payday_ itself also generated many interesting 'memes' and talking points among players.

It became a part of the game's culture and even landed on the official Weibo account's trending searches.

“The game is so fun! Going to work at the bank during the day, then working overtime at the bank at night.”

“Bought this game for my child, and the child loves it so much they've already been sentenced to a suspended death sentence.”

“My child is 23 this year, inspired by this game during the darkest low point of their life, they bought a Ferrari outright and a sea-view house on their first attempt, without a single penny from home, all by themselves. It's just that the person is no longer with us.”

“Someone asked me who the most stingy person in the world is? I thought of the pedantic Plyushkin, the ruthless Shylock, the suspicious Harpagon, the cunning Grandet, or perhaps the treacherous Marquis Jianhe and Yan Jiansheng, who even at death's door wouldn't forget to trim a lamp wick before expiring. But it wasn't until I played this game, seeing a bunch of bandits worth tens of billions risk their lives to rob, preferring to face countless enemies rather than replace a drill that takes several minutes and often breaks, that I understood how to write the word 'stingy'.”

“Brother on the floor above, that’s not called stinginess, that’s called loyalty, that’s called staying true to one's original aspirations. How many people, after gaining wealth and glory, can still remember their original aspirations? How many people, after gaining wealth and glory, can still remember the person who shared meager food with them back then? How many people can share hardships but not wealth? Even if the four robbers have robbed hundreds of establishments, even if they are worth tens of billions, even if they are already renowned hardened criminals in the industry, they have never forgotten that electric drill they first used to 'get goods.' Yes, they have better options now, but they have never forgotten that drill, which carried their growth and their youth.”

“Damn! I almost believed your nonsense!”

……………………

This was actually a very normal phenomenon. Due to the game's theme and scale, Chen Xu at Nebula Games didn't allocate many resources for promotion. This led to many players who weren't deeply involved in the gaming industry, who only occasionally played games, or who simply followed popular trends, being initially unaware of Chen Xu's _Payday_.

Secondly, the game's theme itself was limited. Games like _Elden Ring_ and _Final Fantasy_, which focus on story, combat, and exploration, immediately immerse players in their charm and content upon entry. But _Payday_ wasn't that type of game; at its core, it was a grinding game.

So, when players first entered the game, while they could participate in some heists, they were mostly minor skirmishes at places like four stores or jewelry shops. However, with increased playtime and accumulation of experience and money, players gradually delved into deeper game content, and numerous interesting mechanics were unveiled.

For example, skill points. By learning skills from different skill trees for various professions, players could advance to become high-level hardened criminals with special abilities. Each playstyle had its own purpose and set of theories. What to do in the early game, how to proceed in the mid-game, what strategies to use in the late game, how to escape, how to hold a position. How to play stealthily, how to play aggressively. There were also considerations for weapon choices, attachment decisions, item selections, purchasing and unlocking advantageous conditions, and even choosing a position and wearing a mask before entering a heist – all these had their nuances. As heists became more complex and the difficulty of enemies increased, the game's professional depth grew stronger.

Because of the complexity of the heists and the increased difficulty of enemies, it no longer allowed you to be a brainless brute who just rushed in guns blazing. Otherwise, you would experience various flavors of existential doubt in the game.

For instance, the 'Blademaster' who would mercilessly beat you while sounding an alarm. This unit, with a riot stick in hand, would rush towards the player with ghostly speed, delivering a Thomas spin slam dunk to the player's head. Or the high-tech Internet Addiction Exterminator. This unit wielded a specialized taser gun, capable of electrocuting players to the point of incontinence, pinning them in place amidst a hail of bullets, turning them into the most eye-catching live target. Besides these, there were many other prominent 'big brothers,' and with high difficulty and advancing time, the game's difficulty would only continue to rise. Therefore, to successfully escape the encirclement of so many 'big brothers,' one had to utilize their professional knowledge. This involved combining various skills and playstyles, scouting heist maps, and determining tactics. In the end, these aspects proved to be even more captivating than the initial bandit robbery theme that first drew players in.
