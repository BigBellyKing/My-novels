Chapter 263: You Call This a Normal Player? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

“I won't elaborate on the preparations; it's simply about eating a Felyne Canteen meal for the desired stats, equipping the appropriate weapons and armor, and bringing auxiliary items.”

After enjoying a Felyne Canteen meal at the Hunter's Astera Base, Chen Xu conversed with the Investigator, who was still eating, and then arrived at the Camp 11 in the Wildspire Waste.

Under the watchful eyes of the live stream's viewers, Chen Xu headed straight for the Diablos's nest.

Sliding down the steep slope at the entrance, he could just see the awakened Diablos running outside, seemingly looking to forage for some cactus.

“This is relatively good luck. We see the Diablos has just reached the slope, which is perfect for initiating the Spirit Gauge State using the slope. I believe most players know this trick, right?” Chen Xu said in a calm tone.

Through the live stream, players watched as Chen Xu's Hunter character slid down, then, just as he neared the Diablos, he leaped up, his Long Sword striking the Diablos, landing and immediately following up with a Spirit Roundslash.

The Long Sword's first White Blade was activated.

Struck by the sudden attack, the Diablos let out a bellow, performing two consecutive head thrusts that sent the accompanying Palico flying.

“Generally speaking, if you have high confidence in your own skills, not bringing a Palico can actually increase effective damage output, because monsters often transfer their aggro to the Palico.”

“At such times, if you're a Great Sword, Long Sword, or Charge Blade player, using True Charged Slash, Helm Breaker, or Super Amped Element Discharge can easily lead to missing your ultimate.”

“Of course, what I'm demonstrating today is a normal Long Sword player's Diablos hunting journey, so we'll still bring a Palico because they greatly improve our margin for error, and their healing is also very useful.”

“These two consecutive horn attacks have a very long flinch duration, which is perfect for sneaking in some damage. A Diagonal Slash combined with a Spirit Roundslash can cut two attacks short and activate the Long Sword's second Yellow Blade.”

In the game, Chen Xu narrated while controlling the Long Sword-wielding Hunter to attack the Diablos.

Amidst his casual commentary, the Long Sword had already reached its second Spirit Gauge State.

Countless Hunters in the live stream, especially Long Sword players, were instantly bewildered.

'What? Two Spirit Gauge States already!?'

'A normal Long Sword player's Diablos hunting journey? Mr. Chen, do you have some misunderstanding about the word
