Chapter 244: Entering the Game (Sixth Update, Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)

With an overwhelming flood of advertisements, time slowly advanced.

On August 1st, _Monster Hunter: World_ officially opened its demo version for download on the Nebula Games Platform.

Not only players but also many gaming industry designers chose to download the game immediately.

Because many gaming industry designers also wanted to see exactly what kind of game _Monster Hunter: World_ was.

After all, hunting-type games were truly niche before this, and this game carried a very different significance.

Although the success or failure of this game wouldn't determine the fate of the Nebula Games Platform or cause any major damage, it would definitely make the Channel Alliance, which had been repeatedly frustrated, clap their hands in glee.

And whether it was designers who had decided to invest in the Nebula Games Platform, or those still with the Channel Alliance, NetDragon, and TengHua, none of them wanted to see such an outcome.

After all, most designers in the industry, as well as independent game studios and small game companies, had benefited from the Nebula Games Platform's sudden rise.

However, for ordinary players, it was obviously not of such concern.

After all, as players, they simply wanted to play good games.

_Monster Hunter: World_ was clearly the game they had been anticipating all this time.

Around past eleven in the morning, many players had already pre-downloaded _Monster Hunter: World_ from the Nebula Games Platform, just waiting for the demo content to unlock at twelve o'clock.

In a certain Garden Community in the Imperial Capital, Wang Han and Zhang Yi, who had officially become a family, were each sitting in front of their computers. At the same time, Song Ren, Wang Yifan, and Joey were also in the voice channel.

The five offline friends chatted as they waited for the game to open.

“This game is good in every way, except that it only supports four-player online multiplayer at most,” Old Song said, a little glumly, in the voice channel.

“Yeah!” Zhang Yi agreed.

“It's fine, we'll see about the time then. Besides, the company has a big project recently, so I've been quite busy,” Wang Yifan said in the voice channel.

“Alright, alright, enough of that. Even though this game only allows four players, and there are five of us, Old Zhang and I can share one computer, taking turns,” Wang Han said with a chuckle.

“Alright, alright, consider the feelings of us single people, Sister Han, stop showing off!” Joey interjected.

“But I wonder if this game will be difficult. Huge monsters combined with small, thin hunters, it just feels like there's something to it!” Zhang Yi said.

“It shouldn't be too hard. Didn't Mr. Chen say it's not a Souls-like game? And the previous trailer felt very relaxed, even showing them roasting meat during a hunt,” Song Ren offered his opinion.

“Why worry so much? Just go for it! The five of us are all high-level players who have cleared Dark Souls! Plus, doesn't this game have teaming up? If we can't beat it, we'll just team up to defeat the BOSS. All problems will be easily solved,” Wang Han said dismissively.

“It's open, it's open! We can enter the game now, stop chatting!” Joey exclaimed in the voice channel, noticing the game was accessible.

Hearing this, Zhang Yi and the others immediately clicked to launch the game.

After clicking to open the game, it didn't enter immediately; instead, a notification pop-up appeared.

‘Due to the current version being a demo, only limited areas are accessible, and multiplayer is not supported. (In-game saves will only retain character customization data)’

Seeing the prompt that appeared, Zhang Yi and the others weren't too surprised.

After all, they were all veteran players and naturally understood what a demo version entailed.

Opening limited content basically meant things like the game's prologue, allowing players to understand the game's overall vibe/tone.

Naturally, many things couldn't be experienced.

In the voice channel, everyone conferred briefly and then muted their microphones.

After all, if they couldn't team up, voice chat wasn't really necessary, and it would be better to have a more immersive experience with the game.

As the Nebula Games LOGO skipped by, the sound of waves crashing reached their ears.

The next moment, a booming voice shouted:

“So... my fellow members of the Fifth Fleet!”

“Time is almost up, so let's skip the goodbyes!”

“Once you board this ship, there's no turning back. If you've lost your resolve, I advise you to turn back now.”

“Now, let us set sail for the New World!”

“May the Azure Star that guides the way shine for you!”

Following the narration, the tightly closed door opened.

A blinding light appeared. After a moment to adjust, countless people carrying luggage began boarding the ship.

Zhang Yi blended in with them, clearly one of those heading to the New World.

After boarding the large ship and reaching the deck,

a crew member on board guided him into the ship's cabin.

Upon entering the cabin, it was an entirely different world.

Chandeliers with burning candles hung from the cabin ceiling. Countless armored crew members bustled about. Three or five hunters sat at a wide table, raising their cups and drinking, while nearby, other crew members carried stacks of books, seemingly researching something.

But what astonished Zhang Yi the most was that these hunters were accompanied by small cats, clad in armor, scurrying about, jumping, and raising cups to drink.

Furthermore, many other small cats walked upright and roamed around, acting as waiters, delivering plates full of food to the tables.

Watching a small cat place a plate full of food on a table, then wide-eyed and smiling, wave its paw in greeting to a female hunter at the table, was utterly adorable.

“These cats are so cute!” Zhang Yi couldn't help but exclaim.

Is this really a hunting game? Or a cute-themed game?

Filled with curiosity, Zhang Yi observed everything in the cabin.

Every hunter was busy with their own tasks: drinking, consulting materials, or organizing their equipment.

Are these my future hunting companions? Are these the partners I'll be fighting alongside?

Now Zhang Yi completely understood why Chen Xu had said earlier that _Monster Hunter: World_ was completely different from _Dark Souls_.

Never mind the art style or gameplay.

Just the atmosphere alone.

Look, how friendly and harmonious are these Hunter's Guild members? They'll all be great helpers in the future.

In single-player mode, without teaming up, he probably would be accompanied by these NPC teammates.

Unlike _Dark Souls_, where the Firelink Shrine with the Fire Keeper only had so few people in total.

And there was the unwavering Crestfallen Warrior, constantly spreading all sorts of negative energy/thoughts, making the entire game's atmosphere very oppressive.

Of course, luckily, you could always summon helpers in any installment.

As for _Monster Hunter: World_, it was clearly a completely different style.

Unity, friendship, full of positive energy!

“Hey, we're almost at the New World. Are you ready?”

“Nervous?”

As Zhang Yi was reflecting, a Mohawk-haired male hunter approached. Casually, the hunter, mug in hand, sat down opposite him and struck up a conversation easily.

After discussing their current situation and some details,

the game immediately transitioned to the character creation screen, similar to _Dark Souls_' character customization interface. However, compared to _Dark Souls_' Western fantasy style, _Monster Hunter: World_ clearly leaned more towards an Eastern aesthetic.

Character creation!?

I'm good at this! And character creation save data can be retained, right?

Looking at the rich character customization interface before him, Zhang Yi became excited.

This was his favorite part!

Gender was a given, still a male character. As for skin tone, it would be yellow skin.

Next, for the face shape, it needed to be a bit imposing, a middle-aged hunter, whose combat prowess was at the peak state of his life.

“A mouth without hair cannot do things reliably,” so a bit of beard on the chin.

But the mindset needed to be youthful. And when facing hunting targets, it wasn't always necessary to fight; sometimes, love could be used to influence them.

Therefore, the hair color needed a touch of playfulness.

“Done!” After about fifteen minutes, Zhang Yi nodded with satisfaction, looking at the character before him.

The only thing that left him slightly dissatisfied was that, compared to _Dark Souls_' character customization system, _Monster Hunter: World_ was a bit more conservative, preventing him from fully expressing himself. But he decided to just go with it.

Also, same as usual, a bit late.
