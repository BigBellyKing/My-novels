Chapter 543: The Carnival Brought by Silly Games (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

"Why did I get stuck on a level with a big dummy like you?" Zhang Yi couldn't help but sigh.

Song Ren, clinging to Zhang Yi's waistband, retorted without showing weakness: "That's what I should be saying. If you hadn't fallen off the cliff and made me come save you, would we be in this predicament?"

"Then when you saved me, how did you end up below me? I don't want you to save me anymore, let go!" Zhang Yi looked speechless.

"I won't let go!" Song Ren replied.

At this moment, the two of them were in a slightly awkward situation. Zhang Yi's hands were gripping the wall, and his head could just about pop out if he pushed up. But the crucial part was that his feet were being held by Song Ren's noodle-limbed figure. He had originally thought Song Ren would come to save him, grab his head, and help him pull himself up, but inexplicably, both of them ended up falling down together.

"Playing with big dummies, that line should clearly be said by the three of us." Wang Han and the other two, who were watching from the side, were also completely speechless at this point.

Since they started the game, they had already cleared several levels.

But these two clowns? If they had been even a tiny bit useful, it wouldn't have amounted to absolutely no use at all!

It wasn't just among players; within just two or three hours, the game Human: Fall Flat suddenly became popular on live streaming platforms.

On one hand, Nebula Games itself had high visibility within the player community. So, after the game's launch, many streamers immediately gave it a try.

On the other hand, the game's streaming effect was truly explosive. As a game that could be called a grandmaster of silly games, Human: Fall Flat's streaming effect far surpassed that of other games.

After all, for videos and live streams, some games are very fun to play but not necessarily very interesting to watch. However, Human: Fall Flat was not like that; it was a game that was fun to play and equally fun to watch others play.

Just the wobbly little characters in the game brought a lot of joy to players.

Especially when playing, if you could play with two or three friends you knew, it was explosively joyful. If there was someone among the fellow players who loved to mess around and cause trouble, then the gameplay would be full of endless comedic moments, adding a lot of extra joy to the original game.

On live streaming platforms like Shark TV and video websites, almost any live stream, big or small, would show streamers playing this game.

All sorts of flashy maneuvers emerged one after another. For example, some skill-oriented players actually turned Human: Fall Flat into human parkour experts.

Clearing the level through the correct route?

What's that? They simply didn't take it!

The little characters' hands in the game were like super glue; once they stuck to something, they wouldn't let go. So, players utilized this property to climb with both hands.

They could directly use this stretching property to send their little characters to heights that were originally unattainable.

Of course, such skill-oriented streamers were actually a minority.

It wasn't that it couldn't be done; from a technical level, it wasn't difficult. But doing so would also lose some of the fun.

Therefore, more players were busy causing trouble. It's a PVE game with no PVP? No problem, that's what everyone thought about Monster Hunter: World back then.

They used the mechanisms in the game, and simply grabbed teammates and threw them off cliffs or into rivers.

In short, what truly hinders your progress on the level progression isn't puzzles or mechanisms, but your silly teammates.

Players who had originally kept a low profile, upon entering Human: Fall Flat, looked at the enchanting little characters and threw up their hands: I'm not pretending anymore, I'm showing my hand, I'm going to be a Grabber!

The level progression of Human: Fall Flat itself isn't very long, with only about a dozen levels in total, although they become increasingly complex.

However, completing all levels actually doesn't take much time, just a few hours.

But Human: Fall Flat supports Workshop map creation, and Chen Xu even made some special optimizations during development, such as adding more terrain elements for players.

This allowed players to quickly create different maps using various materials in the game.

Two or three days after the game's launch, some relatively simple but gameplay-rich maps were already made by players.

In the snowy world map, some players created ice skating maps, some built giant maze puzzles, and others made parkour maps.

Of course, more often than not, these weren't PVE maps, but rather arena maps built to satisfy players' wicked sense of humor.

Only PVE, no PVP?

Players responded: No!

Inside the rooms, players maintained their own rules.

Suddenly, all the hot topics online were overshadowed by this particularly silly game. Major forums were also filled with reviews and discussions about the game.

'Haha, this game is truly silly, but it's precisely this kind of silly game that's fun!'

'233333, you can trick each other in the game too, but unlike the blood pressure exploding from tricking each other in Overcooked, why does tricking each other in Human: Fall Flat feel so interesting?'

'Haha, because this game is sufficiently silly!'

'To be fair, this game is quite fun, but it needs a friend who's just as silly as you are, otherwise, it can be quite lonely.'

'So much fun! This time, Mr. Chen didn't lie at all! This game is explosively joyful!'

'I wonder if there are any other fun, similar silly games?'

'Doesn't seem like it, at least I haven't seen any before.'

'The only regret, I guess, is that this game doesn't have PVP; when you hit someone, if they grab the ground, you can't pull them no matter what.'

'That's for sure, after all, it's a puzzle-solving, level-clearing game, not a fighting game.'

On the community forums and under Chen Xu's official Weibo account, there were overwhelmingly positive reviews.

Inside Nebula Games, Chen Xu was beaming with joy as he read the players' comments online, his whole being filled with satisfaction.

This is great!

It's a shame that, except for some new generation players, veteran players remained noncommittal about his 'Warrior of Love' persona.

How could that be?

And when the Carnival comes, the players' hearts will also endure a shock and hardship.

Now, they needed to let the players' mood completely relax.

That way, the impact effect brought later would be truly stunning.

Thinking this, Chen Xu smiled faintly and called Ruan Ningxue and a few members of the Art Team into his office.
