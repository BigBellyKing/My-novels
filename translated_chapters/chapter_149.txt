Chapter 148: I Play Alone (Fourth update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)

Zhang Yi and Wang Han sat in front of the computer, the room filled with laughter.

Along the way, they did encounter some puzzles that momentarily stumped them, but in *It Takes Two*, the guidance for all sorts of puzzles was quite well-executed.

Key information was marked in very noticeable, obvious colors, which is what game design refers to as attraction anchors.

In his previous life, *Breath of the Wild* was arguably the most perfect application of this design.

However, in *It Takes Two*, although there are many different scene spaces players can visit, the activity range of a single scene space is not large. Therefore, inserting various attraction anchor mechanism prompts immediately captures the players' attention.

Moreover, even if they don't notice, if they linger too long before a level, Cody and May in the game will also provide corresponding dialogue prompts.

It can be said that, as long as it's not intentional, getting stuck on a level in *It Takes Two* is practically impossible.

After all, this game isn't a hardcore platformer like *Celeste*; it's a two-player game designed to make players feel happy.

"This is so cool!" Wang Han and Zhang Yi exclaimed, their faces filled with surprise.

Using mechanisms like blowing pipes, the two performed an aerial relay, being sprayed out of one pipe and then sucked into another.

Combined with the game's storyboarding, it was like watching an exciting action-adventure movie, incredibly thrilling.

Pushing through the game's levels little by little, the two soon entered their first BOSS battle.

Their opponent was the vacuum cleaner that had previously sprayed them out.

Seeing Cody and May return before it, the vacuum cleaner appeared extremely angry.

But at this moment, Cody and May stated that once they turned back, they could fix the vacuum cleaner, as May was a skilled engineer.

However, at that very moment, the Book of Love suddenly appeared.

'Wow! Is what you're saying true?'

'Then why did you buy the expensive Turbo X2000 Vacuum Cleaner? Hmm!?'

After saying this, the Book of Love vanished without a trace.

"My god, this guy showed up just to instigate!?"

"That's a bit annoying!"

Evidently, as the game's guide, the Book of Love attracted the collective hatred of both Wang Han and Zhang Yi.

However, their attention quickly shifted away from the instigating Book of Love.

The game officially entered its first BOSS battle.

The method to defeat the BOSS wasn't difficult.

Because the BOSS's attack method was very singular: spraying incendiary cans.

At this point, players only needed to dodge.

Once the BOSS stopped throwing, one person would climb a pipe on the stairs and aim it at the BOSS, while the person below would use a pipe to suck in the incendiary cans thrown by the BOSS.

Although the BOSS also had a so-called second phase, it was clear that *It Takes Two*'s second BOSS phase was no match for a BOSS in *Dark Souls*.

They just needed to continue moving carefully and repeat the previous actions to easily defeat the BOSS.

After successfully defeating the vacuum cleaner BOSS, a cutscene played.

After escaping, the two saw their daughter Rose, but she couldn't hear them. A nearby hammer made a sound, indicating it could help them, but it needed their help to rescue the Toolbox's friends.

Here, May and Cody acquired new items.

A hammer and a nail: May got the hammer, and Cody got the nail.

After obtaining the tools, all puzzle levels required the use of these newly acquired items.

For instance, May used her hammer to hit a switch, allowing Cody to stand on a mechanism platform and move to the opposite side.

Then Cody threw a nail onto a wooden board, and May, using the hammer in her hand to hook the nail, swung across like on a swing.

"You can actually play like this!"

Watching Wang Han in the game hook her nail and swing across, Zhang Yi couldn't help but let out a heartfelt exclamation.

And this was the most he had said so far.

Though it was only the third level, the entire game's presentation was simply too wild.

It completely overturned his understanding of two-player games.

And as the game progressed, the instigating purple Book of Love soon reappeared, but this time it brought a mini-game called 'Beat Up Cody'.

"This game even has mini-games!"

"Amazing!"

Seeing the Whac-A-Mole mini-game before them, both Wang Han and Zhang Yi were astonished; they clearly hadn't expected the game to include challengeable mini-games.

"But why? Why am I the one getting beaten up!?" Looking at Wang Han standing on a box, swinging her hammer repeatedly to hit him, Zhang Yi, playing the mole, felt a bit pained.

Because Cody, playing the mole, had to stick his head out and wait for a moment to score, he was repeatedly hit until he saw stars.

"There's nothing you can do about it, it's the game's design!" Wang Han chuckled, easily winning the Whac-A-Mole game.

"That's not necessarily true!" Zhang Yi also let out a laugh, looking at the nail in his hand, then quietly pulled back, aimed, and fired!

With a 'bang,' May was nailed to the wooden board by an iron nail.

"Don't run! If you have the guts to nail me, have the guts to stand still!" After breaking free repeatedly, Wang Han also chased Zhang Yi with her hammer.

May's hammer could also inflict damage on others, but the key was that it was a hammer.

After creating distance, she couldn't catch up at all.

Just as she was about to catch up, 'Bang!' another nail pinned her in place.

"Hehe, I'm an archer. Have you ever seen an archer engage in close combat with a warrior?" Zhang Yi chuckled, having regained his composure outside the mini-game.

"Alright, alright, aren't we childish? Let's hurry and clear the level to advance the story!" Pinned to the ground once more, feeling unable to win head-on, Wang Han lightly coughed and changed the subject.

Hearing this, Zhang Yi also smiled, recalled the nail, and continued to advance the story in the game.

After obtaining the hammer and nail, the puzzles became more complex and demanded even greater tacit cooperation between them.

For example, when Cody obtained three nails, there was a platforming level where platforms would only appear when a nail was hammered in.

This particular level required May to constantly climb up, especially at a wall jump point, where a lack of good coordination could lead to being stuck for a while.

Although this level seemed to require very fluid movement, in reality, by following the sequence step by step, it could be passed quite easily.

This is because during a wall jump, one would cling to the wall for a short period of hang time. As long as they didn't frantically pull out the nail attached to the wall, it was quite easy to get through.

Finally, Cody and May, having passed a series of levels, arrived at the BOSS Toolbox.

As a tense melody began and the Toolbox roared, it was clearly another BOSS battle.

However, this BOSS battle against the Toolbox was different from the previous one against the vacuum cleaner.

This time, the Toolbox was a bit more challenging.

First, many iron nails would fall from the sky; getting hit twice would deplete one's health.

In the first phase, it was manageable, only requiring dodging a sweep from the Toolbox's shovel and the nails falling from above.

But the second phase was different: blade fans and chainsaws cut away the platform's wood, leaving very little room to maneuver when facing the Toolbox's shovel smashes.

Here, both Wang Han and Zhang Yi died a few times.

"Good thing there's infinite respawns, and the progress doesn't reset. Otherwise, it would be really difficult!"

"Indeed!"

Wang Han and Zhang Yi also expressed some emotion.

The difficulty of *It Takes Two*, compared to the previous life, Chen Xu had actually lowered it quite a bit.

Furthermore, with the setting of infinite respawns as long as one player is alive, and even if both players die, not everything resets.

Moreover, if players truly can't defeat a part, the game also features a dynamic difficulty setting.

For instance, under normal circumstances, getting hit by nails twice in a row would lead to death.

Getting smacked once by a large shovel would mean instant defeat.

If players get stuck on a level, they can choose to enable this difficulty.

Once enabled, the BOSS's attack power will be reduced, giving players more grace period.

After all, not all players are gaming masters. Many might think some actions are 'easy enough for anyone with hands,' right?

But many people, despite playing very seriously, simply couldn't perform those actions.

And *It Takes Two* isn't a hardcore game, so Chen Xu added these settings compared to the original version to help players who were constantly stuck on levels to get through more easily.

Of course, this also gave players a choice: if they wanted to challenge themselves, they could choose not to enable it, but if they wanted to advance the story quickly, they could enable it.

………………

As the game's story progressed, the phrase Wang Han and Zhang Yi most frequently uttered together was: "It can actually be like this!"

Because as the game evolved, they discovered its content was incredibly rich!

In addition to the main story's puzzle-solving levels, the game also had a considerable number of interesting mini-games built-in.

It was practically a bonus mini-game collection!

Moreover, each chapter's levels could be said to have a unique theme.

For example, the vacuum cleaner and toolbox comprised a major level.

Within this level, the theme was Shed.

The surrounding scenes were all related to the shed, and within this large scene, players acquired tools: a hammer and nails.

After defeating the Toolbox, as a gesture of gratitude, the tools brought the duo before their daughter.

But the daughter didn't notice them. At this point, Dr. Hakim reappeared and told them that if they wanted to see their daughter, they needed to go to the upper window.

In the level leading outside the house, the two had to slide on an electrical wire, and combined with the coursing current, it felt like time-traveling.

After finishing the Shed scene, they then entered a new thematic scene.

And the items acquired were also related to the theme.

For instance, Wang Han and Zhang Yi had now arrived at a large tree in the courtyard and entered its Heart of the Tree.

However, they were captured by squirrels, who believed them to be enemies sent by Hornets. After negotiations, it was decided that the two would help eliminate the Hornets.

From the squirrels, they obtained new items.

A special tool that could spray tree sap and attach to wooden materials, and a weapon that could fire flames to ignite the tree sap.

Thus, the game's art style instantly transformed into a shooting game.

One was responsible for spraying, the other for igniting, cooperatively overcoming challenges.

Going from the shed to the outside world felt like opening a door to a new world, and entering the Heart of the Tree led to another wondrous adventure.

With the acquired items transforming into 'firearms,' the game's puzzles became even more complex, requiring players to think creatively, and the game's pace began to heat up.

This cartoon art style game surprisingly featured many grand scenes.

Cody and May clung to a barrel lid, drifting in rapids, performing a scene of white water rafting.

Deeper into the Heart of the Tree, the dreamlike scenery was captivating.

They could also ride a beetle that they had defeated, which then decided to betray the Hornets, rampaging through.

After defeating the 'Queen Bee,' Cody and May discovered that it was actually a robot, and the so-called Queen Bee hidden inside was a fat little drone.

Consequently, Cody, May, and the fat little drone were pursued by a swarm of Hornets, eventually escaping by detonating a honey barrel.

That scene was as spectacular as watching the protagonist destroy an alien hive in a sci-fi blockbuster.

And this was just the beginning.

Because as Cody and May comforted the bee, the squirrel troops arrived and immediately opened fire.

The recently rescued fat bee immediately chose to flee.

Thus, the battlefield shifted from the ground to the sky.

Cody and May, riding the 'Underpants' plane, staged an Ace Combat sequence.

While passing through a deep tunnel, the Squirrel Boss climbed onto the plane's roof.

And so, the puzzle-solving game instantly transformed into a 2D side-scrolling fighting game.

...............

Zhang Yi and Wang Han spent the entire day experiencing *It Takes Two*, until their stomachs rumbled late that evening.

Only then did they put down their controllers.

"This game is so much fun!" Wang Han said, still wanting more.

"It is, and it's especially joyful. There seem to be many more scenes later on; at least, a lot of things in the promotional trailer haven't been experienced yet!" Zhang Yi said with an excited look on his face.

Unlike *Overcooked (Chinese title)*, which made them get carried away as they played, *It Takes Two* also involved the two of them messing with each other, but it was always the kind filled with smiles.

What's more crucial is that the game's content is truly massive.

After playing for an entire afternoon, they felt there was still a considerable amount of content ahead.

"I'm going to change. Let's go eat hotpot tonight, and then come back to continue." Wang Han said, glancing at the time.

"No problem." Zhang Yi nodded with a smile.

While Wang Han went to her room to change, Zhang Yi, leaning back in his chair, opened his phone and posted on his WeChat Moments.

Next, he opened his friends list, found Song Ren's profile picture, and sent a message: "Old Song, have you played *It Takes Two* yet? This game is seriously good fun; I never thought a two-player co-op game could be made like this! And the key thing is, Chen Xu really didn't lie this time—this game is particularly warm and friendly!"

Clearly, Zhang Yi was still somewhat immersed in the *It Takes Two* experience and hadn't quite come out of it yet.

About ten seconds later, Song Ren replied with a message and a meme.

The content was simple, but within that simple message, Zhang Yi sensed a poignant feeling.

'Playing alone? (smile.jpg)'
