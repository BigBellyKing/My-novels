Chapter 551: Mr. Chen is About to Transform into a True ‘Warrior of Love’!? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

For three consecutive days, players at the Nebula Games Park were treated to an absolute feast for the senses.

In truth, the attractions within the park, whether holographic tours or holographic games, were not particularly rare entertainment items. Whether at domestic or international parks, these types of attractions were inescapable, with only minor variations in their details.

But what excited them was the way game elements were brought to life, allowing them to experience them offline. Much like a player's sentiment, with this added layer of filter, many players felt only one thing: that the trip was well worth it.

There were also specially arranged musical performances, with each selecting a classic IP from Nebula Games, such as Red Dead Redemption 2, Assassin's Creed, To the Moon, Undertale, The Witcher: Wild Hunt, and more. Each performance, combined with holographic projections, offered players a unique experience.

However, compared to these events, the main trending topic online was not centered on them.

Why?

Because only a limited number of players could attend offline, while the rest could only watch longingly from their computer and phone screens.

Moreover, many attractions were not viewable on mobile devices, which made it even more frustrating for many players.

For the players participating in the carnival activities at the theme park, time seemed to fly by; a day passed in the blink of an eye.

For those not present, after a brief period of excitement, they found the wait a bit grueling.

Because for them, one point was more important: the new announcements and content Mr. Chen would deliver at the final Nebula Games press conference.

In the enormous plaza opposite the artificial lake in the theme park, countless players sat neatly in chairs.

For the past two days, they had watched concerts and competitions here.

This setup was primarily due to the large number of attendees, making it impossible to build a giant exhibition hall within the theme park town. Therefore, a tent-like outdoor venue was used, featuring massive LED screens and costly holographic projections for the performances.

Players outside discussed animatedly.

“This is the last night! I wonder what surprising news Mr. Chen will bring!”

“Anyway, there’s definitely Mario news.”

“Too bad, after three days, I still haven’t experienced many of the scenes. When the park officially opens, I definitely have to come again.”

“Yeah, yeah, bro, leave your contact info. We can find a time to come together then?”

“Uh… sorry, buddy. I’m planning to come with my girlfriend then.”

“...Farewell!”

Amidst the chatter of the on-site players, holographic fireworks suddenly bloomed on the opposite shore of the artificial lake.

As the fireworks burst, the Nebula Games LOGO appeared in the sky, then slowly dispersed to form a green pipe.

‘Doo-doo-doo…’

A familiar sound rang out, and a plumber in a red hat, Mario, emerged from the green pipe.

“Mario!”

“And Luigi!”

“Eh… who are those pink and blue Toads?”

All the players looked astonished.

But the demonstration continued.

The subsequent content display left many players wide-eyed with surprise.

Before this, players were well aware that Switch’s new title would be a Mario-themed game. Many players’ first impression was Super Mario Odyssey, but from the content presented, it seemed to be a 2D side-scrolling platformer!

Mario, Luigi, and the blue and pink Toads were seen bouncing and hopping their way forward.

But then, a gigantic Bowser descended from the sky, spewing a mouthful of fire. Just as the four were about to be incinerated by the flames, time seemed to freeze, and the screen went still.

Many tools appeared on the map, and then a thick black paintbrush suddenly materialized on the game screen. It clicked the ‘status’ button among the row of tools and selected a Super Star.

With Mario’s “Let's go” in the game, the game restarted.

A Super Star fell from the sky and was eaten by Mario. The golden-glowing Mario, along with his three companions, rushed forward, and the seemingly massive Bowser was directly knocked away.

But soon, Mario and his friends encountered another problem: there was a cliff ahead with no path.

Just like before, time paused, and countless tools appeared. Then, the paintbrush selected the ‘ground’ option, and a white glove appeared, dragging a ground icon to stretch it in the air. A new path, allowing them to advance, extended from the edge of the cliff under the white glove’s manipulation.

Following this path, collecting coins and stomping on monsters, Mario and his companions quickly reached the finish line and finally embraced the flag in a victory pose.

Then, various game scenes appeared one after another. With the previous arrangement by the white glove, many interesting mechanisms were placed on different maps.

Cable cars that could turn corners in the sky, spike-covered ground passable only by riding Yoshi or sitting inside a shoe.

Transparent pipes leading in all directions, eating a hammer power-up to become a craftsman, smashing blocking bricks with each swing, hiding a bell inside a tree, and then Mario eating it to become Cat Mario, able to pounce and climb walls.

Alongside these were various quirky BOSSes, and the familiar giant Bowser.

Then, the scene shifted from the game to reality.

Players, holding controllers and styluses, used these tools in the game to unleash their creativity, creating one interesting level after another, then uploading them for players worldwide to enjoy.

As these player-made levels were uploaded, a gigantic Earth appeared. The ID numbers of player-created maps turned into threads, connecting to each other, eventually forming the game's LOGO: Super Mario Maker.

As the name Super Mario Maker appeared, many players both at the event and watching the livestream began discussing the game. After all, from a game type perspective, this game was truly a renaissance.

Platforming games, especially 2D platforming games.

Although the launch of Super Mario Odyssey once sparked a platforming craze, that was a different situation. While Super Mario Odyssey itself involved platforming gameplay, its core was sandbox-style exploration. This new game, however, appeared to be purely a 2D side-scrolling platformer.

The only novel aspect, perhaps, was its primary feature, which looked somewhat like a MOD, or rather, the Nebula Games Workshop functionality.

“Oh my god, I never expected Mr. Chen’s new game to be a platformer.”

“Although 2D platforming games are ancient, they do evoke a strong sense of nostalgia. Look at this pixel art style, my youth is back!”

“233333, it’s true, several later versions had all sorts of pixel dots, it’s even more pixelated than Minecraft’s mosaics!”

“Who are you looking down on? Play a heavily modded Minecraft, with all the HD models and lighting, Minecraft’s visual performance is not bad at all!”

“Stop just talking about graphics and stuff. Didn’t you notice how special this game actually is?”

“It seems to have merged all the Mario versions from the Switch membership library?”

“Not just that, the key is that players can supposedly create their own levels and maps!”

“Exactly, exactly. Thinking about Warcraft and Minecraft, I have a premonition that I might not even be able to play all the maps in this Super Mario Maker game.”

“But it still looks pretty fun, a four-player co-op game to foster friendship?”

“Haha, Mr. Chen has really changed these days! I declare ‘Warrior of Love’ to be a fitting title.”

Players on site exchanged their views on the game.

After all, it was completely unexpected. They never thought Chen Xu would release a platformer.

However, despite the surprise, many players were delighted. Previously, Party Animals and Human: Fall Flat had been full of entertainment, leisure, and healing.

And now, another unique Mario platformer, with Mario combined with this seemingly very interesting gameplay.

Clearly, this was another healing and joyful game!

Many players felt that this time, Chen Xu was truly going down the 'Warrior of Love' path of no return.

However, some old fans expressed their 'youth ending,' saying that although it was a good thing, for some reason, they felt a little reluctant at the thought of Mr. Chen truly embarking on a healing route.

After all, the years of being tricked by Mr. Chen were also a part of their youth!
