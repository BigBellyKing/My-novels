Chapter 475: Intensify Efforts! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Coming out of the game, Song Ren immediately uninstalled the game from his gaming pod.

At the same time, he opened the Nebula Games Platform and decisively dragged the game down to a self-created category list at the very bottom. Then he opened the Nebula Games Platform on the PC platform and repeated the same operation. Get lost! Never appear in my sight again!

In that small list, there were a total of four games: Getting Over It, Silent Hill PT, Outlast, and the newly added Resident Evil.

After emerging from the gaming pod, Song Ren opened the window and took a deep breath, looking at the bright sunshine outside. Then he sat in front of his computer and watched two episodes of Peppa Pig cartoons, which finally made him feel a little better. He really couldn't take it anymore.

There were too many elements in the game that evoked fear, especially when combined with the VR immersive experience and force feedback, which brought out the sense of terror to the fullest. Moreover, various techniques commonly used in horror games were fully showcased in Resident Evil.

For instance, the sudden appearance of a floating corpse when players traversed the sewers was a jump scare. Such jump scares are indispensable in horror games, but many horror games intentionally increase these jump scare points to compensate for actual fear points. However, this was not the only way to make players panic; the second phase involved entering the second-floor room after Mia disappeared.

The gloomy room, combined with the cramped and narrow setting, and the thunderstorm BGM echoing in the silence. And your own footsteps, making it impossible to distinguish where they came from, all contributed to creating an atmosphere of dread. There was also the oppressive feeling brought by the suddenly mutated Mia, and Mia's mysterious disappearance after Ethan chopped her neck with an axe.

When she reappeared, she seemed to have returned to normal, smiling sweetly and holding the player's hand, then suddenly turned monstrous, nailing the player's hand to the wall with a screwdriver, and severing Ethan's Qilin arm with a chainsaw.

This combination of psychological and visual assaults left players completely disoriented. Of course, while being dazed by this combination, these players unanimously pointed their fingers at Chen Xu. Calling it a surprise, calling it a gift—but who would believe that nonsense!

Chen Xu's official Weibo account was filled with players' lamentations.

………………

Inside Nebula Games, in the lounge, Chen Xu leaned back in a recliner, scrolling through his phone and chuckling at the players' various comments. He had to admit, when he wasn't trying to trick players, they felt tricked by him, which he found quite profound at the time. But when he actually intended to trick players, and they perfectly followed his script, the experience was simply too amusing!

Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin next to him couldn't help but feel speechless watching the amused Chen Xu. Clearly, this was Mr. Chen's wicked sense of humor.

“However, Mr. Chen, the player churn rate isn't low,” Qin Yi said from beside him. This is quite normal. There's no helping it; after all, Resident Evil is a horror game, and the visual presentation developed by Chen Xu is considerably stronger than in his previous life.

As is well known, generally speaking, for realistic horror games, the more realistic the graphics, the stronger the sense of fear they evoke.

Under these circumstances, naturally, many players were scared out of their wits.

“Indeed, players are all saying they give up,” Ruan Ningxue also chuckled.

“Ah, it seems players still have a slight misunderstanding about the game’s core essence!” Chen Xu couldn't help but sigh.

“I think the players have absolutely no misunderstanding at all,” Yang Xin said, speechless. She recalled a plot concept document Chen Xu had given her earlier; even at first glance, she had felt speechless. At that time, she had genuinely and naively thought it was a family ethics game, and a particularly melodramatic one at that. Something like accompanying his wife, whom he hadn't seen for three years, home for the New Year, receiving a warm welcome from his in-laws, but immediately getting into a small argument with his wife upon arrival, with his wife threatening to break up, thankfully his father-in-law intervened, and then the family had a lavish dinner, with the father-in-law getting upset if anyone ate too little. At the time, she even wanted to ask if players would revolt over such a plot, but then she looked further and realized, what the heck, this wasn't family ethics, this was domestic violence!

“But Mr. Chen, are we going to develop a new horror game after this?” Meng Zuo asked, somewhat curious. During this time, they had also read the two novels Chen Xu mentioned earlier, as per his request, and learned about some related content. The Cthulhu Mythos, a relatively niche genre. In the gaming field, it wasn't entirely unused, but it was mostly confined to horror and thriller games. At the same time, many prototypes for fantasy monsters could find similar origins within it.

“To some extent, it can indeed be called a horror game,” Chen Xu mused, then summarized after hearing Meng Zuo's words. Hearing Chen Xu's words, everyone was a little confused. What does 'to some extent' mean?

“You'll know when the time comes. Also, since there are some significant player opinions regarding Resident Evil...” Chen Xu smiled, left them in suspense, then pondered for a moment.

“Make adjustments?” Zhang Yida, who was in charge of marketing and operations and had been silent until now, asked.

“Hmm… intensify efforts! Completed players can now choose any first-party game we've released on the current platform, excluding this year’s titles. Players who reach 30% game progress will randomly draw a mini-game, and those at 60% progress will draw a medium-sized game. As for the game library, our operations team can handle that,” Chen Xu decided. “Also, we can take this opportunity to release some crossovers! Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Rainbow Six Siege—aren't these all our own IP brands?”

For Nebula Games currently, this amount of money wasn't a huge sum. Since it was the first time holding a holiday event outside of traditional discounts, they might as well let the players enjoy themselves more.

Everyone: ......

…………………………

Online, the topic of Resident Evil was exceptionally popular. Of course, regarding this game, despite its high popularity, most players probably hadn't even started playing it. Just watch it online!

After all, Resident Evil is a horror game, and many players, after being scared speechless themselves, chose to watch streamers and UP hosts get scared speechless, which provided a very interesting experience.

Until the related crossovers and rewards were announced.

The rewards were upgraded, and more games were given away! And there were even skin crossovers for other online games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare!?

As these new rewards came out, many players instantly felt their hands itching to act. Although there were still many players online saying that Mr. Chen wasn't giving out benefits, but rather trying to kill them, and that they would absolutely not risk their lives for these few games and skins.

However, a few hours later, many players posted screenshots of their successful redemptions in the original threads and game communities, putting on a grand display of "It's so good!"

At the same time, as players gradually adapted to the game's horror, after a family reunion dinner...

They discovered that if they ignored the fear, the game was actually quite enjoyable.

Especially later on, players could acquire many weapons, allowing them to enact a harmonious family drama of 'Chainsawing the Father-in-Law, Burning the Mother-in-Law, and Punching the Brother-in-Law,' showing players how an ordinary programmer could transform into a Hand Sanitizer Warrior.

As the game progressed and horror was no longer the main theme, the game's story instead became a major feature attracting players.

And crucially, as the game's plot gradually unfolded, players also realized that this game truly was a 'family fun'-themed game!
