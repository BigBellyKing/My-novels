Chapter 39: Then We'll Always Meet on the Moon

The background music in the game, for the first time, changed from pure instrumental to a themed song with lyrics.

"Everything's Alright."

It was as if it sang Liva's innermost feelings.

Accomp anied by the sorrowful melody, Liva was gradually removed from Johnny's life.

On the steps of the teaching building where Johnny thought he first met Liva.

The platypus, and Liva sitting on the steps, were gone, leaving only a book about lighthouses rustling in the wind.

Here, Johnny's good friend Nicolas walked through the corridor.

Inside the library, Liva was no longer there, replaced by Joey. The two brothers talked about Transformers and aerospace.

The copy of "The Emperor's New Clothes" that Liva liked was covered in dust.

In front of the cinema where Johnny and Liva had watched movies together, Johnny and his brother Joey walked in, laughing joyfully.

Yes, Liva was removed.

But Eva altered Johnny's memories, replacing Liva with his brother Joey.

At the same time, constant hints and guidance shaped Johnny's dream and goal: to become an astronaut.

Without Liva, with Joey by his side, Johnny.

His future was completely changed.

The horse ranch where Johnny and Liva once galloped together was empty at this point in time.

In front of the lighthouse named Anya, there were only countless weeds, and no trace of the couple who were once there.

Even the rabbit that was hit and killed during their wedding was gone.

In Johnny's memory, his future had been completely altered.

Through continuous training and study.

Finally, Johnny received an employment offer from the Space Agency and visited the Space Agency.

His goal was now within reach.

'Going to the moon,' this goal seemed to be only a matter of time.

Everything Eva did seemed to be working.

But all the players and viewers were silent.

Yes, Johnny would soon be able to go to the moon.

Eva and Neil were also about to complete their mission.

But was this ending truly what Johnny wanted?

Going to the moon, but without Liva.

Did it really have any meaning?

In the future memories Johnny fantasized about, they arrived at the Space Agency.

At this moment, Dong Zhen, and all the players who had reached this point in the game.

Were merely mechanically operating the game characters.

Suffering, there was only one feeling: suffering!

But as Eva and Neil arrived at the Space Agency and toured with Johnny.

'She's not here either...'

'What are you talking about?'

'Anyway, let's go.'

Accompanying Neil and Eva's conversation, Dong Zhen seemed to discover something different.

"Wait! You old hag!"

"This old hag seems to be looking for something!"

In the waiting room, thinking about what had just happened and Eva's words, Dong Zhen had a bold conjecture, one he hoped was true.

But before he could say it in his live stream.

The previously sorrowful game background music suddenly fell silent, replaced by a heartbeat sound.

Cheerful background music began to play.

A girl with an orange-red ponytail appeared at the doorway.

'Ah! This is also our new recruit, Liva, isn't it? It's great you could come.' The unnamed Space Agency director said.

'Hello, I'm Johnny.' Johnny stepped forward to greet her, just as he had before.

At the same time, the last memory fragment was finally collected.

Eva, standing by the window, let out a sigh of relief.

'Phew! I almost thought she was gone.'

'What are you doing? Eva! But you... deleted her!' Neil said incredulously.

'No, I told you, I merely relocated her. How she plans her life is still up to... her.'

'This new world... is built based on public data and Johnny's personal beliefs. Since Liva belongs to an individual, her data would not have been recorded in public data.'

Accompanying Eva's explanation, Neil also understood: 'So... this entirely comes from Johnny...'

Yes, Liva still came!

Even though their lives had changed, even though Johnny and Liva had no interaction before.

Yet, in this fictional world, Johnny still remembered that promise.

'What if we get lost? Then we'll meet on the moon, silly!'

Yes, they would eventually meet again on the moon.

The tears Dong Zhen had held back earlier threatened to well up again.

In the Space Agency, that tune was no longer "To Liva."

It had a brand new name: "To the Moon."

In the hall, watching Johnny play the piano, Liva murmured from the audience: 'I like that name.'

............

In Johnny's fabricated memory, the two underwent years of training and preparation.

Finally, the rocket was almost ready for launch.

Neil and Eva also invited Lily, Johnny's caregiver, and his doctor, among others, to witness this moment.

Under the sunset, countless people stood on the Cross-river Bridge, watching the rocket launch site in the distance.

With a rumbling sound, the rocket launched.

At the same time, a heartbeat sound came.

A very dull heartbeat.

This was the heartbeat of the critically ill Johnny in reality.

He was about to leave this world.

To the tune of the piano piece "To the Moon," the rocket ascended.

Ahead was their destination – the moon.

Inside the rocket, Johnny and Liva looked at each other in unison.

Then their hands gently clasped together.

"Then we'll always meet on the moon, silly!"

As the moon appeared, the screen went dark.

The next moment, Johnny's past memories flashed by like a revolving lantern.

Watching these memories, recalling Johnny and Liva's story in the game.

Finally, Dong Zhen, in front of his computer, couldn't hold back his emotions. He covered his face with his hands, then pulled a tissue from beside him.

It wasn't his nose he was wiping, but his eyes.

'Damn, damn, damn! Tough guy crying a second time!'

'What the heck, I'm bawling my eyes out!'

'Can't see the screen through my tears!'

'What if you really get lost? Then we'll meet on the moon, silly!'

'What if you really get lost? Then we'll meet on the moon, silly!'

As the game's final credits screen appeared.

In Dong Zhen's live stream, the bullet comments gradually turned into this same phrase.

At this moment, everyone was moved by the game's plot.

Everyone had even forgotten.

This was actually a game participating in a Sci-Fi Game Design Competition.

No one was thinking about whether it truly counted as a sci-fi game anymore.

Everyone was immersed in the story of Johnny and Liva.

Thanks to 'Caiji 2016' for the 1500 reward.
