Chapter 622: Warcraft (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Regarding Chloe's departure, Chen Xu naturally couldn't completely delete the character from the game.

She would simply disappear for a while.

[Mr. Chen's sins are heinous, causing players to lament endlessly]

Logging onto his official Weibo account and seeing the uniformly critical comments, Chen Xu felt a surge of emotion.

It was just a small easter egg-like piece of content, why did players have so little faith in him?

"Chloe will not leave everyone; she will return with a brand new surprise."

While sighing, Chen Xu also posted a message on his official Weibo, aiming to put the players' minds at ease.

And with Chen Xu's Weibo post, the players immediately erupted.

First, there was a slightly reassuring message: Chen Xu confirmed that Chloe would return.

Although many players jokingly called Chen Xu the 'Old Geezer', given the countless heartaches his works had caused them, they also placed great trust in Chen Xu's credibility.

Since he said it, Chloe would definitely return.

The only thing that made players curious was Chen Xu's 'brand new surprise,' leading to widespread online discussion.

‘Finally! My wife Chloe is coming back!’

‘Bro upstairs, I have all your wife's forms!’

‘Yeah, get possessive, everyone!’

‘Enough with the possessiveness! Didn’t anyone wonder about the other news Mr. Chen mentioned?’

‘Right, Chloe is confirmed to return, but what exactly is this 'new surprise'? Can Mr. Chen's 'surprise' really be a surprise?’

‘Who knows? Mr. Chen, I think if there were a ranking list of grand promise-makers, he'd undoubtedly be number one.’

‘You guys, you were all calling him ‘Old Geezer’ before, now why has everyone switched to ‘Mr. Chen’?’

Players online discussed the related news, but for all of them, there was one common action: logging into Nebula World periodically to check if Chloe had returned.

Song Ren was, of course, one of them. He didn't notice it when Chloe was there, but now that she was gone, he felt something was missing every time he logged into Nebula World to play games.

He habitually logged in for a quick look, but the next moment, his eyes lit up.

Because in front of the small island house, he saw a familiar figure.

Chloe, who had left before, was back!

"Hello… I think I might need to stay with you for a while longer… because I feel I might learn more from you, and I still want to watch you on your adventures."

"So… could you keep me for a bit longer? Of course, in return, I will take care of everything for you." Still with her familiar smile, Chloe said to Song Ren.

Without a moment's hesitation, Song Ren immediately agreed.

Stay as long as you like, don't be a stranger.

Don't treat him like an outsider.

"Thank you. Also, during my time away, I made some new discoveries that you might find interesting." Chloe smiled brightly, then, as if remembering something, she took out a piece of parchment under Song Ren's surprised gaze.

"What is this?" Song Ren felt a little bewildered as he took the parchment from Chloe.

It appeared to be a map, but it was completely illegible.

There were only a few scattered icons, and they were incomplete.

"I'm not sure, but it seems to be a map of a known world you once explored." Chloe shook her head, but gave Song Ren a crucial piece of information.

A map of a known world?

Recalling Chen Xu's previous Weibo message, Song Ren was now ninety percent sure that this was likely an easter egg for Chen Xu's next new game, and possibly a sequel.

But the key problem was, it was too Riddler-like!

Looking at the parchment, Song Ren was utterly bewildered.

Similarly, on Weibo, many players were just as bewildered.

Welcoming Chloe back was supposed to be a happy occasion.

Hearing that Nebula Games might have news of a new game, possibly a sequel to an existing IP, was even more exciting news.

But only being told there's a new game, with no other details, was truly agonizing news.

‘I’m sick of this. I thought Mr. Chen had a change of heart, but it turns out it’s just one trick after another.’

‘Chloe is back, but she brought me news that causes immense pain.’

‘So what the heck is this parchment map? It’s all blurry, I can’t see anything clearly. Can any masters solve this puzzle?’

‘Don’t worry, the Detective Agency that deciphered all those Riddler-like messages from Bloodborne and other games has already begun its investigation!’

Online, players simultaneously denounced Chen Xu for being Riddler-like again, while also eagerly trying to figure out what this new easter egg map foretold.

………………

Meanwhile, in Nebula Games' conference room, everyone looked excitedly at Chen Xu, or rather, at the large screen behind him.

Before this, the gradual content planning within Nebula World, including a dedicated team in the Art Team for relevant content refinement, meant everyone on the team knew.

Perhaps one day, *that* game would arrive.

But now, as the meeting was genuinely convened, seeing the iconic character on the big screen still excited everyone.

On the big screen.

A figure clad in armor sat on a throne, with a sword shimmering with blue light standing beside him.

Lich King: Arthas.

Everyone, from the first batch of Nebula Games employees to those who joined later, was incredibly excited.

The Warcraft project was not much of a secret within Nebula Games.

Because in Nebula World, in the past two years, besides Stormwind, several new scenes had been gradually added.

And there were quite a few unreleased art scenes as well.

But exactly when it would be released, no one knew.

And now was clearly that time, everyone was incredibly thrilled.

For Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, and others, World of Warcraft was not the first major project they participated in, but it was definitely one they remembered deeply.

For others, Warcraft was also an incredibly exciting IP, as the original Warcraft and its various merchandise had become globally popular.

Even today, it remains the most popular and classic RTS.

Especially with the map editor, Warcraft still maintained considerable vitality today, even though VR equipment had become the gaming device with the largest market share. Many players still logged into Warcraft in their leisure time to experience various RPG maps.

Warcraft could definitely be called a great game.

Now they were actually going to participate in the development of a sequel to this IP. How could they not be excited?

"That's right, this is our next project. This will be a huge challenge for us," Chen Xu said to the group.

Before this, the development of World of Warcraft had not been initiated.

Mainly because the timing was not yet mature enough.

On one hand, the project was too massive and required accumulated resources.

On the other hand, the VR controller was somewhat insufficient for World of Warcraft.

While the PC platform was perfectly capable, Chen Xu didn't just want to simply recreate the previous life's World of Warcraft on the PC platform.

Currently, Nebula Games had both money and technology; what he wanted more was to present a lifelike Azeroth.

But now, with the advent of brainwave capture technology, and through the practical application in Detroit: Become Human, Chen Xu had determined that the timing was ripe.

Combining the existing VR controllers with the emerging technology.

Now, the time was right.
