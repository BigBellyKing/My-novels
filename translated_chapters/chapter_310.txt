Chapter 309: We Are a Professional Counter-Terrorism Team! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

After completing the new player tutorial, everyone's level was only one.

Currently, there was only Quick Play available for the game. It randomly selected one of three modes: Bomb, Hostage, or Secure Area (which is point-capture). It adopted a best-of-five format, with two rounds of attack and defense switching. If it was 2:2, a tie-breaker would be played.

Systems like the ranking system were actually already complete. Regular matchmaking also calculated hidden MMR and team scores based on the ranking mechanism, allowing players to be matched with equally skilled opponents. However, since everyone currently had no idea how to play, there was no need to enable the Ranked Mode.

As for the new player tutorial mode from his previous life, Recruit Mode, prepared specifically for new players, it was clearly not needed now, as all players were rookies. After the game had been operating for a while, Recruit Mode would be launched to separate veteran players from new players who had just started the game.

Clicking on matchmaking, Song Ren and his team entered the game in almost exactly one second.

"It looks like the other side is also a five-person party queue team!" Zhang Yi exclaimed in surprise upon entering the game interface and seeing the five opposing IDs. Moreover, those five people on the other side clearly had very fast hand speeds. This was because their five names were very particular; only people with extremely fast hand speeds and internet connections could register such names. Their five IDs were: ASD, QWE, ZXC, 123, and ABC. Very disciplined. In contrast, Zhang Yi and his team all used their usual game IDs, and their morale was immediately suppressed!

"That's normal. After all, party queue players play against party queue players, and solo queue players play against solo queue players, to ensure game balance," Song Ren said, not too surprised. After all, this was a characteristic of most games. Although Rainbow Six Siege, like most games, had voice chat, there was usually a gap in tacit understanding and cooperation between ordinary pick-up teams and premade players.

The mode randomly selected was Bomb Mode, which was quite familiar to many FPS players. It involved entering the bomb site to plant the bomb, then defending it until time ran out and defusing the bomb. From a mode perspective, only the terminology had changed. As for the map, it was randomly selected as Chicago Mansion.

"For offense, what Operators should we choose?" Song Ren asked.

"Old Song, you assign them. After all, you played Terrorist Hunt Mode more than us, so you have more experience," Zhang Yi said from beside him. The Operator selection was a scapegoat position. If they lost, why? Because the team composition was unreasonable! As old friends, Song Ren understood this was a small trap. Yet, he couldn't say a word. Why did he have to play Terrorist Hunt Mode first? Of course, if he had actually figured things out, it would be fine, but he hadn't understood anything yet. Well... it wasn't that he understood nothing. At least he knew that the AI on Realistic difficulty was incredibly fierce, and the breaching rappelling through windows shown in the video felt somewhat impractical, at least for him at the moment.

"Alright... then I'll use my experience to assign everyone's Operators," Song Ren coughed twice and cleared his throat.

"Hurry up, only twenty-seven seconds left, no time! If you don't say, I'll just pick randomly, don't give me a default Recruit Operator," Zhang Yi urged. Any Operator was fine, but not a Recruit. That thing had no skills, and you couldn't even see what it looked like, how unlucky!

"One of those Operators that deploys a huge shield and one with a small flash shield!" Song Ren declared. These two were the Operators that left the deepest impression on him. And for counter-terrorism, how could they proceed without a ballistic shield leading the way?

"I'll take the Greatshield, I've already selected this Operator!" Wang Yifan accepted the task, and after selecting, began choosing his equipment attachments.

"Then I'll take that small flash shield," Wang Han chimed in.

"Next for the attacking team, one Sledge! And another entry fragger, Fuze, equipped with a shield to cover the rear. I'll take IQ!" Although he had no idea how to play, Song Ren wasn't sure how effective these Operators' skills would be in actual combat. But this didn't stop him from mentally picturing a perfect scenario. The Greatshield and small shield would lead the way, holding up their shields. Sledge would follow in second position, and if they encountered an unbreached wall, he'd go up and smash it with his hammer. Fuze, meanwhile, would cover the rear with his small pistol and shield. As for why he chose IQ as an Operator, the main reason was that he valued this Operator's ability to scan electronic devices. After all, the defenders could use cameras, and with everyone unfamiliar with the map, he figured it would be hard to find them. Even if they kept getting notifications that they were being scanned, they probably wouldn't find them quickly. So with IQ, a quick scan could help them find cameras more effectively. Moreover, he had seen in the Operator's video introduction that not only cameras, but also electronic devices and traps, such as Kapkan's devices, could be detected. In this way, the enemies' eyes would effectively be poked out. And they had ten drones to gather intelligence and information. How could they lose? This was them, a professional counter-terrorism team!

As the game began, the five players' drones headed into the mansion. Their current objective was to locate the two bombs inside the mansion. And then defuse either one.

"This map is so complicated!" Controlling his drone, Song Ren felt a bit dizzy. The new player tutorial was fine before, but now that he was in actual combat, he was a bit confused. It was really a bit convoluted; he had no idea which part of the map connected to which. At least for now, he followed the stairs from the main entrance to the second-floor office, and then he got lost.

"It's fine, if we're confused, the opponents are probably confused too. Let's just wander around," Zhang Yi said. As for why he said that? Because he was also lost.

"Found it! I found the bomb! It's in the basement garage room! Oh no... my drone got destroyed!" Although Zhang Yi and Song Ren were lost, Wang Han successfully located one of the bombs. As for the other bomb's location, it shouldn't be too far away. A yellow marker appeared on the map. Song Ren, Zhang Yi, Wang Yifan, and Joey, the four of them, all controlled their drones and headed towards it. But even though the point was marked, the few people inside the house couldn't find a way in. Although the Chicago Mansion map was quite small, for them, who were playing the game for the first time, it still felt a bit complex. As for this map, Chen Xu did not choose the post-rework version, but instead stuck with the pre-rework version. After all, it was more realistic and offered very high playability and entertainment, especially since the entire interior of the map was basically made of wooden floors, meaning players could theoretically demolish the entire house. Of course, some improvements were made, for example, the basement garage leaned towards the post-rework version, adding some cover instead of the original empty space designed for direct gunfights. At least for casual matchmaking, it was perfectly fine.
