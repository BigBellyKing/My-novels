Chapter 439: Everywhere I Go, It Collapses (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

From Song Ren's current perspective, the plot of *Uncharted*, while not exceptionally brilliant, wasn't bad either.

Especially inside the mansion, Nathan Drake's yearning for adventure, yet his restrained demeanor, resonated strongly with Song Ren.

As for the appearance of his brother Sam, it was clearly a catalyst.

Beyond the story, what truly captivated Song Ren were the various camera transitions and the stunningly beautiful environments within the game.

Just like the mansion scene he was in at that moment.

With the help of his old friend Sully, Nathan and Sam successfully entered the mansion.

The mansion's grand hall was filled with countless gentlemen and noblewomen, and outside, various luxury cars were parked. The European-style estate resembled a medieval castle, brimming with history and beauty.

Especially when climbing on the rooftop, gazing at the distant cliffs and the azure sea, and then seeing the crumbling rubble beneath his feet and the moss covering the building in front, it created a dreamlike and ethereal sensation.

Coupled with *Uncharted*'s explosive visuals, the visual impact was simply astonishing.

Nathan and Sam stealthily infiltrated the auction to retrieve a cross that held clues, but naturally, they weren't going to buy it with money.

So, they had to employ some tricks, combining puzzles and action. It wasn't overly difficult but felt very engaging.

After some maneuvering in the cellar, they cut the power, stole the auctioned cross in the dark, and at the same time, the game's antagonist appeared.

It was Rafe, who fifteen years ago had embarked on the 'Path to Hell' with Nathan Drake and Sam Drake.

After the item was lost, Rafe and the auction house's security began searching for Nathan and his whereabouts.

At this point, players didn't have firearms yet; they could only use stealth to evade. It wasn't too difficult, just required a little attention.

However, compared to Sam, Nathan, upon entering the house, was quite unlucky, encountering a particularly formidable Black Woman Mercenary Leader.

"Holy cow, how is she so strong?" Song Ren was utterly shocked watching Nathan get punched out of a window.

But thinking about it, it wasn't that surprising.

After all, Nathan was just an 'ordinary' explorer and treasure hunter.

In a close-quarters fight, he definitely couldn't beat this mercenary leader.

What truly impressed Song Ren, though, was that even when beaten black and blue, Nathan still didn't forget to crack all sorts of jokes.

After this combat scene, Nathan escaped through the window, and while climbing, he also retrieved a pistol Sam had provided him for self-defense.

Thus, at this moment, Nathan finally had a means of self-defense.

Looking at the patrolling security guards ahead, Song Ren smiled slightly.

"Stealth? Who has that much time for stealth in life? Is the 'adventurer' difficulty kidding me? As long as the game's difficulty is low enough, I can kill even a god for you to see!"

Ten minutes later, inside the mansion, Song Ren hummed twice, looking at the piles of bodies. He exuded a bold declaration reminiscent of Wei Yan ambushing Yang Yi, shouting 'Who dares kill me?' on the battlefield. The small pistol in his hand had now transformed into a submachine gun.

It must be said, on the lowest difficulty, the game offered players only one feeling: exhilaration.

The "breathing-to-regain-health" trick, combined with the low damage from enemies on the easiest setting, made Song Ren feel as if protagonist Nathan Drake was an ironman. Moreover, the game's auto-aim feature for targeting enemies made the entire combat flow as smooth as if greased with lubricant.

From the courtyard, he fought his way to the main hall, then from the main hall to the mansion's entrance, before speeding away in Sully's car.

The process was incredibly thrilling, as if he himself was starring in an excellent action movie.

And from here, the game truly began to get on track—treasure hunting.

After all, *Uncharted* is a treasure-hunting game.

Before this, the escapes from the prison and the mansion, though breathtaking, weren't actually related to treasure hunting.

Only after obtaining the crucial clue from the mansion did the journey of treasure hunting and adventure truly begin.

At the same time, the game's settings finally shifted from modern environments to some sparsely populated places.

All sorts of perilous and strange climbs, along with endless thrills and drama, unfolded before Song Ren.

"My goodness, if someone actually did this in real life, the grass on their grave would probably be three zhang high by now, wouldn't it?"

Sliding down a slope towards a cliff, then, just before falling, throwing a grappling hook towards a distant tree trunk to swing across to the opposite ledge using momentum—the entire maneuver was incredibly stylish.

Of course, if he failed, he'd probably have to reincarnate again.

And sometimes, branches and precarious footholds would suddenly break and fall, making players feel utterly terrified during climbs.

Because during the game, players were essentially fully immersed throughout.

The surrounding environment, lighting and shadows, fluid and natural dialogue between characters, and the almost negligible game UI.

All these factors made players feel as if they were personally embarking on a treasure hunt and adventure.

This sense of immersion, coupled with the game's design of various thrilling climbs, gave players a truly lifelike experience.

Upon arriving at St. Dismas Cathedral in Scotland, the game's pace became even more tense and exciting.

However, just like most action movies, when the protagonists reach their destination, the antagonists always get there first.

At St. Dismas Cathedral, Rafe and the Black Woman Mercenary Leader had already arrived.

Unlike Nathan and Sam, who relied on various puzzles, clues, and climbs to find a cave beneath the cathedral, possibly Henry Every's tomb.

Rafe and the Black Woman Mercenary's approach was much simpler and more direct: sheer explosive demolition.

Now, Nathan and Sam's task was to solve the puzzles before Rafe and the Shoreline Mercenaries discovered the treasure.

Compared to the previous two scenarios in the mansion and prison, the current puzzles were clearly a step up in difficulty.

For players who enjoyed puzzles, this would obviously not be a challenge.

And for players less skilled at puzzles, *Uncharted*'s puzzle content was quite friendly, as Sam would kindly offer hints.

Even the system would provide guidance, even directly shifting your view to the key puzzle icon.

Players just needed to use their brains a little; there was absolutely no chance of getting stuck.

Similarly, after solving the puzzles, the game would usher in even more intense and thrilling grand scenes.

'Henry Every, he's toying with us! So that's the answer, but where's the treasure? Ah! I mean, King's Bay? Good, but where next? The North Pole? Outer space?'

After solving a series of puzzles in the cave, they finally reached the underground grand hall, but what awaited Nathan and Sam was not treasure, but a map guiding them to the next destination. Sam was a bit annoyed by this outcome.

However, Nathan remained calm.

'The one who proves his worth... paradise awaits. He's recruiting, Henry Every is recruiting.'

'Recruiting for what?'

As the two were talking, a rumbling sound echoed.

The antagonist might be late, but they would never be absent.

The mercenary leader, the Black Woman Mercenary, burst through the ruins and appeared before Nathan.

Facing the mercenaries armed with submachine guns, Nathan subtly maneuvered them to grab the cross from the scale in the center of the crypt, then activated a mechanism that caused the entire grand hall to collapse instantly.

The entire hall shook continuously, stone floors crumbled, and at the same time, there was powerful gunfire from the mercenaries.

The scene immediately descended into chaos, and amidst this chaos, Song Ren controlled Nathan and Sam, guns in hand, to fight their way out.

Climbing, shooting, and along the way, igniting the powder kegs the mercenaries used for demolition, flames engulfed the entire camera view.

Amidst the collapses, explosions, and flames, Nathan and Sam frantically fled towards the exit.

Along the way, stone pillars toppled, cave ceilings collapsed, and platforms gave way.

Wherever Nathan went, it seemed to explode and crumble.

As for the path beneath his feet, it definitely completely collapsed.

"My goodness, are you an explorer or a demolition crew? It's all collapsed!"

Watching Nathan and Sam escape towards Sully's plane, Song Ren was utterly stunned.

Climbing and gunfights, a perfect combination.

But the crucial point was, this grand cathedral, which had stood for hundreds of years, just collapsed by more than half?
