Chapter 381: Easter Egg? Digging a Pit! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Chapter 381: Easter Egg? [×] Digging a Pit! [√] (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Looking at the buildings before them, Song Ren and Zhang Yi were both filled with awe.

They were considered veteran players of Warcraft, having invested at least a thousand hours into the game since its release.

Of course, they mainly played various interesting RPG maps within the game. As for their ranks?

The player with the highest Ladder score in Warcraft had already surpassed 4500 points.

As for the two of them, one had 430 points, and the other 410 points.

It's also worth noting that the initial placement score was 500.

As players who had played Warcraft for over a thousand hours, the two were naturally familiar with the Warcraft story.

Standing in the Valley of Heroes and looking at the majestic human city-state before them, they felt only one thing: utterly amazing.

Using the game's built-in sightseeing mode, Zhang Yi and Song Ren flew through the sky, looking down from above.

Of course, Zhang Yi used a third-person perspective, not because it made his character feel smaller against the grandeur of the city-state.

It was simply because he had a fear of heights, and the third-person mode helped alleviate some of his symptoms of fear.

In fact, Stormwind had already been recreated in Minecraft. Many buildings from Warcraft had also been made by various Master artists.

However, Minecraft creations are based on various blocks. Compared to this direct artistic sculpting, the latter was clearly more spectacular.

The densely packed building complexes were clearly layered.

The Mage Quarter with its purple rooftops, the Trade District with blue rooftops, the Old Town with red rooftops, the Dwarf District with brown rooftops, and the Cathedral Square with yellow rooftops.

All of this left Song Ren and Zhang Yi completely stunned.

After all, Warcraft was just an RTS game on the PC platform.

Players could only imagine places like Lordaeron and Stormwind through their own fantasies and CG cutscenes.

Now, seeing such a scene through VR, they had only one feeling: absolutely incredible!

And within this city, Zhang Yi and Song Ren also saw many NPCs. For example, the Mage Quarter had numerous tailor shops, warehouses for storing magical artifacts, and coffee shops and bars filled with mages and warlocks.

On the streets of the Dwarf District, rows of weapon and armor shops were displayed, and blacksmiths toiled tirelessly in open-air squares, forging astonishing masterpieces.

In addition, the streets of Stormwind also had patrolling soldiers, dressed in uniform blue and white armor with Alliance insignia tabards on their chests.

However, what many players found regrettable was that while the entire 'Stormwind' was vast, it currently only offered sightseeing.

There was no substantial gameplay.

Despite this, during their tour of Stormwind, many players discovered some special Easter eggs.

For instance, in the weapon shops, they could see that the weapons and armor had attributes.

This immediately excited them.

Attributes!

What did this imply?

If it were just a simple sightseeing VR theme, would Nebula Games bother to do this?

Clearly, it was a hint!

Referencing The Wilderness (Game)'s farm life theme, perhaps Stormwind would also receive more gameplay updates in the future!

And that wasn't all. Many players also found some special Easter egg NPCs in Stormwind.

For example, in Stormwind's Garden District – which later became Lion's Rest, King Varian's cenotaph after his death on the Broken Shore – they could see an NPC named Solaire of Andorhal.

Additionally, in the Dwarf District, players could spot a little green-hat NPC named Link, a flower girl named Alice on the streets of the Mage Quarter, and a pair of brother guards wearing red and green hats on the watchtower.

Many of these were Easter eggs from the previous life's WOW, just distributed in different areas. For example, Alice was originally in Dalaran, but Chen Xu directly moved her to Stormwind. Of course, most of these NPCs cannot be called Easter eggs yet, as players don't currently understand what they represent.

One could only say they were pits, and once filled in the future, they would become Easter eggs.

But when players look back later, they will definitely experience a different kind of surprise and emotion.

As for now?

The pits are dug for players, and if they step in, they'll just have to stay there for a while.

As for when they'll be filled, there's no hurry.

····················

During the New Year's Special event, many players were immersed in the joy of shopping.

Nebula Games Platform's sales also hit a new high. Of course, looking at it from another perspective, it was also an unprecedented loss!

Players were all enthusiastically discussing the related VR themes online.

“This VR theme is really cool, all of them are super exquisite!”

“Yeah, especially Stormwind, it's amazing! And the key is that the weapons inside have attribute entries, so can we look forward to a Warcraft ARPG in the future?”

“Feels like there's a strong possibility!”

“Hey, stop talking about Stormwind. Does anyone know how to delete this Outlast VR theme?”

“Why delete it? The Outlast VR theme is so much fun, it’s like a harmonious family.”

“Heh, right now it's a harmonious family, but didn't you read the description? New Year Special Edition! This is damn limited-time. It'll revert after the New Year.”

“Holy cow, you mean the doctor cutting fingernails is cutting *my* fingernails right now, but once it reverts, he'll be cutting *my fingers* instead?”

“What do you think?”

“Damn it, that's just inhumane! The PC version scared me enough, the VR one will scare me to death. Chen Xu not only wants my money, but my life too!”

Many players were engaged in various discussions, and quite a few expressed their desire to delete the Outlast VR theme.

Even though it was just a theme, what kind of psychological pressure would it bring if accidentally opened?

Of course, deleting it was impossible. This was all bought with players' hard-earned money, how could it just be deleted? What if they regretted it later?

Besides the VR themes, shopping, and playing games, many players also started paying attention to the Game of the Year awards.

After all, this year was quite historically significant.

Huanyu and Zeus both launched, and blockbusters emerged one after another.

This included not only domestic Game of the Year events but also award ceremonies jointly organized by some authoritative international media.

This drew a lot of player attention, but while players were concerned, Chen Xu didn't really care much.

Because these international award ceremonies were quite commercially driven, and the timing was rather inconvenient.

Although not exactly during the New Year period, it was close to it.

Chen Xu couldn't possibly run off to attend such an award ceremony during the Lunar New Year, because to be honest, Nebula Games didn't need these awards to build momentum anymore.

In the hearts of players, Nebula Games' reputation was already firmly established.

Of course, not going at all wasn't an option either. So, after a brief discussion, Nebula Games directly communicated with the organizers of the relevant awards.

Then, some foreign employees from Nebula Games' overseas branches would accept the awards. Although it was called accepting awards, it was essentially paid company travel. Of course, they also had to fill a slot, otherwise, it would seem disrespectful.

Things like 'General Manager of Nebula Games' branch office,' or 'Lead Producer of Nebula Games' overseas studio,' whoever wanted to travel to Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Southeast Asia, or North America, they could divide it amongst themselves internally.

However, for these various miscellaneous overseas awards, Chen Xu had people from the company handle them.

But for the domestic Game of the Year organized by the Game Department, Chen Xu still planned to attend in person.
