Chapter 85: Is This the Peach Garden?

After finishing the new player tutorial, Zhang Yi and his friends officially entered the game.

They could see that there were already quite a few players chatting in the lobby on the main interface.

Evidently, these were players from the exhibition.

The five computers for the experience were set to private room matches by default, and the computers were not arranged side-by-side, so it was impossible to peek at other people's screens and know their identities.

Except for the Lord's identity, which was open, all others were hidden.

Zhang Yi's assigned identity was Lord, and he chose Liu Bei as his general.

On one hand, it provided a sense of immersion, as Liu Bei was naturally the ruler of Shu Han.

On the other hand, he was quite familiar with this general, having used him in the new player tutorial.

The ability was simply to give other players cards and also recover health.

As for the others, Wang Han's identity was Rebel, and she chose Zhao Yun as her general.

Song Ren was a Loyalist, choosing Zhuge Liang.

Wang Yifan, who remained, was from the Spy faction, choosing Sun Shangxiang.

Another girl, Joey, chose Zhen Ji.

Everyone was carefully reading the skill descriptions of their generals.

After all, they had just completed the new player tutorial and only had a rough idea of the game, not yet fully understanding their general's skills.

After everyone made their selections, the game officially began.

Upon starting, Zhang Yi, as the Lord, checked his hand cards. He equipped himself with a Zhangba Snake Spear and a Defensive Horse, then threw out a Southern Barbarian Invasion, directly deducting one health point from Sun Shangxiang.

As for the others, they all had an Attack card in hand, so they didn't lose health.

Since it was the beginning of the game and it was hard to confirm who was a Rebel, Loyalist, or Spy, Zhang Yi opted for a cautious approach—standing still.

After his turn, it was Wang Han's turn. Without a word, she immediately equipped herself with a Guan Stone Axe.

Although she didn't draw an Attack card, she had three Dodge cards.

She directly used Zhao Yun's skill, treating a Dodge card as an Attack card and playing it against Zhang Yi.

'To advance and retreat is the true magic weapon!'

Along with Zhao Yun's dialogue, an attack effect appeared on the screen.

'Dodge!' Zhang Yi calmly threw a Dodge card.

Then Wang Han immediately discarded two Dodge cards, activating the Guan Stone Axe's skill to forcibly deduct one health point from Zhang Yi.

"Zilong, ah Zilong! I didn't expect you to be the Rebel!" Zhang Yi exclaimed, watching Wang Han immediately reveal her Rebel identity, getting into character.

Although he lost one health point, he wasn't flustered at all.

After all, his Liu Bei could restore health.

Once he knew who the Loyalist was, he would immediately give out two cards.

That's generosity!

"Hmph! Just you wait and see how I eliminate you, incompetent ruler!" Wang Han pouted, then chose to end her turn.

After Wang Han's turn ended, it proceeded clockwise to Joey's turn.

As a Rebel, she first activated her Luo Shen skill.

'Like a wisp of cloud veiling the moon, fluttering like a gentle breeze amidst swirling snow.'

She successfully judged three times in a row, incredibly lucky to draw a Club Ace Zhuge Repeating Crossbow and a Spade 6 Contentment for Forgetfulness.

The third card was a Diamond Dodge, which failed the judgment.

After briefly examining the effects of the cards in her hand, Joey immediately declared herself a Rebel against Zhang Yi without a second thought.

A Contentment for Forgetfulness was played directly.

Then Joey was embarrassed.

"Why can't I attack Old Zhang?!" Joey held an Attack card but found she could only attack Zhao Yun and Sun Shangxiang next to her.

Hearing Joey's words, Wang Yifan complained, "Didn't the new player tutorial explain the game rules? You need an offensive horse or a weapon with an attack range greater than one to attack across positions. Your Zhuge Repeating Crossbow doesn't have enough range!"

"Study the new player tutorial properly; see how you're stuck now? Your identity is exposed, but you can do nothing."

However, as soon as he finished speaking, Zhen Ji in the game drew her blade, hitting his Sun Shangxiang with an Attack.

"That's what you get for talking so much!"

Unable to attack the Lord, and with her Rebel identity directly exposed.

From a public perspective, this Sun Shangxiang, whether Loyalist or Spy, was definitely not her ally, so eliminating her was the right move. Anyway, she could only attack this Sun Shangxiang.

From a private perspective, who told you to talk so much!

"No, you're just taking personal revenge!" Wang Yifan's eyes widened.

Who did he provoke?

More importantly, he didn't have a Dodge card in his hand.

He had a Create Something from Nothing, a Take a Goat in Passing, and two offensive horses.

In some ways, he had a perfect starting hand.

But from another perspective, this was a hellish start.

In his desperate gaze, a second Attack landed on him.

Coupled with the one health point lost to Southern Barbarian Invasion in the first round, he became the first person to be eliminated.

"My goodness, this general is too fierce! Wouldn't continuously judging black cards make her invincible?" Zhang Yi's eyes were wide open.

Fortunately, someone blocked the attack for him; he only had one Dodge card left.

In comparison, he felt his Liu Bei was simply garbage!

What was the point of giving cards to others!?

Wasn't that just for others' enjoyment?

It was like going to a foot bath city for a full service, and Liu Bei's role was: Brothers, have a good time, tonight's on me!

But don't just treat others, enjoy it yourself!

"Why are you all targeting me!"

Wang Yifan listened to the Bow-waisted Princess in the game, her forlorn cry of 'No... I cannot die yet...', and was utterly speechless.

His first journey in "Sanguosha" had ended so prematurely?

The key was that he hadn't even played a single card!

"Friendly reminder, it's not 'us' targeting you, it's only Yiyi targeting you!" Wang Han chuckled.

"Tsk tsk, tough luck! Good thing I'm your next player," Song Ren also said, relieved.

The five people on the field... no, it should be said the four people, were playing with great enthusiasm.

And through the big screen, some players who didn't experience it themselves but only watched were also amused by this scene.

This was simply too unlucky.

But at the same time, many players also gained a general understanding of the game.

That is, in this game, in addition to strategy, luck also plays a significant role.

It could even lead to a legendary god-tier hand.

For example, if Zhen Ji had a Zhuge Repeating Crossbow in hand and could attack the Lord, and happened to judge a bunch of black Attack cards, wouldn't she take out the Lord in one round?

It required brains, but also luck.

Many experienced players immediately analyzed the characteristics of "Sanguosha."

As for ordinary players, they didn't think so much.

They mostly felt that the game was quite engaging and didn't seem very complicated.

The game continued, but the situation on the field entered a stalemate. Zhang Yi and Song Ren, one Zhuge Liang and one Liu Bei.

It perfectly matched their roles as monarch and minister, one Lord and one Prime Minister.

But it must be said that the skills of these two genuinely didn't synergize well.

And their positions were also quite awkward.

"Old Zhang! I don't know how Zhuge Liang died in history, but one thing is clear to me: my Zhuge Liang is definitely being screwed over by you!"

Looking at the Borrowed Knife to Kill and an Attack card in his hand, he felt like cursing.

Last round, he emptied his hand, and next round, he got two more cards.

And if you're going to give cards, at least give a Dodge!

His Empty Fort skill hadn't triggered once!

Fortunately, he had used his Observe Stars skill earlier to get a Cross the River and Demolish the Bridge to remove Zhen Ji's Zhuge Repeating Crossbow; otherwise, he would have died ten thousand times over.

"I can't help it, my health is a bit dangerous, just bear with it," Zhang Yi coughed lightly, looking at his recently restored three health points.

What could he do? He was also desperate.

Compared to Zhao Yun and Zhen Ji, these two Rebel generals' skills, when viewed individually, were actually pretty good.

But when combined, and with their turn order, it was simply idiotic!

"Don't struggle in vain anymore!"

"Exactly, just surrender."

Wang Han and Joey were armed to the teeth, with weapons, armor, offensive and Defensive Horses, everything. Only their health wasn't great, both at two health points.

"Hmph hmph, surrender? Surrendering is impossible! It's time for a comeback!" Song Ren's eyes lit up, delighted by the cards he drew.

"My Lord, do not panic, I, Liang, have a plan!" Song Ren dramatically shouted, fully in character.

Then Zhuge Liang in the game recited his dialogue.

'Lightning!'

A flash of electricity crossed the screen, and then a lightning icon appeared above Zhuge Liang's head.

"Excellent plan! Prime Minister, this plan is indeed brilliant! Combined with your Observe Stars, the Rebels will have nowhere to escape!"

Seeing the lightning icon above Song Ren's head, Zhang Yi immediately understood.

Although it was their first game, after the initial unfamiliarity, everyone had pretty much figured out the game rules.

They were invincible!

"Ah! No Cross the River and Demolish the Bridge or Take a Goat in Passing!"

"Me neither!"

When it was Wang Han and Joey's turn, neither of them had a Cross the River and Demolish the Bridge or Take a Goat in Passing.

At the same time, they tried to forcefully eliminate Zhuge Liang, but he still had a Peach, bringing him back to life.

"It's okay, Yiyi, we still have hope. As long as we're lucky and it doesn't strike us, we can eliminate him directly on our turn," Wang Han said.

"Hmph hmph, don't you dare dream. It's time for a comeback! My Great Han Prime Minister is mighty..." Zhang Yi said, gloating.

But before he could finish, he heard Zhuge Liang in the game recite a line of dialogue.

'Create Something from Nothing!'

??????

"No, Old Song, what are you doing?" Zhang Yi's eyes widened.

Song Ren, who had just used it and reacted, was also a bit embarrassed.

At first, he did remember to use Observe Stars to adjust the Lightning card.

But here came the crucial part.

He actually saw a Create Something from Nothing mixed among the four cards, so he moved it to the second position.

When he got the Create Something from Nothing, he subconsciously couldn't resist.

Drawing two cards, what a temptation that was!

Anyone would find it hard to resist!

Moreover, he saw that the fourth card, which would be the next judgment card, was actually a Bagua Array.

Exclusive!

"It's fine, it shouldn't be a big problem. Emperor Liu Bei is a fortunate man and will naturally..." But he stopped mid-sentence.

Because a judgment card appeared in the center of the game.

A Spade 7 Attack.

And the Lightning judgment was Spade 2 to Spade 9, so the Lightning judgment took effect.

Instantly, a dark cloud gathered above Liu Bei's head in the game, then thunder rumbled, and a lightning bolt struck Liu Bei directly.

'Is this, perhaps, the Peach Garden...'

Listening to Liu Bei's last words in the game, Zhang Yi remained expressionless, while Wang Yifan, who had been eliminated early, was stifling a laugh.

Song Ren looked bewildered.

Wang Han and Joey high-fived in celebration.

"Prime Minister, explain yourself." Zhang Yi glared at Song Ren.

"Ahem, how about we try "Fall Guys"! Chen Xu really wasn't lying this time, this game is really fun!"

Facing an extremely awkward situation, Song Ren, noticing the commotion around "Fall Guys," immediately changed the subject.
