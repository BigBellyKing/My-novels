Chapter 264: You Can Actually "Cheese" It This Way! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Undoubtedly, the Long Sword's performance was incredibly cool.

And in terms of hunting time, it only took about 6 minutes from engaging the monster to successfully defeating it.

It was quite efficient.

However, many players were still not satisfied.

"Mr. Chen, you showed off for nothing!"

"Exactly, Mr. Chen, if that's normal Long Sword play, aren't we all disabled?"

"+1!"

The players in the live stream room were all sending bullet comments.

It was the same old saying: cool to watch, but impossible to learn!

Chen Xu said, "Well... skills can be practiced, can't they? After all, not everyone is born a master."

"Besides, look at the Long Sword. Isn't it particularly cool? And incredibly graceful?"

"Such a cool weapon, in anime and manga, it's usually the protagonist's. And you've seen the efficiency in fighting monsters; there's no issue with low damage. You could say both its upper and lower limits are very high. It's impossible for a weapon to be cool, high-damage, and easy to use all at once. That would be truly unbalanced, wouldn't it?" Chen Xu said earnestly.

Listening to Chen Xu's words, the Long Sword players watching the live stream paused.

So reasonable!

They couldn't find a single angle to refute it!

"Of course, in the game, there are also weapons more suitable for struggling newcomers, and remember to make good use of items!" Chen Xu continued.

Returning to the workshop area, Chen Xu changed into Tao Chuang clothes, then equipped a Healing Smoke Bomb, crafted a Gunlance, ate a defense-boosting Felyne Canteen meal, and once again headed to the Diablos's den.

"If you're just aiming to defeat the BOSS, I recommend the Gunlance for new players, as it's very safe and reliable. As long as your defense is adequate, you'll be fine. Plus, its shelling attacks ignore hitzones, so in the later stages, just increasing Artillery skill gives you damage."

Upon entering combat, to everyone's astonishment, Chen Xu neither dodged nor avoided the Diablos's burrowing attack. He simply raised his shield and stood still.

Next, the Diablos burst out from underground and slammed fiercely into the shield. However, the hunter in the game only recoiled a small step, and his health bar in the upper left corner only dropped by a single segment.

Facing a roar, he raised his shield and fired.

Facing a Dragon Charge, he raised his shield and fired.

Facing two consecutive head thrusts, he raised his shield and fired.

He placed a Healing Smoke Bomb on the ground, kept his shield up the whole time, and just kept firing.

When his health was low, his Palico would also deliver a Vigorwasp. If things got really bad, he would disengage from combat, create distance, drink a healing potion, and continue.

Accompanying the Gunlance's shelling, the Diablos's long horns quickly broke.

The players watching the live stream were also astonished.

Why did this game suddenly feel so easy!?
