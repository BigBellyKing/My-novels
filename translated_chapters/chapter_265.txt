## Chapter 264: You can actually cheese it this way! (Requesting subscriptions, monthly passes)

Undoubtedly, the Long Sword's performance was incredibly cool.

And judging by the hunting time, it only took about 6 minutes from aggroing the monster to success. It was remarkably efficient.

However, this still left many players dissatisfied.

"Mr. Chen, you showed off for nothing!"

"Exactly, exactly! Mr. Chen, if that's normal Long Sword play, aren't we all crippled?"

"+1!"

The players in the live streaming room flooded the bullet comments.

It was the same old saying: it looks cool, but you can't learn it!

Chen Xu said, "Well... skills can be practiced, right? After all, not everyone is born a master."

"Besides, look at this Long Sword weapon, isn't it especially cool? Especially agile?"

"Such a cool weapon, in animations and comics, basically always belongs to the protagonist. And you've seen the monster-fighting efficiency; it's not lacking in damage. It can be said that both its upper and lower limits are very high. It's impossible for it to be cool, high-damage, and easy all at once; that would be truly unbalanced, wouldn't you agree?" Chen Xu said earnestly.

Listening to Chen Xu's words, the Long Sword players watching the live stream were stunned.

So logical! There was absolutely no angle to refute it!

"Of course, in the game, there are also weapons more suitable for struggling new players. Also, remember to make good use of items!" Chen Xu continued.

Returning to the Workshop area, Chen Xu changed into Tao Chuang clothes, brought a Healing Smoke Bomb, crafted a Gunlance, and ate a Felyne Canteen meal that boosted defense, then once again ventured into the Diablos's nest.

"If you're just looking to defeat the BOSS, I'd recommend new players choose the Gunlance, as it's very stable. As long as your defense is adequate, you'll be fine. Plus, its shelling ignores hitzone values, and later on, just increasing Artillery will give you damage."

Upon entering combat, to everyone's astonishment, Chen Xu didn't dodge the Diablos's burrowing attacks; he simply held up his shield and stood still.

Next, the Diablos burst out from underground, crashing heavily into the shield, but the Hunter in the game only recoiled a tiny step, and the health bar in the upper left corner only dropped by one small segment.

Facing a Dragon Roar, he raised his shield and fired.

Facing a Dragon Charge, he raised his shield and fired.

Facing two consecutive head thrusts, he raised his shield and fired.

He placed a Healing Smoke Bomb on the ground, kept his shield up the whole time, and just went "boom, boom, boom." If his health got low, his Palico would send honey bugs; if that wasn't enough, he'd disengage, create distance, drink a healing potion, and continue.

Accompanied by the Gunlance's shelling, the Diablos's long horns quickly broke.

The players watching the live stream were also surprised. Why did this game suddenly feel so easy?!

Unlike the flashy Foresight Slashes and Helm Breakers of the Long Sword, this Gunlance felt utterly devoid of technical skill to the audience. When the opponent attacked, just raise the shield, then fire.

It felt like playing a reduced-difficulty version of Dark Souls. Raise a greatshield, then land a couple of hits after the opponent's attack. It utterly transformed an action game into a turn-based one.

After shelling for about sixteen minutes, accompanied by a wail from the Diablos, the words "Hunt Successful" appeared on the screen.

"See? It's that simple. Besides the Gunlance, the Lance can also do it. However, unlike the Gunlance's Wyvern's Fire that ignores hitzone values, the Lance requires accurate pokes and some damage output. Of course, as long as you're patient enough, you can still poke the monster to death. These shielded weapons basically follow the same routine."

"Besides those, for ranged weapons, everyone should pay attention to the Light Bowgun. It can accumulate Slicing Ammo."

"However, the downsides are that it's quite expensive and time-consuming to gather materials." As he spoke, Chen Xu demonstrated each in turn.

Under the bewildered gaze of the players, Chen Xu switched to the Light Bowgun, brought a pile of Slicing Ammo Fruit and Slicing Ammo, and then went in.

From a great distance, he shot three Slicing Ammo rounds into the Diablos.

A second or two later, the Slicing Ammo exploded.

A string of numbers erupted on the Diablos.

The Diablos, startled, charged at the Hunter.

But from a distance, two rolls were enough to dodge it.

Then it was back and forth.

Shoot Slicing Ammo, then throw a Screamer Pod when the Diablos burrows.

Similarly, after about sixteen or seventeen minutes, with another wail from the Diablos, the hunt was successful.

The previous Long Sword demonstration fully showed how high the upper limit of that weapon was.

For skilled players, the damage output was explosive, and their movements were incredibly agile.

But all players understood that this was something only masters could achieve.

It's like Dark Souls, it's not impossible to play it like a hack-and-slash game.

But for most ordinary players, it's still a masochistic game.

However, the weapons demonstrated later were different!

Especially the Gunlance and Light Bowgun felt brainless, making many players think, "I can do that, put me in coach!"

But compared to being repeatedly thrashed by the Diablos before, this felt like opening a new world for all players. Even without relying on skill, it could be passed so easily by utilizing game mechanisms!

Instantly, countless hunters who were still suffering were stunned.

"My Heavens, is this Diablos really the one I know?"

"I don't know why, but I suddenly feel a little sorry for this Diablos!"

"The Gunlance can be played like this! Combined with that Healing Smoke Bomb, it's incredibly useful!"

"Haha, I passed, I passed! I used the Gunlance and passed! It's simply too effective!"

"I tried it too, but my gear isn't good enough, and my defense is insufficient. The Diablos still hits me pretty hard."

"That last Slicing Ammo was too strong!"

"Yeah, the cost of Slicing Ammo doesn't seem high, it's just a bit troublesome to get Slicing Ammo Fruit and the Light Bowgun."

"Although the damage isn't particularly high, it feels incredibly brainless!"

Many players watching the live stream expressed surprise, and some impatient ones even tried it out themselves while watching. Following the steps throughout, although the process was a bit tedious, they actually passed!

In his previous life, there were many ways to cheese *Monster Hunter: World*.

Among them, the most renowned was the Slicing Ammo cult. With gear builds of Rathalos and Rotten Vale monsters, coupled with the explosive damage of Slicing Ammo, it took simple brainless play to the extreme.

Perhaps the pure damage wasn't the highest, but it was absolutely the easiest to pick up and the most brainless. You could easily get a ton of Slicing Ammo, and if you ran out, you could always return to camp for supplies.

Combined with its unique DEBUFF attribute, it rendered all other bullet types completely inferior to Slicing Ammo.

As a result of this gear build being too overpowered, it was directly nerfed into oblivion.

Too overpowered, or nerfed into oblivion. In Chen Xu's view, both were too extreme.

And the greatest effect of Slicing Ammo itself was actually for tail severing, supplementing the lack of cutting damage for ranged weapons.

So Chen Xu still retained the Slicing Ammo playstyle.

However, it was kept at a relatively low level. Don't even think about speedrunning BOSSes purely with this playstyle; it's just a little trick for cheesing. As for the weapons that allow players to cheese, it would actually be easy to modify them, but why modify them?

Moreover, these cheesing methods are mostly effective for solo play.

For team play, Slicing Ammo is a non-starter; it's a team cancer. If you use it, you'll end up worse than a Longsword Hero. Similar to the Dark Left-Right Spreadshot cult, if you use it, players would rather team up with a Longsword Hero than with you.

If you play with the Slicing Ammo cult or the Spreadshot cult, without true friends or fellow cult members, you are destined to be a lonely old hunter.

Of course, it's also possible that while you're fighting, your three other teammates are exchanging barbecue tips from a distance.

As for the Gunlance and Lance, when teaming up, you're behind your shield, waiting for the monster's Dragon Charge, and then a nearby teammate 'accidentally' bumps you. Happy? Surprised?

As for whether these tactics would allow players to endlessly cheese and eventually lose the fun of the game, Chen Xu wasn't worried.

In fact, for a grind-heavy game like *Monster Hunter: World*, clearing the game is just the beginning. The various weapon gear builds and tactical playstyles in the late game are the core gameplay. Constantly challenging hunting speeds, endlessly farming decorations, you could easily sink hundreds of hours into it without realizing.

What's more, with the Game AI Performance Technology, the subsequent Tempered monsters would be completely different from those in his previous life.

In his previous life, the so-called Tempered monsters merely had increased attack power and attack frequency. It was just a purely numerical change, greatly reducing the players' margin for error.

It was precisely because of this that the Slicing Ammo cult became so prevalent in his previous life; after all, it was simple and brainless – just keep attacking and it's done.

But now? Players who enjoy cheesing, if they aren't the type to quit after clearing the game but continue to play, will sooner or later have to catch up on their
