Chapter 33: Full of Doubts

Continuing the conversation with the two bear kids, Dr. Neil received another piece of information: when Johnny wasn't sick, he often visited a lighthouse on the edge of a cliff.

And Johnny built his house in such a remote location specifically to guard that lighthouse? Clearly, something was going on there!

So Dong Zhen also followed the two bear kids towards the lighthouse.

On the way to the lighthouse, everyone chatted about various random topics, which added some amusement to the otherwise boring journey.

Boy Kid: 'Do you play role-playing games too?'

Dr. Neil: 'Uh... I don't...'

Girl Kid: 'He's not cool enough, he can't play!'

Dr. Neil: 'If I put my mind to it, there's nothing I can't do!'

As he finished speaking, the two bear kids discovered a sleeping squirrel and let out exclamations of surprise.

'Look, a squirrel!'

At this moment, Dr. Neil stood ready: 'Oh no! A terrifying Squirrel Monster!'

What?

Dong Zhen, playing the game in front of his computer, looked bewildered.

The next moment, an impassioned BGM started playing. The squirrel, Dr. Neil, and the two kids stood opposite each other, and simultaneously, a crude RPG turn-based UI interface appeared.

'Don't be afraid, children, I'll protect you!'

The two bear kids behind them exchanged glances, shrugged, and showed expressions of helplessness.

At the same time, 'Attack' and 'Defend' options appeared on the screen.

'What the heck, there's a system like this? Why does it feel so weird?!'

'Oh my goodness!'

Dong Zhen was completely stunned, looking at the game whose art style had suddenly changed.

Clicking the 'Attack' button, four skills appeared.

'Volcanic Jump Kick, Whirlwind Palm, Fist of Decisive Battle, Shoes?'

Dong Zhen, bewildered, randomly picked one.

Then a new option appeared: 'Shouting Volume'.

There were three options: 'Loud', 'Louder', 'Loudest'.

'Are you crazy!'

'What is all this?'

Dong Zhen was completely dumbfounded.

He decisively chose 'Loudest'.

'Your turn is over, Squirrel Monster!'

Dr. Neil shouted at the top of his lungs.

At this moment, the two bear kids behind him stepped forward.

'Stop it—! Or I'll tell Mom you're abusing animals!'

'Yeah, she'll call the police to arrest you!'

The next moment, the RPG UI instantly disappeared. The squirrel glanced at Dr. Neil as if he were an idiot, then turned and scurried away.

'What kind of development is this? I just got into it! I've been trolled!'

At this point, Dong Zhen understood. Clearly, this was a joke in the game, referencing turn-based RPGs.

Because most RPGs have a similar progression.

The bullet comments in the live stream were constantly scrolling across the screen.

'Holy crap, I really thought it was a turn-based RPG!'

'I just got into it and now I'm out of it!'

'Haha, I knew it, why did the art style suddenly change?'

'What the heck, I've been trolled!'

'Chen Xu is so devious!'

'23333333 (laughter), I think it's quite interesting. This isn't a comedy game, is it?'

'Haha, I think it might be. From the beginning until now, it's been full of humor!'

In the game, Dong Zhen steadily progressed and arrived at the lighthouse by the sea.

In front of the lighthouse was a tombstone.

The name of the tombstone's owner was: Liva.

'The old man's wife's tomb.'

Looking at the tomb before him, Dong Zhen recalled that the housekeeper in the house had mentioned Johnny once had a wife, but she had passed away long ago.

Clearly, this was the old man's wife's tomb, but why was she buried in front of the lighthouse?

Did this lighthouse hold any special meaning for the old man and his wife?

With a hint of doubt, Dong Zhen entered the lighthouse and climbed to the top.

Here, there were paper rabbits just like those in the basement, but one paper rabbit was different.

It was folded from a mix of two different colored papers, which would take a long time and be more difficult than folding a regular paper rabbit.

This one could also be collected, seemingly a crucial item.

But Dong Zhen's confusion only grew.

After going through all this, it seemed no questions were answered; instead, he accumulated a belly full of new questions.

The lighthouse and the paper rabbits, what did they truly mean?

Full of doubts, he returned to Johnny's room and, with Dr. Eva, who was already prepared, activated the machine.

Johnny, the old man lying on the bed, his life was about to unfold before everyone's eyes.

But just as they had done before, a medium was needed to enter Johnny's memories.

The purpose was to access the old man's childhood memories, allowing them to implant the dream of becoming an astronaut. Through the machine, this dream would become a persistent goal in the old man's virtual memories.

Thus, in the end, the old man would be able to fabricate a future for himself: one where he became an astronaut and successfully landed on the moon. This would fulfill his dying wish.

Therefore, to achieve this goal, they needed to gradually progress from the old man's recent memories towards his childhood memories.

Before embarking on their journey, they discovered a musical score on the piano downstairs from the old man's room—'To Liva (for river)'.

And the composer was Johnny; clearly, this was a piece he wrote for his wife.

Behind the house, the two doctors found Johnny, but through their conversation, they discovered something very strange.

Dr. Neil curiously asked Johnny why he wanted to go to the moon.

But even Johnny himself was very confused.

'I'm sorry, but I really don't know.'

'I just... want to go.'

Looking at the confused Johnny before him, Dong Zhen, like many viewers in the live stream, was also a little bewildered.

He himself didn't know why he wanted to go to the moon?

Then why did he have such a strong obsession?

'Could it be the origin of an alien invasion of Earth? No, that's not right either.'

Dong Zhen, filled with confusion and curiosity, continued to advance the game's plot. Using the rabbit obtained from the lighthouse earlier, he performed a memory jump, pushing backward through Johnny's memories.

As time progressed, the memories in the game were of Johnny's elderly years.

The house was full of paper rabbits, and old Johnny simply sat at the piano, playing the song he wrote for his wife, Liva, over and over again.

Clearly, Liva had already passed away at this time.

'Paper rabbits, what deep meaning do these paper rabbits truly hold?'

Dong Zhen was certain at this moment that these paper rabbits must have some connection to Johnny's wish to go to the moon.

But what exactly was the connection?

This segment of the game was also very simple: find memory objects related to Johnny.

After finding them all, a not-so-difficult puzzle game would allow them to continue progressing through Johnny's memories.

Playing up to this point, one thing was clear: *To the Moon* was not a game rich in gameplay mechanics.

It was a story-driven game.
