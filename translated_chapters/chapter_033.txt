## Chapter 33: Full of Doubts

Continuing the conversation with the two Boy Kids, Dr. Neil received another piece of information: when Johnny wasn't sick, he often visited a lighthouse by the cliff.

And Johnny built his house in such a secluded place just to guard that lighthouse? Clearly, there must be something going on!

So Dong Zhen followed the two Boy Kids towards the lighthouse.

On the way to the lighthouse, everyone discussed various random topics, which added some fun to the otherwise boring journey.

Boy Kid: ‘Do you play role-playing games too?’

Dr. Neil: ‘Uh… I don't…’

Girl Kid: ‘He's not that cool, he can't play them!’

Dr. Neil: ‘If I want to, there's nothing I can't do!’

As soon as he finished speaking, the two Boy Kids discovered a squirrel in deep slumber and let out cries of surprise.

‘Look, a squirrel!’

At this moment, Dr. Neil stood ready: “Oh no! A terrifying Squirrel Monster!”

What?

Dong Zhen, playing the game in front of his computer, looked utterly bewildered.

The next moment, an impassioned BGM started playing. The squirrel, Dr. Neil, and the two children faced off against each other. Simultaneously, a crude RPG turn-based UI interface appeared.

‘Don't be afraid, children, I will protect you!’

The two Boy Kids behind him exchanged glances, shrugged, and showed helpless expressions.

At the same time, “Attack” and “Defense” options appeared on the screen.

“What the heck, there's a system like this too? Why does it feel so weird?!”

“Oh my goodness!”

Dong Zhen was completely stunned, looking at the game whose art style had suddenly changed.

Clicking the “Attack” button revealed four skills.

“Volcanic Jump Kick, Whirlwind Palm, Fist of Decisive Battle, Shoes?”

Dong Zhen looked bewildered and randomly picked one.

Then a new option appeared: Scream Volume.

There were three options: Loud, Louder, Loudest.

Are you crazy?!

What are these?

Dong Zhen was completely dumbfounded.

He decisively chose “Loudest.”

‘Your turn is over, Squirrel Monster!’

Dr. Neil shouted at the top of his voice.

At this moment, the two Boy Kids behind him stepped forward.

‘Stop it—! Or I'll tell Mom you're abusing animals!’

‘Yes, she'll call the police to arrest you!’

The next moment, the previous RPG UI disappeared. The squirrel glanced at Dr. Neil as if he were an idiot, then turned and scurried away.

“What the heck kind of development is this? I just got into character! I got trolled!”

At this point, Dong Zhen understood. Clearly, this was a meme playing on the trope of an RPG turn-based game within the game.

Because most RPGs have a similar progression.

The bullet comments in the live stream room kept flashing across the screen.

‘Holy cow, I really thought it was a turn-based RPG game!’

‘Just got into character and now it's immersion-breaking!’

‘Haha, I knew it, why did the art style suddenly change?’

‘Damn it, I got trolled!’

‘Chen Xu, this guy is so evil!’

‘23333333, I actually find it quite interesting, isn't this probably a comedy game?’

‘Haha, very likely! From the beginning until now, it's been full of humor!’

In the game, Dong Zhen proceeded as planned and arrived at the lighthouse by the sea.

In front of the lighthouse was a tombstone.

The name of the tombstone's owner was: Liva.

“The old man's wife's tomb.”

Looking at the tomb, Dong Zhen remembered that the housekeeper had mentioned Johnny had a wife who had passed away long ago.

Clearly, this was the old man's wife's tomb, but why was she buried in front of the lighthouse?

Did this lighthouse have any special meaning for the old man and his wife?

With some doubts, Dong Zhen entered the lighthouse and climbed to the top.

Here, there were paper bunnies similar to those in the basement, but one paper bunny was different.

It was folded from two different colored papers mixed together, which would take a long time and was more difficult than making a regular paper bunny.

This, too, could be collected, and it seemed to be a key item.

But Dong Zhen's confusion only grew.

After going around in such a large circle, it seemed no questions were answered; instead, he accumulated a belly full of new questions.

The lighthouse and the paper bunny, what could they possibly mean?

With a head full of doubts, he returned to Johnny's room and, with Dr. Eva, started the machine.

Johnny, the old man lying in bed, his life was about to unfold before everyone's eyes.

But just like before, entering Johnny's memory required a medium.

The purpose was to enter the old man's childhood memories, so they could implant the dream of becoming an astronaut. Through the machine, this dream would become a persistent goal in the old man's virtual memory.

This way, in the end, the old man could fabricate a future for himself – a future where he became an astronaut and successfully landed on the moon, thus fulfilling his dying wish.

So, for this goal, they needed to gradually move backward from the old man's recent memories towards his childhood memories.

Before embarking on their journey, they found a musical score on the piano downstairs in the old man's house – “To Liva.”

The composer was Johnny; clearly, he wrote this for his wife.

Behind the house, the two doctors found Johnny, but through their conversation, they discovered something very strange.

Dr. Neil curiously asked Johnny why he wanted to go to the moon.

But even Johnny himself was very confused.

‘I'm sorry, but I really don't know.’

‘I just… want to go.’

Looking at the bewildered Johnny, Dong Zhen, like many viewers in the live stream room, was also a bit confused.

He didn't even know why he wanted to go to the moon?

Then why such a strong obsession?

“Could it be the origin of an alien invasion of Earth? No, that doesn't seem right.”

Dong Zhen looked utterly confused. With full curiosity, Dong Zhen continued to push the game's plot, using the rabbit obtained from the lighthouse to perform a memory leap, moving backward into Johnny's earlier memories.

As time progressed, the game's memory was Johnny's old age.

The room was filled with paper bunnies, and old Johnny just sat at the piano, playing the song he wrote for his wife, Liva, over and over again.

Clearly, Liva had already passed away by this time.

“Paper bunnies, what deep meaning do these paper bunnies actually hold?”

Dong Zhen could say with certainty at this moment that these paper bunnies must have some connection to Johnny's wish to go to the moon.

But what was the connection?

This segment of the game was also very simple: find memory objects related to Johnny.

After finding them all, a not-so-difficult jigsaw puzzle game would allow them to continue advancing through Johnny's memories.

Playing up to this point, one thing was clear: “To the Moon” was not a game rich in gameplay.

It was primarily a story-driven game.
