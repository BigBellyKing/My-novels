Chapter 310: Hehe! Little brother, enjoying the scan? (Requesting subscriptions, monthly passes)

The match officially began. Although Zhang Yi and Song Ren were completely unaware, Wang Han, who had found the bomb, knew.

Although they still had spare drones, at this moment, none of the five had any intention of using them to continue scouting.

Their spawn points were all different. Song Ren and Zhang Yi spawned on the Side Street, Joey and Wang Yifan spawned near the Construction Site, while Wang Han was alone at the Riverbank Dock.

“Let's gather at Wang Han's location. No need to rush the attack, we have plenty of time. The bomb's position is confirmed, so let's first summarize our tactics and then proceed slowly.” As the team's sole commander and designated scapegoat, Song Ren acted very rationally and cautiously.

At this moment, as Song Ren was walking towards the Riverbank Dock, a notification suddenly appeared before him: his position had been scanned and exposed.

He immediately froze in place, then looked around. A 20-meter scan range wasn't too far, but not too close either. Accompanied by a series of Beeping Sounds, Song Ren located a flashing camera belonging to the defenders and shot it down with his AUG.

“Who are you looking at? Haven't you seen such a pretty young lady before? Peeping Tom!” Song Ren chuckled smugly.

Although, according to her in-game profile, IQ was already auntie-tier in terms of age.

But what did that matter?

Her Modeling was incredibly well-done!

That golden hair not covered by her helmet, and those Azure Eyes, how could anyone resist?

So what if she was an auntie?

As long as she's pretty enough, even a Grandma isn't a problem!

“Everyone listen up, we are professional counter-terrorism squad members, let's show our attitude!” Song Ren immediately hyped them up.

“The in-game sounds are quite realistic. For example, Old Zhang's Russian Operator, with three armor and one speed, runs like a tank, instantly giving away his position. So we need to move quietly. Although there are still footsteps, as long as you're not Listening Against the Wall, there's generally not much sound.” Song Ren and the others hid behind a Wall (fence), not rushing to attack, but instead analyzing their tactical approach.

This was also a detailed feature of the VR version of Rainbow Six Siege. While stealth walking still produced footsteps, they were very faint and inaudible if not listened to carefully.

However, if a player chose to lie prone with their ear to the ground, or pressed against the Base of the Wall, the Reverberation would slightly amplify the sound, making it more realistic.

Of course, there were pros and cons.

Because when performing these actions, their position might not be ideal.

“Next, Wang Yifan, you go first with your Greatshield. Wang Han, you take the side with your Flash Shield, using the flash to blind and achieve a surprise attack.”

“Joey, as our Breacher, will destroy everything that obstructs us.”

“Old Zhang, you Cover the Rear. I'll scan to prevent them from setting up any electronic traps.”

After about 20 seconds, Song Ren had formulated the plan.

Then, Wang Yifan, as the Greatshield, stood with his shield raised and went first, followed by Wang Han in second, with the remaining three close behind.

They slowly moved towards the Garage Room like a Train Formation.

Soon, everyone arrived at the Garage Room.

“There are two Plaster Walls directly in front here. Smash them open, and inside is the Bomb Plant Site!” Wang Han announced.

Before them were two Soft Walls, one large and one small, neither of which had been Reinforced with Steel Plates.

Clearly, this wasn't intentional, nor had the defenders forgotten; they simply didn't know.

Just like Song Ren now, he actually had no idea that these walls could be Reinforced.

Although it had been taught in the tutorial, for most players, “you taught it” is one thing, and “I forgot” is another.

In school, classes are held every day, and teachers teach so much knowledge!

Wouldn't I still fail the exam?

“Wait, what's that sound? Let me scan!” Song Ren was just about to deploy tactics when a series of Beeping Sounds suddenly came from behind the wall, making him wonder.

What kind of sound is that?!

Opening the scanner, Song Ren became even more puzzled.

Why was there a Signal Source in this Corner of the Wall?

And so close.

A camera?

Whose camera is placed in a wall corner?

Or did the defenders pick Valkyrie, or another Operator who could place traps?

“Be careful, there might be traps here. Should we use the drone... Hey! Wait! Why did the Signal Source disappear?!” Song Ren, who was about to lead everyone to attack through another small garage, suddenly froze because the Signal Source in front of him had vanished, accompanied by a sound that seemed like clothes rubbing.

Could it be a person?

Is there someone inside playing on their phone and watching cameras?

But that's not right, why are there still Beeping Sounds then?

While Song Ren was bewildered, the signal suddenly reappeared, accompanied by a Click Sound and a series of Beeping Sounds.

At the same time, just behind a Plaster Wall, a bald, sunglasses-wearing, cool-looking Operator was crouching there, scanning the wall, not daring to move.

If this were reality, one would probably already see sweat on his forehead.

Responsible for guarding the wall, he was still accustomed to the old-fashioned FPS gameplay, hiding in a corner like a sneaky camper.

Unable to hear any movement, he took out his Heartbeat Sensor out of boredom, as it could be used permanently anyway.

Like a camera, he scanned left and right.

But as he scanned, the beeping sound started.

Against the wall, five red heart-shaped signal points appeared directly outside.

It scared him quite a bit.

He quickly turned off the Heartbeat Sensor and notified his teammates.

“123 calling teammates, there are five damn enemies outside the door! Hurry and help me! ABC, why did you run to the second floor?!” The Heartbeat Operator, hiding in the corner, called out to his teammates.

The other teammates, who were lying prone like campers, were also startled by this. All five enemies were outside the garage wall?

Receiving the information, the group slowly moved towards the Garage Room, afraid of making even the slightest sound.

At this moment, the player controlling the bald uncle Heartbeat Operator was also a bit puzzled.

Why was there no movement from the other side?

He took out the Heartbeat Sensor again and scanned; they were still there!

Was it a bug?

Just as he was wondering, a Click Sound came from the wall, as if something had been embedded, accompanied by a clear and rather pleasant sound.

‘Thump... thump... thump... thump... thump!’

And then came.

‘Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!’

His entire screen shook from the blast, and the aftermath of the explosion directly reduced his health to single digits.

Fortunately, in this round, they had an Operator, Rook, who could provide bulletproof plates to teammates, which boosted his health and prevented him from being instantly killed.

But his teammate, who was also guarding the Garage Room and hiding behind a Covered Car, wasn't so lucky and was directly blown away.

Before he could recover, there was another loud bang. The fragile Plaster Wall was instantly blown open by a Breaching Charge, and from the Wooden Plank Passage on the right, came the sound of a breaching hammer smashing through planks.

“Hehe! Little brother, enjoying the scan?!”

Executing a Pre-fire, Song Ren finished off the Heartbeat Operator in the corner, letting out a laugh like a Big Villain.
