Chapter 517: Ciri? A New Wife Appears! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

After the news about Chen Xu leaked, many players also discovered the Easter egg content this time. It was a brand-new triggerable quest added to *Monster Hunter: World*.

Many veteran Hunters, who had temporarily set aside their weapons, also flocked back to the New World.

Song Ren, curious about the new game, returned home that evening and entered the Huanyu VR. He opened *Monster Hunter: World* and arrived at the long-unseen Ancient Forest. Following the quest trigger location he'd seen in online guides, he went to Sector 7. After winding his way around, he found a bush. Controlling the legendary Azure Star and the White Wind of the New World, Song Ren walked in and triggered a cutscene.

“Partner! Look!” The receptionist, who seemed only good for eating, appeared behind the Azure Star, pointing at something in the bush with a shocked expression. The camera panned over to reveal a ghoul-like monster, hunched there, looking around.

“Damn it, no way! No way! Is Mr. Chen doing it again!?” Seeing the monster, which clearly had a different art style, Song Ren shivered. If the game could reflect his real-life expression, he'd be deathly pale right now. The ghoul-like monster instantly reminded him of *Bloodborne* and *Resident Evil*. Is it happening again? And thinking about it, *Hades* was also like that! The Underworld and various monsters, though *Hades*'s art style leaned towards comics. But this ghoul-like monster clearly had a realistic art style! Song Ren thought of those 'fond memories' from before and instantly shivered.

Meanwhile, the Hunter in the game completed the reconnaissance mission and returned to the Astera Settlement. In the settlement, the Commander-in-Chief and a group of people surrounded the ghoul, discussing its origin. “Its current danger level is unknown. Although a target has been confirmed, this creature has many aspects that significantly deviate from our understanding of biological concepts,” the receptionist analyzed. The Commander-in-Chief nodded: “I even think it would be more fitting to consider it an otherworldly creature.” The group debated the topic intensely, while the Azure Star remained silent, appearing quite aloof. Of course, Song Ren understood that the Azure Star wasn't aloof, just simply unable to speak.

Just then, a portal suddenly appeared in the room. A grey-haired woman emerged from it, holding a Steel Sword, wearing eyeshadow, and with a scar on her left cheek: “Another new world? Where is this?” Seeing the grey-haired woman suddenly appear before him, Song Ren's eyes lit up. After Lady Maria, the Doll Sister, and Megara from *Hades*, he felt he had a new 'wife'! The mysterious grey-haired woman looked at the Commander-in-Chief and the others, subtly shifting her feet. The Commander-in-Chief spoke, answering her confusion: “This is the Research Base of the New World's Fleet. And you are?” “A traveler, Ciri.” “I'm escaping some people. Using... well, you could say magic, I came to this world.” Hearing Ciri's words and recalling the previous scene, the receptionist and the Commander-in-Chief were all astonished. Ciri looked at everyone, introducing herself. However, when Ciri saw the Niegui playing with a potion bottle on the ground, her expression subtly changed. “This creature is a Niegui... In a world I've been to, it's a very common monster. How did this creature appear?” Ciri looked at the Commander-in-Chief, appearing somewhat urgent.

In the game, Song Ren continued the dialogue between Ciri and the Fleet members. He quickly learned some key information. For example, after learning about the *Monster Hunter* world, Ciri also revealed her identity. She stated that she was a Witcher, who accepts contracts to hunt monsters, and also wanted to investigate how this monster called Niegui came to be.

Looking at Ciri, Song Ren, in the game, was also very curious as to why Ciri had come to this world. And could it be that this Ciri was the protagonist of the new game? Furthermore, from Ciri's previous words, quite a bit of intriguing information had already been revealed. Firstly, Ciri seemed to be hiding from certain people, and she possessed the ability to travel through time and space, though it appeared she couldn't control this ability very well. Additionally, “Witcher” should be a crucial piece of information, so would the new game be set in a fantasy background?

While Song Ren was speculating, he officially entered the Easter egg crossover storyline. However, what surprised him was that this Easter egg content completely changed *Monster Hunter*'s inherent gameplay. Although weapons like Longswords and Greatswords were still used, the exploration process became a mode akin to forensics, searching for clues.

“It's a bit like a detective game!” Song Ren exclaimed, watching Ciri investigate the truth behind the rampaging Hatebird. However, what interested Song Ren more was that, when praised by the Astera Settlement investigator, Ciri mentioned an elder named Geralt, highly recommending him and stating that she learned all her abilities from him. Clearly, this should also be an important character in Chen Xu's new work.

Beyond that, what quite amazed Song Ren was Ciri's abilities. That is, instant teleportation. She could instantly move behind a monster and unleash a fatal blow. It was incredibly cool. Combined with the Longsword, “graceful” was the only word to describe it.

“These Gajalaka are quite interesting!” Song Ren couldn't help but chuckle, watching the Gajalaka try to make Ciri their chief and demand she wear a mask and dance, forcing Ciri to promise to find their missing previous chief. Every game has a mascot, and the mascots in *Monster Hunter: World* were clearly the Palicos and the Gajalaka.

After gathering some information, Ciri returned to the camp to converse with the receptionist. “By the way, where is that Hunter? I haven't seen him around,” Ciri asked the receptionist with some curiosity. “He's currently on a mission, suppressing the activities of large monsters in the forest. If large monsters were to interfere, it would hinder your investigation. The purpose is to prevent such things from happening.” “One person responsible for this vast forest? That's truly impressive!” Ciri was also somewhat shocked. “How should I put it? That Hunter is quite special. Although he's taciturn, his skill, judgment, and adaptability are all top-tier in every aspect!” “What's even more remarkable is his mental fortitude to see things through once he's decided! I've encountered many Hunters due to my work, but a Hunter like him is truly unprecedented and will likely never be seen again. Perhaps I am living in the same era as someone who will be called a hero!”

In simple terms, he's just an excellent “tool” character, Song Ren thought, remembering his past experiences in the New World while watching this scene, completely speechless. But griping aside, Song Ren still noticed many distinct differences. The game featured a multitude of new dialogues and various branching options. This was clearly completely different from the style of *Monster Hunter: World*, and this type leaned more towards RPG elements. So, would Chen Xu's new work be an RPG? Song Ren speculated inwardly, as these were all clear RPG elements.

However, this speculation wasn't confirmed by the remaining content. Because as Ciri's investigation progressed, the rest was essentially *Monster Hunter*'s inherent gameplay. It was discovered that the anomalies in the Ancient Forest all originated from an otherworldly monster called Leshen. The subsequent tracking and hunting were then *Monster Hunter: World*'s own gameplay, only Ciri's unique instant teleportation skill made the battle simpler and more enjoyable.

After all, it was just a crossover Easter egg, so the entire process wasn't too long. In addition, there were the crossover rewards, which brought many “African Hunters” to tears. Especially Song Ren, who was almost crying, because he finally got an Attack Jewel again! Although it was still a guaranteed quest reward, it was an Attack Jewel nonetheless!
