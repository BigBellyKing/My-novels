Chapter 266: A Truly Legendary Game (Sixth update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)

“Monster Hunter: World” continued to sell well, and player enthusiasm remained quite high.

In reality, there was still a fair amount of work to be done for “Monster Hunter: World” going forward.

Despite being essentially a single-player game, it possessed a very strong lifespan.

Furthermore, in Chen Xu’s plans, more versions would be successively released in the future.

This included classic monsters from the previous life’s Monster Hunter series, such as Rathalos, Zinogre, Brachydios, Akantor, and Bulldrome...

However, these were all contents to be released later. For the current version of “Monster Hunter: World,” the existing content was already quite substantial.

Similar to the DLC for “Dark Souls,” Chen Xu also planned to establish a dedicated project team to slowly develop these后续contents.

Remaining, then, was the previously established strategy.

To further consolidate the advantages of the Nebula Games Platform, while “Minecraft” was a long-term game, for many players, it leaned more towards light and casual gameplay.

As for “Monster Hunter: World,” player activity was currently quite high.

However, as the content deepened, the rate of player loss would inevitably be faster than imagined.

So for Chen Xu, another game was needed to eventually take over “Monster Hunter: World”'s role in boosting user stickiness for the Nebula Games Platform.

For the new work, Chen Xu chose a game that could be called legendary.

An RTS competitive game: “Warcraft.”

Initially, Chen Xu had his sights set on MOBA-type games.

Whether it was DOTA from his previous life, or League of Legends.

For the current Chen Xu, both users and capital were sufficient.

And the production difficulty wasn't that great either.

However, after careful consideration and market research, Chen Xu decided to temporarily postpone the MOBA strategy.

There were mainly two reasons.

Firstly, MOBA-type games had never emerged in this world, and even RTS was still in a developmental stage. Rashly launching MOBA games might make it difficult for most players to understand their gameplay mechanics.

In the Parallel World, RTS-type games were still relatively popular.

Some settings that Chen Xu considered important had largely been perfected.

For example, the fog of war in games.

In his previous life, the concept of fog of war actually emerged due to game engine limitations.

Its embryonic form first appeared in “Dune,” the perfected concept was in the game “Patton Versus Rommel,” but it was truly popularized by “Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness.”

In reality, many classic game designs initially arose as compromises due to insufficient technical capabilities.

However, the emergence of fog of war in the Parallel World was not due to technical limitations, but designers had still proposed and created corresponding concepts.

There were even numerous disputes, for example, designers had been in legal battles for several years over who first proposed the fog of war design, with no definite conclusion even now.

Secondly, what caught Chen Xu's attention was that the esports industry in the Parallel World was significantly more thriving compared to his previous life.

This was not entirely unexpected, as the gaming industry in the Parallel World was much larger and more esteemed than in his previous life.

In such circumstances, there was no shortage of status, prestige, or attention.

Naturally, a decent competitive game giving rise to professional tournaments was a very normal occurrence.

For instance, in the Channel Alliance, the game with the highest concurrent players was an RTS game called “Human Wars.”

This was also why Chen Xu chose “Warcraft.”

From the various small moves made by the Channel Alliance, NetDragon, and TengHua after the launch of “Monster Hunter: World,” it was clear they wouldn't just sit idly by.

Chen Xu had no interest in sitting around and waiting either.

It was highly probable that when he announced a new game, the Channel Alliance, NetDragon, and TengHua would immediately follow up to target it.

Since that was the case, he might as well take the initiative.

When a potential threat emerges, it's always better to eliminate it beforehand.

Wouldn't that be great?

Therefore, after comprehensive consideration, Chen Xu decided to make “Warcraft” first.

After making the decision, Chen Xu pondered for a moment, looking at the computer monitor in front of him.

He began planning the general framework.

In his previous life, there were many excellent RTS games.

The early enlightenment of RTS included “Age of Empires” and “Red Alert,” with “StarCraft” becoming the competitive benchmark. But if one were to name the most far-reaching RTS game.

Then nine out of ten players who understood what an RTS game was would say “Warcraft.”

It was simply too classic, especially the third iteration.

Putting aside the game's plot content, purely from a game mechanics perspective, “Warcraft” could truly be called the magnum opus of the series, genuinely forming its own distinct style.

The population cap, and each unit having different tech tree options and skills that formed various combinations, especially the introduction of hero settings, could be said to have revolutionized the entire RTS game genre.

To some extent, it was precisely the introduction of heroes that led to the later rise of MOBA games.

Especially with the final version, “The Frozen Throne,” “Warcraft” truly ascended to its apex.

Many players might not be familiar with the plot of “Warcraft,” but they surely know the two major characters from The Frozen Throne storyline.

Illidan and Arthas.

Even later, when “Warcraft” was born, many “Warcraft” players got into the game based on these two characters.

Although it wasn't until Wrath of the Lich King and The Burning Crusade that these two characters appeared, and they were relegated to dungeons for players to farm.

However, for Chen Xu, he currently only planned to incorporate the storylines of “Reign of Chaos” and “The Frozen Throne” from “Warcraft 3” into the base game content.

As for the previous storylines like “Orcs & Humans,” “Tides of Darkness,” and “Beyond the Dark Portal,” Chen Xu planned to observe player feedback. If enthusiasm was high, he would release corresponding single-player campaigns as DLC.

If the response was lukewarm, he would follow the old Blizzard Entertainment tradition from his previous life: release animated films.

Besides that, there was another crucial point: the Map Editor.

A game with ten thousand ways to play – this was the praise players gave “Minecraft” before its appearance.

But before that, this title belonged to “Warcraft.”

It’s important to know that the reason “Warcraft” in his previous life had such a vast lifespan, in addition to its excellent quality, was largely due to the Map Editor feature.

Both DOTA and League of Legends are intricately linked to it.

After a brief general planning of a few directions, Chen Xu stretched and walked out of his office.

Although it was an RTS game, “Warcraft”'s scale was by no means small, and Chen Xu wasn't planning to treat it as a small-scale RTS.

If he was going to do it, he would bring this game, which was a legend in his previous life, to the highest point Nebula Games could achieve right now.

Just a quick note~ I won't be writing about League of Legends and DOTA for War3 for now~ Even though the World Championships and TI are currently ongoing~
