### Chapter 133: Overseas Promotion (Requesting Subscriptions)

For most games, especially single-player games, their peak popularity usually occurs during the launch week and the second week. Afterward, the game's popularity tends to decline, especially for titles that received extensive promotion early on.

This is considered a common phenomenon in the gaming industry. After all, for many players, once a single-player game is completed, there's little reason to play it a second time, beyond collecting items or a second playthrough. Since the story has already been experienced, a desire for a second playthrough is rare, unless there's unique gameplay content.

Furthermore, game developers typically don't continue to heavily promote the game afterward, so its popularity naturally wanes.

However, *Dark Souls* completely defied this trend. Its popularity steadily climbed.

Especially as more and more players completed the game and delved into its more detailed content, the game's rating slowly rose from an initial 8.3 to 9.3, and it still seemed to have the potential to climb further.

This left countless game designers in the industry utterly bewildered.

'How is *Dark Souls*'s reputation getting higher and higher? It's baffling!'

'Mainly because *Dark Souls*'s initial score was indeed underestimated, and now it's seeing a rebound. But what I can't figure out is, *Dark Souls* has been out for almost a month, hasn't it? How is its popularity even higher?'

'Exactly! Video platforms and live streaming platforms are practically flooded with *Dark Souls* content!'

'All I can say is that Chen Xu and his Nebula Games are addictive!'

'But looking at third-party statistical sales, while *Dark Souls* is popular, the sales don't seem that explosive? First-month sales probably peaked at 4 million.'

'That's only because *Dark Souls*'s popularity is so explosive! Are 4 million first-month sales low for a blockbuster? It's only a matter of time before it hits the ten million club with future discount promotions.'

'I feel like *Dark Souls*'s design completely goes against traditional ARPG games! Why is it so successful?'

Amidst *Dark Souls*'s immense popularity, the gaming industry was in constant discussion about this phenomenal game. Major game developers and game designers were also studying *Dark Souls* in reverse.

After all, before, the gaming industry generally felt that Chen Xu had messed up. No mini-map, extreme difficulty, severe death penalties—all of these were points players complained about in *Dark Souls*'s early stages.

But why, as time went on, did these very points turn into *Dark Souls*'s strengths? It was perplexing!

Numerous game designers looked at *Dark Souls*'s persistently high popularity, feeling a little doubtful about life. This completely overturned their understanding.

Of course, there were those who doubted life even more. These were the game developers and designers who had been preparing to steal the fruits of labor when *Dark Souls*'s reputation collapsed in its early release. Now, they were all dumbfounded.

Inside Hawkwing Entertainment, Li Xiang felt his blood pressure rising, and in a daze, he seemed to see stars. He had considered many possibilities, but he never imagined that a game whose launch reputation seemed poor could reverse its fortunes without any content changes to the game itself.

*The game is fine, the players are the problem; players must adapt to the game.* This was a jest among many game designers, and basically, veteran practitioners wouldn't believe it. But he never expected that *Dark Souls* actually aligned with this statement quite well.

The most crucial point was that *Dark Souls*'s popularity showed no signs of cooling down. Now, Hawkwing Entertainment faced a rather awkward situation.

Should their new game be released or not? If released, it would have to contend with *Dark Souls*'s output, and then there were the threats from TengHua and NetDragon's two VR blockbusters. If not released, all the prior promotional activities and warm-ups would go to waste.

In the office, looking at his subordinates who were all staring at him, Li Xiang remained silent for a moment before offering them a way out.

"I believe there's still room for improvement in the game's plot and gameplay settings. To provide players with a better experience, I think we should choose game delays. After all, no one remembers games that were released on time but were trash. Game delays are for presenting players with a game that better meets their expectations. Everything is for the players!"

Looking at his team, Li Xiang perfectly copied a phrase Chen Xu had once said at the gameplay Expo. And, surprisingly, this phrase was quite effective. Why the game delays? It wasn't because they feared poor sales against competitors; it was all for the sake of the players!

Similar to Li Xiang, a large number of games that had previously been promoted also collectively opted for game delays. Of course, one or two games still chose to launch according to their original plans, but none of them were RPG-type games.

Chen Xu didn't pay much attention to *Dark Souls*'s impact on the industry. At this moment, he was more focused on the overseas version of *Dark Souls*.

Although Target Software had signed on to represent many of Nebula Games' titles, their primary focus remained on *Dark Souls*. Translation was carried out simultaneously in multiple languages, but voice acting was only adapted for English. Target Software was quite optimistic about *Dark Souls*'s performance overseas, handling the approval documents for various countries and online channel promotion operations.

After the game successfully passed review, *Dark Souls*'s promotional trailer began to be distributed in various countries. The main promotional methods were trailers and actual gameplay videos. Although the momentum wasn't massive, it certainly caught the attention of Chinese gaming professionals.

Soon, news in this area of the industry spread.

"Did you hear the news? *Dark Souls* is getting an overseas release!"

"Really?"

"Just go check a few well-known overseas game communities and forums yourself; there are *Dark Souls* ads there."

"It's kind of expected, isn't it? After all, it's so popular in China, and it's inherently a fantasy-themed game."

"Not really a surprise. Actually, I think Nebula Games' previously developed independent games wouldn't do too badly overseas, especially *Valiant Hearts: The Great War*, considering its source material is that war in Europe."

"Yeah, it's just that Nebula Games' main focus was on the domestic market before. But speaking of which, can *Dark Souls* become popular abroad?"

"Who can say whether it'll be popular or not? But I think there's a high chance, mainly because there don't seem to be many competitive blockbusters in the overseas market during this period."

On domestic official Weibo accounts and game community forums, many players were also discussing.

"I heard *Dark Souls* is launching an overseas version!"

"Overseas version is fine, it doesn't have much to do with us."

"I wonder if they'll open overseas servers later. I kind of want to invade foreigners."

"Holy crap, isn't that bullying? But please count me in!"

"Alright, alright, calm down everyone! Look at your embarrassing game time; you haven't even finished your first playthrough and you're thinking about fighting foreigners. Don't end up getting beaten up yourselves."

While domestic players were actively discussing, Target Software's overseas promotion began to show initial results.

Because the budget for promotion was relatively limited, large-scale advertising was obviously somewhat difficult. Target Software adopted the most common and direct method in the gaming industry: advance media reviews.

Domestically, Chen Xu didn't engage in media reviews; media and players received the game at the same time. However, due to *Dark Souls*'s unique game attributes, some large domestic media outlets were hesitant to speak rashly. Some smaller media did review it on the first day, but their reviews lacked any depth whatsoever, whether praising or criticizing, they completely missed the point. Later, when players understood *Dark Souls*, all those early reviews were reportedly deleted due to backlash.

As for the more authoritative, reputation-focused major media, by the time they understood and mastered *Dark Souls*,

Most players who had been following the game already knew what it was about. Their reviews merely served as a confirmation.

Overseas, considering *Dark Souls*'s inherent quality and how to most quickly capture the attention of overseas players, media scores were clearly the fastest and most cost-effective method.

GameSpot, a well-known overseas media outlet, gave its score on the eve of *Dark Souls*'s overseas launch.

'This is a fantasy ARPG brought by a Chinese game company from across the ocean.'

'Before reviewing the game, I want to express my shock. Its unique map design, unique combat system, and unique gameplay ideas have clearly opened a new path for future ARPG games.'

'We can even boldly predict that this type of gameplay in *Dark Souls* is very likely to become a unique branch in the future ARPG gaming field.'

'Incredibly hardcore, yet it brings both pain and joy. Death is a good friend that constantly accompanies players throughout this game.'

'In terms of plot, unlike previous ARPGs that directly presented a thrilling and captivating story, *Dark Souls* chooses to wrap joy within layers of suffering.'

'If you want to savor it, you need to repeatedly fail and fight again, growing stronger with each battle, and ultimately surpass yourself. This will grant you an unprecedented sense of achievement and satisfaction, which is a very bold attempt; a slight misstep and they would have fallen to pieces.'

'But I have to say they succeeded. This game is damn enticing, with perfect level design and BOSS design. It's not difficult for difficulty's sake, but incredibly reasonable. Each time a stage map is cleared, it's like solving a puzzle, and each time I conquered a seemingly insurmountable BOSS, I felt my blood boiling.'

'Furthermore, the game also has many NPC side quests, but without clear guidance, requiring players to constantly dig for them. Players might even inadvertently cause these NPCs' deaths, leading to that entire content line being cut off in the first playthrough.'

'Moreover, the game's art style and map design are captivating. Taking the High Wall of Lothric as an example, there are various exploration routes that guide players to thoroughly explore every corner of the map.'

'The distribution of enemies and their patrol routes on the map are extremely meticulous, so much so that walking forward along most routes and returning backward offers players completely different experiences.'

'And the rich weapon choices further enrich the entire game's combat system, making it no longer dull and uninteresting.'

'Score: 9.5 points. Review recommendation: If you can accept and endure temporary pain, then *Dark Souls* is definitely worth experiencing.'

After GameSpot gave a high score of 9.5, other well-known overseas media outlets also successively gave corresponding high scores.
