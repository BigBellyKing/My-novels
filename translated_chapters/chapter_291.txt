Chapter 290: You Can Do That?! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

“Ah! What’s going on?!

Shu Ben lost again? Is Mr. Chen really that formidable?!”

On the main commentary stage, Huang Donglai looked bewildered; this completely exceeded his expectations! Meanwhile, Sun Yixie next to him was secretly chuckling. Seeing his good brother’s bewildered expression, he offered comfort on the surface, but his words contained an instigating momentum.

“Oh, Brother Huang, isn’t it normal to make wrong predictions before a match?

And Mr. Chen really has a trick up his sleeve. Who would have thought of this Night Elf expansion harassment? And Brother Huang, you’re not a professional player after all, so making a misread is quite normal.” Sun Yixie said with a chuckle to Huang Donglai.

“No, no, no, Brother Sun, I still think my view is correct. Of course, Mr. Chen definitely has some genuine skills, but I still stand by my opinion: haven’t you noticed that Mr. Chen’s operational skills are actually a bit inferior to those of professional players?

Of course, Mr. Chen is only a game designer after all. And the actual tactical performance of the Night Elves just now, I believe not only us but all players, including professional players, must be greatly surprised. Moving forward, these pro gamers definitely won’t underestimate Mr. Chen.

In such a situation, Mr. Chen’s skills are definitely going to suffer a big loss.” As a professional commentator and a streamer, Huang Donglai rationally analyzed the situation. Of course, he didn’t forget to emphasize to the viewers what today’s live stream was all about.

“So, Brother Huang, do you think Mr. Chen will lose this round?” Sun Yixie subtly fanned the flames.

“Oh, it’s not a feeling, it’s a certainty! Shu Ben’s loss before should be an exception. I admit Mr. Chen is strong, but facing a fully powered professional player, I think Mr. Chen will still have a tough time. Of course, that’s fine, after all, Mr. Chen is glorious even in defeat; as a game designer, Mr. Chen has done everything he can.

Next, he’s facing Lu Bu! Lu Fengxian! And with Shu Ben already having lost, Satellite will undoubtedly be cautious and ready for battle. How can Mr. Chen win in such a situation?” Huang Donglai stated that a professional commentator should have professional integrity.

He believed everything his eyes saw, because in the previous match between Chen Xu and Shu Ben, he could tell that while Chen Xu’s skills were indeed very good, there was still a slight gap compared to top-tier professional players. So, as a professional commentator, he bravely stated his understanding.

And at this moment, the game had officially begun.

As for the map, it was NI, which is Northrend Islands. This map had one major difference compared to the previous one. That is, the players’ spawn points were fixed diagonally, with a neutral tavern in the middle. And each player only had one expansion base next to them.

In the game, Satellite, also an Orc player, slowly breathed a sigh of relief when he saw this map. On this map, he dared to say that if Chen Xu still used his previous expansion strategy, he would definitely be annihilated! The only variable was that the opponent was playing Human. However, he still chose a single burrow for a standard Orc opening.

“It’s a fast tech with a single burrow again, with Blademaster as the starting hero, just like before. But note, Satellite’s burrow placement is very tricky; he chose a rear position close to the gold mine.

Why place it like that? Because this map has a tavern, to prevent the opponent from getting a Beastmaster to harass. And at this moment, the fourth Peon came out, and Satellite directly chose to scout.”

“Satellite calculated everything!” The main attention on the field focused on Satellite, as Huang Donglai analyzed the current situation. But soon the camera switched to Chen Xu’s side, and like most ordinary players, he too found himself a bit confused.

“Hey! Mr. Chen’s build order here seems to be Barracks first, then Farm, then Altar. The starting Footman defaults to scouting the Tavern. Is he still planning to summon a neutral creature, a Beastmaster?

Hey! What’s going on?! The Lumber Mill is up, six Peasants immediately transformed into Militia and headed straight for Satellite’s base, and he summoned a neutral hero, the Firelord. What in the world is happening!?”

Huang Donglai on the commentary desk declared he couldn’t understand it. Equally bewildered was Satellite in the game.

He had a default opening. After the fourth Peon and the first Orc Grunt and Blademaster came out, his scouting was complete at the mid-lane. He saw a Human Footman at the Tavern, which was a standard Human Barracks-first then neutral hero opening. What surprised him was that the opponent directly chose a Firelord, which he didn’t quite understand.

Wouldn’t Archmage be better? But when he saw the second Footman behind, and a swarm of Militia coming over, Satellite became even more confused. As a professional player, he had studied all the game’s data. In that instant, he understood why the opponent didn’t start with Archmage but Firelord.

Because at level one, the Firelord is stronger than the Archmage, and the Lesser Fire Demon also has a split characteristic; if not dealt with, its combat power doubles. At the same time, starting with a neutral hero also saves time, allowing for an extra Human Footman.

But the key is, do you really think one hero, two Footmen, and six Militia can take him out in one go? Are you overthinking it?! Militia aren’t permanent.

Thinking this, Satellite immediately controlled his Blademaster to activate Wind Walk, rushed over, and cleaved at the Firelord. In the early game, especially at level one, there’s almost nothing that can contend with a Blademaster.

Satellite’s idea was to attract the Militia’s attention and buy some time. But the next moment, Satellite was completely bewildered, because Chen Xu, while guiding the Firelord, moved it slightly to the side, but its direction was still towards his base. And with this slight dodge, it took two more hits from his Blademaster, leaving it with three-quarters of its health.

The bullet comments were also stunned.

‘What’s going on? Is Mr. Chen trying an all-in push?’

‘How can this be an all-in push? Isn’t that too fanciful?’

‘Yeah, how can the Firelord beat the Blademaster in the early game? Even with Militia, there are only twenty seconds left. Once the time is up, won’t they all be easy prey for the Blademaster?’

Chen Xu in the game was smiling very happily. Especially when he arrived at the Orc base and saw that deeply recessed burrow, he smiled even more widely.

Next to the Orc Barracks, 800 yards away from the burrow (burrow attack range is 700 yards), six Peasants immediately began building Guard Towers. This is also a Human characteristic: they consume wood and gold, and multiple Peasants can build structures simultaneously.

As soon as one Guard Tower was completed, he immediately upgraded it to an Arcane Tower without hesitation. Before long, the second Guard Tower was also completed. And his Lumber Mill at home was also ready, so he immediately upgraded it to a Defense Tower.

At this point, players, commentators, and Satellite on the field all understood what was happening. Building defense towers directly inside the opponent’s base, you can do that?!
