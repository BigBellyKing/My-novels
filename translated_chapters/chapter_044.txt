## Chapter 44: Outlast

After the interview.

Less than twenty minutes later, Chen Xu hadn't even returned to Nebula Games from the Game Department.

Interview reports from major media outlets were already out.

“Exclusive: Nebula Games' Next Title Is Likely To Be…”

“Chen Xu: I Think I Should Be a Warrior of Love”

“No New Game Plans Yet, But According to Chen Xu's Tone, Nebula Games' New Title Is Likely to Be a Heartwarming Love Story!”

“A Rising Star Independent Game Producer: The Warrior of Love – Chen Xu!”

The Sci-Fi Game Design Competition's popularity hadn't completely faded, and *To the Moon* was still prominently featured on the Official Game Platform.

These media interview articles also introduced many players to Chen Xu.

Including his official Weibo account's followers, his fan count had already reached 800,000.

Based on the current momentum, breaking 1 million was only a matter of time.

At the same time, his official Weibo account's verified bio now included *To the Moon* as one of his representative works, along with the tag 'Warrior of Love'.

Below the related interview articles, many players were also discussing animatedly.

“Warrior of Love? What the heck is that!?”

“If you think about it, Chen Xu really seems to be a Warrior of Love. Not to mention *Mirror (Game)*, where every character has a pure love storyline, though the corrupted endings are quite something…”

“And *Undertale*'s Pacifist Ending is full of love, and the latest *To the Moon* goes without saying, it's all about love.”

“Now that you mention it, that actually makes a lot of sense!”

“But I'm more curious about what Chen Xu's next game will be.”

“It should be a very heartwarming game, right?”

“Exactly, he is the Warrior of Love after all.”

………………

However, Chen Xu didn't pay too much attention to the online situation.

Because at this moment, having just arrived at the Nebula Games office, he was alone in his office doing gacha pulls.

Golden lights bloomed before his eyes, one after another.

The Special Effects looked formidable.

It was just that this thing was too realistic.

Fifty-pulls.

Among them were 37 Common Professional Skill Books, covering plot, music, and level design.

There were 4 Rare Professional Skill Books: one for architecture, one for psychology, and two for music.

The remaining 9 were all Memory Capsules.

“Just one more pull, might as well use it now.” Seeing that he had just enough Emotion Points for the last pull, Chen Xu didn't think much and used it directly.

Accompanying the golden light, to Chen Xu's surprise, something actually dropped this time!

It wasn't a Rare Professional Skill Book, but a Special Item like the Memory Capsule.

“Single pulls yield miracles, is it that superstitious? But this thing?” Chen Xu fell silent for a moment.

【Fear Converter】 (120 days)

Effect: Converts the player's Fear Value into ten times the Emotion Points (up to 6 million).

Clearly, this thing was a Timed Item, a Double XP Card with a cap, but it was limited only to the player's fear.

What was unknown was whether this cap was for the converted amount or the pre-conversion amount.

However, Chen Xu estimated that it was most likely the cap for the converted amount.

“Moreover, this item is different from the Memory Capsule; it's timed. Is this hinting that I should make a horror game next?” Chen Xu was a little speechless.

Regarding the choice for the next game, Chen Xu had actually been deliberating earlier.

Firstly, it wouldn't be a small project like before; at least this time, it would move towards 3D games.

But at the same time, the scale couldn't be too large.

Although game development in the Parallel World was much simpler compared to his previous life,

This didn't mean that no technical accumulation was needed at all.

It was like building with blocks; everyone used the same parts, but what could be built depended on individual skill.

The same applied to games, especially FPS and ACT games.

For example, action games prioritize a sense of impact.

And how to create a sense of impact?

Sound effects, Controller Feedback, Special Effects, UI Interface Vibration, and various Physical Collision Detection. Additionally, a more crucial element was freeze-frame impact.

The same principle applied to FPS games.

So for his next project, Chen Xu wasn't planning on making an overly complex game.

“Thinking this way, a horror game doesn't seem impossible. It can incorporate some Action Elements, and for horror games, these Action Elements aren't the primary core,” Chen Xu stroked his chin, pondering.

Although he had an idea, Chen Xu didn't act immediately. Instead, he first did a rough online survey of the current state of horror games in the Parallel World.

Simply put, it wasn't much different from his previous life.

Whether in the Film and Television Industry or the gaming industry, horror games generally lacked Large-Budget Productions.

They were mostly the type that aimed for high returns with small investments.

However, compared to his previous life, the Market Share of pure horror games was considerably larger.

Some even saw Single Titles with nearly ten million sales.

Of course, these were older titles, usually sold at a cabbage-level price during holidays, and had been launched for many years.

Furthermore, there wasn't a single horror game specifically designed for VR platforms.

After all, VR games could be incredibly expensive in terms of Development Costs.

At the same time, horror games were inherently a Niche Category.

Unless someone had a special fondness for Horror Culture, no one would develop horror games for the VR platform.

After all, the risks were simply too great.

As for horror games on the PC platform, they were divided into two types: one was a Low-Cost approach.

For example, the model of *Undertale* and *To the Moon*.

Another type was made as a Medium-to-Small Scale game.

After roughly understanding the market and relevant developments of horror games in the Parallel World,

Chen Xu quickly made a decision.

To proceed with the Medium-to-Small Scale model, Nebula Games currently had some capital from the revenue generated by *Mirror (Game)*, *Undertale*, and *To the Moon*.

Moreover, although the horror game market was niche, that was in comparison to Traditional Game Genres like FPS and RPG. If done well and it garnered buzz, horror games could still sell big.

Next, the question was which specific game to make.

For horror games, Chen Xu had quite a few directions to choose from.

However, after careful consideration, Chen Xu decided to choose *Outlast* as his next game.

Mainly, it was quite suitable.

In terms of Game Length, *Outlast* had a playtime of about 5 hours. Of course, speedrunning through the game would take less than an hour.

Secondly, compared to horror games like *Resident Evil*, *Silent Hill*, and *The Evil Within*, *Outlast* had a rather clever aspect.

That was, in this game, players controlled a Reporter who could only flee and not fight back.

For Chen Xu, *Outlast* was actually a game to integrate the team and allow him to more deeply test the Game Engine.

As for action and shooting aspects, they could be reflected in the game's monsters, while the Protagonist controlled by the player would perform basic actions such as running and climbing.

One could say that in all aspects, *Outlast* was a game that largely met Chen Xu's Psychological Expectations.

The only concern was the Censorship aspect.

After all, unlike Eastern Horror Games such as *Silent Hill* and *Fatal Frame*, *Outlast* was purely Western Horror, meaning the game was quite bloody.

Although the Parallel World's Review System was very comprehensive, whether it could pass the review still depended on the Game Department's decision.
