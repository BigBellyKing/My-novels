Chapter 233: We Have a Traitor in Our Midst! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Following Chen Xu's official Weibo post, the entire gaming industry was instantly reignited.

Countless players and designers were shocked.

Although it was just Chen Xu's official Weibo post, and not an official announcement from Nebula Games.

But everyone knew that the message Chen Xu posted on his official Weibo was equivalent to an official announcement from Nebula Games, wasn't it?

Without any surprise, less than a minute after Chen Xu's official Weibo post was released.

Nebula Games' official Weibo directly reposted Chen Xu's official Weibo.

This instantly made countless players and designers unable to remain calm.

At the same time, most of the various chaotic rumors online also instantly disappeared.

On one hand, Nebula Games' Legal Department had started to act, collecting evidence, directly calling the police, and then filing lawsuits. Lawyer's letter warning?

That didn't exist. Either they didn't receive it, but if they did, it would definitely be a court summons.

Although it was impossible to target everyone, killing a few "chickens to scare the monkeys," taking down a few prominent agitators was enough to serve as a deterrent.

And compared to small organizations, it was easier to collect relevant evidence against these prominent agitators.

On the other hand, there was really nothing left to say, as Chen Xu had already spoken directly to the entire gaming industry, including players.

Although legally, even if Nebula Games or Chen Xu backed down, it wouldn't be illegal.

But within the entire gaming industry, Nebula Games' reputation would immediately be ruined.

If it was simply to seize market share, Nebula Games wouldn't need to fight so hard.

It was obvious, Nebula Games was really going all out.

No, that's not right. It shouldn't be called "going all out."

Because Nebula Games was doing perfectly fine, and channels were just a new business for them.

What was truly fatal were those traditional channel providers without R&D capabilities.

Countless channel providers were dumbfounded. Many channel providers originally believed Nebula Games was temporarily trying to enter this competitive track with a price war strategy.

But who would have thought that Nebula Games had directly demolished this track!

And for countless ordinary game designers, it was as lively as a festival.

Clearly, the emergence of the Nebula Games Platform gave them a brand new choice, and also acted as a channel price killer.

As for the major channel providers, at this moment, they could only stare blankly.

Because there was truly nothing they could do.

Restrict Nebula Games?

Restrict with their heads?

Could they really run to players' homes, tie up players' hands and feet, and prevent them from spending on the Nebula Games Platform?

Now they could only pray that the games launched on the Nebula Games Platform would all have poor sales, and ideally, completely flop.

And consequently, directly damage the reputation of the Nebula Games Platform.

However, this was completely impossible.

Because there were clear regulations in the sales terms of the Nebula Games Platform.

Games launched on the Nebula Games Platform must first pass the Game Department's review and obtain the necessary qualifications.

Secondly, all games must adhere to a refund policy.

Unconditional refunds within two weeks and if playtime hadn't reached two hours. This ensured that players could still get refunds even if they encountered bad games.

On the second day after Chen Xu's official Weibo post was released, Nebula Games' official channels also announced new information.

Firstly, news that new works from independent game designers and studios would debut on the Nebula Games Platform at that time.

Chen Xu had already communicated this with Zhang Yida previously.

(He) had been preparing for the promotion of the Nebula Games Platform.

Besides this, the most bewildering news for some major channel providers was that several small domestic channel providers had actually directly joined Nebula Games' camp and reached a cooperation agreement with them, transferring some high-quality games from their own channels to Nebula Games to serve as inventory.

And they announced that they would establish a strategic partnership, jointly sharing channel networks.

With this news breaking, the major channel providers, who were already bewildered, became even more so.

They hadn't even exerted their strength yet, and Nebula Games had already started to undermine their roots?

Rural areas surrounding cities!?

Nebula Games was smashing the rice bowls of channel providers; how could you go and side with Nebula Games?

We have a traitor in our midst!

But in reality, these channel providers cooperating with Nebula Games were mainly focused on independent games and specific categories of games, such as text-adventure games, simulation games, and so on.

The market share for these games was not large, but they had a very stable player base.

Major channels didn't pay attention to them, but for some small channel providers, this segment could still provide them with a living.

As for why these small channel providers were willing to join Nebula Games' camp?

Because clinging to a strong patron meant earning more!

For small channel providers, industry unspoken rules?

They couldn't get the meat or the soup from that.

Many small channel providers, in fact, already had a 3:7 revenue split (30% for them, 70% for developer) or even lower.

Why?

Because they were small channel providers themselves; without offering benefits or specializing in a certain field, which developer would be willing to put their game on their channel?

Just like the classic strategy of "rural areas surrounding cities" in his previous life, these small channel providers were also worth winning over.

At the same time, for these small channel providers, cooperating with Nebula Games could be said to be a complete win-win.

Nebula Games needed some decent quality games to fill its game library.

Likewise, for these small channel providers, Nebula Games' vast user base – even if only one percent of players bought the games they launched on the platform – that would still be a huge profit!

As for whether they could retain designers on their own platform later?

These small channel providers weren't afraid of that.

Because Nebula Games, as a large open platform, would certainly face a situation.

That is, it would be impossible to comprehensively cater to the works of all designers. This was inevitable.

Especially as more and more games are released in the future; after all, effective recommendation slots are limited.

And they, as small channel providers, being able to survive well, naturally had some situational awareness.

Not greedy, not impulsive, cultivating their own small patch of land well.

As for truly being unable to resist, then they had no other option. After all, compared to major channels, their biggest advantage originally was low commission and specialization.

But now that Nebula Games had entered the arena, and its commission was so low, wasn't the only thing they could offer more targeted promotion for designers in these niche categories?

So, since they couldn't figure out a way to resist, they might as well enjoy it. If things really didn't work out, they could always sit down and talk slowly with Nebula Games.

"You name an honest price and buy me out," "then we'll be one family, no longer speaking as two."

……………………

A series of strategic plans had already begun preparations since before the New Year, when "Minecraft" was being developed.

Firstly, a total of 116 games were launched on the Nebula Games Platform in the first batch.

Among them, 16 were new games, and the rest were older games from channel providers who had joined Nebula Games' camp.

As the first batch of games, these games obviously hit the jackpot.

After all, Nebula Games' platform users were already there, but this could also be considered the first wave of benefits for those who embraced Nebula Games.

Currently, only independent games were holding the fort, while second and third-tier game developers were mostly still taking a wait-and-see approach. Unlike ordinary independent game designers, they had some bargaining power with channels, and with Nebula Games' aggressive entry, major channels would clearly make significant concessions.

For these game developers, it was natural to shop around to see what kind of terms they could get.

And with the launch of these games, many players were constantly paying attention.

“The number of games is quite decent!”

“But they’re all old games!?”

“No choice, the platform just launched after all. And as you say it, do other platforms have new games every day?”

“That’s true.”

“And old games are old games, but the discounts are pretty high!”

“Huh, there are so many ACG games? I haven't even seen them before!”

“Some of these games actually look quite good!”

“These games, seem a little different from what I've played before. There are also achievement trophies and card collection? That's interesting!”

“The game community is also quite rich, with plenty of guides and reviews. Some even support the Workshop!”

Many players on the Nebula Games Platform initially just looked at these new games out of curiosity.

But after checking them out one by one, many players discovered that quite a few of these games actually seemed pretty interesting.

Moreover, these games weren't just simply launched on the Nebula Games Platform. They all underwent platform adaptation.

For example, the achievement and trophy systems, and relevant game communities were also very well-developed.

Some even supported the Workshop. After some designers learned that their old games would be launched on the Nebula Games Platform, they specifically went back to update and polish them.

Some even went as far as to invest heavily directly in a visual remake of their games, in order to sell them better, striving to achieve better visual effects.

After all, when the original old games were on those small channels, even with a remake, not many people cared besides fan players.

But now it was different. This was an opportunity!

And a very rare opportunity at that. Not to mention anything else, just this wave of "Minecraft" made the potential of the Nebula Games Platform undeniable.

At this point, it didn't matter if they were old games. The goal was to make them the best they could be.
