Chapter 848: Mr. Chen, You're Too Professional

In the office, due to this news, Chen Xu, Yang Xin, and Ruan Ningxue had an intense brainstorming session.

Of course, most of the time, Chen Xu was talking and they were listening.

"Generally speaking, situations like robbers taking hostages, as seen in movies, rarely occur. This is because, for robbers, hostages are actually a burden. For bank robbers, all they want is money, not to risk their lives."

"Moreover, after taking hostages, their crimes could multiply significantly. What might have originally been a 20-year sentence, with good behavior and some special policies, could turn into eight or nine years before release. But taking hostages would genuinely mean a lifetime behind bars."

"In addition, most banks also use timed locks. In my opinion, this is irresponsible towards the lives of employees, because these timed locks are usually only known by the bank's branch or regional manager, and opening the vault door isn't instantaneous."

"But this isn't a good method. Because when bank employees tell the robbers they can't open the vault door immediately and need five or six minutes, it makes the robbers extremely panicked. They'll think the employees are lying and just trying to delay."

"After all, most robbers, when they first rob a bank, might not have much experience. They don't realize these people are actually helpless, so their panic and desire to establish dominance will lead them to harm these ordinary employees."

"So, to truly succeed in a robbery, one needs a stable source of information and a thorough understanding of the bank. It's usually easiest to strike when money is being moved into the vault. It's clear that the robbers in this news incident must include a seasoned veteran. It's just unknown whether their professional knowledge has been updated after spending so much time in prison."

At first, Yang Xin and the others were quite curious, but as they listened, something felt off.

This sounded so professional!?

"Mr. Chen, robbing banks... that's not allowed!" Unable to hold back, Ruan Ningxue blurted out what was on her mind.

"What are you thinking? I'm a law-abiding citizen!" Chen Xu looked speechless.

What were they thinking? Was he tired of living? Besides, taking a 10,000 Yuan cash brick as an example, a hundred 10,000 Yuan bricks weigh about 27-36 kilograms. Considering efficiency and physical strength, in a successful robbery, a single robber might carry 2-3 backpacks. Even if completely filled with 300 10,000 Yuan cash bricks, they could only get 3 million. Wouldn't it be better to make a new DOTA treasure chest or directly do a crossover with Ranni for a set?

"The main reason I'm telling you all this is to help you understand more, and also to prepare for the upcoming new project – a game for players to relax their nerves a bit after suffering in Elden Ring, and have some shooting fun."

As soon as Chen Xu said this, everyone was immediately delighted.

"We can make FPS games again?"

"What kind? Like Rainbow Six?"

"But I feel like the style should be a bit more absurd, after all, even if you can have shooting fun in Rainbow Six, it's not satisfying enough!"

"Counter-Strike vs. fierce robbers, while tracking clues left by the criminals at the crime scene. Is this a combination of shooting and criminal investigation? That's great!"

"Mr. Chen, how many criminal investigation elements will there be? Will it be like Sherlock Holmes, searching for minute clues to uncover the truth?"

Everyone seemed particularly excited, discussing the direction of the new game incessantly.

Seeing everyone's enthusiasm so high, Chen Xu also showed a satisfied smile.

"There won't be too many criminal investigation elements, but depending on the difficulty, players will need to infiltrate to scout the terrain, gather information, and then formulate a reasonable plan."

"In addition, players will also need to rationally match their team composition and tools to increase their rewards."

Listening to Chen Xu's words, everyone's smiles gradually froze.

This sounded... a bit different from what they had imagined?

"Mr. Chen... so, what will the players be role-playing in the game?" Qin Yi guessed.

"Exactly, players will be role-playing the cute and charming villainous characters—the robbers!" Chen Xu nodded.

Ah, this...

Everyone looked bewildered.

So, players were going to be playing as robbers!

No wonder Mr. Chen talked so much about the professional knowledge of robbers; he wanted them to align with the profession!

"Furthermore, this game will be a completely opposite mode to Rainbow Six. It will be a PVE-focused mode, so it has a hardcore side, but more importantly, it's about one thing: satisfaction." Chen Xu revealed some brief information.

Listening to Chen Xu's words, everyone present was a little excited.

Although it was a bit different from their initial thoughts, it wasn't too outrageous.

It's just playing as robbers, that's nothing. After all, wasn't that what players did in Red Dead Redemption, playing as Arthur Morgan?

In a way, the player's role as Arthur Morgan was regrettable, but it's undeniable that Arthur Morgan was indeed a bad person, committing murder, arson, and all sorts of other deeds.

Moreover, this new game, according to Chen Xu, is not like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare; it focuses more on grinding elements for PVE, with the main feedback points being numerical design and level design, rather than the story plot.

"As for the name of this game, let's call it Payday," Chen Xu said.

"Payday? That name is quite fitting. A showdown between cunning as a fox criminals and corrupt detectives." Yang Xin thought, recalling some of the game background Chen Xu had just mentioned.

Although players would be playing as robbers in the game, this was just an identity. Obviously, no one likes gratuitous evil, so even though players are robbers and appear to be villains, the game will incorporate elements of Robin Hood-like rogue heroes. At the very least, the official organizations in the game won't be good either; they will be depicted as corrupt.

Listening to Yang Xin's words, Chen Xu smiled without speaking. Cunning as a fox criminals and corrupt detectives? No, it's magical robbers and clone detectives.

"Mr. Chen, is our main work now focused on this game?" Meng Zuo asked Chen Xu.

After all, he had previously been assigned a task to negotiate for IPs from other developers.

"Not yet. This game is quite special and requires some preliminary preparatory work, inviting some frontline personnel to be our consultants," Chen Xu shook his head and said.

"Frontline personnel?" Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue were taken aback.

"Mr. Chen... isn't that a bit inappropriate?" Yang Xin said tactfully.

"Yes, inviting these former professional players might lead to some public opinion later," Qin Yi nodded.

"Exactly, there'll be talk no matter what," Ruan Ningxue agreed.

Listening to their words, Chen Xu immediately understood what they meant and looked speechless: "What are you thinking? Even though players role-play as robbers in the game, it's just a game, we're not making a robbery instruction manual! We're making a game! And 'frontline personnel,' did I say robbers? I meant professional detectives. And summarizing past solved robberies—all of these can be used as game material."

Former professional players, indeed! What were they even thinking?!
