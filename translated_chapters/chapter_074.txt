Chapter 74: Workshop Update and Multiplayer Games

Over the course of a week, Chen Xu had several contacts with NetDragon and TengHua Games.

Essentially, it was one word: stalling.

The other party expressed an interest in acquiring Nebula Games.

He met with their representative to discuss the acquisition.

Judging from their offer and various conditions,

Chen Xu pretty much had an idea.

They were interested, but not overly serious.

After a few discussions, the other party didn't contact Chen Xu again, clearly having dropped the idea.

Thus, the acquisition matter temporarily came to an end.

Meanwhile, a new version of Overcooked was officially launched.

This update came exactly two and a half weeks after the game's initial launch.

The main update content was the opening of the Workshop.

Of course, there were also several new official game maps, themes, and dish combinations.

With the launch of the new Overcooked version, players quickly discovered an update package for the game.

They all rushed to update and download it.

“Huh? Overcooked actually got an update?!”

“It's free? New maps and levels, and this 'Workshop' thing, isn't this usually DLC? So generous!”

“Checked the update description, players can apparently create their own levels!”

“Holy cow, that's awesome! Let me check it out!”

Many players updated immediately.

At the same time, discussions erupted in the relevant Overcooked player communities.

After all, this update was a bit unexpected for everyone.

Generally, this kind of content update belongs to DLC, meaning it's paid.

But this time, all of Overcooked's updates were free.

Furthermore, Overcooked had only been launched for a little over half a month.

Compared to the previous period, although the various 'Breakup Kitchen' and 'Friendship Over Kitchen' memes had seen a slight dip in popularity, the game was still quite hot.

There were still many new players flocking in, which could be seen from the sales volume and online numbers.

This game still had a relatively long lifespan, and updating the version now clearly surprised many players.

After the version update, some players interested in level design began trying out Overcooked's Workshop.

During the game's design, Chen Xu specifically considered the aspect of players creating their own levels later on.

Therefore, the entire creation mode was very simple and easy to understand.

In fact, Chen Xu could have fully integrated these functions into the game itself.

Just like a game called Super Mario Maker in his previous life.

From a technical standpoint, this was not an issue.

But in the end, Chen Xu didn't choose that path.

The main goal was that Chen Xu hoped to use this to build a community for Nebula Games.

How could player stickiness be maintained outside the game?

A stable gaming community could be said to be quite important.

And after the new version of Overcooked was updated, players continuously joined the community.

During this time, quite a few players had already released some self-made levels.

However, they were still relatively crude, basically just involving some simple terrain changes.

Moreover, there wasn't anything particularly outstanding, clearly lacking highlights.

Chen Xu wasn't too worried about this, because as long as enough people created, excellent maps would eventually emerge.

In fact, the Workshop feature quickly indeed stirred up a wave among players.

And the ways players 'broke up' became more diverse.

For example, by personally creating a hellishly difficult map for another person to experience.

In Nebula Games' Workshop community, countless players were discussing this update.

‘Awesome! This update!’

‘Yeah! It feels like there's more content to experience after this update!’

‘I don't know if you've noticed, but some creators have even made levels that can be played smoothly solo!’

‘That's right, it's great! I can finally cook by myself!’

‘Overcooked, playing alone? My heart goes out to you, buddy!’

‘To be honest, before playing alone, I actually had a partner!’

Following Overcooked's Workshop update, Chen Xu checked the online player reviews.

They were uniformly positive reviews.

However, aside from players, it didn't cause much of a stir.

After all, it was just a version update.

But Chen Xu knew very well that the Workshop's design could completely extend Overcooked's lifespan for quite a while longer.

As for how long that would be, it depended on the market and the players; that was beyond his control.

In the period that followed, there wasn't much going on, the main focus was the company's expansion.

The entire upper floor had been negotiated with the relevant owners.

It had all been rented, and all that remained was the renovation.

On the personnel side, quite a few resumes had been received.

Chen Xu was also almost ready to start considering the next phase.

Users and profits, these were the two directions Chen Xu would consider next.

However, the main focus was still on users.

Overcooked had started things off well.

Currently, Nebula Games' platform had approximately 500,000 daily active users.

All of them were brought in by Overcooked.

Thanks to the opening of the Workshop, at least in the short term, these users wouldn't be lost for too long.

But if Nebula Games didn't do anything, they would inevitably be lost.

“Multiplayer games, but not suitable for multiplayer games with long development cycles. Also, work on real AAA titles almost has to begin; we can't have zero experience.”

Sitting in front of his computer, Chen Xu already had a sound plan for Nebula Games' future development.

In the short term, he planned to develop multiplayer games with relatively short development cycles to promote rapid platform growth and user acquisition.

Secondly, the entire team also needed to start accumulating experience for true AAA blockbusters.

After all, if he wanted to develop the platform, he would at least need a presentable AAA game as a cornerstone title.

Winning first prize in the Game Design Competition last year and subsequently releasing Outlast and Overcooked had greatly enhanced Chen Xu's resume.

In terms of the official game designer rating, although there was no formal notification letter, the backend resources had increased by half compared to before.

Developing large-scale VR games would strain resources and funds.

However, for PC, funds and resources were actually not bad, and risks were entirely within an acceptable range.

The main issue at this stage was the team's technical capabilities, which had been a consideration for the previous Outlast.

Including this round of new employee recruitment, the personnel requirements were much stricter than before.

Basically, all applicants needed to have over four years of industry-related experience.

The goal was to enable them to meet qualified requirements under his guidance, using the official game engine.

And just as Chen Xu was contemplating Nebula Games' development path,

there was a knock on his office door.
