## Chapter 451: Nothing Is True, Everything Is Permitted (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

As Chen Xu and Nebula Games released their second promotional video, players whose hearts had been itching from the Animus were instantly captivated.

This even included some players from FOW's side.

Seeing the recently built hype immediately doused with cold water, Zeus was so furious his head felt like it was on fire.

It was intentional! This was definitely intentional!

Otherwise, how could such a coincidence happen?

Why release it now, of all times, and not earlier or later! ?

Chen Xu was completely unaware of Zeus's extreme anger.

However, if Chen Xu had known, he would certainly have said: You guessed it! This time it really wasn't a coincidence, it was absolutely intentional.

When you have an obvious competitor and an opportunity to mess with them, of course you take it!

Ordinary players were completely oblivious to all this; they were entirely drawn in by Nebula Games' new *Assassin's Creed* promotional video.

………………

The video begins.

Amidst flowers and cheers, and the support of countless guards, a corpulent Pope, seated in a magnificent carriage, held a scepter in one hand and smiled as he waved to the crowd.

At the same time, in a dark corner of the square, an assassin wearing a white hood and a red-and-white assassin's robe watched the distant Pope.

With his head down, he slowly advanced towards the Pope's procession.

The surrounding cheering crowds, upon seeing the white-robed assassin, revealed looks of astonishment and quickly made way.

Guards on the rafters, armed with muskets, also noticed the uninvited guest emerging from the shadows in an instant.

He slowly raised his musket, aiming it at the assassin who was still advancing towards the Pope.

The assassin in the square seemed utterly oblivious, continuing his unhurried and composed advance towards the Pope's motorcade.

The next moment, the camera switched to the musket-wielding guard on the rooftop. Under the sunlight, two shadows overlapped.

A 'thwack' of a blade piercing flesh sounded, blood flowed, and the guard's corpse fell.

Then the camera returned to the square. The white-hooded assassin had approached the outer perimeter of the pilgrims.

Seeing the assassin, the surrounding knights also noticed him, drawing their longswords and moving to intercept.

Without even a glance at the two guards beside him, the white-robed assassin's movements and steps remained unchanged, slowly proceeding towards the center of the square.

An eagle cried, a whooshing sound broke the air, and 'thwack'—two arrows shot through the guards' throats, trailing splatters of blood.

Passing by in a flash, the two guards fell to the ground.

The surrounding pilgrims cried out in alarm, scattering and clearing a path for the white-robed assassin.

Meanwhile, the remaining knights charged towards the white-robed assassin.

Facing the approaching knights, the assassin flicked his wrists lightly; a crisp metallic clang, and Hidden Blades sprang from his wrists, plunging directly into the throats of the two knights in front of him.

In an instant, a double kill.

Then the white-robed assassin raised his head, continuing forward with an expressionless face.

Knights drawing swords to meet him.

Fallen corpses.

Panicked crowds.

And the composed assassin.

Innumerable knights surrounded the white-robed assassin. The Red-robed Commander in the carriage dismounted, a contemptuous smile on his face as he saw the assassin.

'Ezio Auditore.'

'To stand against us alone, your courage is commendable.'

'It's just a pity, you have courage but no strategy.'

The Red-robed Commander stared directly at the white-robed assassin, known as Ezio.

Ezio offered no response to his words.

He merely raised his hand and gently caught something in the air, then opened his left palm.

In the palm of the assassin known as Ezio lay an eagle feather.

An eagle flew over Ezio's head, letting out a cry.

He looked up, his hood obscuring his face, but a smile played on Ezio's lips, and he nodded gently.

The next moment, countless arrows cut through the sky, piercing the throats of the knights surrounding Ezio.

Lightly pushing aside the still-standing knight's corpse, Ezio grabbed a longsword and easily killed two cavalrymen charging towards him.

'Papal Guard!'

Following a shout, countless soldiers clad in armor and wielding long spears rushed out from the Papal Cathedral.

At the same time, four other assassins, also wearing white hoods and wielding different weapons, slowly emerged from the crowd and stood behind Ezio.

Then the screen went dark, and the next scene showed the top floor of a clock tower.

White hood, white-and-red assassin's robe, and Hidden Blades.

On the top floor of the clock tower, an assassin gazed at a distant execution platform.

The bells chimed, and as the copper bell swung, it obscured the assassin's figure. But in the next second, when the bell swung back, the white-robed assassin had already vanished.

'Dong!' accompanied by the bell chime.

The camera moved to the square. The white-robed assassin moved through the crowd.

'Dong!' 'Dong!' 'Dong!' With each bell chime, as if perfectly timed to the beat.

The assassin's movements grew faster and faster, swiftly passing through the crowd and arriving beneath the execution platform. Then, he leaped up, like a fledgling eagle spreading its wings, his Hidden Blade cleanly plunging into the throat of the Templar Knight on the execution platform.

The sudden assassination plunged the crowd into chaos.

Enemies from afar quickly rushed over. After killing his target, the assassin looked at the corpse on the ground, murmured softly, and then used his hand to close the man's eyes.

He then turned gracefully, scaled the rooftop, and parkoured away from the scene.

The camera switched once again, showing countless Templar Knights wielding spears charging towards a white-robed assassin.

But they were no match; countless Templar Knights fell under the assassin's assault, becoming cold corpses.

Another battle scene appeared.

This time, the white-robed assassin's opponent was no longer a Templar Knight, but an assassin like himself.

Only the opponent's assassin's robe had changed from white to black.

The two fought fiercely in a courtyard.

Agile footwork intertwined, and Hidden Blades clashed.

Suddenly, countless phantoms appeared around the white-robed assassin.

There were assassins, ordinary old men, and even Templar Knights.

Innumerable ethereal shadows swirled around the assassin, like a carousel.

Finally, all the clamoring sounds dissolved into a narration:

'When other men blindly follow truth, remember...'

'Nothing is true.'

The surrounding phantoms slowly dissipated.

'When other men are limited by morality or law, remember...'

'Everything is permitted.'

Ultimately, the Hidden Blade pierced the body of the black-robed assassin.

Looking at the body on the ground, the white-robed assassin knelt, gently caressing the opponent's eyes to close them.

Then the assassin slowly walked into the interior of the palace, disappearing into the darkness.

'We work in the dark... to serve the light.'

'We are... Assassins.'

As the assassin completely vanished into the darkness, a blinding light burst forth.

*Assassin's Creed*

The game's title and its LOGO appeared in the center of the video.
