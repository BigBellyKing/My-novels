# Chapter 252: Players' Strong Demands (Six Updates, Requesting Subscriptions)

Looking at the prompt in front of him, Zhang Yi then saw the game automatically exit and return to the starting UI interface.

Zhang Yi was completely bewildered.

He was just getting into it, and it's already over?

Even if it's a demo version, this is too short!

Zhang Yi was utterly speechless; it was an outrageous cliffhanger!

The plot itself was still acceptable.

To be honest, so far, Zhang Yi hadn't paid too much attention to the plot of *Monster Hunter: World*.

He only knew a few things: Elder Dragons were migrating, the Hunter's Guild came to investigate the secrets behind it, and with one Fleet arriving every ten years, the protagonist's arrival marked 50 years. The Research Team Leader was also the Commander-in-Chief's grandson, who remained in the New World.

As for anything else?

He didn't know anything.

But the key point was that the first half of this demo content primarily focused on teaching players about the game's content and systems.

For example, combat, gathering materials, hunting methods, and weapon introductions.

After players understood these, they basically wanted to hunt themselves.

And indeed, the game did just that.

Small Jagras, Crown-crested Dragon, Great Jagras – three consecutive different battles, including a BOSS battle.

It could be said that this demo experience was actually very complete.

But the crucial issue was that it was too fun!

Especially in terms of combat, the game's difficulty wasn't high, allowing every player to easily get the hang of it.

At the same time, because they had just started playing the game, many players weren't yet fully familiar with weapon skills and combos.

After experiencing the Great Jagras BOSS battle, many players felt they had gained a deeper understanding of their chosen weapon.

They urgently wanted to challenge new monsters and test their abilities.

But now!؟

The key part is gone!؟

Before long, the voices of Song Ren, Wang Han, and others also appeared in the voice channel.

"What the heck, it's over already? I haven't had enough fun yet! I've only used the Long Sword Helm Breaker a few times!" Song Ren said in frustration in the voice channel.

"Yeah! It's too short, I haven't even figured out my Hammer yet!" Wang Han also said, feeling equally frustrated.

"Yeah, yeah!" Wang Yifan and Joey echoed.

All of them shared the same feeling: they hadn't had enough fun before it suddenly ended.

...

While Zhang Yi and his friends were discussing, the related community forums for *Monster Hunter: World* were already overwhelmed by agitated players.

There was no other way; it was just too unbearable.

It was cut off right at the most exciting part of the game.

Who could possibly endure that!

Innumerable people @-mentioned Chen Xu's official Weibo account and Nebula Games' community everywhere, all expressing the same sentiment.

They hoped that *Monster Hunter: World* could be launched early. After all, judging from the demo trial version, the content already seemed quite complete.

Moreover, if it wasn't finished, for a game of such a large scale, from the demo to the official launch, there's only a week. Could there really be any transformative changes in such a short time?

So the answer was simple: *Monster Hunter: World* had already been completed long ago.

However, while players' petitions were numerous, many players also clearly understood that the launch date would definitely not change.

They were simply venting.

Thus, the surge of excitement over the demo being cut short came quickly and left quickly.

However, the quality of the *Monster Hunter: World* demo became a hot topic among many players.

Throughout the game's hunting process, many players expressed that it was very interesting and provided a strong sense of real immersion.

For example, after being injured, the Great Jagras wouldn't foolishly continue to fight the player.

Instead, it would try to escape.

If it managed to get away by accident, and the player hadn't gathered enough information beforehand, they would need to continue investigating the clues it left behind to successfully track it.

At the same time, there were many interactive natural traps in the game.

For instance, in the Jagras's Den during the first hunt, there were many Flashflies, resembling fireflies.

If these Flashflies were triggered, any surrounding monsters that looked directly at them would enter a dizzy state.

There were also numerous plants throughout the game.

For example, vines could entangle monsters, allowing players to freely deal damage for a few seconds.

In *Monster Hunter: World*, every creature possessed unique characteristics.

Just like the game's subtitle, 'World,' implies.

It gave players a very strong sense of realism.

As if in a certain universe of a Parallel World, such a truly existing world genuinely existed.

After a monster was killed, its corpse wouldn't immediately disappear but would remain in place.

There was also a creature called the Hatebird that would come to feed on these corpses.

Of course, players could also capture them.

The New World was covered with various collectible plants and excavatable ores.

The novel worldview, peculiar creatures, and rich combat system made many players feel particularly refreshed.

The only thing that players were dissatisfied with was the difficulty.

Every quest provided an extra-long time limit of 50 minutes and 3 opportunities for carting due to exhaustion.

But when playing, it felt completely unnecessary.

As for time, the Great Jagras could generally be dealt with within 30 minutes.

As for carting?

Many players felt it was almost impossible.

With Palicos drawing aggro, carrying so many Potions, and the game environment itself providing unique supplies (like collecting honey to make Mega Potions, honey fruits on vines, and Palicos even summoning honey bugs to deliver honey fruits),

It felt like it would be very difficult to actually die.

Many players felt like, "I haven't even gotten serious, and it's already over."

Because of this, many players also offered various suggestions on Chen Xu's official Weibo account.

"Strongly suggest that Mr. Chen enhance the difficulty in *Monster Hunter: World* later."

"Exactly! The current difficulty is too easy!"

"Mr. Chen, don't underestimate us! Having been tempered by *Dark Souls*, we're absolutely superb!"

"That's right!"

Some casual players also agreed, to some extent.

Because even they felt that the game's difficulty indeed seemed a bit too low.

Facing these suggestions from players, Chen Xu didn't remain silent as he had when players previously petitioned for the game to launch faster.

Instead, he gave a very clear answer.

"Everyone, please rest assured. The difficulty balance in *Monster Hunter: World* has been strictly controlled by me and the development team. The difficulty will adopt a progressive approach, and as the game content continuously advances, players will unlock new difficulties. We will be applying Nebula Games' latest AI technology to Tempered monsters, which are 'beings that have endured countless battles.' So, whether you are an ordinary player or one seeking hardcore challenges, I believe you will all find satisfaction in the New World."

Following Chen Xu's official Weibo post, many players were very satisfied.

However, Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, and others within Nebula Games looked at Chen Xu with a tiny bit of change in their gaze.

Indeed, there wasn't a single lie in that statement.

But these Tempered monsters and the so-called progressive approach probably had a slight deviation from what you players imagined.

Watching the joyful players online, Qin Yi and the others couldn't help but sigh with emotion.
