Chapter 915: Rich and Diverse Modes

As players experienced and communicated, they quickly discovered that even in the same mode, and even within the same Nebula World, the content experienced each time was completely different.

Taking Red Dead Redemption as an example, there are many possibilities and rich scenarios in the game.

For instance, there's the possibility of an insider. Sometimes, it's not just one's own side that has an insider; both sides might have them. One player on the outlaw side might be in a gang, while another acts as an insider who has infiltrated the police department or the Pinkerton Agents.

Similarly, the police department and Pinkerton Agents might also have an insider within the police department who has infiltrated the outlaw gang.

And due to the nature of the game mode, players cannot communicate via text or external voice channels. The game itself will have detection programs to prevent such 'cheating' and illicit coordination.

So, if an insider in the game learns about an operation targeting the other side, they must relay the message before the operation, indicating an 'inside man' to cancel the deal!

For players who haven't played these games, Nebula World allows them to experience some of the charm these games offer, which in turn might encourage them to try the original content.

As for players who are already fans of these games, it's a complete carnival.

Meanwhile, the Survival Mode, when facing different Nebula Worlds, showcases entirely different gameplay and approaches.

For example, in a horror game like Silent Hill, several players would cooperate to clear levels, encountering various monster attacks along the way. These players must escape from the monsters, but sometimes, players within the group might not always be benevolent.

It can be said that this mode is full of intrigue and rivalry for players, but not entirely so.

In the Survival Mode of Resident Evil Village, for instance, players need to stealthily collect various resources on four themed maps within a limited time. Then, they gather together to defend their position with firearms and ammunition until Chris arrives for rescue.

Of course, if players want to charge in directly, it's not impossible, but they'll face a hellish difficulty scenario with BOSSes and mobs swarming in. Consequences are at their own risk.

Cooperation and confrontation, as Survival Mode, can provide players with many different experiences.

In the other Trial Mode, what players need to do is much simpler. There's no intrigue; it's purely about collaborating for a common mission.

However, unlike in Survival Mode, where each player can take on different roles from the game itself, in Trial Mode, all players must create entirely new characters and then complete corresponding trials based on different worlds.

Initially, if players entered game worlds like Warcraft, God of War, or Dark Souls, there's a high probability they would either become infected peasants in Lordaeron, unfortunate souls caught in the world's collapse after Kratos killed the Olympian gods, or unconscious Hollows in the Dark Souls world.

For newly entering players, these high-level power system instances are clearly not what they can target in the early stages.

Meanwhile, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Vice City, and Red Dead Redemption, which lack high-level power systems, are clearly the newbie villages for new players.

Starting from these newbie village game instances with no inherent power, players complete main trial quests to earn corresponding reward points, or they can directly learn specific skills or obtain specific items by fulfilling certain conditions in different game instances.

Players can also bring these skills and items out into the Nebula World after completing Trial Mode.

By conquering these worlds with relatively ordinary power levels, players can gradually strengthen their game characters.

Of course, there are still limitations. These newbie village instances are not infinitely developable.

Instead, based on the number of times a player visits, the system will gradually increase the player's hidden weight. There's no such thing as a Shi Li Po Sword God, grinding to max level in the newbie village before setting out.

At the same time, for the so-called trial missions, each world will have a huge mission pool. Like a Roguelike game, each player's experience is unique and unrepeatable.

With experience in different game worlds, the skills players can acquire and cultivate are also completely different.

For example, the Dead Eye skill, if not redeemed with points earned from trials in the Nebula World, can only be learned and acquired in Red Dead Redemption.

Additionally, considering the role of skills and the overall gameplay and numerical balance of the Nebula World, these are not irreplaceable.

For instance, Eagle Vision in Assassin's Creed and Listen Mode in The Last of Us share some similarities, differing only in their specific characteristics.

Similarly, there are local specialties from various game worlds, such as Blades in Xenoblade Chronicles, Materia in Final Fantasy, and blood vials in Bloodborne.

Besides these, there will also be some specific items that players cannot obtain in the Nebula World. They must complete a series of extremely difficult missions in designated game worlds to finally acquire them.

These items and skills may not be the strongest, but they will certainly be the most unique and representative, such as the Monado from Xenoblade Chronicles, the Buster Sword from Final Fantasy, and Frostmourne from Warcraft.

The Nebula World is a place that integrates countless vast game worlds, allowing players to embody adventurers traversing different worlds.

It enables players to acquire various special skills and items in these game worlds, and then build their characters into unique existences.

Then, through a matchmaking system, players can confront each other in different game worlds, experiencing the unique charm of this gaming culture.

This is Chen Xu's vision for the core direction of Nebula World's future development.

However, for now, even with much effort from Chen Xu and his team, it is still just a rather special toy.

Many aspects are still immature, and integrating so many worlds is no simple task.

The blending of art styles, compromises in numerical values and gameplay, and the design of various different levels.

For Nebula World, there is clearly a long way to go.

But Chen Xu also believes that with the gradual development of Nebula Games, this concept will not just be an illusion but a tangible future.
