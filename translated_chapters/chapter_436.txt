Chapter 435: So Exciting Right From The Start! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

On May 1st, _Uncharted: A Thief's End_ officially launched.

Many long-awaiting players were eagerly waiting for it to unlock.

This time, unlike before, all players who pre-ordered _Uncharted: A Thief's End_ could directly wait in the VR theme that came with the game, and then enter the game immediately.

It was a beach-themed scene, and although there wasn't much to interact with, the visuals astonished many players.

Because it was simply too outstanding.

“Is _Uncharted: A Thief's End_ a multiplayer game? How can a VR theme still allow online multiplayer entry into the game?” Inside the _Uncharted_ VR theme, Zhang Yi, a loyal fan of Nebula Games, asked curiously.

His conversation partner was his good brother Song Ren; the two brothers were always inseparable when playing games, and even if they weren't in the same voice channel, their spirits were definitely together.

Of course, his wife Wang Han was also with them.

“You're asking me? How would I know? Anyway, these graphics are absolutely amazing!” Song Ren was currently lying on the ground, observing the sand on the beach.

As a gaming expert, Song Ren couldn't help but marvel at _Uncharted: A Thief's End_'s visual presentation. He hadn't even seen the actual game content yet, but just the sand on the beach had already shocked him.

Especially when he discovered that the sand was interactive; he could control his character to scoop some up and watch the grains of sand fall through his fingers. It was simply incredible!

“Yeah! Just looking at the scenery in this game feels worth it!” Wang Han, who was on the boat, also sighed with emotion. While Zhang Yi and Song Ren were playing in the sand, she meticulously observed the boat.

“But can’t this thing be started?” Zhang Yi leaned over and asked after hearing Wang Han’s words.

“Don’t you read the introductions? This boat is the game's entrance, what are you going to start?” Song Ren followed closely, boarding the boat and complaining to Zhang Yi.

“Who seriously reads game introductions?” Zhang Yi stubbornly retorted.

“Poor protagonist Nathan Drake, he probably can’t escape the fate of being sacrificed by Mr. Chen again,” Song Ren lamented.

“Knives and stuff don’t matter anymore, because there won’t be any love left,” Zhang Yi also sighed.

“You two stop bantering, the game has started, but how do we enter?” Wang Han interjected. All three of them were on the game’s entry boat, and they were even in an online multiplayer state, so how were they supposed to enter the game?

Zhang Yi and Song Ren were equally curious.

But they soon understood.

Song Ren, curious, walked to the main driver's seat, and to his surprise, he found that the boat could actually be started! He pressed the interact button and turned the key. Instantly, the boat shot out, though he couldn't control it himself. As it sped away, he heard a series of 'thump-thumps'. Song Ren saw Zhang Yi and Wang Han next to him, falling into the sea in unison. Subconsciously, Song Ren tried to go towards Zhang Yi, but then the game screen went dark.

A line of text appeared before him:

‘I am a man of fortune, and I must seek my fortune – Henry Every, 1694.’

Seeing this, Song Ren understood.

He had entered the game.

As for Zhang Yi and Wang Han's characters falling into the water earlier, it was clear that he had left the VR theme and entered the game. It was like getting disconnected.

“Holy cow, Old Song, I saw you fall into the water!” Zhang Yi’s surprised voice rang out. “Yeah! Over here, both of you fell into the water too!” said Wang Han, who had just connected. The voices in the voice channel confirmed Song Ren’s thoughts.

“Same here, too! This game entry sequence is quite violent!” Song Ren also said. The few of them chatted for a couple of sentences, then all exited the voice channel, preparing to focus on playing the game.

Song Ren unpaused, and the black screen gradually faded. Simultaneously, the sounds of rain, waves, engine, and thunder entered his ears. From the driver's seat in the cabin, Song Ren saw countless large raindrops falling on the front glass panel. The wipers moved back and forth incessantly, but in the face of the torrential rain, his vision remained blurred. The entire game screen constantly jostled; in the stormy sea, the boat swayed precariously.

The thunder in the sky, coupled with the gale and heavy rain, made one's heart race.

Then the camera pulled back, and Song Ren saw Nathan Drake operating the boat on screen. ‘Ah… damn it, this really isn't good.’ He gripped the steering wheel, but Nathan Drake's face was filled with grimness. His hair and clothes were completely soaked by the rain. Behind him, his brother Sam Drake clung tightly to the boat, struggling to maintain his balance.

“These graphics are absolutely mind-blowing!” Looking at the game screen before him, Song Ren exclaimed again. It was truly astonishing.

In VR perspective, Song Ren could clearly see everything around him: the interior decorations of the cabin, and the texture on the steering wheel. Including the surrounding rain and sea waves, it almost made him unable to distinguish whether this was a game or reality.

'Nathan!' As Song Ren marveled, a huge wave crashed over, causing Nathan Drake and Sam Drake to stumble. At the same time, searchlights shone from the waves behind the boat, and countless larger vessels appeared in their wake.

'They're almost upon us!' 'Yes, I know! I know!' 'I said, speed up!' 'Sam, I'm already going full throttle!'

Amidst the gale and torrential rain, Sam and Nathan communicated loudly. Clearly, they were being chased across the vast ocean.

After a brief exchange, Sam pulled out his pistol and ran outside. At this moment, the camera focused on Nathan Drake, and simultaneously, Song Ren's view showed the relevant UI operation interface.

Because it was VR mode, the game defaulted to first-person. Of course, if one truly didn't want to play in first-person, they could switch to third-person. However, Song Ren himself was more accustomed to first-person, as it was more exciting.

Amidst the ferocious waves and gale, the boat was violently tossed by the sea. Although he was operating the boat, Song Ren couldn't discern where he was actually heading. He now understood why people in stories often spoke of losing their way at sea. This was exactly how he felt; one big wave would hit, and the boat would lurch. After a few waves, he completely lost all sense of direction. Anyway, the only thing he was doing now was keeping the accelerator pressed down.

The boat continued forward through the storm, while the enemies behind them had already caught up. Sam was exchanging fire with them. Bullets struck the boat's hull, sparks flying and leaving marks – the details were truly maximized. Song Ren himself was incredibly nervous; was it going to be this thrilling right from the start? Combined with the realistic visuals and the drama of being chased on a stormy sea, it made his heart pound rapidly.
