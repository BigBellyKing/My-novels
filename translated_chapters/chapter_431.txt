Chapter 430: Easter Egg Promotion (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

_Uncharted_ quickly entered an intense development phase.

However, as a VR game, and like the games Chen Xu developed before, some adjustments were needed for the camera. Certain scene presentations could provide players with a better sense of immersion through a first-person perspective, such as during climbing and rope swinging, which would undoubtedly be thrilling and exciting.

Furthermore, the Awakening Mode updated in the new era Huanyu VR gaming pod could significantly alleviate players' negative emotions, better showcasing the thrilling excitement of this action-adventure game to players. Also, during Nathan Drake's escape in the game, facing various explosions and collapsing ruins, these scenes would deliver a stronger sense of shock in first-person than in third-person.

Of course, not all scenes were suitable for first-person. The most exciting car chase in the game was actually not suitable for first-person. Just like the classic train level in _Uncharted 2_, this car chase followed the same level design philosophy: the feedback from changing environments and the thrilling sensation experienced by the player.

Fleeing on foot from the city under pursuit and getting into a car, then speeding through the city streets and alleys, eventually reaching country roads, and finally crossing a large bridge. In third-person, the natural transitions between scenes could give players a stronger visual impact. If a first-person perspective were used, many elements couldn't be shown.

Similar scenes included Nathan Drake, Sully, and Sam's expedition to the Twelve Lighthouses in King's Bay's extinct volcano. The climbing towers and collapsing designs in this section, under immersive mode, were actually more suited to a first-person camera design. Moreover, the first-person perspective on a VR platform felt different from that on a PC platform. The simplest difference was a wider field of view.

In the previous life, during this particular story segment, the fall from the tower primarily utilized a close-range shaking experience, combined with a third-person over-the-shoulder perspective to create spatial contrast, thereby enhancing player immersion. However, with the immersive experience of VR, a natural conversion could be achieved.

At the same time, compared to the previous life, _Uncharted 4: A Thief's End_ needed many more detailed elements. This was because the Huanyu VR gaming pod provided more comprehensive force feedback, not limited to just the controller. Also, in VR mode, players' sense of immersion would be stronger, meaning players would pay more attention to minute details.

For example, when players controlled Drake to climb, the close-up interaction between his body and the wall in front of him. In addition, there were various other detailed feedback elements: the force feedback from falling heavily to the ground, and the feedback when facing explosions and gunshots. These were all things that needed to be added to the game to make it more realistic, allowing players to immerse themselves more deeply in Nathan Drake's adventure during gameplay.

………………

While _Uncharted_ was in development, news about new games from other developers was constantly being released. Among them, the most anticipated were the new titles from gaming giants NetDragon and Atari.

Atari's _Elemental World_ also unveiled some new content for the first time. For instance, the game featured various ruins that players needed to solve puzzles in, find four elemental swords, and finally connect the entire world. From Atari's current description, it was clearly an open-world game with a focus on puzzle-solving elements.

As for NetDragon, their promotional efforts were non-stop. Like its predecessor, players would take on the role of Shadow Team, combating criminals. However, there was one difference from before: this time, NetDragon had moved the setting to a fictional island.

NetDragon revealed quite a bit of in-game footage, and from these actual gameplay videos, it was clear that the new game's visuals had made significant progress compared to the previous title. This attracted many graphics enthusiast players.

“The graphics feel a bit outstanding!”

“Yeah, it feels a lot prettier than the previous game, ‘The Wilderness.’ It must be especially shocking in VR mode!”

“And Atari's new game, I actually think it looks good too.”

“But don't you guys think this feels a bit like the shrines in _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_?”

“The shrine system isn't exclusive to Breath of the Wild. I'm actually quite optimistic about it.”

“Speaking of which, all these game developers are making a big fuss, but why is there no news from Nebula Games?”

“Yeah! Where's Chen Xu? Does Nebula Games not have any projects?”

On major game media forums, various pieces of information related to NetDragon and Atari were constantly being disclosed, sparking enthusiastic discussions among players.

However, many players soon became quite curious. After all, news about projects from NetDragon, Atari, and other game developers was circulating widely, but Nebula Games seemed to have no major news coming out. Although some media outlets reported online, it was mostly about third-party games launching on the Switch platform, which for most players, wasn't substantial enough.

They were more eager to see what new projects Nebula Games would bring them this year.

But just as players expressed their curiosity,

A post suddenly began circulating online.

“First on the Entire Internet! Shocking! The Content of Nebula Games' New Title is Actually Hidden in…”

“What's the deal with Nebula Games' new title? I believe everyone is familiar with VR themes, but what exactly is Nebula Games' new game? Let the OP take you through it below.”

Clicking inside, the opening was a strong, attention-grabbing sentence, clearly an old marketing trick. However, the content really did contain some genuine insights. Stripping away the various old marketing formats, players who read it summarized three points:

Nebula Games was working on a new VR game; although it hadn't been officially promoted, many easter eggs were secretly hidden within Nebula Games' VR themes; and finally, it was likely an action-adventure game.

Upon discovering this, players couldn't stay calm.

“Damn it! Mr. Chen actually hid the news about his new game?”

“2333333, other game developers can't wait to let the whole world know, but Mr. Chen is sneaking around like this.”

“I found it! The protagonist seems to be named Nathan Drake!”

“Haha, I also found something in the _Red Dead Redemption: Redemption_ VR theme. Everyone, pay attention to the newspaper at the entrance of the camp. It says that Nebula Games' latest handheld console, the Switch, is selling well. Of course, that's not the main point. The main point is a piece of information in the second section: It is rumored that Nebula Games is developing a new game, _Uncharted_, and billions of players worldwide are looking forward to it.”

“This is just too much! Promoting themselves with easter eggs in their own games!”
