Chapter 1: Parallel World

“I’m never drinking again, my head hurts too much.”

Rubbing his head, Chen Xu complained as he sat up from the bed.

He rubbed his still somewhat sticky eyelids, and after opening his eyes, Chen Xu froze.

The surroundings were completely unfamiliar to him.

“Wait, this place…”

The next moment, before Chen Xu could figure out what had happened, countless memories surged into his mind.

It took about an hour for Chen Xu to sort through the memories in his mind.

It was clear that as a regular Game Planner in his previous life, he had not only transmigrated but had also landed in a Parallel World.

According to the memories in his mind, this world, for some unknown reason or at some unknown point in time, had diverged significantly from Chen Xu’s previous life.

All industries had undergone significant changes due to advancements in technology.

But exactly how significant, Chen Xu couldn’t quite say. What truly gave Chen Xu the most intuitive feeling was the game and entertainment industry.

The post-war world had embraced peace, and with the explosion of technology, the situations of not having enough food or being unable to afford medical treatment, prevalent in his previous life, basically no longer existed.

The economy had recovered exceptionally quickly. People were no longer worried about survival, and with money in their pockets, the entertainment industry naturally became the main direction of development.

The game industry was a part of this. In his previous life, games were treated as a scourge and a scapegoat for a long time.

Domestically, it went without saying, and it was the same abroad. Why did shootings happen so frequently? Because games promoted violence! So, supermarkets shouldn't take guns off the shelves; we should remove the source of shootings: games!

But in this Parallel World, it was different. Excellent games could truly be called art, and top-tier Game Designers enjoyed a social status comparable to literary giants.

However, this world also had one difference compared to Chen Xu’s previous life.

In the gaming field, game developers like Ubisoft and EA were nowhere to be found, replaced by others Chen Xu had never heard of.

As for the famous game producers of his previous life, not a single one existed in this world.

Hidetaka Miyazaki, who created the Souls series after resigning from Oracle to join FromSoftware; Masahiro Sakurai, who simplified hardcore platformers and single-handedly built the legendary Smash Bros. series; Sid Meier, who defined 4X game; Hironobu Sakaguchi, the founder of the Final Fantasy series; the Houser brothers, who pushed the concept of 3D open-world to its peak; Hideo Kojima, who pioneered stealth games and cinematic narrative games; and Shigeru Miyamoto, a legendary electronic game producer.

These producers, who had left illustrious names in the gaming world in his previous life, had vanished without a trace in this world.

Chen Xu himself was an ordinary student who had graduated less than half a year ago, devoted to entering the Comic Industry.

“This world... truly is a paradise for Cultural Practitioners!”

Recalling some memories in his mind, combined with some information he found on the computer, Chen Xu couldn't help but exclaim.

Strict laws and copyright protection for cultural products – these were unimaginable things in his previous life.

“Illustrations, huh?”

Through memories and the internet, Chen Xu gained some basic information about this world and noticed some drawing papers on the desk.

They were all Illustrations he had drawn before.

After graduating before the transmigration, the Original Body had always wanted to become a cartoonist.

Unfortunately, despite submitting multiple times, he never passed the editor's review.

As for online serialization of comics, they were also Lukewarm.

In addition to the Manuscript Fees from online serialized comics, he also made a living by drawing character Illustrations for novel authors and creating Concept Art for some game companies.

He wasn't particularly famous, and his Painting Skill wasn't top-tier. Depending on different requirements.

Generally speaking, the price for one drawing was around 1200, and if he encountered a Demanding Client, he'd have to revise it repeatedly.

“Comics? I don't understand this stuff!” Chen Xu recalled the memories in his mind and couldn't help but purse his lips.

Although the memories from the Original Body gave Chen Xu knowledge of various Painting Skill, it was useless.

After all, the Original Body had been reduced to doing Outsourced Illustrations to supplement living expenses.

As for the comics of his previous life, Chen Xu had heard of many: One-Punch Man, One Piece, Bleach, Naruto, Detective Conan—he knew them all.

But as for reading them, sorry.

He had only watched the anime. Who knew how to draw those popular manga?

“Looking at it this way, it seems I'll have to return to my old profession, gaming. And the game development efficiency in this world is quite high!” Chen Xu clicked his tongue after learning more.

Unlike game companies in his previous life that developed their own Game Engine, this world's overseas companies mostly followed that model, but domestically, there was an official Game Engine provided.

Furthermore, as everyone knows, game production covers many aspects, such as Numerical Design, art, story, level design, and code.

But the most important and fundamental aspect is code.

It directly affects the game's performance, serving as its skeleton.

No matter how good the gameplay and graphics are, if the code and optimization are poor, the game can basically be deemed a failure.

However, in this world, due to the development of IT Technology, Artificial Intelligence had an Embryonic Form and was applied to various industries, with gaming being one of the most significantly transformed.

Mechanism Commands and other code were implemented through Artificial Intelligence via the official Game Engine.

This completely eliminated the situation in his previous life where they would Sacrifice a Programmer.

If someone had to be sacrificed, it was usually the planner.

Of course, while convenient, it wasn't something every designer could use infinitely.

After all, using Artificial Intelligence for code construction required massive computations.

Therefore, each Game Designer, according to their different Job Title, received fixed resources each month.

Of course, they could also set up their own servers for individual computations, requiring only the payment of Licensing Fees.

However, the cost of setting up and maintaining servers was not cheap.

As for how to become a Game Designer, there were three methods in total.

One was to participate in the Game Department's exam every summer. Passing it would grant the Job Title of Game Designer.

Another way was to join a game company, work for two to three years, and then apply through the company's channels, reporting to the Game Department to become an Official Game Designer.

The last method was to create an Independent Game that received market recognition from players, mainly providing a path for ordinary game enthusiasts who weren't professionally trained.

Achieving a Sales Volume of 150,000, or a Cumulative Reviews of 5,000 with Positive Reviews above 8.5.

Meeting any one of these conditions would suffice.

As for Boosting Sales and Positive Reviews, that was essentially nonexistent, as it was considered an illegal activity, and getting caught would lead to severe consequences.

“It seems very legitimate, but at least getting the Game Designer Job Title shouldn't be difficult for me,” Chen Xu muttered to himself, stroking his chin as he absorbed the information.

After all, he wasn't alone; thousands upon thousands of predecessors from the gaming industry in his previous life stood behind him.

Chen Xu hadn't considered large-scale games at this stage, lacking in capabilities, resources, and funds.

But for small Independent Games, Chen Xu felt quite confident.

He knew all sorts of excellent Independent Games from his previous life very clearly.

After understanding the relevant information about this world, reproducing them would be entirely within Chen Xu's capabilities.

“Wait, what’s this?”

As Chen Xu was contemplating his next steps, he suddenly noticed something.

On the back of his hand, there was a translucent blue spherical mark, like a Birthmark.

Chen Xu rubbed his thumb over it, and suddenly, a transparent UI Pop-up Window appeared.

“System?”

Instantly, two words popped into Chen Xu’s mind.

Thinking about it carefully, after transmigrating, getting a system wasn’t all that excessive, was it?

It’s just, what about the name of this system?

‘Emotion Collection System’

Looking at the Flashy and Gaudy UI interface, golden like a Domestic Web Games from his previous life, Chen Xu fell into a moment of silence.

It was so Flashy and Gaudy, he couldn't shake the feeling it wasn't a legitimate system.
