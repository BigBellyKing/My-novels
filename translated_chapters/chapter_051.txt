Chapter 51: Damn it, shut up!

Looking at the brightly lit corridor, Sun Yixie let out a long breath.

There shouldn't be any danger in this brightly lit place, right?

Compared to a dark scene, a brightly lit one like this was much more comforting.

Thinking this, Sun Yixie controlled the protagonist to walk forward. Just as the protagonist tried to squeeze through a narrow gap, a low voice suddenly came through his headphones: "Little Pig!"

The game's perspective shook violently. Sun Yixie, sitting in his chair just as before, and the protagonist in the game, almost simultaneously let out panicked screams.

Along with the familiar action of covering his face.

Through the gaps in his fingers, Sun Yixie saw a huge, blood-stained, ferocious-looking brawny man appear behind the protagonist on the screen.

Then, he fiercely threw the game's protagonist down from the second floor.

The protagonist fell from the second floor to the first, and the screen displayed the corresponding visual, gradually becoming clear from darkness.

At this moment, a priest-like NPC walked up to him.

Speaking incomprehensible words.

"Who are you?"

"I understand, merciful God, you sent a messenger to find me, to protect your life... Child, you have been called."

Completely unsure of the meaning of this dialogue, the protagonist struggled to his feet a moment later, revealing a new mission prompt: Escape the asylum, enter the security room and open the main gate.

"Damn it, resorting to such sudden attacks!"

Looking at the mission prompt and then at his camera with only one battery left, Sun Yixie felt a bad premonition.

He had absolutely no sense of security.

What would he do if he encountered that fat monster again later?

However, it was good that he had only panicked a moment ago, and Sun Yixie actually felt that encountering the chubby monster was still somewhat better.

Because unlike the traditional terrifying female ghost faces, that chubby monster still looked relatively human, just more ferocious and menacing.

"What are these people doing?"

"They're not going to turn into monsters later, are they?"

In the hall, he finally saw other people, but they were all sitting there with blank expressions.

Sun Yixie cautiously controlled the protagonist to approach, but these people, as well as the patients in wheelchairs, ignored him completely.

As if they didn't see him at all.

He searched every corner and found some batteries.

"This kind of... this kind of horror game, it just creates a scary atmosphere, there's actually nothing there!"

Sun Yixie tried to alleviate his psychological pressure with words.

However, just as he passed the patient in the wheelchair from before, the music in his headphones suddenly became intense and chilling, and at the same time, the game's protagonist let out another loud scream.

Because the mental patient in the wheelchair suddenly lunged at him, his terrifying appearance was visible across the entire computer screen.

And in reality, Sun Yixie was so scared that he threw his mouse away.

"Damn it! Damn it!"

Slumped in his chair, Sun Yixie covered his face with his hands, muttering his catchphrase.

Just then, a creaking sound suddenly echoed, and the room door was slowly pushed open.

"Damn it! Who! Who!" Like a bird startled by a bowstring, Sun Yixie's body trembled as he looked towards the door.

"Who? It's me! Brother Sun, what are you doing? The air conditioning in the room is set so low? Hey... what's wrong with you?" Behind the door was a portly middle-aged man with a chubby face, a slightly short neck, and black-rimmed glasses. He looked with surprise at Sun Yixie, who was pale and wearing a down jacket.

"Brother Huang! You're finally back!" Sun Yixie let out a long breath, looking at the familiar face.

Glancing at the live stream's secondary monitor, then at the game's main screen, Huang Donglai understood what was going on.

"Brother Sun, are you playing a horror game? Judging by your state, you've had a tough time!" Huang Donglai clicked his tongue.

"Don't talk about it, Brother Huang, it's good that you're back." Sun Yixie seemed to have found his organization, breathing a sigh of relief as he picked up the mouse he'd thrown and adjusted the camera: "Guys, a small accident just happened, let's continue, okay?"

After speaking, he put his headphones back on.

Looking at his good friend sitting beside him, Sun Yixie felt something called confidence blossoming within him.

The perspective returned to the game.

At this moment, his hands were empty; he had nothing but a broken camera.

Sun Yixie now endlessly yearned for the horror games he used to play that involved shooting zombies with guns.

At least give him a weapon; with a weapon in hand, he wouldn't be so panicked.

"Finally found it."

No longer alone in reality, Sun Yixie felt that thing called courage return.

Stumbling and avoiding the mental patients along the way, he safely arrived at the security room.

After entering the security room and triggering a cutscene, Sun Yixie glanced at the nearby screen, then put his hood back on.

"Why are you wearing a hood, Brother Sun?" Huang Donglai next to him asked curiously.

"The bullet comments say there's a high-energy part ahead." Sun Yixie said, glancing at the bullet comments.

"Oh, come on, how many high-energy parts can a horror game have? And with it being so bright, what's there to be scared of?" Huang Donglai said.

The moment his words fell, the game monitor showed the image of the priest from before in the bottom right corner. After glancing at the camera, the priest pulled the power switch, and instantly, the entire screen went completely dark; the power was cut!

"Damn it!" The sudden power outage startled Sun Yixie.

"Oh, Brother Sun, don't get so worked up. The monster hasn't even appeared, what are you scared of?" Huang Donglai said.

At the same time, violent banging sounds started coming from the security room door!

'Bang!' 'Bang!' 'Bang!'

Each door-banging sound seemed to strike Sun Yixie's heart.

"Damn it! Huang Donglai, shut up!" Sun Yixie shouted with a slightly trembling voice, then noticed the bullet comments in the live stream and also the prompt that appeared in the game.

"The cabinet, yes! Yes! I can hide in the cabinet!"

As he spoke, he fumbled to the cabinet and pressed the interact button.

'Bang!'

He had just entered the cabinet when, with another door-banging sound, the terrifying fat man from before burst through the door.

He looked around the room.

The protagonist in the game was hiding in the cabinet, and only his rapid heartbeat could be heard.

Through the gaps in the cabinet, illuminated by faint light, Sun Yixie saw the fat man's terrifying face, then pulled himself back and closed his eyes.

One minute, two minutes, three minutes...

"Brother Sun, Brother Sun, why are you still hiding in the cabinet? The monster's gone, it probably won't come back." Huang Donglai, looking at the bullet comments in the live stream, then curiously observed Sun Yixie, who was still and unmoving like a turtle hiding in the cabinet.

"Damn it, shut up! I have my own thoughts!"

As Sun Yixie spoke, he took a deep breath and emerged from the cabinet.

"Oh, Brother Sun, don't get agitated. Let me tell you, these horror games are cyclical. If it's a scary scene now, the next part will be relatively simple," Huang Donglai said.

"Don't lie to me, Brother Huang." Sun Yixie was half-believing, half-doubting.

"Oh, why would I lie to you? Trust me! The content later definitely won't be that scary!" Huang Donglai said with a 'trust me' expression.
