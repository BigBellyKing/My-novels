Chapter 331: Utterly Exhilarating (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

The Call of Duty: Modern Warfare series always presents its game story through multi-line narratives, only switching back to one faction at the very end. So, after rescuing Nikolai, the player's faction also switched to the US military storyline, transforming from an SAS operative into a Marine Corps soldier: Paul Jackson.

"From the timeline, it seems this event is happening simultaneously on the day after Price and Soap rescued Nikolai!" Inside the gaming pod, Song Ren sighed with emotion as he watched the unfolding story. And unlike before, this time the scale of the operation was much larger. Over the coastline, more than a dozen Cobra attack helicopters were flying towards the target, carrying fully armed squad members. Their mission had only one objective: to capture Khaled Al-Asad. Before the game started, a piece of footage had been played. Its content showed Khaled Al-Asad capturing the ruler of a certain Middle Eastern country and then executing him in a coup.

"Ten seconds to target." "Received..." With this brief exchange, the attack helicopters quickly arrived above the target. This was the first time in the game they had arrived at a city scene. It was clearly a country with a terrible economic environment, but it still filled Song Ren with anticipation. Just like the game's title: Modern Warfare. This level clearly had a much larger setting!

Lieutenant Vasquez's orders came through the radio, and Song Ren, taking the lead, charged towards the target building. Using explosives to blow open the door, Song Ren didn't even wait for his teammates behind him; he was already impatient to start shooting. Breach the door, descend the underground stairs. The moment he reached the doorway, the screen turned from red to gray, and a famous quote appeared: "Teamwork is essential; it gives others a chance to take the bullet for you. – Unknown."

"What's going on! Where's my health bar? I'm playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, not Dark Souls: Monster Hunter!" He was confused at first, but then Song Ren realized something. Difficulty! Damn it, he'd changed the difficulty himself! This wasn't normal difficulty! It had become Veteran difficulty! But to jump two difficulty levels, wasn't that a bit too much? He went down in one encounter?

Song Ren was completely stunned. Old Zhang had been spouting nonsense about entrusting his life to his teammates. Was this what it meant, letting teammates scout ahead while he followed? And learning knowledge, was that the slogan after death? Song Ren was utterly flustered.

However, on the other side, Zhang Yi felt a completely different kind of exhilaration. After switching from Veteran difficulty to normal difficulty, he felt the game's sense of participation became stronger. Although the heart-pounding sensation was gone, it was incredibly satisfying. He entered the building with night vision goggles, then was forced out by enemy fire to clear the streets. At the same time, various modern weapons finally appeared; our supporting M1A2 main battle tank showed up, but was unable to provide fire support due to enemy tanks. At this point, he needed to use Javelin anti-tank weapons to destroy the enemy tanks, and finally blow up the elevated machine gun. The scene instantly became exciting.

"Awesome!" After controlling Paul Jackson to take down the attacking enemies and completing the retreat with their M1A2 tank and troops, Zhang Yi's character once again switched back to Soap on the SAS side. By this time, Soap and his team had successfully rescued Nikolai and were leaving in an attack helicopter.

But midway through their departure, they encountered enemy attack and were directly shot down by a classic RPG in mid-air. The first fallen squad member appeared—Boris, along with two unnamed pilots. What followed was a thrilling escape, during which they used a Stinger to shoot down an enemy attack helicopter that was pursuing them. Finally, they retreated under the cover of their own AC-130 gunship. In this level, Chen Xu also made some improvements. In the first half, players controlled Soap, escaping with Captain Price. In the second half, they played as the AC-130's bombardier, helping Soap and his team by bombing a path for them. It was no longer just simply watching a monitor screen like in his previous life, but offered visuals with even greater impact. With each bombardment, watching the buildings on the ground instantly collapse from the explosions, and the kill effects appearing, Zhang Yi felt utterly exhilarated. And this was just an appetizer.

After successfully helping the SAS squad evacuate, Zhang Yi's perspective once again shifted to Paul Jackson for the next part of the story. One storyline followed the SAS forces, and the other, the Marine Corps. At the same time, both storylines advanced concurrently. Before he had even finished reveling in the bombing, Zhang Yi, now playing Paul Jackson, was once again in a plane, frantically using its turrets to bombard enemy tanks and troops over the city. The entire city was in ruins, with smoke and dust from the shelling permeating everything, making the sky appear hazy gray at dusk. Bullets, artillery fire, and constant explosions on the highway bridge. Buildings under construction and cranes collapsed with a roar in the blasts. The large-scale war scenes that had been absent before were finally unfolding before Zhang Yi. He continuously attacked enemy forces with machine guns, planes crashed and exploded. Buildings collapsed with a thunderous roar, stirring up clouds of dust. These scenes were truly shocking. Zhang Yi, playing intensely, shouted and yelled, his adrenaline surging. It was incredibly thrilling and addictive.

Large numbers of armored vehicles entered the city. From attack helicopters in the sky, soldiers rappelled down into the city. Tens of thousands of soldiers advanced and searched in several different areas. It was similar to previous levels, but the scale of this level's setting was far grander. They descended from the attack helicopter, then proceeded to the trapped friendly forces' position, relieved them, and returned to the helicopter. Along the way, even on normal difficulty, facing a hail of bullets and explosions, enemy RPGs and grenades, Zhang Yi experienced the screen turning red many times. But fortunately, it wasn't Veteran difficulty, so the damage wasn't enough to make him "learn the famous quote" (i.e., die and see the quote).

However, in the game, a catastrophic piece of news arrived at this moment. There was a high probability that a nuclear weapon was hidden within the city. Upon receiving the news, the Marine Corps immediately began to retreat; countless helicopters returned, and soldiers in the city quickly boarded armored vehicles to evacuate. Paul Jackson, controlled by Zhang Yi, was also rapidly returning in a helicopter with the comrades he had just rescued.

But Zhang Yi shivered. Having seen the promotional trailer, he already had some guesses about what might happen next. If the previous levels had allowed players to experience what it meant to have their 'blood boiling,' then the upcoming level's presentation would make them understand what true shock was, not just visually, but also deep within their hearts.
