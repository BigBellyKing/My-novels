Chapter 198: Official Taunt! (4th update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)

“Everything needs materials: flint, wood, grass, silk, and gold nuggets…”

While chopping trees on the map, Wang Han also picked up flint, flowers, dry grass, and berries from the ground.

Gradually, Wang Han accumulated more items.

Through the inventory panel on the left, Wang Han also saw that there weren’t many things she could make at the moment. Axes, hoes, torches, and campfires, as for combat gear, some materials were still missing.

At the same time, many grayed-out, unlocked items, Wang Han noticed, required completing a prerequisite called the Science Machine.

But this thing needed one gold nugget, four wood, and four stone. The wood was easy to get; she had already gathered enough after chopping several trees.

As for stone, she hadn't found any yet, but the description for mining stone with a hoe indicated that it wasn't a rare item. The only thing was the gold nugget; she still didn't know where to find it.

Compared to The Wilderness in her previous life, Chen Xu had made some new player tutorial prompts.

For instance, the first time Wang Han encountered a tree, Wilson in the game would prompt her, indicating the need for an axe. At this point, a small arrow would also point to the toolbar next to it. The same applied to ore and other resources. This was meant to help players understand the most basic guided operations in the game, rather than having them figure out everything on their own.

For most small-scale, low-cost games, the biggest problem isn't necessarily the gameplay content. More often, it's about the detailed experience. New player prompts are a case in point.

Many independent game designers have a unique, unconventional style, finding new approaches in gameplay, much like independent films. However, they often struggle with details.

Moreover, games and movies are different mediums; movies are simply watched, while games require players to experience them themselves. For some big titles, regardless of whether they are fun or if the story is excellent, at least the experience ensures that players won't be confused about how to play the game.

Hardcore Souls-like games like Dark Souls mostly make players lament the game's difficulty. However, basic operations like attacking, defending, rolling, and lighting bonfires are clearly understood by players, allowing them to grasp how the game is played.

Regarding The Wilderness’s new player tutorial, Chen Xu didn't just throw everything at players like in mobile games, eager to show them how to play step-by-step.

Instead, it adopted a phased approach. For example, when a player discovered ore, Wilson in the game would prompt them, saying they needed to build a pickaxe and adding a line: “Perhaps there's some gold inside these rocks.”

These hints were given to players in conjunction with Wilson's dialogue in the game.

Of course, for Wang Han at the moment, what she was doing was scavenging.

She clicked on every collectible item on the ground: pebbles, weeds, berries, and saplings.

Along the way, she also saw some butterfly-like insects, but for some reason, either not meeting the conditions or something else, she couldn't catch them at all.

She also saw some rabbit holes on the grass, and when she clicked on them, Wilson in the game would say a corresponding line, making Wang Han understand that these rabbits ate carrots. If she could make a trap with carrots, she might be able to catch rabbits.

“This seems a bit interesting, but the map is so huge!”

Wang Han’s face was filled with novelty. Although she hadn't played for long, her sensitivity to games allowed her to realize that this game's gameplay was completely different from the games Chen Xu had developed before.

And what surprised her most was how incredibly vast the game's map was.

After opening the map, she scrolled the mouse wheel and discovered that her character’s current location could only be described as the tip of the iceberg.

To put it in percentage terms, she had probably explored less than 0.1% of the content so far.

Wang Han used the collected materials to craft another axe and a hoe, then began to wander around the map.

Currently, she didn’t know how to play the game, so she was simply traversing the map, exploring new areas, and collecting all sorts of materials from the ground.

These material-gathering activities were inherently somewhat boring.

But at the moment, Wang Han seemed to be enjoying it.

Mainly, it was because collecting these materials allowed her to clearly see her item inventory becoming richer.

Moreover, the sound effects associated with gathering materials, such as chopping trees and picking berries, sounded very engaging.

Of course, there was an even more crucial point: scavenging was truly an addictive activity.

At this moment, Wang Han had completely forgotten that she had originally intended to look for gold and build that Science Machine first.

Now, she was just running continuously across the map, collecting all kinds of ‘junk’.

At the same time, tools in the game, like axes and hoes, had durability. Once their durability was depleted, the tools would break.

However, these raw materials were generally easy to obtain, so she didn't feel bad when they broke.

“Huh! What’s that? A beehive?”

Wang Han, who was near the river chopping trees and scavenging, heard a buzzing sound from her headphones and noticed something resembling a beehive.

“I wonder if attacking it will drop honey!” Staring at the beehive, Wang Han looked at the axe in her hand, feeling a little unable to restrain herself.

Walking up to the beehive, Wang Han raised her axe and swung it directly.

With that swing, Wang Han heard a buzzing sound, and then five or six ‘Killer Bees’ swarmed out of the beehive in front of her.

“Wait! Not bees, Killer Bees!?”

Looking at the Killer Bees in front of her, Wang Han, still holding the axe, widened her eyes. The name gave her a bad premonition.

The next moment, these Killer Bees rushed straight towards Wang Han. The screen flashed red repeatedly, and her health in the upper right corner plummeted wildly.

At this point, Wang Han didn't choose to escape. Instead, she stood her ground stubbornly, trying to retaliate with the axe in her hand.

However, what took her aback was that the axe seemed completely useless against them; she swung two or three times, but didn’t kill a single one.

“What the heck! How do I fight this?!”

Wang Han was instantly startled. This time, she thought about running away. But it was already too late.

With the Killer Bees’ final sting, Wilson in the game collapsed to the ground.

【First Day】 (Everyone has a first death, but even so, dying so quickly is indeed a bit embarrassing)

Looking at the achievement that popped up, Wang Han's eyes widened. Official Taunt! This was definitely an Official Taunt!
