Chapter 322: Propaganda War (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Following the announcement from Chen Xu about *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*.

Immediately, numerous domestic media outlets reported on it.

After all, many designers and media in the gaming industry were well aware.

Of what *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare* represented.

Clearly, Nebula Games was acting as the escorting game developer for the Cosmic VR Platform this time.

And *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare* was this escorting masterpiece.

Although the publicly announced content was just a name and a theme.

Nebula Games' reputation, however, was too strong to ignore.

From its very first game until now, Nebula Games' reputation had been painstakingly built, punch by punch.

Especially with *Warcraft*, which had previously swept the entire RTS market, and the unique *Rainbow Six Siege*.

So, even though there wasn't much content yet.

The mere label of "Produced by Chen Xu, Produced by Nebula Games."

Was enough to make players both domestically and internationally eagerly anticipate it.

However, this situation also caused Atrai and the Channel Alliance a headache.

Whether it was movies, promotions, or game development.

"We were clearly here first!"

"And these promotional warm-up tactics, why are you so skilled at them?"

But annoyance aside, there was nothing they could do.

After all, they couldn't rewire players' brains to make them ignore *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*.

Players, on their end, were eagerly discussing the potential content and gameplay of *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*, which was a source of enjoyment for many.

Guessing correctly was a bonus, and guessing wrong wasn't embarrassing.

While *Storm Action* had players excited, honestly, there wasn't much to guess about it.

After all, it was a film-adapted game.

As for Nebula Games, besides the modern warfare theme, players knew nothing else.

This added a sense of mystery.

"Rational analysis: This is very likely an FPS game! And it's a modern warfare-themed game!"

"Bro upstairs, that's awesome! Like Zhuge Liang reborn! Listening to your words is like listening to words!"

"Damn it, you two idiots upstairs, I hope the next time such a stupid reply appears is next time!"

"Warning! No Matryoshka-Style Spreading!"

Online, players were enthusiastically discussing related topics.

Atrai and the Channel Alliance, meanwhile, also made an urgent response.

Offering free viewing of *Storm Action* to further increase IP promotion.

Behind-the-scenes footage of the male and female protagonists during game recording.

They pulled out all the stops.

At the same time, *Storm Action* struck while the iron was hot.

Releasing its first promotional video.

The video recreated a classic scene from the movie.

The game's protagonist infiltrated the armed militants' building base to rescue trapped comrades.

Finally eliminating the evil forces.

Especially the final building explosion, combined with tense and exciting music, was very impactful.

In the original movie, this part was actually nearing its end.

But clearly, the game wouldn't follow the movie's plot, as a two-hour storyline could hardly support a main campaign experience of a dozen or even twenty hours.

Therefore, expanding the subsequent plot was an inevitable task.

In the video, after this crisis, the camera instantly switched to a dark basement.

At the same time, the protagonist's incredulous voice came through: "It's you?"

Then the video abruptly ceased.

The entire promotional video sparked a huge reaction among the player fanbase.

Because the visuals of the entire promotional video were outstanding.

Moreover, Atrai specifically noted that this was in-game footage, meaning it was the actual visuals players would experience.

It was incredibly exquisite and detailed, and finally, there was the very cliché but classic Riddler-like setup.

Who made the protagonist so surprised? Who was the mastermind?!

For ordinary casual players, it might not have made much of an impression.

But for fan players, it was clearly quite appealing.

They all discussed who the so-called mastermind truly was.

And just after Atrai released its first promotional video.

Chen Xu's official Weibo account also made a move.

No images, no text content.

At 2 PM Imperial Capital time, Chen Xu and Nebula Games' official Weibo accounts simply posted a video link in silence.

Instantly, many players became excited.

"Sure enough, I knew Mr. Chen wouldn't remain indifferent!"

"Atrai just released their promotional video, and Mr. Chen immediately followed suit, so the game must really be ready?"

Even though they hadn't clicked to watch yet, players were already discussing it animatedly.

The main thing was that the launch timing was simply too subtle.

Atrai had just launched theirs.

And Chen Xu immediately brought out his video.

……………………

In an internet cafe in the Imperial Capital, Zhang Yi was lying in a VR pod, playing *Rainbow Six Siege*.

"Damn it, you scared the hell out of me! Damn it! How can someone be so twisted?! Why play Kapkan when there are so many other Operators?!" Zhang Yi felt his heart pounding and took a deep breath.

"Exactly, this game is good in every way, except sometimes you die without seeing anyone," Song Ren's voice came through the voice channel.

For Zhang Yi and his friends, the game felt pretty good, but also a bit like a horror game.

They'd be walking along and suddenly die; passing through a door, they'd either hit a Claymore or a Kapkan trap.

Especially with the recently updated Operator called Evil Eye, those laser cameras going "biubiubiu" were absolutely terrifying.

"Are you guys still playing?! Hurry and check Chen Xu's official Weibo! The *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare* promotional video is out! And there's a VR version!" Wang Han's voice suddenly burst into the voice channel, full of excitement.

"What?! The promotional video is out already?!" Zhang Yi's voice was filled with surprise.

You had to know, in the past, Chen Xu would always make grand promises, and when players asked, it was always: "It's being made, it's being made."

Two months ago, he'd create a new folder, then release a promotional video, and after another two months, there'd be new game news.

But this time, the video was out so quickly?!

"I wonder what this new game will be like?!" Song Ren also sounded a bit expectant.

"Who cares what it's like, I'm definitely buying it," Zhang Yi said.

Of course, this was also because he had already ordered two Huanyu VR pods.

"Enough talk, let's just quit and quickly check out the trailer to see if there's anything exciting," Song Ren said, exiting the game.

Anyway, this round was already the decisive one, and the opponents were dominating with a 2:0 lead.

Their last teammate was still crouching in a corner saving his weapon—damn it, playing this game as an attacker and you're still saving your weapon!

Carrying a hint of resentment, Zhang Yi also exited the game and opened Chen Xu's official Weibo, where the first thing he saw was a video option.

He directly selected to load the VR version, and Zhang Yi, filled with anticipation, clicked on it.
