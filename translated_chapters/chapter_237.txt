Chapter 236: Is This Really a Hunting Game? (Sixth Update, Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)

Chen Xu rested his chin on his hand in front of the computer.

Since he had decided to make "Monster Hunter: World," he still needed to carefully consider how to go about it.

From a gameplay perspective, "Monster Hunter: World" was a very unique game.

In other multiplayer games, there would always be more or less some PVE elements.

But "Monster Hunter: World," on the other hand, was a pure cooperative hunting game.

In "Dark Souls," players could even invade other players' worlds.

And later on, for many veteran Dark Souls players, the fun largely revolved around PVP.

However, "Monster Hunter: World" had no PVP content.

The game advocated for player teamwork and cooperative hunting of dragon-like creatures.

As for Demon Mode Dual Blades slashing teammates, a charging Lance skewering a friend, a Light Bowgun blowing up a teammate's crotch, a Heavy Bowgun piercing a teammate's defense, or a Great Hammer's three-charge home run – all these scenarios were exceptions and absolutely not PVP content within the game.

From the game itself, whether it's the game's background or content, "Monster Hunter: World" could be said to be a game with a very unique style.

Firstly, the core selling points of this game were its action system and a relatively realistic hunting experience.

These all served to revolve around the overall hunting experience of the game.

In most games, battles between players and BOSSes usually lasted a few minutes, ten minutes at most.

But in "Monster Hunter: World."

Facing powerful BOSSes, for most ordinary players.

An intense battle lasting ten or twenty minutes was considered quite normal.

Of course, speedrun masters, or hardcore players who had grind out powerful equipment to bully smaller monsters, didn't count.

Combined with the AI's performance, Chen Xu believed it could better showcase the immersion of hunting than "Monster Hunter: World" in his previous life.

Next was the game's class system.

Or rather, its weapon system.

There were no class divisions like warriors or wizards in the game.

But there were different weapon classifications.

Just like how different weapons in "Dark Souls" had different attack methods.

In "Monster Hunter: World," players had a variety of distinct weapons to choose from.

At the same time, each weapon had different combo skills.

It was just like a fighting game; players needed to input commands to successfully unleash weapon moves.

Of course, in actual play, it wouldn't be like fighting games where players needed to memorize long move lists.

Furthermore, it wasn't that if you couldn't perform weapon combos, you couldn't play.

It just meant you wouldn't be able to pull off very flashy moves.

As for the difficulty, compared to "Dark Souls."

"Monster Hunter: World" was much simpler.

Because the game would have a gradual difficulty curve.

To put it bluntly, "Dark Souls" made you suffer first, then slowly get familiar with the game.

Whereas "Monster Hunter" let you get familiar with the game before suffering, which was quite user-friendly.

Secondly, "Monster Hunter: World" itself was a very replayable game.

Why was that?

When you've grinded for hundreds of hours and haven't even gotten a single Attack Jewel, you'd naturally understand why this game was so replayable.

Because the game inherently had a grind element, but if it were just pure grinding, it wouldn't be enough to sustain players for such a long time.

Ultimately, even when facing the same monster in every hunt.

There would still be a different experience.

Changes in the environment during combat, other BOSSes potentially joining unexpectedly, unstable teammate factors in cooperative play, and the monster's own attack habits.

All these factors ensured that every hunt could present a different process, rather than being singular and tedious.

At the same time, the most crucial point was that in "Monster Hunter: World," there were actually many clever methods that allowed some players, even if their skills weren't top-notch, to clear the game effectively as long as they understood its characteristics.

Of course, it wasn't completely brain-dead either.

...

After two continuous days, Chen Xu completed the general content of the "Monster Hunter: World" design concept document, and called Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, and others into the conference room for a meeting.

Everyone arrived early in the conference room, excitedly discussing in low voices.

"I wonder what kind of hunting game Mr. Chen mentioned before!"

"Yeah, I feel like the setting should be ancient, with players mainly using Spears, Bows, and other weapons to hunt in nature."

"I'm more interested in how the AI's performance will be reflected in hunting."

"An inexplicable anticipation!"

The people in the conference room had apparently learned in the past two days that the new game would be a hunting-themed title, and all looked eagerly expectant.

Just then, Chen Xu pushed the door open and entered, and everyone quieted down.

Sitting at the head of the table, Chen Xu looked at everyone and said, "I believe you all know some things about the new game, so I won't waste any more time with pleasantries."

"The main purpose of today's meeting is the development of the new game. Please look at the big screen."

As Chen Xu's words fell, the title "Monster Hunter: World" appeared on the projector.

"First, let me briefly talk about the game's theme and direction."

"Regarding the theme, this is a hunting-themed game, but the combat system will be quite unique, differing from other action games currently on the market."

"At the same time, within the game, we will create a relatively vast ecological world to showcase a characteristic of AI intelligence."

"Finally, the monsters players will hunt are mainly dragon-like creatures... Hmm, that's it."

Chen Xu slid his finger across the laptop's touchpad.

On the projection screen in the conference room appeared a colossal monster with a yellowish-green carapace, strong wings, and limbs.

Its ferocious claws and sharp teeth made it look incredibly terrifying.

Next to it was an introduction to this monster: [Queen of the Land – Rathian]

Looking at the screen, everyone was stunned.

The sense of shock brought by this wyvern was simply too strong.

"Furthermore, in the game, players won't have class divisions; instead, there will be different weapons. Simply put, weapons will replace the so-called classes."

As Chen Xu introduced, the image on the conference room's projection screen also changed.

Great Swords, Long Bows, Dual Blades, Long Swords... a series of weapons appeared on the screen.

Of course, they all shared a common characteristic: all weapons were melee weapons.

Looking at the depiction in the concept art, although the weapon held by the leather-clad hunter was large, compared to the Rathian from before, it still felt puny.

Besides this, there were some unfinished sketches. For example, one sketch depicted a colossal Elder Dragon with spread wings, its massive wings covered in thorns, and two horns on its head that sent shivers down one's spine.

"Mr. Chen, is the new game... a Souls-like game?" Qin Yi swallowed, voicing the confusion in his heart.

Colossal dragon-like monsters, tiny hunters, and still melee weapons.

Is this truly a hunting game?

It's not going to be monsters hunting hunters, is it?

Don't ask if there's more; if you ask, there is.
