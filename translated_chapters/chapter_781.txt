Chapter 780: Stop Persecuting Nia! 

The game had reached this point, and from a story perspective, many players knew that it was nearing the end. 

Although there was still a lot of content to explore in the game, such as different Titans, each representing a vast map, and many powerful monsters that players hadn't encountered yet.

And now, having arrived in Morytha, this new map made many people realize that the world background of Xenoblade Chronicles might be completely different from what they had imagined. 

Twisters and thunder, Morytha, located in the deepest part of the Cloud Sea, was shrouded in darkness. 

The most crucial point was that Morytha was actually a ruined modern city, incredibly familiar to players. 

Collapsed office buildings, shattered highways, buildings and metal melted by thermal warheads – it was clear this had once been a technologically advanced world.
