Chapter 45: Be a Human, Mr. Chen

On October 8th, after the National Day holiday, Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, and staff from various departments were called into Chen Xu's office.

"As I mentioned to everyone before the National Day holiday, we will be developing a large-scale project next."

"It will involve a lot of action elements. Qin Yi, you'll need to contact a motion capture studio later, as many assets will be needed for that." Chen Xu said to a young man in his mid-twenties, who already seemed to be balding a bit.

"No problem, Mr. Chen." The young man, named Qin Yi, nodded.

Motion capture, in both his previous life and the Parallel World, wasn't some high-tech, exclusive gadget. Compared to manual animation, motion capture offered significant advantages: cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and naturalness.

If it weren't for the substantial capital required to set up a mature motion capture studio, Chen Xu would want to establish one immediately. After all, future game development would undoubtedly necessitate a frequent output of relevant assets.

"Alright, everyone, let's take a look at the game we're going to develop this time."

After a brief introduction, Chen Xu projected his laptop screen onto the wall screen. The initial design concept draft for Outlast had been rushed out by Chen Xu over the past few days, with the help of the Memory Capsule.

"Ho... horror game?" Yang Xin looked at Chen Xu with a hint of surprise.

It wasn't just Yang Xin; Ruan Ningxue, Qin Yi, and other newly hired employees were all a bit bewildered. This was a genre they had absolutely never anticipated.

Everyone had considered story-driven games like To the Moon, META-style games like Undertale, or traditional RPGs, among others. But a horror game? That was truly unexpected.

After all, horror games are actually in a rather awkward position. And there was a crucial point: hadn't Mr. Chen said before that he was a Warrior of Love? What the heck does a horror game have to do with love?! 

Looking at everyone's expressions, Chen Xu could more or less guess their thoughts. This type of game is genuinely difficult to make. It can be said that horror games are a genre that severely tests production quality.

After all, if a horror game fails to scare players, it will likely devolve into a comedy game. Coupled with the horror game market, it's destined to be overlooked by big companies, with only small and average companies taking on its production.

In the absence of financial support, most designers resort to a common technique used in horror movies and games: jump scares. Simply put, a jump scare is when you see a long-legged young lady gracefully walking towards you in a picture. Just as you're getting excited and ready to draw your gun and shoot, she suddenly transforms into a blood-stained, hideous old witch right in your face—that's a standard jump scare.

Despite being considered incredibly cliché, it's undeniable that jump scares are a classic and effective technique for instilling fear in players. However, jump scares are a double-edged sword: used well, they can create a masterpiece; used poorly, they result in a terrible game. Truly excellent horror games often employ jump scares, so it's a very mistaken notion to simply say that horror games using jump scares aren't good.

A truly terrifying horror game keeps players in a constant state of dread throughout the game. Because the scariest thing about a horror game isn't being startled, but the unsettling feeling of not knowing when you'll be scared.

Horror games can have jump scares, but they absolutely must not be overused. How to use jump scares as an expressive technique to make players scare themselves during the game—that is the most crucial point of horror games, and also the most difficult.

In the office, Chen Xu explained the key points to pay attention to for Outlast.

"Actually, it's just that we don't have enough development time. Otherwise, I would really have liked to take everyone on a field trip, find an abandoned hospital or something, then set it up so you could have a deeper understanding." Chen Xu said with a regretful expression, thinking of something.

Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue stared at Chen Xu with wide eyes. Qin Yi and the others quietly lowered their heads.

"It's alright, don't regret it. The next time we develop a horror game, I'll definitely take everyone." Chen Xu said with a smile. Everyone was instantly speechless. Who would regret something like that!

"Also, Zhang Yida, regarding the game's promotion, you'll need to pay attention to it. We need to create a hot topic around video and live streaming platforms. You should write a proposal for that." After a simple joke, Chen Xu turned to Zhang Yida from the marketing department.

Zhang Yida, who had been sitting quietly, nodded in response to Chen Xu's words: "Understood, Mr. Chen."

Nebula Games now had some capital, so promotion would naturally not be neglected. Moreover, excellent horror games inherently have a good live streaming effect, which can be leveraged through live streaming and video platforms to rapidly spread and ferment popularity.

After all, many players are too scared to play horror games themselves but enjoy watching others play. Furthermore, watching and playing many horror games are two different experiences. It's not uncommon for players who think "this horror game is just okay" to buy and play it themselves.

Although there's a high probability they might be too scared to continue playing, this still contributes to the game's popularity. These aspects are all important.

In his previous life, the Outlast series achieved over 15 million units in sales, largely due to the rise of the live streaming industry in that world.

After a few brief remarks, Chen Xu continued to explain the core elements of Outlast to everyone. Firstly, just like the game's name, players take on the role of an unarmed reporter, and when faced with various terrifying scenes, they have only one choice: to escape.

Secondly, there's the camera setting in the game. Unlike traditional games with nuclear-powered flashlights that never turn off, in Outlast, the reporter's use of the camera's night vision function is an essential mode for navigating dark environments. And unlike a nuclear-powered flashlight, activating night vision consumes battery power.

However, players have a limited supply of batteries, which creates a driving point. In addition, the game's plot, rhythm, and other aspects were meticulously dissected and explained to everyone by Chen Xu.

"Hmm, for the DV art style and the creation of the scene atmosphere, Ruan Ningxue, you need to pay attention. You can try turning off the lights at home late at night and truly experiencing it."

"I've also prepared the props; you can take them home to experience it then." As he spoke, Chen Xu took a handheld DV camera from his desk and placed it next to Ruan Ningxue.

Ruan Ningxue: ??????

Looking at the handheld DV in front of her, her smile gradually faded. Be a human, Mr. Chen!
