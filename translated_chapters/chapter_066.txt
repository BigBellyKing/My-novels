Chapter 66: Overcooked is Launched

As the first-prize winner of last year's 'Sci-Fi Game Design Competition', and having previously created Outlast, which sparked a wave of horror, Chen Xu's influence was no longer limited to the independent game circle.

Furthermore, the significance of Overcooked for Nebula Games this time was not just a simple game, but a trial run for the platform's direction.

Therefore, in terms of promotion, Overcooked received even more resources than the previous Outlast.

For this game, Chen Xu even specifically filmed several one-and-a-half-minute short video advertisements.

In the promotional video ad, a couple sat in front of their respective computers in a bright, sunny bedroom.

On the computer monitors, the game screen of Overcooked was displayed.

'A brief separation cannot affect our chemistry and feelings.'

Chopping vegetables, cooking dishes, then serving them, and with the screen shaking, the kitchen in the game actually split into two.

They were actually cooking on a hot air balloon.

With their mutual cooperation, the couple laughed and enjoyed the beauty of the game.

The next moment, as time progressed, day gradually turned into night.

In the background, the spaces of the two individuals, a man and a woman in different locations, gradually merged. With a brief flash of screen, the next moment, the two were living together in one house.

But what remained the same was that in front of them, the computer screen still displayed the game screen of Overcooked.

'From the past to the present, our feelings remain.'

Getting up from the chair, the boy opened a food delivery APP on his phone, preparing to order some takeout.

But the next moment, the girl snatched the phone, full of smiles. She pulled out a chef's hat from who-knows-where and waved it in front of him.

Opening the refrigerator, the two went to the kitchen. One chopped vegetables, the other cooked, turning cooking in the game into cooking in reality.

'Enjoy the game, enjoy life, and experience the fun the game brings with your special someone (him/her).'

Accompanied by the melodious BGM, the video drew to a close with their candlelight dinner.

Finally, a line of subtitles appeared in the center of the screen: Overcooked launches on February 14th.

Of course, this was the couple's version of the promotional video; in addition to this, there were also versions for brothers and best friends.

A total of three different versions were filmed.

It could be said that it covered all aspects.

For players, this promotional video for Overcooked clearly sparked considerable interest.

The Q-style cute graphics themselves, coupled with the incredibly warm promotional video, had already stirred up anticipation in the hearts of countless players.

Below Chen Xu's official Weibo post releasing the promotional video, various replies from players quickly flooded in.

"Holy cow, the game designer I follow came back from the dead!"

"The promotional video is great! Though the couple's version made my single dog heart feel a bit sour."

"This game is too cute and heartwarming! Is Chen Xu compensating us for scaring us with Outlast?"

"This is the true 'Warrior of Love'! Perfect for playing with my girlfriend. Thumbs up, Chen Xu!"

"Looking closely, it seems to be a cooking game, co-op for two players? Poor me, I can only play with my bros!"

"Don't be disheartened, bros can sometimes turn into couples!"

"????? Something's not right with you upstairs!"

"Who's not right? Let Brother Jie take a look!"

"Hehe, I'm planning to confess this Valentine's Day. She loves playing games, so I'll confess while we play this game. I've got my methods ready: cook in the game, then show her my real-life cooking skills. The confession gift will be hidden inside the cake I bake!"

"You got this, bro! Wishing you a successful confession!"

"Yeah, this is the Chen Xu I know! Stop making 'underworld games' like Outlast. Although watching others get scared silly is fun, I still prefer games full of love like this!"

Not only were players discussing it, but game industry designers who followed Chen Xu were also discussing it.

"Did you hear? Chen Xu's new game is actually a cooperative game for couples."

"It's not strictly for couples, but the promotion and release date (Valentine's Day) certainly lean that way."

"I'm not too optimistic about this kind of game. For cooperative games, if the level design isn't good, the whole game falls apart. Chen Xu's previous games were all story-driven; this is his first time doing something like this, right?"

"It's hard to say about the game content, but Chen Xu has definitely mastered the promotional aspect!"

"Exactly, exactly! Looking at that promotional video, I felt especially warm and wanted to buy it to play with my girlfriend."

"But I feel it won't be easy for it to become a hit. After all, the success of cooperative games largely depends on their popularity. If it can generate the same kind of buzz as Outlast did, then Overcooked's sales would be very impressive."

"However, there don't seem to be similar competing products during the Spring Festival, so Chen Xu has a significant advantage here."

"No competitors isn't necessarily a good thing. After all, the gaming industry isn't zero-sum. As long as it doesn't become oversaturated, it can help expand the sales market."

"I feel it might be unrealistic for Chen Xu to expect this game to be as big a hit as Outlast."

"It's definitely going to make money. From its appearance, Overcooked's development cost shouldn't be high, so at worst, it'll just make a little less profit."

"But compared to Outlast, Overcooked's art style, following the Q-style cute cartoon route, has a much broader audience."

"By the way, have you noticed that Chen Xu's Nebula Games platform is running a buy-one-get-one-free event?"

"Normal. For the dual festivals of Spring Festival and Valentine's Day, you always have to prepare some benefits for players. And who in the game development business doesn't want to gather a loyal fanbase on their own game platform?"

"Exactly. Plus, Overcooked is a cooperative game. If sold individually, some players might hesitate, but this buy-one-get-one-free model might actually encourage many interested but undecided players to commit."

………………

Chen Xu's new game was widely discussed by both the industry and players.

Ordinary players were simply concerned with the game's performance.

For the industry, the analysis was more focused on the market aspect.

Including Nebula Games platform's buy-one-get-one-free promotion, which was also discussed by some industry designers.

But, just as Chen Xu expected, not many people paid too much attention.

After all, it comes back to that saying: who in the game business doesn't want to build up their own platform?

Listing on other game platforms would mean a significant cut.

As for Overcooked, many designers in the industry shared the same attitude.

They believed the game could make some money, but achieving a significant impact was probably a long shot.

Chen Xu, however, was unaffected by this.

How the game would truly perform remained to be seen after its release.

As time progressed day by day.

And on February 14th, the third day of the Lunar New Year, Chen Xu logged onto his official Weibo account and updated it with a new message.

'Overcooked launches today! This is a harmonious and loving multiplayer game where you and your chef partners must complete various delicious orders before your customers explode! Now, get your knives and chef uniforms ready and begin! No mistakes are tolerated in this crazy kitchen!'

Thanks to 'D's 18th Power' for a 1500 reward.
