Chapter 173: Next Time, For Sure! (8th update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)

The entire gameplay Expo, just like last year, lasted for four days.

Compared to last year, which saw a bit of a clash of titans with TengHua and NetDragon both showcasing their latest VR blockbusters, this year was different.

At this year's gameplay Expo, the only blockbuster that players were relatively anticipating was the announcement regarding 'Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame'.

But this was not the most talked-about event.

What surprised many game developers and game media was that this year's expo somewhat resembled last year's.

Last year, TengHua and NetDragon's two VR blockbusters should have arguably been the most dazzling stars of the expo.

However, Nebula Games' 'Fall Guys' and 'Sanguosha' ended up stealing the spotlight.

At this year's expo, it was almost universally assumed that the news of Nebula Games' new 'Dark Souls' title would be the biggest highlight on the first day.

But to everyone's surprise, Nebula Games only brought a promotional trailer for 'Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame' to this year's expo.

What truly captured all players' attention at the expo was a simple Big Hammer Game.

Although playing this game oneself would send blood pressure soaring, watching others play it was an entirely different experience.

Especially since the game had already launched on the Nebula Games Platform on the very day of the expo.

Within just a few days, thanks to its performance at the expo and some media reports, this game, which wasn't even promoted and was free, immediately became a central topic across major live streaming and video platforms.

It wasn't that this game truly had as many people playing it as 'Fall Guys' did back then.

Rather, it simply meant the game's popularity exploded.

On live streaming platforms, almost by the second day of the expo, this simple little game called 'Hammer Swing Ascension' quickly became a sensation.

Initially, it was mainly fans of various streamers who flooded the screens, asking their favorite streamers to download and play it.

This sparked curiosity among many streamers.

Then, they instantly understood their viewers' true intentions.

And once a game had several streamers playing it on live streaming platforms, naturally, even more streamers would join in.

For a time, the entire live streaming platform was filled with the wails and screams of various streamers.

Clicking into any live stream room where the game was being played, one could witness a kaleidoscope of human experiences.

“Friends, everyone says this Big Hammer Game is very difficult, but today I'm going to tell you that nothing is impossible for a willing heart. As long as we persevere, we will definitely achieve something.”

“What? You say it's impossible for me to clear it?”

“Impossible, don't worry, I'll definitely clear it.”

A streamer, playing the game in his live stream room, said very seriously.

“What’s most important when playing with the hammer? It’s about grasping the right amount of force. As the saying goes, ‘big hammer eighty, small hammer forty,’ and that doesn't just refer to the hammer itself, but also the force applied when using it.”

“So, you can't rush this game. See? Didn't I just effortlessly climb the mountain?”

“You can't rush it at all. The purpose of this game is to break the player's mentality. If a player's mentality collapses, then they definitely won't be able to clear the game.”

“So, we need to maintain a good mindset.”

“Friends, watch this move carefully, don't rush, hook it, use force! Ah!!!!”

“It's okay... it's okay, don't rush, maintain your mindset, you must play games with a smile.”

“Isn't it normal to make mistakes once or twice? Can't we just climb again?”

“Remember my words, you must have a good mindset when playing games, and you must play with a smile.”

“Hehe, hook it! Go... Ah~~~~~~~ I’m playing my *ass* off!!!!”

Along with a powerless rage, the sound of table-banging, like slapping cucumbers, echoed.

Besides the game streamers who insisted on suffering, many ordinary players were also attracted to download and try the game.

After all, with streamers in all the major live stream rooms playing it, many players developed an interest.

Moreover, this type of game actually looked very simple. Was it really that hard to play with just the right hand?

Isn't it just a Big Hammer Game?

I'll give it a try!

This was a common thought among most players, believing they were definitely better than streamers, and that many streamers were likely just feigning clumsiness for entertainment effect; in reality, the game couldn't be that difficult.

Furthermore, since the game was free, there were no worries; at worst, it would just be another free game added to their collection, no refunds necessary.

So, even knowing it might be a game that tested one's patience, players still poured into it ceaselessly.

However, after these players downloaded the game to their computers.

After experiencing it for about ten minutes, accompanied by its perfectly fitting BGM.

Almost 90% of players left only one comment: “I’m playing my *fucking geoduck*! Get out of my computer!”

Then furiously uninstalled the game.

Many players gave it the lowest possible negative reviews.

And the content of the reviews was very simple.

For example, 'I'm a fool!' and various strings of '**********' highlighted the heartfelt emotions of the players as they left their reviews.

Of course, some players also intentionally left five-star positive reviews, hoping to trick more people.

“This game is so much fun! I’ve been playing it while “howling,” and now my blood pressure is very low, and my mood is very stable. But I have a request for everyone: I am extremely grateful to Chen Xu; this game has brought me the joy of my childhood, so I'd like to ask where Chen Xu’s home is? I wish to visit him and express my thanks!!”

“A very simple and fun game that brought me a lot of joy. I truly hope more people can experience this happiness.”

“Very useful! My son used to love playing games and hated studying. I downloaded 'Hammer Swing Ascension' for him and told him that every time he fell, he had to do one problem. Now, he's been admitted to Tsinghua and Peking University!”

“Thanks to Chen Xu, I've always wanted to replace my mouse but couldn't bring myself to do it. Now, this game has finally made me successfully replace my mouse! I won't say more, I need to lay my old mouse to rest.”

Chen Xu, in the Nebula Games office, was thoroughly amused by all sorts of interesting comments.

Although it was released for free and didn't count towards system points.

This didn't matter much, as even if this type of game were free, not many players would actually play it, let alone position it as a buy-to-play game.

For Chen Xu, the goal was already achieved if players could experience the fun this game brought.

Moreover, it wasn't without benefits; at the very least, driven by the game's popularity, the Nebula Games Platform also attracted a significant wave of traffic.

It's just that players' misunderstandings of him were growing deeper!

Looking at the online discussions where players had once again dug up the report on Game Timespace's exclusive interview with Chen Xu after 'It Takes Two' launched, Chen Xu sighed with emotion.

In the report, some keywords were prominently highlighted, such as: heartwarming, fostering love for players.

Then, players quietly juxtaposed game screenshots of 'Silent Hill PT' and 'Hammer Swing Ascension'.

Countless players in the comments section all grumbled, 'Is this Chen Xu's love for players?'

Chen Xu also sighed with emotion, watching the various topics and complaints from online players.

He then quietly opened his official Weibo account and sent a long post.

“Actually, 'Hammer Swing Ascension' isn't simply a game that shatters one's mentality.”

“Indeed, its design is overly malicious, but it's not impossible to clear. While some players might have their mentality shattered and abandon the game, there will also be players who, after enduring hardship and tears, once again swing their hammer and start over.”

“Think about it carefully, isn't this just like life itself? When we swing the hammer in our hands, it's like making a decision in our lives; there's no room for regret, only lessons learned, and we can only keep moving forward on an unknown path.”

“In this process, we might experience failure, suffer setbacks, or even see all our previous efforts go to waste.”

“But just like in the game, we have no save points. Even if we fall from a great height and are battered and bruised, all we can do is dust ourselves off and climb again.”

“How are the characters in the game any different from us in real life?”

“So now, are you willing to try again? To overcome those difficulties, whether in reality or in the game?”

Countless players were stunned, looking at the official Weibo post Chen Xu had made.

So, this game was actually a game with a lot of philosophical depth?

Although it sounded quite reasonable, countless players collectively declared, 'We've fallen for your trickery, Chen Xu!'

Especially that last line, 'Are you willing to try?'

Did that even need an answer?

Countless players, looking at Chen Xu's official Weibo post, silently typed four characters into the comments section.

‘Next Time, For Sure!’

Alright, that’s all for today, continuing tomorrow.
