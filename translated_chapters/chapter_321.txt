Chapter 320: Rich and Reckless! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Inside Nebula Games' office, Chen Xu was still discussing a detailed development issue for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare with everyone.

Chen Xu hadn't yet elaborated on the overall framework. But when it came to details, a lot could still be done. Especially the decision to render a map with a large amount of resources, to give players a cinematic experience. What was pursued, naturally, was an ultimate visual effect. For competitive multiplayer modes, this visual effect might not be what most players seek. However, in single-player campaigns, an ultimate visual effect would definitely allow players to immerse themselves more deeply in the story. There was no doubt about this.

“Regarding the physics engine, the development prototype from the Game Department hasn't been delivered yet, but I've already gained some understanding of the relevant data.”

“Although it's already very powerful compared to current VR performance, there are still many detailed areas that require our manual intervention.”

“The shattered glass and walls of houses, all need to have a special effect created.”

As Chen Xu continued his explanations, everyone present was astonished. So many detailed elements! “But Mr. Chen, with the parameters of the new VR equipment, such complex and massive scenes might be difficult to achieve, right?” Qin Yi voiced his question. It wasn't that they couldn't do it, but rather that current equipment standards would struggle to handle it.

“We'll utilize all the capabilities of the VR equipment on a single level,” Chen Xu said.

“But in that case, the sense of discontinuity in the game would be quite severe, requiring players to endure a period of loading,” Qin Yi continued.

“Play a CG,” Chen Xu glanced at Qin Yi and said simply and concisely.

Hearing Chen Xu's words, Qin Yi also reacted. Good heavens, what a simple and crude method! How to make players unaware of loading, ensuring a silky-smooth experience? The answer was simple: turn the loading screen into a CG playback screen, and ensure the CG playback was longer than the loading time. This could be said to be a very simple and crude method. But very few game developers would do it. As for the reason? Because it didn't significantly improve the overall game quality. And it was expensive! But for Chen Xu, he clearly understood the value of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. CG animation? Just a small matter, rich and reckless! And compared to Warcraft, an RTS game that wasn't easy to add subsequent revenue points to, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, as an FPS game, could still incorporate many pay-to-win elements, just like Rainbow Six Siege. What remained was the firearm sound effects, which were also artificially created. For example, sounds like missiles were recorded using snowmobiles, then mixed and mastered. Real sound effects are very different from what players imagine. Just like war games, if the game depicted brutal scenes like a documentary, most players might not be interested. After all, many players only want what they imagine, not reality. Just like catgirls, players want the cute, adorable anime-style ones, like chocolate, vanilla, red bean, or coconut, not those from grotesque stories. As for the shooting feel and actions of firearms in VR, Nebula Games originally had no experience in this area, but now Chen Xu could only say: NetDragon, thank you.

After confirming some development details for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare with the team, Chen Xu returned to his office to refine some subsequent game content. In Chen Xu's view, the gameplay of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was already quite mature. Moreover, compared to other FPS games currently on the market, many designs in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare were actually quite advanced. As for comparing it to Rainbow Six Siege, which had just launched, they were completely different types of games, and their player bases were also distinct. Firstly, the 'breathing to heal' mechanic was not originally pioneered by the Call of Duty series. The shield design in Halo was the embryonic form of 'breathing to heal,' but it was indeed popularized by Call of Duty. The greatest benefit of this setting was that it kept players' attention and focus on combat. After taking damage, depending on the severity of the injury, the screen would turn blood-red and black-and-white, but as long as they didn't die immediately, after a few seconds out of combat and not taking damage, they could recover health by taking deep breaths. This allowed players to immerse themselves more deeply in the game experience and also made the game's pace very fast. In typical FPS games, if a player was injured, the most likely action was to look for health packs. This would create a sense of discontinuity in the player's experience, as the tension and tight combat of the story and level design would be directly fragmented. But with 'breathing to heal,' players could remain fully engaged in combat throughout. Additionally, there were settings in multiplayer, such as various firearm modifications, including infrared, night vision, and other attachments. And Call of Duty's unique killstreak reward system, where players could use high-tech items after achieving killstreaks. Such as UAV drones that could detect other players' positions and essentially enable 'wallhacks,' targeted bombing via pagers, calling in supply drops from the air, RPGs, flamethrowers, and so on. In his previous life, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare became popular not only because most games at the time were still rooted in World War I and II settings, and the game's own story was excellent. The wide array of modern weapons was also a reason for its appeal to players. If the story propelled Modern Warfare to its peak, then the multiplayer mode was the capital that made it an annual Call of Duty title. High-intensity, fast-paced combat – this was the core philosophy of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Of course, some specific maps that led to everyone camping, searching for ages only to be blown up by a landmine, were exceptions.

………………

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare quickly entered an intensive development phase, and as a VR game, its main difference from his previous life's version was the sense of immersion. Chen Xu also needed to personally debug the force feedback systems in the VR gaming pods. The VR feedback from firearm shooting, being hit by bullets, being caught in explosions, as well as climbing and jumping, etc., all had corresponding feedback. At the same time, the details were also meticulously captured. The physical feedback during explosions and shooting, and the depiction of environmental destruction, were all extremely important. Chen Xu's sole goal was for players, when playing the game, to truly become characters like Soap and Roach, experiencing the story of Task Force 141. Although the tasks were complex, the entire team had experience developing content for Rainbow Six Siege, so they possessed considerable relevant expertise. Chen Xu had also communicated with NetDragon. They would provide some technical support, and naturally, in exchange, Chen Xu would also provide some technical support later, for example, in the area of AI technology.

“There’s no need to deliberately rush the progress on this; let NetDragon’s people do more of the work, and you should learn more from our Technology Department here.” Inside the office, Chen Xu called Qin Yi in to assign tasks. Qin Yi smiled and said, “Mr. Chen, I understand.” Hearing this, Chen Xu also nodded with a smile.
