Chapter 305: Negotiations Break Down, Prepare for Assault! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Under the setting sun, in a cemetery filled with tombstones, a middle-aged man rose from an unmarked grave.

"I never thought it would happen so fast. A gunman, a single bullet, straight to the head."

He stood up and walked forward.

"This... I planted a breaching charge, and a life was just gone."

"It was me... I made a mistake only a rookie would make."

The camera cut closer, and only then did players realize the photo on the tombstone was of the man himself.

"They hid a trap by the window; remember to double-check before entering!"

The camera zoomed in, and the person on the tombstone was still him.

"Use your rope well. Don't think you're a superman; falling from the second floor... sometimes it's just that sudden!"

"Foolish, still foolish... always foolish."

The middle-aged man took a deep breath and continued walking forward.

All the tombstones along the way bore his photo.

At this point, viewers of the video suddenly understood.

Clearly, this wasn't some convoluted story about reincarnation.

Instead, it symbolized the man's actions as a player in the game.

"A gunman was ambushed there; by the time I noticed him... it was too late!"

"Killed by a knife from behind, a vertical breaching charge... this one, I stepped directly on a Claymore when rushing out of the building. Being bold is good, but don't be greedy."

"I remember every cause of my death, every foolish mistake I made, and every misjudgment of the situation!"

"But I guarantee, today, it will absolutely not be me who falls in battle!"

As his words faded, the camera zoomed in on the man's face, and the screen plunged into darkness the next moment.

Only his narration remained.

"Are you ready? Initiate the meticulous assault plan."

The next moment, the scene switched to the interior of a bank. In the center of the lobby, a group of hostages were bound and gagged, their faces filled with panic. Simultaneously, in an office on the first floor, a group of terrorist personnel were planting a bomb.

Beside them, countless other White Masks were sealing off critical passages with roll-down wooden panels.

Some White Mask terrorists held shields, guarding various key routes.

Meanwhile, the camera moved outside.

Elite special forces personnel from various countries stood ready for battle—the Rainbow Team.

"Yes, it's them again."

"We cannot let the bomb explode!"

"But they refuse to negotiate!"

"The safety of all hostages rests solely with you all!"

A middle-aged officer looked at the fully armed Rainbow Team, took a deep breath, closed his eyes, then opened them and said with a resolute tone: "Now..."

"Negotiations have broken down, prepare for assault!"

As his words fell,

The assault officially began.

All squad members had been standing by in their respective areas, ready for action.

In the distance, Glaz was already in position, his sniper rifle set up, calmly covering all possible terrorist locations.

Meanwhile, operators like Ying, Blitz, Montagne, Thermite, Ash, and Pulse split into two groups and assembled.

One group launched an attack from the first floor, while the other ascended to the bank's roof via ropes, preparing to assault simultaneously with the first floor team.

At this moment, the screen switched back to the initial location, where two drones had slipped through the door crack into the bank, transmitting internal information.

A notification sound came through all squad members' voice comms.

"One terrorist at the main bank entrance counter, two terrorists to the left of the entrance, hostages have been moved to the second floor."

Facing the tightly sealed bank door, everyone exchanged glances. The next moment, Thermite stepped forward.

Then the scene moved indoors.

On the steel bank door, a crimson spark appeared, and this trail of sparks moved with remarkable regularity.

It was as if someone was cutting open the door with a welding torch, only much faster.

Before the White Mask terrorists could fully comprehend what was happening, an astonishing boom erupted the next moment.

"Boom!"

A cloud of black smoke rose, and then flashbang-like fragments shot through the smoke, landing in the center of the lobby, emitting an intense light.

Instantly, everyone was plunged into temporary deafness and blindness. At this moment, all the White Mask terrorists frantically fired their weapons towards where they remembered the bank entrance to be.

"Clang, clang, clang, clang..." A series of metallic impacts. As the smoke cleared, Montagne was seen leading the charge with his Greatshield, all bullets striking the shield without causing any effective damage.

Ying, Thermite, and Ash, who followed him in, seized the opportunity to pick off the White Masks in the lobby one by one.

Meanwhile, the scene instantly switched to the second floor.

Via rope, Blackbeard, wearing sunglasses and a beard, coolly attached a bulletproof shield to his weapon and slowly descended to a window on the second floor that was sealed with wooden planks.

On the roof, Pulse looked at the Heartbeat Sensor in his hand, which showed two red dots.

He took out a Remote Charge, placed it above, then retreated to the side.

The next moment, the bomb detonated with a boom, blowing a hole in the roof. The instant the explosion occurred, Blackbeard burst through the window, his MK17 CQB, equipped with a bulletproof shield, quickly eliminating the two distracted White Masks.

Simultaneously, Pulse and Blitz, who had jumped down from the roof, quickly secured the second floor.

The first and second floors were completely cleared, and the bomb had been defused. All that remained was the hostage room.

The two squads converged. Facing the wooden door sealing the hostage room, Ash took out her grenade launcher and fired a breaching round at the planks.

After about a one-second delay, there was a loud boom.

The breaching round exploded, and smoke filled the air.

At this moment, Blitz, shield in hand, was the first to rush in, pressing the charge button on his shield with a slight force.

Sizzle... *snap!*

A flash of white light erupted from the shield, illuminating the entire room as if it were daytime.

The sudden blinding flash caused the White Masks guarding the hostages to scream and fall into temporary blindness, their weapons instinctively firing wildly in the direction of the squad.

However, countless bullets were all blocked by the shield, though as bullets struck Blitz's shield,

Cracks clearly appeared on the bulletproof glass visor.

Despite this, Blitz remained unfazed. Seizing the moment, he raised his right hand.

The P12 Pistol, a product of precise German engineering, fired each bullet accurately through the heads of the White Mask terrorists.

Seeing the still-shaken hostages, Ash and Ying stepped forward to free them.

The next moment, the camera panned across the face of each squad member.

Finally, the screen gradually faded to black.

Ying's voice echoed in the comms channel.

"Assault complete."

The game title appeared in the center.
