Chapter 368: Don't Come Looking For Me, I'm Afraid Nebula Games Will Misunderstand (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

After staying at the temporary camp for a few days and confirming the train's arrival time, Dutch prepared to take the gang members to scout ahead.

However, Hosea, the gang's strategist, had a different opinion.

According to the robbery information left by the O'Driscoll gang, the owner of this train was no unknown figure.

It was a big capitalist named Cornwall.

"Why are we doing this?"

"The weather's good, we can set off."

"I thought we were supposed to keep a low profile."

Looking at Hosea, Dutch replied while preparing the horses: "What do you want me to do, Hosea?"

"I just don't want any more people to die, Dutch," Hosea said.

"We're not dead, Hosea, we're not dead... Look at me, I'm not dead, and neither are you, but we need money. All our things are in Blackwater. Do you want to go back there?" Dutch patted Hosea's shoulder, then sighed, pointing in the direction of Blackwater.

Hearing Dutch's words, Hosea fell silent and shook his head.

"But... listen, Dutch, I'm not trying to undermine you, I just... I just want to stick to the plan... which is to keep a low profile and head back West."

"But now we're going to rob a train. Cornwall is not someone to mess with; he's a successful railroad magnate, a sugar merchant, an oil baron."

"Sounds like he has a lot to share," Dutch nodded noncommittally.

Clearly, Hosea in the camp didn't think robbing the train was a good idea.

Especially since the train belonged to a major capitalist.

However, Dutch dismissed these concerns, stating their current predicament was dire.

Because they indeed needed money, after a brief discussion, Dutch still took Arthur and the other gang members to the valley where the intelligence point was located.

They scouted ahead, put on their masks, set up the detonator traps, and waited for the train.

Evidently, this wasn't the Van der Linde gang's first train robbery; everyone's roles were clearly defined, each performing their duties.

However, plans often go awry. Dutch's original plan was for them to use detonators to blow up the tracks before the train arrived, forcing it to stop, and then they could take whatever they wanted from it.

But when the train arrived, an accident occurred: the detonator malfunctioned.

Left with no choice, everyone jumped directly onto the train from the top of the bridge arch.

"Oh my god, this is insane!"

In VR mode, especially jumping from the bridge arch onto the train, the camera made Old Dai's legs feel a bit weak.

The train robbery went very smoothly. Arthur and his companions found many bonds inside the train.

These were bearer bonds, highly sought after in the black market, and could be sold at any time.

Dutch was quite satisfied with this haul. After staying at the temporary camp in the snowy mountains for a while, once the weather warmed up and the snow began to melt, Dutch immediately ordered everyone to pack their bags and start moving southeast.

At the same time, following Hosea's suggestion, their destination this time was a place called Horseshoe Overlook, next to a livestock town named Valentine.

The climate along the way grew warmer, and there were no pursuers from Blackwater, making everyone in the gang feel much more relaxed.

Driving the wagon along the road, with the melody of the background music 'See The Fire In Your Eyes' echoing in his ears, Old Dai himself felt much more at ease, just like his companions in the Van der Linde gang.

In the woods of Horseshoe Overlook, everyone found an open clearing with a wide view to set up camp.

Here, they could take a breather for a while and also accumulate more money to get through the difficult times.

"We're here. Just save up a little more money, and we can leave."

"Go West, buy some land!"

After robbing the train and arriving at the new location, Dutch's eyes lit up, and he began to vigorously rally the gang members to start earning money.

He also stated that he had a subsequent plan.

Save money, then leave this place, and everyone would go West to buy land and retire to farm.

Seeing Dutch's renewed vigor, Arthur in the camp was also very happy, pulling out his diary to start writing.

At this point, the game officially entered a free exploration mode.

Players could roam freely across the vast map without restraint.

After arriving in Valentine, a whole new world unfolded before Old Dai.

If the content in the snowy mountains hadn't particularly impressed Old Dai before,

then arriving in this small town gave him a profound sense of shock.

Wooden buildings, muddy streets after the rain, pedestrians, horses, and carriages on the main street, and saloons with wooden swing doors.

There were also cowboys drinking in the saloons, as well as a post office and a train station.

Newsboys sold newspapers on the street, and after buying one, he could even see news about their recent train robbery.

Looking at everything around him, combined with his previous gaming experience, Old Dai was instantly captivated.

At this moment, he had already forgotten the feelings that Beautiful World had given him before.

Now, what Red Dead Redemption presented was the Western world he had always imagined.

The main and side quests in the Valentine area were very spread out.

The design philosophy was primarily to allow players to understand the worldview and familiarize themselves with the game's open-world gameplay.

As a player, Old Dai was clearly unaware of the clever design of these mechanisms and quests.

He only had one feeling: this game was absolutely amazing!

Moreover, the playable content was explosively abundant. From two in the afternoon to six in the evening, he had only managed to complete the prologue, and he hadn't even had much time to explore the livestock town of Valentine.

Old Dai exited the game and prepared to order some takeout. However, before ordering, he first opened the chat group.

At this time, many people in the chat group were talking.

The topics, naturally, were Red Dead Redemption and Beautiful World.

Then, Old Dai spoke in the group:

"Highly recommend Red Dead Redemption, it's absolutely stunning!"

Along with Old Dai's words, a group of people immediately erupted.

"Same here, I watched the live stream, this is the Western world I imagined!"

"+1, it's so shocking, the game details are absolutely maxed out."

"And the Dead Eye system, it's so cool when you draw your gun for a duel on the street!"

A group of people in the chat group were discussing the content of Red Dead Redemption.

Although not everyone had started playing it immediately, game live streams existed after all.

So, basically, many players currently following this game already had a preliminary impression of it.

At the same time, some people in the chat group were teasing Old Dai.

"By the way, Old Dai, didn't you say before that Red Dead Redemption might not be able to surpass Beautiful World?"

Many others also joined in the fun, but Old Dai wasn't angry; he just sent a message.

"'Beautiful World'? What game is that? Tell it not to come looking for me, I'm afraid Nebula Games might misunderstand."

After sending it, Old Dai started ordering takeout.
