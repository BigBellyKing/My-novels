Chapter 803: This Damnable Resentment

Chapter 803: This Damnable Resentment

In his previous life, the most famous MODs for *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim* were arguably these 'laboratory MODs'.

Chen Xu himself didn't have much thought about such MODs. After all, it's well-known that men are divided into two types: lewd people and old lewd people.

The difference from his previous life was that the development tools for *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim* were officially provided. Therefore, Chen Xu had imposed some restrictions to ensure that no content that crossed the line would appear.

But clearly, players had a strong interest in creating such things, and the players under this particular post showed unprecedented unity. It was like the difference between a regular forum and an old lewd person's forum.

Regular forums would be filled with insults, drama, and factions. They might even argue for half a day over whether savory tofu pudding or sweet tofu pudding was better, with spicy tofu pudding eventually joining in with a wild brawl. But in an old lewd person's forum, such drama was almost completely absent. There, you would see the most beautiful side of humanity, uniformly filled with blessings like, 'Thank you, OP,' and 'May good people live a long and peaceful life.'

It fully demonstrated the meaning of 'my body is in hell, but my heart yearns for light.'

Chen Xu gently shook his head, sighed, and then clicked in to check the latest progress. Hmm... pretty good.

After casting a critical glance at it for a moment, Chen Xu gave instructions to the team responsible for the MOD community. When it came to elements involving official content, Nebula Games couldn't pretend not to see it, but as for what players did privately, they could just turn a blind eye.

Nebula Games had encountered such situations before, the only difference being that the platform had become VR.

Many game developers, both domestic and international, maintained a similar attitude towards MOD content. If it didn't involve their interests, they'd just pretend not to see it.

And in reality, there weren't as many players interested in MODs like 'Skyrim of Love' as imagined; most were just joining in for fun or curiosity. Especially since installing such MODs was relatively troublesome, many players didn't even know how to install them. It was nowhere near as simple as an official MOD store, which was almost idiot-proof with just a subscription.

Therefore, most players predominantly used MODs that adjusted action animations using the skeleton system, and companion MODs that replaced models.

………………

Song Ren was currently exploring *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim*.

However, unlike the original Skyrim province, Yang Xin's version of Skyrim province now had a drastically different art style.

“This Homura MOD is really well-made!”

“Skyrim Province Nebula Girl Group Debuts!”

In the game, Song Ren, controlling the Dragonborn, happily exclaimed. In front of him stood a line of companions:

Ciri, Yennefer, Sylvanas, Pyra/Mythra, Elizabeth, Fire Keeper, Emma… all popular female protagonists from Nebula Games.

With a chuckle, Song Ren gave a command in the game and simultaneously opened a music software to play backing music.

The next moment, the companions in the game began to perform a hot dance in the area.

Compared to various quest MODs, terrain MODs, and functional MODs, simple model replacements were much easier. Combined with *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim*'s skeleton system, it was even possible to specifically design corresponding actions.

As a result, many players who experimented with MODs found that the art style of Skyrim province had gone a little off track. Where was the original *The Elder Scrolls*? It had directly become *Maiden Scrolls*!

Many people jokingly remarked that ever since these MODs appeared, their bodies felt weaker and weaker.

But despite the teasing and complaints, many players, after experiencing the grand and epic storyline of *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim* itself, still installed various MODs. After all, who doesn't love cute girls?

And as more and more MOD authors got involved, some large-scale quest MODs, along with terrain and gameplay-related functional MODs, also gradually emerged. However, the majority were still these companion and model MODs, simply because they were pleasing to the eye.

After all, the fun for most players was to genuinely play a game within an 'old lewd person's game.' And in a 'genuine game,' to act like an old lewd person.

Intentionally crouching in the game and tilting the camera upwards—this might not be absolute, but most players have probably done something like that.

………………

With *Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna ~ The Golden Country* DLC, plus *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim* and MOD-related content development, Nebula Games' core first-tier team has temporarily entered a resting phase.

Of course, several of its studios still have a lot to do, such as the operation and updates of multiplayer online games like *DOTA*, and some experimental small to medium-sized games.

But for Chen Xu currently, life was quite leisurely.

On the large screen in the lounge, Chen Xu watched the *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim* gameplay footage being played, feeling a bit speechless.

“Which genius created this MOD?”

Good heavens, this was a runway show for Nebula Games' male and female protagonists.

Arthur Morgan and Mary, Link and Mipha, Ezio and Cristina, Lara and Makoto, Chen Qingsui and Lin Lixun…

All were couples from Nebula Games who, for various reasons, ultimately couldn't find happiness together.

“Mr. Chen, do you feel the players' resentment? This is the Couple's Resentment Edition. Later, there will be the Close Friend's Resentment Edition, led by *Call of Duty*, and the Family Resentment Edition, led by *Resident Evil*.”

As Chen Xu watched, Yang Xin's voice rang out beside him. She stood there holding a cup of milk tea.

“Hmm, compared to this damnable resentment, I think if I release a half-finished game and declare it a 'once-in-a-lifetime' series, that would stir up even more resentment from players.” Chen Xu thought of something and couldn't help but smile.

Yang Xin, biting her straw, was utterly stunned: “Mr. Chen, are those the words of a human being!?”

“What? Am I not allowed to feel wronged and make a slight resistance?” Chen Xu said with a hearty laugh.

“Mr. Chen, that's not resistance, you're looking for trouble!” Ruan Ningxue, who had arrived at some unknown moment, interjected.

“Exactly, exactly!” Yang Xin nodded. How could this person always test the waters on the verge of courting death?

“It's not a big deal, players should be used to it by now, and besides, I'm just talking,” Chen Xu chuckled.

“Mr. Chen, you must be plotting something wicked!” Ruan Ningxue expressed her disbelief.

“I wasn't before, but seeing this Resentment Collection MOD, I certainly am now,” Chen Xu said.

“New project!?” Hearing Chen Xu's words, Yang Xin was momentarily stunned. Was he actually serious!?

“Mr. Chen, what is it? You're not really planning to mess with the players again, are you?” Ruan Ningxue had a very bad premonition.

“What do you mean 'mess with the players'? I'm a designer who loves players; I never do such things. Haven't players always cursed and bought at the same time? What does that mean? It means players actually have a tsundere attribute.”

“As for a new project, didn't we embed a lot of easter eggs in *World of Warcraft* back then? For example, Link, Mario, Ezio, Arthur Morgan, Geralt, these characters all made cameo appearances in Azeroth.”

“The new game, actually, already made a cameo appearance as a character in Azeroth.”

Chen Xu, sitting there, smiled slightly.

“Made a cameo appearance as a character in the game!?” Yang Xin's eyes widened in shock. She wasn't happy about the news, but rather because the news was as good as saying nothing at all!

Azeroth was so vast, with corresponding cities for every race. Coupled with the easter egg content, this whole part was personally handled by Chen Xu back then. Now, without specifying whether it was an Alliance or Horde city, even Detective Geralt wouldn't be able to find it!

Watching Chen Xu get up and leave, Yang Xin sat in her seat, bewildered. At this point, Meng Zuo, Qin Yi, and others who had noticed the commotion earlier also gathered around.

“Sister Xin, what were you just talking about with Mr. Chen!?”

“Yeah, you look so surprised, is it some big news?”

“I think I heard *World of Warcraft*. Are we going back to be responsible for *World of Warcraft*'s future versions? But the Warcraft Dev Team is doing quite well.”

Yang Xin gently shook her head: “No, Mr. Chen told me about a new project.”

New project!? Hearing this, everyone instantly became even more excited.

“What new project? A sequel to *God of War*? Kratos finally gets a hammer to play with?!”

“A sequel to *Resident Evil Village*, revealing the mystery of Ethan's life and death?”

Looking at everyone's curious faces, Yang Xin pursed her lips and showed a polite smile.

“Want to know the secret of the new game?”

“If you want to know, go find it! Mr. Chen has put all the secrets in Azeroth!”

Everyone: ???????
