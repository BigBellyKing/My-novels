# Chapter 21: Rave Reviews

The next day, Chen Xu arrived at the company at 7:30 AM, but to his surprise, Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue had already arrived ahead of him.

Seeing Chen Xu push the door open and enter, the two rushed excitedly towards him.

"It's blown up! It's blown up! Mr. Chen, the reputation has exploded!" Yang Xin exclaimed, holding a laptop in her hands, her face full of excitement.

On the screen, the rating from the official app store was displayed.

9.9 points, an incredibly high score.

And not only that, but two media outlets had already published their game reviews for *Undertale* on its second day of launch.

The most shocking part was that both media outlets had given it a perfect score of 10!

Even a review website named Game Timespace lauded it to the skies.

In their review, they avoided spoilers, instead building suspense throughout with a Riddler-like approach.

Yet, the review article cited many exaggerated descriptions.

For example, after completing *Undertale*, the editor remained silent for a long time.

It was a game that broke the constraints of traditional RPGs.

It subverted players' understanding of RPG games, showing that a game could be so profound.

Despite being a small-budget independent game, it offered a more breathtaking experience than AAA masterpieces.

Similar reviews also appeared in the comment section for *Undertale*.

It was filled with many bewildering comments.

For example, 'An incredible RPG, my spine was still tingling when it ended!' 'Crush your mercy, and mine too!' 'It fills you with determination!'

"Sales are pretty good, but we'll let it ferment for a bit," Chen Xu said, taking the laptop and checking the backend sales data, a smile gracing his face.

2,749 copies, not a particularly high figure.

This was normal; despite the previous hype with Zhong Mei, it had only really made more players aware of the name *Undertale*.

To many players, Nebula Games and Chen Xu were very unfamiliar.

Their only notable release was a gentleman's game.

Chen Xu had priced *Undertale* at 36 Yuan, just like in his previous life.

As an indie game, it wasn't expensive, and the Parallel World's socio-economic conditions were much better than his previous life's, otherwise, the gaming industry wouldn't be so prosperous.

From 7 PM to 11 PM, this was considered a golden time slot.

The Game Timespace review itself had already allowed the game's popularity to ferment, and this period was also when players were free, perfect for experiencing the game.

Before 7 PM, *Undertale*'s sales growth was roughly around 500 copies per hour.

But after 7 PM, this number more than doubled, reaching approximately 1200.

At the same time, the total sales successfully surpassed 14,000 copies.

And game reviews also gradually began to increase.

It was worth noting that only a day and a half had passed since *Undertale* officially launched on the game platform.

In the hotpot restaurant private room where they had previously dined at MixC, Yang Xin, celebrating that evening, grew even more excited as she listened to the figures Chen Xu announced.

Although *Mirror (Game)* had achieved astonishing sales, she hadn't been involved in its production at the time, merely watching from the sidelines.

However, she had participated in the entire production of *Undertale*.

Even though the process felt like "so easy even a dog could win," she had, in any case, handled most of the story content within the game.

This gave her a sense of accomplishment.

"I wonder what the final sales will be!" Ruan Ningxue took a sip of juice, equally excited.

"I feel like it might break a million!" Yang Xin said excitedly.

"Judging by the current trend of reviews, a million is only a matter of time," Chen Xu said, smiling and nodding in affirmation.

………………

Unlike Chen Xu, who was confident, players who had been following *Undertale*, as well as some designers in the industry, went crazy seeing the game's reviews.

What was going on?

Within the Hapai Culture & Sports media, Zhong Mei's eyes were wide, with no intention of leaving work.

Had Nebula Games bribed them? How much money did they have to pay?

Buying positive reviews, buying media praise, he had done such things before, but *Undertale* was going too far, wasn't it?!

This was his first thought, and also the first thought of everyone else who saw *Undertale*'s achievements.

No one believed that *Undertale*'s true quality warranted such reviews.

After all, it was just a small-budget independent game.

And a score like that could unequivocally be called a standard masterpiece.

Did a small-budget game like *Undertale* truly deserve it?

However, this also piqued the curiosity of many players: exactly what kind of game was *Undertale*?

And once these players became curious, they would in turn become part of the countless positive reviews, further fueling the fire.

The most direct manifestation of this was the game data Chen Xu had been constantly monitoring.

Every hour, upon refreshing, there would be a significant increase.

Of course, even more crucial were the game's reviews.

They were almost uniformly positive; the game's overall score remained at 9.9 and hadn't dropped despite the increase in sales.

It's important to remember that a game's rating generally tends to decrease as more and more players get involved.

Typically, reaching 8.5 points is considered the baseline for excellence.

Reaching 9 points is already a premium game, and 9.5 points or above can be called a masterpiece.

But even with *Undertale*'s skyrocketing sales, the player rating remained remarkably stable.

While it was certain that this score would eventually decline as more players joined in, it was still quite astonishing.

And below the store, player reviews further expressed their opinions on the game.

"I thought it was just a regular RPG monster-slaying game, but I have to say, Flowey's appearance and the ending really shocked me!"

"Initially, I was curious about Nebula Games and Chen Xu because of *Mirror (Game)*, but I have to say *Undertale* showed me what a game truly is! Seriously, it subverted my perception of RPGs!"

"I can only describe it as incredible!"

"Do NOT hurt the monsters in the game, or you'll regret it! Trust me!"

"The wind howls, and before you stands a true hero!"

"It's a phenomenal feeling! I have a premonition that *Undertale* will definitely become a massive hit!"

"Birds are singing, flowers are blooming... on days like these, kids like you... should be burning in hell."

"It fills you with determination!"

"Incredibly novel and astonishing game design!"

Countless players gave *Undertale* extremely high praise, though naturally, some negative reviews were mixed in.

They lowered the score by 0.1, but compared to the flood of positive reviews, these negative comments were merely a drop in the ocean.
