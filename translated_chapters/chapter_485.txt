Chapter 484: All the Happiness is Yours, We Have Nothing! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Although the maximum capacity allowed five players to challenge, Zhang Yi and Song Ren didn't overthink it and just went straight in.

However, whether it was one person or five, it actually didn't matter.

Because what Song Ren and Zhang Yi were experiencing was just an easter egg dungeon storyline.

In this dungeon storyline, Chen Xu's difficulty curve used a dynamic difficulty. Regardless of whether there was 1 person or 5, it would be difficult to fail unless they were extremely bad or intentionally tried to, and there was no need to consider if their classes were appropriate.

Of course, the normal mode would be a bit harder, and the prisoners would act very intelligently.

Different prisoners had different aggro ranges and attack desires, and some could even call for backup.

Additionally, each time players entered the dungeon, there would be randomization, and the positions of the various prisoners would change, making a one-trick pony strategy impossible.

It required some teamwork and tactics.

As for now?

Just go for it.

Soon, Zhang Yi and Song Ren entered the dungeon.

Inside the prison, Zhang Yi and Song Ren quickly noticed something was off.

“These soldiers feel like they've gone mad!” Zhang Yi exclaimed in surprise.

“Right? They've all turned into werewolves. My fireball damage is much higher than the ice arrow’s.” Song Ren nodded.

Some prisoners were normal, but others had transformed into werewolf-like beings, even attacking other prisoners.

The combat system, on the other hand, surprised them both a little.

Initially, they thought it was action gameplay, but in reality, it was somewhat similar to RPG gameplay.

For example, an attack was essentially an action; the attack speed had nothing to do with how you swung your weapon, it was pre-set.

Of course, manual operation was also possible, and attacking an enemy's weak points would deal extra damage.

Other than that, it was basically no different from an RPG, and the monster damage wasn't very high either.

Soon, Song Ren and Zhang Yi arrived before the BOSS, a mutated werewolf.

'Away! Away!' The werewolf roared, looking at Song Ren and Zhang Yi before it, then lunged forward like a mad beast.

However, they quickly discovered that while the werewolf looked fierce, it was actually a complete weakling.

And there were two of them. Zhang Yi used a warrior's taunt skill, shouting 'grandson!', directly drawing the werewolf's aggro, while Song Ren just unleashed fireballs for damage output.

In no time at all, the werewolf before them was reduced to ashes by the fireballs.

Then, two skull-like items appeared in the ashes.

“This monster drops equipment too?” Zhang Yi was surprised, looking at the two skulls on the ground.

Song Ren also came closer. The two skulls, of different colors, represented each of them.

Clearly, one for each.

[Madman's Knowledge] (This is not something from the Azeroth plane. If you crush it, perhaps you can see a different world)

“What is this thing?” Song Ren was a little surprised. Not from Azeroth, meaning it wasn't from Warcraft? And it said 'crush it', but it couldn't be used now! Or could it only be used after returning to Nebula World?

“By the way, Old Song, doesn't this remind you of Mr. Chen's Dragon event before Uncharted was launched?” Looking at the skull, Zhang Yi suddenly had a flash of inspiration.

“Damn it, are you saying!?” Song Ren also realized something.

“Exactly, it might be an easter egg for a new game!” Zhang Yi's eyes lit up as well.

At this point, they didn't care about anything else. They didn't even go to the previous warden to turn in the quest, but directly opened the system interface and chose to return to Nebula World.

Accompanied by a white light, they once again traversed the vast starry sky.

This time, however, Song Ren returned to his own Nebula World. After greeting Chloe, who came forward to say hello, and ignoring the decorations he had bought earlier, Song Ren looked at his inventory UI interface.

The skull, which was previously unusable, could now be used. Without further ado, he selected and crushed it.

'Clang...' A strange sound rang out. Song Ren's vision plunged into darkness, then a blood moon flashed across the darkness.

[Your Insight has increased. You can see things that ordinary people cannot.]

In Song Ren's vision, in the sky over the distant coastline, it was broad daylight, yet he seemed to see a shadow, but it was very blurry and completely indistinguishable.

At this moment, the system prompt reappeared before Song Ren.

[You have discovered a mysterious plane, but a link is missing...]

Holy cow! Is this really an easter egg for a new game?

Seeing this scene, Song Ren was a little excited, and Zhang Yi quickly sent a voice message: “It really is an easter egg for a new game! Did you see it, Old Song?”

“Of course I saw it, you idiot. If there are Warcraft scenes, do other VR themes have them too?” Song Ren said.

“Definitely! Stop messing around, let's go look!”

..................

It wasn't just Song Ren and Zhang Yi; many players were doing the same.

At first, everyone marveled at the Nebula World's settings, then embarked on some exploration, and incidentally purchased some decorations.

But when they entered their respective themed planes, preparing to see if there were any changes, they all simultaneously discovered this crossover.

After all, Chen Xu hadn't hidden this aspect very deeply; anyone who explored would almost certainly find it.

For a time, players were all online, hotly discussing Nebula World and its easter eggs.

'Damn it, Chen Xu is too awesome this time, he really knows how to play!'

'Yeah! Nebula World really has its quirks! And a new work is actually in development? And he hid an easter egg in it!'

'233333333, that's truly unexpected. For the sake of the new work, I won't blame Mr. Chen for specifically making a Resident Evil to scare us on Halloween.'

'Exactly, I wonder what kind of game this new work will be!'

'Still not clear. There's too little information right now. Let's wait for the veteran players to collect everything!'

'Found it, found it! The Assassin's Creed theme was hidden a bit deep. It wasn't in the ancient tomb, but was taken by the Templar Knight!'

'Damn it, no wonder I couldn't find anything when I went straight to the ancient tomb!'

'5555555! All the happiness belongs to you VR players, it has nothing to do with us PC players.'

'+1! Watching you happily experience Nebula World and search for easter eggs, as a PC player, I can only watch, sobbing.'

'So sad I want to cry, but no tears flow out.'

Many VR players were discussing, but there were also many PC players complaining, saying all the happiness belonged to others, and they had nothing to do with it!

However, while they were complaining, something they never expected happened.

Chen Xu actually replied to them on the official Weibo account, and the content of this reply made them overjoyed.
