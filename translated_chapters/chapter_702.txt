## Chapter 701: Hesitation Is Defeat (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

It was still that same expanse of white reed field.

Isshin Ashina was dead, and Ashina was under full invasion.

Gyoubu Masataka Oniwa guarding the gate, the Chained Ogre blocking enemies with Regenerative Water, the Blazing Bull rampaging across the battlefield, and the Tengu along with the Lone Shadow — most had been dismantled by 'Wolf', now known as the Sword Saint.

In this final crisis, Genichiro would stop at nothing to protect Ashina.

The Iai Swordsman of the Ashina style beneath Ashina Castle, when the Interior Ministry launched its full invasion, had already transformed into a Red-Eyed Iai Swordsman using a Red Tassel upon Wolf's return.

But even after committing everything, there was still no way to resist the formidable enemy.

At this moment, Ashina Genichiro had only one path left: to harness the Power of the Dragon's Heritage.

By the time Wolf arrived, Young Lord Kuro was already gravely wounded.

'It has been a long time… Shinobi.'

'You see, another Mortal Blade.'

Genichiro, holding a Mortal Blade in his hand, spoke to Wolf.

This was his last reliance to save Ashina, to use the Mortal Blade to obtain Kuro's Dragon's Heritage.

Hearing Genichiro's words, Zhang Yi wasn't particularly surprised.

Because in the previous game's story, he had already received a lot of information.

There were two Mortal Blades in total. One was called 'Open Gate', the blade for the sacrificial ritual.

The other was called 'Bestowment', the blade for the ritual of taking the Divine Dragon's Tears.

According to Tomoe and Takeru's notes, it was known that Tomoe and Takeru had not obtained Bestowent back then; they had likely only acquired Open Gate.

As for the beautiful priestess seen when traveling to the Divine Dragon's former location, many players believed that person was Tomoe.

Because from the state of the Burial Mounds, Tomoe probably didn't die back then, and Emma's dialogue also confirmed this point.

Coupled with Isshin's earlier remark that Tomoe was a woman who fascinated him, many subconsciously assumed this.

However, Zhang Yi had a different view. Initially, he thought the same, but later, when he idly explored a bit more, he found a prompt appearing upon interaction, stating it was merely a 'sleeping miko'.

The two words 'sleeping' could mean either death or literal slumber, but Zhang Yi believed it should be the literal meaning.

Because he thought this miko was very likely the true empress of the Fountainhead Palace and the only person in the game to achieve eternal life.

And the price for achieving eternal life was to forever guard the Divine Dragon's mansion.

The prototype could refer to Empress Saimei (Kōgyoku) from the Asuka period, who once played the role of a miko praying to the heavens for rain, corresponding to the theocratic politics of witch-rule she practiced.

This also perfectly matched the point that there were no clues about a ruler in the Fountainhead Palace.

Of course, this was just a small guess of his, because beyond these, there were many other places in the game that left him feeling uncertain.

And this was the greatest characteristic of Souls-like games: a narrative and worldview with deliberate gaps, making players feel that every point is possible, without a completely accurate answer.

However, these were issues for Sekiro scholars to discuss, and Zhang Yi had absolutely no mind to delve into them now.

Because at this very moment, his gaze was entirely fixed on the formidable foe that was Ashina Genichiro.

Right from the start, it was Way of Tomoe Genichiro in his third phase.

Even though before, atop Ashina Castle, the third phase of Way of Tomoe Genichiro, using the 'Free Lightning,' was quite easy.

But it was also undeniable that the third phase of Way of Tomoe Genichiro's attack speed was indeed much faster.

Also, the low sweep attack no longer had the 'Perilous Attack' warning, and if one wasn't careful enough to notice it, they could suddenly die.

And in the white reed field, Zhang Yi discovered that Genichiro had also learned completely new moves.

Two consecutive slashes, creating a wave-like sword aura, instantly took away half his health if he didn't react quickly enough.

Fortunately, the rest of his techniques were largely no different from the Ashina Genichiro he encountered before at Ashina Castle.
