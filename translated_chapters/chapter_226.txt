Chapter 225: Freedom is the Core (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Whether it was private servers, Single-Player Mode, or official servers, all were filled with incredibly excited players.

Without exception, all players who visited the structures Chen Xu placed in the display server immediately entered *Minecraft* with an excited heart, ready to flex their muscles and build the structures they envisioned in their minds.

At Nebula Games' office, despite it being the Spring Festival, the importance of *Minecraft* to the development of the Nebula Games Platform was considered.

"Don't forget, *Minecraft* started pre-orders a month in advance, and this is just the beginning. There's no need to be overly excited yet, and the overseas version hasn't even launched," Chen Xu said calmly.
