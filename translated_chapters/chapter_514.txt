Chapter 513: Geralt of Rivia (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Though a small-scale game, `Hades`, launched after `Bloodborne`, with its exhilarating gameplay and action experience, has become a favorite among many players.

Especially the diverse playstyles and game content combinations have left many players astonished.

It could be said that `Hades` allowed players from all walks of life to experience its fun.

Similar to `Bloodborne`, if one is a novice, it's actually quite difficult to find enjoyment in the game.

But `Hades` is different.

As long as luck is good enough, and a player manages to assemble a powerful build, they don't need much skill to effortlessly achieve a `Musou` style of clearing. 

And if luck isn't so good, it doesn't matter. For example, with the two guaranteed `tool hammers` and the choice of one out of three `Gods' Blessings`, players still have certain strategic combinations. 

Even without luck or strategy, players can compensate with skill, constantly dodging the bullet-hell attacks unleashed by monsters in the game. Truly skilled masters can complete a run without taking any damage. 

Of course, if you have neither skill, luck, nor strategy, the game also offers a `God Mode`.

Initially, many players thought `Hades` was a `grind-heavy`, `randomized` game.

But as players delved into the game's `story`, they quickly discovered something different.

Namely, the game's `plot` and character relationships were incredibly rich.

The simplest and most direct example is that, within the same save file, as the player progresses, almost every dialogue trigger with various `NPCs` is different.

Moreover, by gifting the appropriate `nectar` in the game and unlocking `favorability` with each character, players can trigger some special events.

Many players online were also discussing the `plot` and `NPC` content.

“By the way, does anyone know why Nyx fired Dusa? I just maxed out Dusa’s `favorability` and got her doll!”

“Don’t worry, `bro` above, Dusa will be back in a couple of days, and she even got a promotion and a raise!”

“2333333, doesn’t anyone like Megaera? After maxing out her `favorability`, the `whip play` after `confessing` is simply irresistible!”

“There’s no `whip play`! That’s just your imagination!”

“So this game is great in every way, but my `liver` is almost gone! And the `plot` of this damn game, you can’t just clear it once, you have to clear it `N` times! Every time `Prince of the Underworld` meets his old mom, he can only get a tiny bit of information!”

“+1, I think Mr. Chen not only wants our `money`, but also our `lives` with this game! It’s too `grindy`!”

With the launch of `Hades`, it wasn't just players who were discussing it; many `industry designers` were also paying attention to this game.

Because this game was very different from Chen Xu’s previous developments.

Top-tier games like `Bloodborne` were difficult for many `industry designers` to learn from, even if they tried.

After all, it wasn't just about pure `design`; it was more about high-end `IT Technology` in games.

But `Hades` was different; it focused more on `Gameplay`, and it was inherently a `small-scale, low-cost game`.

Chen Xu’s previous works often combined gameplay direction with `industrial` production, but this time, many felt it was a return to the `Don't Starve` and `It Takes Two` model.

Many `game designers` online were also researching the content of this `randomized` gameplay.

However, for Chen Xu, he wasn’t overly concerned with this aspect, as the production of `Hades` was just a minor interlude.

On one hand, it was to fill a `game gap` on `Switch`; on the other hand, it was to look after the players’ well-being.

After all, having experienced the double blow of `Bloodborne` and `Resident Evil`, Chen Xu was quite concerned about players’ `mental health`.

That’s why he developed such a game to help players `de-stress`.

Yes, that was indeed his original intention.

As for any `negative impact`, that was another matter entirely.

…………

In the `Nebula Games` `lounge`, `Yang Xin`, `Ruan Ningxue`, and a group of other `old employees` were all lounging in chairs, holding their `Switch` consoles.

But their expressions showed a myriad of emotions.

`Ruan Ningxue` repeatedly entered rooms, mainly to `collect nectar` to unlock `NPC` `plot`.

`Qin Yi` and `Meng Zuo` were researching various `routines` and combinations.

As for `Yang Xin`, she was looking despairingly at her deleted weapon effects.

Before the `Cerberus` on the fourth floor, the `shop` would randomly offer a special `hammer`.

This `hammer`’s effect was to delete one `skill` and randomly gain two special skills.

Originally, her `skill` set was a `cruel strike` and `rapid slash` `healing playstyle`. She wanted to be `greedy` because she felt that even with one less of `cruel strike` or `rapid slash`, clearing the `levels` wouldn't be a big problem.

If she could randomly get `super armor penetration`, her `damage` would `explode`!

As a result, `cruel strike` remained, but `rapid slash` turned into `super critical` and `double critical`.

These two were `special attack` playstyles, but she had been playing a `basic attack` playstyle all along.

At this point, her head felt a little dizzy; she had spent `money`, but her `combat prowess` had not increased, but actually decreased!

Two minutes later, amidst Hades’ taunts, `Yang Xin` silently turned off her `Switch`.

“Haha, Sister Xin, did you lose your gamble again?” `Ruan Ningxue` noticed `Yang Xin`’s actions and burst into laughter.

At the same time, `Qin Yi` and others also glanced over.

“No, I’m just a little tired of playing. And isn’t it better to use this time to read a book and supplement my knowledge?” `Yang Xin` said, quietly picking up a novel.

`Ruan Ningxue` said nothing, just smirked at `Yang Xin`.

Holding the book and seeing `Ruan Ningxue` staring at her, `Yang Xin` finally couldn't sit still. Just as she was about to say something, she suddenly stood up as if she had seen a savior: “Mr. Chen, what do you have in your hand?”

Looking at `Chen Xu` walking over with a paper bag, `Yang Xin` was a little curious.

Not just `Yang Xin`, everyone else also put down what they were holding and gathered around.

“To supplement your knowledge. Call the people from the `screenwriting team` and `Art Team` too,” `Chen Xu` said with a smile.

Of course, not all employees were called, but some `core design` employees.

When everyone had arrived, `Chen Xu` took out the contents of the paper bag, which were all exquisitely packaged books.

“Mr. Chen, what are these? `Slavic Mythology`? `Vampires`? `A Compendium of Medieval Peasant Life`? `Ancient Norse Village Style`?” Everyone was a bit stunned looking at the books in `Chen Xu`’s hands.

But soon, everyone suddenly realized something.

This posture, could it be that he was going to develop a `new work`?

Seeing everyone’s expressions, `Chen Xu` didn’t keep them in suspense and nodded with a smile.

“A vast fantasy world, filled with countless strange creatures: immortal `High Vampires`, ferocious `Griffins`, xenophobic `Humans`, `sorcerers` with unique powers, as well as `elves` and `dwarves`, and so on.”

“The reason this world has so many different creatures is a peculiar natural phenomenon called the `Conjunction of the Spheres`. Different `worlds` would collide at specific times, causing many creatures from various `worlds` to cross over into one. 

`Humans`, with their powerful reproductive capabilities and adaptability to the environment, quickly became the most dominant `race` on the continent. However, because there were too many `monsters` in the world, `Witchers`, who hunt these monsters, were born. Unlike `sorcerers` who possess innate magical talent, `Witchers` are `humans` transformed by `magic potions`. They possess extraordinary `lifespan` and `perceptive abilities`, and can use `Signs` to briefly employ `magical powers`. `Witchers` carry two weapons: a `steel sword` and a `silver sword`, to deal with different `monsters` and `enemies`.

`Witchers` belong to no country or faction, traveling the world and earning a living by `bounty hunting monsters`. Of course, just as `humans` are divided into different regions and countries, `Witchers` are also divided into different `schools` based on their areas of expertise. But one thing is common: `Witchers` are also ostracized and given cold shoulders due to their non-human characteristics. As for the story we will develop next, it will revolve around a `Wolf School Witcher` named `Geralt of Rivia`.”
