Chapter 316: No Player Can Resist the -90% Green Bar (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Inside Nebula Games' office, Chen Xu leaned back on the sofa, chatting with Meng Zuo via video call.

"Mr. Chen, the Game Department gave Rainbow Six Siege a very high evaluation!" Meng Zuo said with a chuckle.

The media scores weren't particularly high or low.

But apart from players, Rainbow Six Siege also received high praise from the Game Department.

This was mainly because Rainbow Six Siege's characteristics were too distinct.

From a training perspective, the military version of Rainbow Six Siege was actually more about training ideology.

For example, teamwork, timely reporting of various information, and feedback.

When it came to actual combat, the content in VR certainly couldn't be the primary focus.

But even so, compared to other games, even the military versions provided in previous years, Rainbow Six Siege performed exceptionally well.

"How are your preparations for the subsequent versions at NetDragon?" Chen Xu smiled, not directly answering, but instead asked.

"The ranking system has been completed. There's already a significant gap between the current casual player base and high-level players, and it will likely go live after the New Year," Meng Zuo said.

During this period, he was also feeling quite pleased with himself.

He participated in the Rainbow Six Siege project, which could be said to be a great success, and Chen Xu was unaware of it.

As a NetDragon employee, Meng Zuo had quite a few information channels.

As for TengHua and the Channel Alliance, the new game they had been promoting for a while was now silent.

Ordinary players didn't know yet, but according to some internal information from NetDragon, it was highly likely that the project had been cut.

After all, Rainbow Six Siege's performance was arguably too outstanding.

In this situation, both the market and the Game Department found it difficult to overshadow Rainbow Six Siege.

Immediately canceling the project to cut losses was a relatively rational move.

This also caused considerable excitement within NetDragon.

Including Meng Zuo, who stood with the faction supporting NetDragon's cooperation with Nebula Games, he also received a promotion and a raise.

And now he had entered NetDragon's management, gaining a certain degree of influence.

After chatting with Meng Zuo for a while, Chen Xu hung up the phone.

Subsequently, the PC version of Rainbow Six Siege would be ported and developed by NetDragon.

Based on the VR version, some detailed actions and visual fidelity might be reduced.

However, the main content would not differ much from the VR version.

At the same time, cross-platform matchmaking would also be added to the game.

After all, the VR version and PC version had slightly different control schemes.

To be honest, in the Parallel World, the VR version was actually easier to control than the PC version.

This was because it offered stronger realism and immersion, while shooting in real life was actually very difficult.

But VR was still a game after all, so compared to the PC platform, which used mouse and movement for aiming.

Generally, VR games used eye-tracking combined with aim correction.

Therefore, this cross-platform matchmaking needed to be enabled, allowing players to choose freely.

As for the projects, there wasn't much left to do.

Because the Spring Festival was approaching.

The main focus was to seize the opportunity to launch some events for the platform and the games currently in operation.

Launching events essentially served three purposes: one was to boost game popularity, another was revenue, and the third was to appease players.

Sometimes, even if you don't want to rely on holiday events to boost popularity or revenue, you still have to hold events.

Because if you don't hold events, the players will revolt.

Other games are holding events! Why aren't you?!

What, you're saying other games hold events to trick players into spending money?

Then we're willing to be tricked into spending money for cool skins and fashion!

If you release a swimsuit Auntie IQ skin, see if we won't buy it like crazy!

Hmm... that's not right either, after all, the art style and game background are too conflicting.

So, forget the swimsuits! If you release a pink, anime-style gun, see if we won't buy it like crazy!

For many players, sometimes a continuously operated game, especially one with in-app purchases.

During holidays and festivals, if there are no such temporary events, players feel utterly uncomfortable!

As for Chen Xu, there really wasn't much he could do.

Because Nebula Games currently operated quite a few games.

Including the original Overcooked, which was still being stably operated.

Although the daily peak concurrent player count was only around ten thousand.

But it was still stably operating, just without any official content updates.

It relied more on the Workshop player community and official reviews and approvals of player suggestions.

Currently, the truly operable games were only Sanguosha, Fall Guys, and the recently launched Rainbow Six.

However, there wasn't much that could be done with the game content itself.

But Nebula Games' biggest asset right now wasn't games, it was the platform!

"Let's proceed with this model. Game developers will voluntarily participate in the events, and we'll clearly explain the pros and cons to them," Chen Xu said, nodding at Zhang Yida.

This year marked Nebula Games' first major promotion.

Last year, when the Nebula Games Platform was just established, Chen Xu didn't adopt any major promotion models due to the limited number of games.

It relied more on the platform continuously releasing new games.

The situation was different now; NetDragon and Nebula Games had formed a strategic partnership.

The game library immediately became richer. As for promotions, Chen Xu had already communicated with NetDragon in advance.

NetDragon had no objections and was quite cooperative.

Chen Xu guessed that Rainbow Six Siege's performance had clearly satisfied NetDragon.

At the same time, Rainbow Six Siege was not a one-time transaction.

Subsequent weapon skins and other items were also important revenue streams.

The rest was communication with various major developers.

"But Mr. Chen, isn't this discount a bit too generous? Many manufacturers also have concerns about this," Zhang Yida asked.

"What's there to worry about? Digital games aren't physical products; players will buy them immediately when they can be sold at their maximum potential. Besides, the games in the major promotion are basically those that have been online for over a year. Aren't Monster Hunter: World and Warcraft not among them?" Chen Xu said.

Zhang Yida nodded, then discussed this platform event with Chen Xu again.

Some classic games, as well as some niche games with good reputations, would all be included in this New Year's special offer.

No one could resist the temptation of a -50% or even higher green bar; it was the last straw that broke the camel's back.

It was the wicked little hand reaching into players' wallets.

When they saw that percentage green bar, a man's smile involuntarily appeared in the players' minds.

As if under some control, players willingly handed over their wallets.

Besides the popular green bar.

The rest were the company's event arrangements.

After all, Nebula Games had quite a few employees.

They arranged it at a five-star hotel and hired a professional performance team.

As for year-end bonuses, all departments had already distributed them.

At that time, every employee attending the annual meeting, regardless of their position, would receive a uniform 5888 red envelope, and the annual meeting prizes would basically be closely related to games.

Such as custom-made themed computers, mobile phones, VR gaming pods, and so on.

Employees across all departments were very happy, immersed in this joyful atmosphere.

However, Chen Xu certainly had happy emotions, but this was more of a ceremonial formality; the main focus was still next year's R&D plan.
