Chapter 260: Cries of Agony Everywhere (Seventh update, requesting subscriptions)

Despite saying so, Zhang Yi was extremely careful and cautious at this moment.

After all, a Solitary Longsword Hero had already fainted once.

Two more faints and the quest would fail.

So, at this moment, Zhang Yi and his team fought with extra caution.

Essentially, they would keep their health at half and then consume potions.

And at this stage, Zhang Yi finally experienced the burrowing attacks that Old Song had mentioned earlier.

They were practically impossible to defend against!

Emerging from underground was like being hit by a Dragon Charge.

Fortunately, they were in a team; as soon as one person's health dropped to half, the other two teammates would circle around.

They avoided getting greedy with attacks, sheathed their weapons, and ran in circles.

"I feel like the dawn of victory is right before our eyes!" Song Ren, who had traversed the map and returned to the Diablos's nest, also joined the battle.

This time he was smarter; he basically avoided wide-range attacks like the Diagonal Slash and Side Slash, sticking to right-clicking to poke its behind.

Although the damage was low, it wouldn't accidentally hurt his teammates.

"Of course, after all, we're professional hunters!" Zhang Yi also chuckled.

Play aside, jokes aside, Zhang Yi had to admit he thought they were quite formidable.

Moreover, their individual coordination was quite tacit; no matter how powerful the Diablos was, it was only one creature!

It wasn't like a BOSS from Dark Souls; as long as it couldn't instantly kill him, he could just drink a potion and be ready to fight again.

As for not having enough health potions?

They could just run back to the camp tent to get more!

"Exactly! Just a mere Diablos!" Wang Han also smiled happily.

But the next moment, four large characters appeared in the middle of their screens.

[Quest Failed]

"What happened? Quest failed? We only fainted once!" Zhang Yi was stunned by the sudden mission prompt.

"Time! Our time is up!" Joey exclaimed, suddenly realizing something.

"What?! We scraped by for fifty minutes!?" Zhang Yi was also shocked.

The monster's health in multiplayer also increases by a certain proportion; everyone knew that for four players, the health was 2.6 times the original.

But the key was that before, when fighting monsters, they had practically never run out of time.

They even had time to roast meat and catch rabbits.

But now, for the first time, their time was up!

"If you think about it carefully, it's not impossible, is it?" Wang Han said to a disbelieving Zhang Yi.

"Indeed, we spent a lot of time running, and we also had to watch out for friendly fire. Plus, this Diablos is different from the previous Odogaron; although the Odogaron was fierce, it had weak spots everywhere. But this Diablos is covered in tough armor and has huge horns on its head, so our weapons kept bouncing off. On top of that, its damage is very high, and it constantly uses Dragon Charge, which wasted a lot of our damage output time," Song Ren summarized.

"This Diablos is quite tough!" Zhang Yi sighed with emotion.

Soloing makes it easy to Cart.

In multiplayer, it's not as easy to Cart.

After all, when low on health, you can just run, and three teammates will draw aggro, allowing you to heal.

But the crucial point is that with increased monster health, they ended up hitting their teammates. Although there was no friendly fire damage, there was flinching.

Recklessly going for damage output could easily lead to three faints, but being too cautious meant facing a time limit.

It's tough!

...

In fact, Song Ren and his team were considered decent.

Because while they talked big, their skills were above average.

But for most ordinary players and some solo players who reached this point, their minds were practically blurred from being slaughtered by the Diablos!

When facing previous monsters, many players who couldn't solo them could team up.

And most of those monsters' flesh could generally be cut.

At the same time, their damage wasn't as exaggerated as the Diablos'.

But now, facing the Diablos, it was completely different.

Its head, tail, and most other areas were covered in hard armor, causing weapons to bounce off.

The flanks were also easily attacked by the Diablos, so the only truly good area to attack was the abdomen.

Many players had previously complained about the annoyance of teammate flinching, but they hadn't experienced how dangerous it truly was.

But when facing the Diablos and Rathalos, the so-called flinch damage was fully realized.

When the Diablos charged and the Rathalos shot large fireballs, a nearby teammate would 'sinisterly grin' and hit you into a stun lock, and then you'd be carted back to camp by two Palicos.

Dual Blades in Demon Dance mode wildly slashed teammates.

Light Bowguns blew up teammates' crotches, Heavy Bowguns pierced through allies' defenses.

The charging Lance pierced enemies while also taking out teammates.

The wild Wyvern's Fire let teammates enjoy the fun of being sent flying.

The Long Sword's Spirit Roundslash made all inferior weapons kneel.

This phenomenon frequently occurred in team hunts.

Countless hunters discovered that after teaming up, their greatest threat wasn't the enemy.

It wasn't from the enemy, but from their own teammates.

And even if the hunters in the team were very cautious and rarely hit their teammates.

But because of this inhibition, coupled with the characteristic of aggro transfer in multiplayer mode.

The damage simply couldn't be dealt effectively.

Especially for weapons that rely on charged attacks, such as Great Sword and Charge Blade.

A Great Sword player's Level 3 Charged Slash would always end up hitting the floor.

A Charge Blade player's Super Amped Element Discharge, whether it hit or not, once unleashed, was considered damage output.

The Hammer, aimed at the head, could only hit the feet; stunning was a blessing, hitting feet was fate.

Stationary Bow users would charge as much as they could, then respawn if they died.

The dream-chasing Hunting Horn never supported, only dealt damage.

The flashy Sword & Shield only jumped around chaotically.

For a while, the related game communities and forums were buzzing.

The players had all erupted.

Players universally expressed, "What's going on? This isn't what we were promised!"

The game's difficulty was so simple at first, but why is it so hard now?

This Diablos and Rathalos are too difficult to fight!

So, all those Great Jagras and Kulu-Ya-Ku from before were just an illusion?

At first, many players thought they might be playing it wrong.

Perhaps there was some special way to clear the game, or their equipment hadn't been strengthened enough, which was why they were struggling so much?

But after these players once again enjoyed the Diablos's charging service and the Rathalos's barbecue service, they went to the forums to check.

Good heavens, it turned out they were all in the same boat, all stuck at these two monsters: the Diablos and the Rathalos!

"Damn! So that's it, I thought Chen Xu had gotten better, but he was waiting for us here all along?"

"Indeed, the Warrior of Love lives up to his name, this 'love' is practically overflowing!"

"Damn, I'm speechless. At first, I thought it was a Hack-and-Slash Game, but it turns out I'm the grass being cut in the mid-game?"

"Haha, didn't some bro say before that they hoped the dragons would be stronger, not so easy to beat? Are you satisfied now?"

"I'm thoroughly impressed by this 'boiling frog in warm water' trick!"

"RNM refund!"

"My friend, you're overthinking it. If you've reached the Diablos, not to mention grinding other dragons and gameplay, just the main story alone has taken ten hours! There's no way to refund, you can only endure the torment!"

"Forgive me, I originally thought solo hunting was hard enough, but after fighting the Diablos, I realized that teaming up is an even bigger nightmare!"

"Haha, exactly, teaming up is the nightmare! When fighting weaker monsters before, I didn't feel it, but against aggressive and powerful monsters like the Diablos, being hit into a flinch by a teammate is pure despair!"

In an instant, players online were crying out in agony everywhere.

After all, these players weren't like those in his previous life, where there were many veteran hunters who had played since the first Monster Hunter game. All these players were brand-new rookie hunters.

Of course, there were also many veteran Firelinkers who had been brutally tortured by Dark Souls.

But even so, they were getting so tormented in the game that their scalps tingled, because the BOSS fighting style in Monster Hunter: World was completely different from Dark Souls!

What happened to the gradual progression? What happened to the slowly rising difficulty curve? How did it suddenly turn ninety degrees?
