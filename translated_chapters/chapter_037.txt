## Chapter 37: The Whole Truth

The one who got into the car accident wasn't Johnny; it was his twin brother, Joey.

And Joey wasn't some so-called grandfather's name at all. Rather, after Johnny's mother fatally hit Joey with her car, she developed some mental issues and began to mistake Johnny for Joey.

It was at this time that Johnny was given Beta-blockers.

Everything from before was now explained.

Why Johnny always slept in a double bed.

Why Johnny’s mother called him Joey.

Including the comics Johnny loved to read and the pickled olives he ate—these were all things his brother Joey liked.

After the car accident, Johnny's mother, overwhelmed by grief, raised Johnny as if he were Joey.

But there was still some confusion: what about Liva? What did this wish to go to the moon have to do with Liva?

As the game's timeline continued to advance, it went back to a time before Joey's death.

Joey, as the older brother, was very protective of his younger brother, Johnny.

Once again, the two of them participated in a competition at an amusement park.

Joey, the older brother, won a small train toy, while Johnny, the younger brother, only received a platypus toy.

Johnny said he wanted one too, but his mother stopped him.

Joey, however, said they could play with the little train together.

From this, it was clear that the mother seemed to favor Joey more.

A somewhat dejected Johnny walked gloomily towards the back hill of the amusement park, still holding the platypus he had won.

At this moment, Dong Zhen's spirits lifted completely.

Yes, that platypus!

That platypus, belonging to Liva, was actually won by Johnny at the amusement park.

Did this mean...

The following scene confirmed the speculation in his heart.

Johnny, having come to the back hill, looked up at the sky full of stars. His previously gloomy mood seemed to improve, and he found a good spot.

A wooden stump, like a bench, where he could sit and perfectly see the distant twinkling stars.

And just at that moment, a little girl appeared on the screen.

It was Liva from her childhood!

A slight tingling sensation ran down his scalp; in this instant, Dong Zhen felt as if he had understood something profound.

This was the scene of Johnny's first meeting with Liva. Not the so-called high school!

Seeing Liva approach, Johnny happily greeted her, but Liva instinctively wanted to leave.

Johnny called out to Liva.

After a brief exchange, he asked her if she would like to watch the stars with him.

Accompanied by soothing piano and violin background music.

Under a sky full of stars, Johnny and Liva sat on the wooden stump, looking at the distant sky.

The camera switched to a close-up.

The green grass on the verdant lawn swayed gently with the breeze.

‘Look up there…’

‘Did you know, there are countless lanterns in the sky!’ Johnny proactively started a conversation.

‘Mhm.’ Liva's reaction was just like it had been in high school.

‘Uh… um, me too.’ Johnny was a little flustered, but still tried to make conversation. ‘You just said this was your spot? Right?’

‘I only come here during carnival season.’

‘You don't like crowded places?… Hmm, me neither.’ Johnny continued, ‘See, you still haven't told me your name!’

‘I won't tell you. Everyone at school makes fun of me because of it.’

‘Why?’

‘They say hearing my name makes them want to go to the bathroom.’

‘Hmm, well, but… let's just say, it can't be any worse than “Johnny”, can it? I mean, in almost any place in the world, someone is named Johnny.’

‘So what?’

‘Hm?’

‘What's wrong with having a common name? I just hope that, like the stars in the sky, even though they all look similar from here, it doesn't diminish their beauty.’

‘Hmm, I think so too. So what do you think these stars are?’

‘My dad says the stars in the sky are giant spheres burning from within.’

Johnny and Liva chatted for a bit, then Liva asked, ‘Have you ever tried making Easter bunnies with the stars?’

‘Like finding constellations in the sky?’

‘Mhm.’

‘I've looked for others, but never for bunnies.’

‘Want to try?’

‘Mhm! We're sure to find the best bunny constellation! Let's see who finds it first!’

With a countdown of three, two, one, Liva immediately spoke up, “I found it!”

‘Uh, where?’ Johnny was a bit stunned.

The camera slowly shifted upwards, focusing on the full moon.

‘In the sky!’

‘Where in the sky?’

‘Think big, everything else is big!’

‘I can't find it… Wait… wait, I see it!’

‘Tell me what you see!’

‘It's there, right? Those are two ears and a head.’ Johnny's finger pointed at the moon.

‘And?’

‘And over there… those are two feet!’

‘Exactly! And?’

‘And… and the moon! The moon is its big, round belly!’

Simple lines in the screen outlined the stars in the sky.

Forming a — rabbit.

A rabbit with a yellow belly!

In that instant, the previous content of the game flashed before Dong Zhen's eyes.

Why did Liva start frantically folding paper bunnies after Johnny and Liva talked about their first meeting?

Why did Liva ask John countless times throughout her life what that yellow-bellied paper bunny was?

Why had Johnny's answers never satisfied Liva?

Now, finally, Dong Zhen understood!

Liva had been trying to remind Johnny in her own way.

Reminding him that many years ago, under the starry moon, that was their first meeting!

As Johnny and Liva chatted, Liva revealed that she had always believed the stars in the sky were lighthouses.

She thought those lighthouses wanted to communicate with others but couldn't, only able to constantly illuminate others; it was the only thing they could do.

Everything was explained.

Why Liva cared so much about Anya!

Then, a scene that moved countless people appeared.

With his mother's call, Johnny had to go home.

Before leaving, he left his platypus with Liva.

‘This is the prize I won, it's for you!’

That platypus, which had always accompanied Liva, came from this moment!

‘Will you… will you come back next year?’ Holding the platypus, Liva asked Johnny.

‘Of course! And you?’

‘I will.’

‘Same time? Same place?’

‘Mhm!’

Johnny, delighted by the answer, prepared to go home, when Liva asked.

‘But what if you get lost, or forget?’

‘Then we'll always meet on the moon, silly.’

As Johnny said these words, countless players currently playing the game involuntarily felt a pang of sadness in their eyes.

The game screen before them suddenly blurred.

All the doubts.

Were finally explained here.
