## Chapter 37: The Whole Truth

It wasn't Johnny who got into the car accident, but his twin brother, Joey.

Similarly, Joey wasn't the name of some supposed grandfather at all; rather, Johnny's mother developed some mental issues after accidentally killing Joey in the accident, and began treating Johnny as Joey.

And the beta-blockers were administered to Johnny at this time.

Everything from before was now explained.

Why Johnny always slept in a double bed.

Why Johnny's mother called him Joey.

Including the comics Johnny liked to read and the pickled olives he ate, these were all things his brother Joey liked.

After the car accident, Johnny's mother, overwhelmed by grief, raised Johnny as Joey.

But there were still some doubts: what about Liva?

Did the wish to go to the moon have any connection to Liva at all?

As the game's timeline continued to advance, it reached a point before Joey's death.

As the elder brother, Joey was very protective of his younger brother Johnny.

Once again, the two participated in a competition at the amusement park.

Brother Joey won a small toy train, while younger brother Johnny only got a platypus toy.

Johnny expressed that he wanted one too, but was stopped by his mother.

Joey, however, said they could play with the toy train together.

From this, it was clear that their mother seemed to favor Joey more.

A somewhat downcast Johnny glumly headed towards the back hills of the amusement park, still holding the platypus he had won.

At this moment, Dong Zhen's spirits lifted.

Yes, that platypus!

The platypus that belonged to Liva was actually won by Johnny at the amusement park.

Did this mean...

The following scene confirmed his suspicions.

Johnny, having arrived at the back hills, looked up at the sky full of stars. His previously gloomy mood seemed to improve, and he found a good spot.

It was a tree stump, like a bench, where he could sit and perfectly view the distant twinkling stars.

And just then, a little girl appeared on the screen.

It was Liva in her childhood!

His scalp tingled. In that instant, Dong Zhen seemed to realize something profound.

This was Johnny's first meeting with Liva.

Not the supposed high school encounter!

After seeing Liva arrive, Johnny happily greeted her, but Liva instinctively wanted to leave.

At this point, Johnny called out to Liva.

And after a brief exchange, he asked if she would like to watch the stars with him.

Accompanied by soothing piano and violin background music.

Under a sky full of stars, Johnny and Liva sat on the tree stump, gazing at the distant heavens.

The scene switched to a close-up.

Lush green grass on the verdant lawn swayed gently with the passing breeze.

‘Look over there...’

‘You know, there are countless lights in the sky!’

Johnny actively tried to make conversation.

‘Mm-hmm.’

Liva's reaction was the same as it had been in high school.

‘Uh... yeah, me too.’ Johnny was a bit flustered but continued to make conversation.

‘You just said this was your spot? Right?’

‘I only come during the carnival.’

‘Don't you like crowded places? ...Hmm, I don't either.’ Johnny continued, “Look, you still haven't told me your name!”

‘I won't tell you. Everyone at school makes fun of me because of it.’

‘Why?’

‘They say my name makes them want to go to the toilet.’

‘Well, okay, but... let's just say it can't be worse than [Johnny], right? I mean, there's a Johnny almost anywhere in the world.’

‘So what?’

‘Huh?’

‘What's wrong with having a common name? I just hope, like the stars in the sky, they all look pretty similar from here, but that doesn't make them any less beautiful.’

‘Hmm, I think so too. So what do you think these stars are?’

‘My dad says the stars in the sky are giant burning spheres of gas.’

Johnny and Liva chatted for a bit, then Liva asked, ‘Have you ever tried making an Easter Bunny out of stars?’

‘Like finding constellations in the sky?’

‘Mm-hmm.’

‘I've looked for other things, but never a bunny before.’

‘Want to try?’

‘Yeah! We'll definitely find the best bunny constellation! Let's see who finds it first!’

With a countdown of three, two, one, Liva immediately exclaimed,
