# Chapter 201: Wilson's One Hundred Ways to Die (Seventh Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

“Is this game fun?” Zhang Yi, who had already defeated Yhorm the Giant, asked curiously from a stool behind Wang Han, who was preparing to explore a new world.

“It’s pretty fun! The main gameplay involves collecting, building, and survival,” Wang Han replied.

Although she had only survived to the eighth day, and was mostly just bumbling through it, Wang Han had already begun to feel some of the fun in *Don't Starve*.

‘Collecting,’ ‘survival,’ and ‘growing stronger’ – no game can truly escape these three points. This even includes story-driven linear games. In linear games that tell a story, even if the game itself doesn't have collecting elements, survival elements, or upgrade elements, the players still immerse themselves in the protagonist, who gradually grows stronger or acquires certain things.

And *Don't Starve* uses ‘survival’ as its driving force, making players feel ‘collecting’ and ‘growing stronger,’ thereby allowing them to experience satisfaction and joy within the game.

“Hey, what’s that sound?” Zhang Yi asked, somewhat curious.

Because the atmosphere of the night was too eerie, Wang Han had already switched the game’s audio source from headphones to speakers. At that moment, a rumbling sound came from the speakers, a bit like thunder and a bit like the howl of some wild beast.

And at this moment, Wilson in the game also began to mumble to himself: ‘I think I heard something, did you? I have a bad feeling about this.’

Wang Han looked at Wilson’s words on the screen and couldn't help but feel nervous. She already had a general understanding of the game’s mechanisms. When Wilson spoke, there was definitely a reason.

“I don’t know either, probably not?” Wang Han replied to Zhang Yi, cautiously standing still and waiting for a while. After about a minute, nothing happened, and Wang Han relaxed, but was also a little puzzled.

“That’s so strange, could it be that my Sanity is too low? So Wilson felt a sense of crisis and became a bit paranoid?” Wang Han remarked, feeling a bit odd. At the same time, she prepared to look for flower patches and green mushrooms to boost her character's Sanity.

Just as Wang Han was about to look for resources and pick some flowers, a sudden dog bark appeared in the game. From the top of the map, two fierce Hounds emerged, pouncing towards the Wilson she was controlling.

“What’s going on? What kind of monster is this? There weren’t any monsters here before!” Looking at the two Hounds pouncing towards her, Wang Han froze. Hadn't she just passed this spot? When did these monsters appear? Where did these two dogs come from?

However, there was no way to get an answer to this question, at least not in this playthrough. Under the Hounds’ bites, Wang Han's Wilson was not at full health, and these Hounds were very fast and had high attack power. Although she tried to fight back with the axe in her hand, it felt like scratching an itch. After two rounds, her Wilson collapsed directly into a pool of blood.

【Beware of Hounds】(Please heed Wilson’s intuition)

Looking at the achievement notification that popped up, Wang Han was speechless. What good was telling her now! She had already been bitten to death by Hounds!

“That’s it? Dead already?” Zhang Yi, standing behind her, was taken aback.

“I should have made armor and weapons first, I wasted too much time wandering around before!” Wang Han summarized her eight days of experience in the game and reflected. Then she turned to look at Zhang Yi next to her: “Stop talking nonsense, log on!”

Hearing Wang Han’s words, Zhang Yi quickly got up: “Wait, almost!”

Back in his room, Zhang Yi skillfully opened the Nebula Games Platform and downloaded *Don't Starve*.

………………

Like Zhang Yi and Wang Han, many players immediately jumped into *Don't Starve* to experience it after its launch. However, for many players, their first survival journey only revealed a very small part of the game's content. Complex gameplay like building camps and tech progression was completely untouched. The only thing they truly experienced was a variety of deaths. No matter how carefully they planned, unexpected events would always arise in the game, bringing an end to their survival journey.

And in the relevant community forums, many players who got the game right away were posting and sharing their in-game experiences.

‘This game feels like it has so much content. After playing for over two hours, I feel like I've only scratched the surface!’

‘+1, I’ve been playing all afternoon. Even though I’ve never survived for double-digit days, it still feels very interesting!’

‘Haha, this is too real. The first time I died was when I tried to steal a Tallbird egg and got pecked to death by the Tallbird.’

‘233333, I encountered a herd of red-butt bulls on the prairie and got gored to death by them!’

‘Anyone else accidentally burn themselves to death while setting the mountain on fire?’

‘I'm disgusted. Am I the only one who didn't make a fire at night and then got killed by some monster in the darkness without knowing how?’

‘+1 for dying in the darkness without fire, that's how I died too!’

‘Although it's a small game, it feels super fun, especially when scavenging with friends. Before you know it, several hours have passed.’

‘Exactly, playing with friends is definitely more interesting.’

‘Haha, playing online multiplayer with friends, you need clear division of labor. The first time the dogs came, they were counted per person, and N dogs came at once and bit me and my friends to death.’

‘Exactly, those dogs are too fierce! How do you fight them?!’

‘The first time you encounter dogs isn't too bad. Just craft a Grass Suit, do a little kiting, and you can hack them down. Of course, if you want to be safer, you can craft a Spear.’

‘Everyone, pay attention: never let your Sanity get too low, otherwise you’ll see a bunch of shadowy phantom creatures. They're incredibly powerful; I was killed by them.’

‘I think this game's name doesn't match its content at all. It's called *Don't Starve*, but I've never actually starved to death once!’

Countless players were sharing game tips—or rather, death tips—on the forum community. Among them, the Hounds, as a rookie killer, undeniably topped the list of death causes. When players hadn't quite figured out how to play the game and were still slowly exploring, even just two ordinary Hounds could cause immense damage to them.

As countless players recounted their various bizarre death experiences in *Don't Starve*, many also expressed that although the game was named *Don't Starve*, very few players actually died of starvation. More often, deaths were due to various accidents. Therefore, calling this game *Don't Starve* was completely misleading; the true game title should be *Wilson's One Hundred Ways to Die!*.
