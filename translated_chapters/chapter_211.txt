Chapter 210: How About Changing It To A Pyramid? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

The various controversies in the gaming industry regarding sandbox games did not affect Chen Xu.

This was because the promotional model and schedule for 'Minecraft' had basically been fully determined.

After New Year's Day, on January 3rd, which was also the first day of the twelfth lunar month, the single-player test for 'Minecraft' would commence. Multiplayer mode would not be enabled for now, only regular friend online multiplayer and single-player functions would be available for five days.

It would officially launch online on February 1st, the first day of the first lunar month.

As for the promotional model, Chen Xu had also finalized it with Zhang Yida.

Beyond advertising, a special method would be employed: showcasing some truly jaw-dropping constructions created within 'Minecraft' by players, along with simple Redstone applications.

To put it plainly, it was about showing off skills.

This was to let players know what kind of game 'Minecraft' truly was, and what content they could experience within it.

This kind of operation wasn't a new trick.

After all, game promotion always adheres to fundamental principles.

Just like some games that immediately give players a nostalgic 'memory kill' experience.

In this 'memory kill,' players would be max level, with all skills, and fully equipped with divine gear.

Why?

It was precisely to give players a sense of anticipation, to make them look forward to the game's subsequent content, and to let them understand that the game could be played this way, allowing them to experience that exhilarating feeling by playing further.

Similarly, game trailers and movie promotional edits generally follow this path, making players anticipate the upcoming content.

However, limited by 'Minecraft's' rather unique gameplay, all the in-game content had to be created independently by Chen Xu and his team.

The only good news, however, was that Galaxy Smart Tech, specifically Zhong Yue and his team, had made significant breakthroughs in AI intelligence.

Chen Xu estimated that this was also due to the countdown progress bar nearing its end. With various patent applications, it was safe to say that Galaxy Smart Tech was going crazy with breakthroughs.

When it came to cutting-edge AI in the industry, Galaxy Smart Tech couldn't compete at all, as they weren't focused on the same conceptual direction. According to Chen Xu's requirements, their primary research focused on in-game AI performance.

Compared to the somewhat rigid performance when it was previously applied in 'Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame,' there had now been considerable progress.

Leveraging Zhong Yue's technology, Chen Xu also specifically developed a tool for rapid construction.

In his previous life, there were similar tools that could save a lot of time.

However, on Chen Xu's side, it could be even simpler. Through Galaxy Smart Tech's AI technology, after initial construction in the software, it could be further generated via AI recognition in the editor backend.

Of course, some overly complex elements still required Chen Xu and his team to work on them manually.

But it did make things much more convenient, which was why Chen Xu felt confident promoting the game in this manner.

Subsequently, this could also be used to release some commemorative official building complexes periodically.

As for this tool, Chen Xu had no plans to release it, because even if it were released, players wouldn't be able to use it. The issue involved AI computational resources, unless players were willing to pay a lot.

However, apart from the wealthy, Chen Xu estimated that most players wouldn't be able to afford it based on the pricing. So, Chen Xu would still release simpler 'brush tools' like 'Creator God' later on.

After completing a portion of the building complex, Chen Xu stretched, preparing to go check on Qin Yi and his team's progress.

After all, 'Minecraft's' content development was currently complete. Although 'Dark Souls' still had the Ringed City and Painted World DLCs, there was no rush for those; they were already in development, and it would be fine to release them on the third anniversary.

Therefore, all the company's employees were currently involved in the house-building process, and today was the first day.

However, Chen Xu didn't have high expectations for what they could build. Instead, he planned to use the tools himself to create the main models, then provide the finished products to them for minor adjustments and filling in details according to the templates.

Upon arriving at the project room, Chen Xu saw a group of people sitting in rows, with 'Minecraft' displayed on all their computers.

Everyone seemed to be working with great synergy, engaging in various discussions with each other.

"I've finished here, Qin Yi. You handle the interior construction."

"No problem!"

"Sister Xin, is the foundation ready?"

"You can trust me to get things done!"

Hearing their conversation, which sounded quite professional, Chen Xu was somewhat surprised.

Could he have guessed wrong?

But upon closer inspection, Chen Xu fell silent.

"Are you building an ancient Egyptian pharaoh's pyramid?" Chen Xu finally couldn't help but ask, looking at the game screen.

Hearing Chen Xu's words, everyone was taken aback. A pharaoh's pyramid?

No, that's not right. Although they had considered it before, they ultimately rejected the idea.

But soon everyone realized, what *was* a pharaoh's pyramid?

Isn't it just an ancient Egyptian pharaoh's tomb?

He was saying their houses were ugly!

Immediately, everyone became displeased: "Mr. Chen, this is a structure we all built by pooling our intelligence and creativity, it's absolutely not some ancient tomb."

Yang Xin chimed in, "Exactly, exactly! Mr. Chen, you're looking down on us! But when it comes to architecture, you really don't know as much as we do. It looks quite ugly right now, but we actually based it on the Musée d'Orsay in France. Originally, we thought about building the Forbidden City or the Mogao Grottoes, but then we reconsidered, thinking the difficulty would be a bit too high. In the end, we decided to build something simpler first."

Based on the Musée d'Orsay?

Chen Xu quietly opened a search engine, looked at pictures of the Musée d'Orsay, and then looked at the 'lump' in front of Yang Xin and the others.

He, for one, couldn't connect the two at all.

Musée d'Orsay? Who gave you the courage to say such a thing?

"Fine, I'll fix it for you," Chen Xu said.

Looking at everyone, Chen Xu sighed and took Yang Xin's seat.

First, he increased the in-game movement speed, then Chen Xu skillfully began to build using the tools.

Everyone gathered around Chen Xu, watching him build.

His speed was much faster than theirs.

They just didn't know what he was making.

It didn't look like a house either.

"Mr. Chen, what are you building?"

"A statue, it seems?"

"I get it!"

"What do you get, Sister Xin?"

"Statues! Don't you remember, aren't there various sculptures next to the Musée d'Orsay?"

"Mr. Chen has been there? He doesn't even need to compare photos?"

Everyone discussed curiously.

After about twenty minutes, Chen Xu placed the last block, then released the mouse and clapped his hands: "Done!"

Looking at the structure in front of them, everyone fell silent.

"Well, Mr. Chen really did build a sculpture, just as Sister Xin said."

"Indeed, not just a sculpture, but a very famous cultural heritage of ancient Egyptian civilization."

"The famous Sphinx!"

"So, Mr. Chen, what are you still implying?"

Looking at the lifelike Sphinx Chen Xu had just built, everyone exchanged glances.

This damn well implied that the houses they built looked like small burial mounds!

"Ahem, I didn't say anything; you all said it yourselves!" Chen Xu lightly coughed twice.

Hearing Chen Xu's words, everyone was speechless.

Did they even need to say it themselves? It wasn't an implication; it was a direct statement!

But then again, looking closely now, it really did seem quite similar!

Square and blocky, a mix of dirt and stone, it was completely enclosed for now as windows were planned for later. It looked airtight, lacking only torches for illumination. Didn't it perfectly resemble the appearance of ancient tombs in archaeological documentaries?

Staring intently for a few seconds, especially with the Sphinx right in front of her, Yang Xin hesitated.

Because she found that as she looked at the Sphinx in front of her...

Slowly, the original image of the Musée d'Orsay in her mind began to change.

After a moment of thought, Yang Xin looked at her colleague next to her and said, "How about... we change it?"

"Change it?"

"How about we change it to a pyramid? And it seems relatively easy to build!" Yang Xin suggested.

"And you have to understand that changing building plans is quite normal. It's just like painting; perhaps Qi Baishi didn't initially paint shrimp, and Xu Beihong didn't paint horses. It's just that later they discovered their talent for painting shrimp and horses, so they leaned into that," Yang Xin explained.

"Sister Xin, please give it a rest!" Ruan Ningxue, standing nearby, couldn't help but say.

Qin Yi and the others also sighed with emotion.

During the development of 'Minecraft,' everyone genuinely experienced the joy of the game.

But when it came to building houses, what they built always turned out different from what they imagined!
