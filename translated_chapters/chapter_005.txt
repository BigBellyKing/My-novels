Chapter 5: I Can't Believe You're Making This Kind of Game!

Mirror (Game) could be described as a truly unique small game. The combination of Match-3 game and RPG elements, coupled with the Galgame gameplay featuring different endings, made the overall gameplay very appealing.

As for the Match-3 game gameplay, it's essentially an extension of tile-matching game, and this world already has this type of gameplay. It's quite popular, so Chen Xu wasn't worried about whether this Match-3 style gameplay would be accepted by players.

Furthermore, Mirror (Game)'s selling point wasn't solely the Match-3 game aspect. The rest involved the story and CG Illustrations. Chen Xu wasn't worried about this part at all, because the Ruan Ningxue in his memories possessed that skill. Chen Xu himself also had this skill.

After simply completing a Game Design Document (GDD)-related setup, which included the Match-3 gameplay and different upgrade paths, Chen Xu began writing the stories.

In the first story, the female character is a Drow Elf Rogue who goes to steal from a lord's treasury to help the poor, but unexpectedly, the lord's hidden identity turns out to be a devil, and she falls into his hands. For the subsequent development, players are given two choices: a Pure Love Warrior path or a Netorare Warrior path.

The second story features a female general who time-travels from ancient times to modern society, encountering an Otaku. Due to the time travel, the female general becomes powerless. The subsequent development offers two different endings: the Pure Love Warrior path naturally leads to a beautiful conclusion, while the other is a somewhat dark but ultimately moving ending. In modern society, the Otaku commits evil acts against the female general, then both are transported back to ancient times. After spending some time together, war is about to be lost, and the Otaku, while capable of returning to the modern era, chooses to die alongside her.

As for subsequent stories, there are tales involving zombies and Dragon Knights, touching upon themes of reincarnation and destiny.

Of course, for the initial stage, Chen Xu only planned to create these four stories.

The main reason was that his savings weren't enough. After all, the Match-3 gameplay, a subsequent Voice Actor, and purchasing BGM copyrights would also require a significant amount of capital.

As for where the money would come from, it wasn't a big problem. Over ten thousand in savings was clearly unreliable, but a Jiebei loan from Zhibafu, a Jiejie loan from Jingdog, and credit cards could totally cover it.

………………

The next morning, inside Chen Xu's apartment. Ruan Ningxue, carrying her graphics tablet and laptop, sat beside Chen Xu, looking at his hand-drawn story synopsis and Storyboards with a strange expression.

"I can't believe Chen Xu, you're actually making this kind of game!"

"Indeed, indeed, being a cartoonist and a Game Designer isn't your true talent. Come draw doujinshi with me!"

"With your talent and mine, I'm sure we can make it big. Many famous artists have followed this path, accumulating fans as doujinshi artists and then becoming renowned cartoonists."

Ruan Ningxue looked at the materials Chen Xu had rushed to produce overnight, and began to outline her strategic workaround plan. It was such a waste! How could such talent be used for making games? She knew her biggest flaw was her insufficient storytelling ability. That's why she decided to create doujinshi to support herself while slowly honing her skills. But now, looking at Chen Xu's short stories, they were simply amazing. Pure love, Netorare, reincarnation—all sorts of elements were present.

Listening to Ruan Ningxue's exclamations, Chen Xu's mouth twitched.

"Thank you for the compliment, but I'll pass," Chen Xu said tactfully.

"Alright, next, Ningxue, please create the Illustration in order. However, unlike comic format, they all need to be colored and more refined.

"Of course, the story plot doesn't need to be conveyed through visuals; it will primarily be revealed through dialogue."

Chen Xu said to Ruan Ningxue.

"I understand, make the pictures more detailed and primarily showcase the female characters' charm, essentially making each one a front page of a doujinshi. I'm very professional in this regard, so rest assured!" Ruan Ningxue said spiritedly.

"Hmm, that understanding works too." Chen Xu nodded, then took a deep breath: "If there are no issues, then let's start working today!"

Hearing Chen Xu's words, Ruan Ningxue smiled slightly, gave a thumbs-up, and then opened the relevant software. The development of Mirror (Game) was much smoother than Chen Xu had imagined.

Other non-critical art assets were mostly outsourced. Among them, the Dark Elf, Dragon Girl, female general, and Zombie Moe Girl were the four provisional starting characters. As for music, Chen Xu could technically do it himself. However, it would be time-consuming and labor-intensive, and he didn't have that much money; it was simpler and more direct to just purchase a license. The rest was Voice acting.

BGM and other music could be managed with compromises. But only the Key illustrations and Voice acting — these two points could not be cut corners on. These two points were the two most important core aspects of Mirror (Game).

"Hmm, perfect! But it still needs some adjustments."

Looking at Ruan Ningxue's freshly colored Illustrations, Chen Xu couldn't help but feel a hint of amazement. In his previous life, he was no small fry in the gaming industry. He had met and interacted with some industry magnates at various summits. He naturally knew a thing or two about art, having deeply studied the designs of some Master artist concept artists in the industry in his past life. These included Yang Qi, who created Asura Online, Shigenori Soejima of the Persona series, and Tetsuya Nomura, who was the concept artist for Tifa in Final Fantasy 7. Chen Xu had a deep understanding of the designs of these well-known industry figures in his previous life. But in terms of character art, Ruan Ningxue truly gave Chen Xu an incredibly stunning impression; her skill was not to be underestimated!

Of course, there were also shortcomings; after all, a game's art style is different from that of a comic. Even as Illustrations in a Galgame, they were distinct from comics.

"I see! It's indeed quite different from drawing doujinshi." Listening to Chen Xu, Ruan Ningxue mused.

"Hmm, even in a Visual novel game, the Illustrations within it are completely different from comics," Chen Xu nodded gently, saying to Ruan Ningxue.

Inside the rented apartment, Chen Xu and Ruan Ningxue discussed some of the key points. Overall, the game was basically nearing completion. What remained was the Voice acting aspect.

For this type of Bishōjo game, Voice acting could be considered a relatively important part. The proportion of funds allocated to this section was one of the highest for the entire game. Of course, Chen Xu wasn't planning full voice acting; that would blow the budget. Voice acting for some of the more important lines would be sufficient.

As for the male protagonists in each story? Should they have voice acting? Of course not!
