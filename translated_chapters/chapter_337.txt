Chapter 336: Is Captain Price Really Gone? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Ten days ago, Zhang Yi, whose liver ached slightly from the anger caused by "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare," uncharacteristically stood his ground.

Since the release of "Overcooked," he had washed dishes for over a thousand days.

But today, he stood firm; he wasn't washing these dishes anymore!

As for the reason, it was naturally because he didn't want to wait another second.

Although his liver ached from anger, that was due to the deaths of Gaz and Brother Griggs, and Nebula Games pulling a cliffhanger.

Regarding the game itself, he was incredibly excited.

He might curse 'Chen Xu Old Geezer' with his mouth, but the money in his wallet still had to be handed over.

Entering the game, what first appeared was not new game footage.

Instead, it was a flashback.

In the recruit training camp, Captain Price listened to the recruits' introductions and grumbled to his teammate next to him: "Soap? What kind of ridiculous codename is that?"

In a square in the Middle East, Al-Asad, wearing a red beret, staged a coup, shooting the president of a small country.

And in the video footage, Zakhaev also appeared, but players didn't recognize him before, so they had no reaction upon first seeing him.

In a city in the Middle East, a mushroom cloud rose into the sky, taking the lives of thirty thousand people.

During the operation, Young Zakhaev swallowed his gun and committed suicide when faced with capture.

Zakhaev, grief-stricken by the loss of his son, activated and launched missiles equipped with nuclear warheads.

Price, Gaz, Soap, and Griggs chased and fought Zakhaev on a bridge, eventually killing him.

In the Ukrainian mountains, the newly formed Task Force 141 fell into a trap, and Price covered the rear, his fate unknown.

Scene after scene from the past unfolded before the players, and then the timeline subtitle appeared—[Five Years Later]

For players who had played the game, these plot points and content were naturally clear.

However, Chen Xu had, after all, released "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare" as a trilogy, just like in his previous life.

So, there would inevitably be some players who didn't buy the first part, choosing instead to buy the second or third.

Including such fragmented flashback narratives in the game could also help players better understand the story's plot.

Zakhaev was dead, but the even more insane Makarov had appeared.

Without the slightest hesitation, Zhang Yi directly selected the normal difficulty.

He had already tried Hardened and Veteran before.

Now, he genuinely felt a bit out of his depth.

As for Recruit difficulty, he felt it was too easy.

For players who hadn't played FPS games, Recruit difficulty might be just right.

But for a veteran FPS player like him, normal difficulty was the perfect "water temperature."

'No matter how fast appearances change, the essence of things is always eternal.'

'Rules change, players change, but power will always fall into someone's hands.'

'We fought side by side with the Russians, but in the end, there was only hostility between nations.'

The anti-American wave, war plans, insane leaders, and volatile international situation created an immense sense of tension.

Against this grand backdrop, the camera moved to Phoenix Base in Afghanistan.

Today was recruit training day, and Sergeant Foley had been tasked by General Shepherd to select a soldier with a clean record and excellent qualities to join Shepherd's command.

The player character was a Private First Class in the 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment: Joseph Allen.

The first mission was called 【Daily Life (Mission)】, but it was just a simple new player tutorial. As for why Zhang Yi knew this:

A system prompt appeared, indicating that the player's VR had played the first part, and asked if he wanted to skip the new player tutorial.

Of course, if there was no save file, then passing this tutorial level would be mandatory by default.

Since he already knew it was a tutorial level, Zhang Yi figured it would be basically the same as the previous installment, so he directly chose to skip it.

Moreover, he still had many questions in his mind.

Not just whether Captain Price was still alive, but also why he had become this Ranger Private First Class instead of the previous Soap.

Or was it going to continue with multi-line narration as before, where he played as Joseph Allen here, and later became Soap?

Zhang Yi speculated, and after choosing to skip the new player tutorial level, an achievement notification popped up.

【Daily Training: Sometimes the purpose is more than just training】

Looking at this achievement prompt, Zhang Yi didn't think much of it.

This was a rather unique point about games under Nebula Games.

That is, there were various achievements and trophies in the game.

Many players with a collecting urge would collect various achievements, and after collecting them all, they would receive a platinum trophy.

Even on the Nebula Games platform, there were many game developers and designers who specifically made games with easily obtainable trophies.

However, Zhang Yi himself didn't dwell on it.

After finishing the daily training, Allen was immediately dispatched to the front lines.

It was a seamless continuation of the "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare" experience from before, with an incredibly intense battlefield atmosphere and experience.

And of course, there were also highly reliable teammates.

For example, Shepherd from the previous installment would pull the player up, loudly reminding them that this was a battlefield.

The Ranger squad would provide cover for you, and Captain Dunn would even rescue you from a hail of bullets without regard for his own safety.

They were all excellent teammates.

Especially his superior, Shepherd, who held him in very high regard.

Allen: "Sir, how do I look?"

Shepherd: "Excellent. Just like the enemy. You're perfect for this undercover mission."

Allen: "The target is Makarov, right?"

Shepherd: "Makarov? He's not worthy of being a target. Just a mad dog biting everywhere for money. Memorize the details of your undercover identity; your life depends on it."

Shepherd: "Finally, welcome to Task Force 141, comprised of the world's most elite soldiers."

Allen: "It's an honor, General! When can I meet the other teammates?"

Shepherd: "They are currently on a mission."

After a CG animation ended, the scene shifted to a snowy mountain.

Heavy snow fell, and on a thousand-meter-high cliff, a man with ice hanging from his beard and wearing windproof goggles was squatting, smoking a cigar – the type his former captain loved most.

【Cliffhanger (Mission)】

【Day Two, 07:35:40】

【Roach - Sergeant Gary Sanderson】

"Time's up, we need to go, Roach." The smoking man flicked his cigar off the cliff with a familiar gesture, stood up, and turned his head to say.

It was then that Zhang Yi finally recognized who the man in front of him was.

"Holy cow! Soap! Now Soap is my captain?" Zhang Yi was utterly stunned.

And this Gary Sanderson he was playing now, wasn't he a member of the previous Operation Croaker?

So, Captain Price was really gone?

And Soap had replaced Price as the captain of Task Force 141?
