Chapter 179: Dying Too Naturally! (6th update, requesting subscriptions, monthly passes)

Just like the seemingly difficult BOSSes in the previous game, they all had patterns.

For example, the Ancient Wyvern, where you climb to the top, then perform an aerial plunge attack for an execution, taking it down instantly.

Or Yhorm the Giant, where you grab the Storm Ruler and directly charge it five times to defeat him.

Song Ren believed that there must be a way to deal with the Asylum Demon before him, rather than him having to 'trim its nails' with a small knife to get through.

Entering the gate once again, this time he finally discovered something different.

In the middle of the room, near a pillar on the ground, there was an in-game message.

Clicking on it revealed a message: "Run!"

However, this message was close to the pillar, requiring the player to walk two steps forward.

And in those two steps, the BOSS would jump down from above, directly shifting the player's attention to the BOSS instead of the message on the ground.

Song Ren also keenly noticed that the great demon would pause for two seconds after jumping down.

Clearly, this time was reserved for players to open the message.

But like most players, when he first saw this BOSS, his subconscious reaction was to try and kill it.

Because BOSS battles in Dark Souls usually follow a design where one scene has one BOSS, and you can only proceed to the next area after defeating the BOSS.

Only story-kill BOSSes like the Ancient Wyvern, which show a UI health bar, allow you to find a way to leave.

“So that’s where you were waiting for me! It's a pity that an excellent Firelinker's excellence isn't just in their skill, but also in their mind!”

Slipping into the passage, Song Ren smiled faintly as the gate behind him fell.

Dark Souls sequel? Is that all there is to it!? Is that all there is to it!?

Lighting a bonfire at the entrance of the passage, it was as if he had just used Embers, and Song Ren's body was filled with confidence.

Continuing along the passage, Song Ren found a knight's weapons: a shield and a sword.

“So, I only get weapons here!” Song Ren couldn't help but grumble, looking at the weapons and shield in his equipment slot.

The process of picking up the equipment was smooth enough, but there was an annoying archer in the narrow passage.

Carelessly, Song Ren was shot twice, and seeing his health bar halved, he felt a little unaccustomed to it.

Because in the world of Dark Souls, half health provided too little security; a slight mistake could lead to death.

“Where is the Estus Flask? They didn't cancel the Estus Flask setting, did they?”

Muttering to himself, Song Ren walked forward.

However, he also noticed some differences from the previous game.

In the previous game, a fog gate usually meant encountering a BOSS that had already been seen.

At first, when Song Ren saw the fog gate, he thought he was about to fight the Asylum Demon again, knowing he was at half health and had no Estus Flask.

But after he passed through, he realized it was just a new area, and the fog gate had become something to obstruct the player's view.

He found it a bit strange why the game would be designed this way; wasn't it a bit redundant?

While muttering, Song Ren also discovered a knight locked in a cell, the same knight who had previously rescued him.

“How do I open this thing! Do I have to defeat the demon from before, and it has the key? But that doesn't make sense! Didn't I choose the Master Key as my starting gift? And where is the lock for this thing?” Song Ren felt puzzled looking at the cell in front of him.

He tried attacking it but found no effect.

He could only explore elsewhere.

Following the small staircase downwards, Song Ren soon surprisingly found that the iron door, which he couldn't open earlier, led to the courtyard of the previous BOSS battle outside; he could even see the burning bonfire through the cracks.

So, after passing through the BOSS's small door, he could actually return here?

This made Song Ren feel a bit surprised.

In fact, the previous Dark Souls also had a similar interconnected design, but they were all relatively simple.

But this Undead Asylum, from what looked like a passage, led through a long sewer, and then this door via the staircase could lead back – this top-down spatial connection truly astonished Song Ren.

After all, this was just the beginning of the game, essentially the tutorial map.

After a brief moment of surprise, Song Ren could only choose the other staircase leading upwards.

He would see if there were any other exits first.

With this thought, Song Ren controlled his character to run up the stairs.

As he slowly ascended the stairs, just as he reached the middle, Song Ren heard a 'rumble'.

Then he saw a huge, dark iron ball suddenly roll down the stairs.

Caught off guard, Song Ren had no time to dodge.

And he was shot several times by the archer in the corridor, leaving him with only about half his health.

So...

The familiar three words appeared on the screen again.

【YOU DIED!】

Damn it!

Song Ren cursed inwardly.

This is a scam!

Traps could be said to be a major feature of Dark Souls.

For example, Mimics, and various other traps.

But in the previous game, he only encountered the first Mimic trap after defeating Teacher Gundyr and reaching the High Wall of Lothric.

Yet now, this big iron ball came rolling down with a thump-thump.

He never expected it.

The first BOSS isn't even dead yet, and traps are already appearing?

Moreover, this big iron ball felt exactly like the Bone Ball in the Catacombs of Carthus.

The only difference was that on both sides, there weren't bottomless abysses.

But this death was too natural, wasn't it!?

However, even though he died, Song Ren made a new discovery.

The big iron ball had smashed through the wall of the knight's cell.

“So, the previous fog gate was warning me about dangers ahead?” After resurrecting at the bonfire, Song Ren re-ran the map. Because he had opened a shortcut earlier, he hadn't saved at the courtyard bonfire, so he resurrected at the bonfire in the corridor where he got the equipment.

After resurrecting, Song Ren quickly ran back to his death point and talked to the knight in the cell.

‘Ah, you… you are not a Hollow, that's great….’

‘I am at my limit. Once I die, I will no longer be able to maintain my sanity.’

‘I want to ask you for something, and you, like me, are Undead. Please accept my request and listen…’

Next, an option popped up: yes or no.

It looked like a main story quest, so Song Ren directly chose yes.

The knight continued to speak.

‘It's shameful to admit, but what I ask of you is my mission….’

‘I wish to entrust it to you, a stranger…’

‘In my family, it is said that:’

‘Undead signifies bearing a mission. With this Undead body, one must travel from the Undead Asylum to the Land of Ancient Kings and ring the Bell of Awakening, to learn of the Undead's mission.’

‘Thank you… With this, I can finally die with hope.’

‘Ah, one more thing, please take these as well.’

After a simple conversation, Song Ren received a familiar Estus Flask and the key to the second floor east side of the Undead Asylum.

“Five Estus Flasks? My goodness, that many?!”

Song Ren looked at the acquired Estus Flasks with surprise.

After all, in the previous game, before fighting Gundyr, there were only three.

Even after converting the blue pulse potion into Fruit Pulp Orange Juice at the Firelink Shrine, it was still only four.

And now, right from the start, there are five!

“But good brother, did you forget something?”
