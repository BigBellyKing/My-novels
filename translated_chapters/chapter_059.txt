Chapter 59: *Outlast*'s Sales

On live streaming platforms, video platforms, and major player communities, the popularity of *Outlast* continued to soar.

Even some media websites progressively released score reviews for *Outlast*.

From the media's perspective, they uniformly gave scores around 8.5, while players' comprehensive score for this title was around 9.1.

This was considered the lowest score among the three games currently developed by Nebula Games.

Of course, *Mirror (Game)* was not included in this.

However, in terms of popularity, *Outlast* was completely different from the other two games.

*Undertale* had the credit for opening up the META game genre, barely qualifying as a pioneering ancestor.

Such immense popularity was understandable.

*To the Moon*, on the other hand, gained significant attention due to the Sci-Fi Game Design Competition.

Furthermore, Chen Xu's online literary disputes regarding those previous two games also attracted a lot of eyeballs.

Comparatively, setting aside these factors, *Outlast* actually had higher topic popularity, and it was also the fastest-growing game among the few titles.

Of course, *Mirror (Game)* was still excluded, as the fighting power of gentlemen is always unknown.

But compared to the popularity of *Outlast*.

Regarding sales, however, it only sparked discussion among many game industry designers.

Only Chen Xu knew the true sales of *Outlast*, but there were also third-party agencies collecting statistics.

According to data released by third-party agencies, *Outlast*, which had been online for a week, had sales of around 250,000.

Simply looking at the sales figure, it could be said that it was already quite high.

Before *Outlast*, the horror game with the highest weekly sales was an old IP, selling 120,000 units weekly.

Of course, that game was priced at a high 149 Yuan.

It also had the support of series fans and nostalgia.

But the key was that *Outlast*'s popularity was too high; it was considered the most sensational horror game in recent years.

Yet, it achieved such a sales figure.

This also led to widespread discussion among industry designers.

'Chen Xu really messed up this time, what a pity! *Outlast*'s popularity is so high, but its sales are surprisingly low.'

'Yeah, it can't compare to *Undertale* and *To the Moon* from back then.'

'No choice, the horror game market is too small.'

'I really can't figure out why Chen Xu chose to make *Outlast*.'

'Yeah, I can't figure it out, why Chen Xu chose to enter the horror game genre.'

'Exactly, making horror games is thankless work. I thought Chen Xu would continue making games like *To the Moon* and *Undertale*.'

'He probably wanted to challenge a high-budget game, but the competition in traditional fields like RPGs is too fierce, so he had no choice but to opt for the horror game genre, right?'

In a certain industry game forum, a group of designers posted and discussed, with Chen Xu and *Outlast* as their topic.

Just as they were discussing vigorously, a piece of information instantly left them choked.

'Weekly sales of 250,000, and priced at 65 Yuan, *Outlast*'s development costs have already been fully recovered! And based on its current popularity and player reviews, achieving a million sales for *Outlast* shouldn't be difficult, right? If so, this game's gross revenue for Nebula Games might even exceed 100 million Yuan!'

The designers who were still discussing the topic immediately fell silent.

Where did this person come from?

Do they have any situational awareness?

As game designers, could they not know that *Outlast* was a very successful horror game?

They simply wanted to brag a bit and imply that Chen Xu and Nebula Games were just mediocre.

Who is this!?

So lacking in situational awareness?

……………………

In the Nebula Games office, Chen Xu leaned back on the sofa, put down his phone, and looked at the UI interface in front of him with a regretful expression.

The effect of the special item obtained earlier was confirmed; the 6 million points marked on it referred to the converted number, not the original number.

Of course, even so, 6 million points, enough for fifty-pulls, was still a fruitful gain.

Unfortunately, once the points converted from the cards reached their limit, the accumulation speed immediately slowed down.

It was even a bit less effective than *To the Moon*.

After providing the converted 6 million, he hadn't even gathered enough for a single ten-pull yet, despite the continuous contributions from the previous *To the Moon* and *Undertale*.

And this was why Chen Xu only managed sixty-pulls.

Underperforming!

For this, Chen Xu also reflected and summarized.

He finally came to a conclusion.

He was harvesting leeks too vigorously.

Although fear emotion was very effective.

But the key was also for players to dare to play.

And now?

Among the players who bought the game, a large number requested refunds, and another large number entered, walked around the asylum entrance, and then exited.

How could this provide fear?

Ultimately, *Outlast* was just too scary.

“A miscalculation!” Chen Xu couldn't help but sigh.

He had originally thought that relying on *Outlast* and the [Fear Converter] would, if not make him rich in one go, at least bring a wave of sudden wealth.

But looking at this trend, it was a bit difficult to yield results!

Never mind, he might as well use all these points for draws first.

Getting up from his chair, Chen Xu first went to the restroom and then returned.

First, he drew the curtains, then turned off the computer monitor.

Drawing lots still required a sense of ritual.

As the points were consumed, golden light shimmered before Chen Xu.

After a while, having used up all the points, Chen Xu fell silent.

The luck was terrible!

Fifty-pulls, but no special items like the [Fear Converter] appeared, though quite a few Memory Capsules did.

As for skill books, only two rare skill books appeared: one for Level Design and one for Numerical Design.

He clearly washed his hands after going to the restroom.

Final haul: Art Concept Art: 17 books, Level Design: 11 books, System and Numerical Planning: 9 books, Story Interaction: 3 books, Music and Sound Effects: 3 books, Camera Work: 4 books.

The rest were all Memory Capsules.

Chen Xu temporarily stored the Memory Capsules in his item inventory.

He'd talk about it later when developing new games required their use.

After all, Chen Xu had used these quite a bit, and he had to admit, they were really effective.

As for the remaining skill books, he would just use them all.

They couldn't bear offspring and earn interest anyway, otherwise, he could save them.

“However, next, it's time to consider a new direction.”

Chen Xu, leaning back in his chair, was also contemplating in his mind.

As for money, *Outlast* also yielded a rich harvest.

Although the available capital wasn't much currently, it was sufficient.

Instead, the focus was on the company's future planning, time, and the operation of new projects and platforms.

Scrolling through some recent news from the game industry on his phone, Chen Xu pondered in his mind.
