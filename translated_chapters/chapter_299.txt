Chapter 298: Entertaining RPG Maps (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Just like when they first encountered Warcraft, many players were filled with novelty upon entering the RPG maps.

A similar scene unfolded for other players.

As players experienced these maps with different attributes in Warcraft, they quickly discovered their unique enjoyment.

Each map had its own characteristics, but they shared a common feature.

Unlike the RTS gameplay of Warcraft itself, players generally only needed to control a single unit.

Everything else could be completely ignored.

This significantly reduced the game's operational complexity.

Especially players who couldn't fully appreciate the fun of RTS in Warcraft found enjoyment in these diverse RPG maps.

Previously, when playing Warcraft, they generally valued every unit highly. When faced with low-health units, they wouldn't send them to their deaths but would instead preserve them or restore their health with healing potions.

This was because units in Warcraft were truly precious; what died wasn't just a common soldier, but money.

However, in RPG maps, the focus was primarily on the hero's presence, often resulting in a single skill wiping out a large group of common soldiers.

This gave players an indescribable sense of exhilaration.

Before this, Warcraft had given them the impression of a relatively hardcore RTS.

But now, they felt the same sensation as playing a story campaign, and it was even more satisfying.

After all, the story campaign itself also bore the responsibility of introducing players to the basic concepts of Warcraft's RTS gameplay, so it couldn't be completely unrestrained.

But now?

These RPG maps had no such concerns at all.

The exhilarating feeling of cultivation and growth was instantly ignited, making players addicted to these maps.

“Haha, these maps released this time are so interesting!”

“Yeah, yeah, I super love the 'Defend the Sword Pass' map, 'Though valiant figures remain, who says the Han has perished!'”

“And that Demon Hunter Chronicles, there are so many craftable equipment pieces! And you can even catch mounts!”

“Yeah, but if you don't know how to play at first, it feels quite difficult. If your equipment level doesn't rise, you won't be able to stop the BOSSes later.”

“When playing Defend the Sword Pass, you can do quests, and also farm BOSSes in dungeons. Upgraded equipment is only useful in the early to mid-game; in the late game, you still need equipment dropped by BOSSes.”

“Calamity of the Western World is really fun! And the plot is especially long! My friends and I played for two or three hours and still haven't cleared it!”

“I actually think the 'Monopoly of the World' map is quite interesting; it feels like playing a land-buying board game!”

“Pyramid Escape is the most fun, with all sorts of mini-games.”

“It's just that someone always steals my equipment! Damn it, a bunch of people are fighting the BOSS over there, and the BOSS still has two-thirds of its health, but a whole flock of birds has already arrived.”

“23333333, I can totally picture that scene! And every time attacking monsters come, no one comes back to defend the base, always with the same excuse: 'The BOSS is almost dead!' Damn it, from my perspective, only 10% of its health is gone.”

Online discussions about these RPG maps were also growing.

Moreover, these RPG maps in Warcraft were actually quite suitable for multiplayer gameplay.

This novel mode instantly captivated players, and also encouraged them to invite their friends.

Then, one by one, they were all drawn in by this unique map gameplay.

No player had imagined that Warcraft could contain such content.

You thought it was an RTS-type game, but then a map like this appeared, suddenly telling you:

“Didn't expect that, did you? We can actually be an RPG-type game too!”

And just when you thought that was all, it told you again:

“Actually, it's not just RPGs; it can also be action-adventure and tower defense-like gameplay!”

This unique experience instantly drew players in.

For many RTS-struggling players.

The experience of freeing up their hands, not having to worry about multi-unit control, and only controlling one hero.

It could be said that it made them truly feel the interesting aspects within.

Meanwhile, another aspect, the map editor, also garnered attention from many game enthusiasts.

Because judging from the performance of these maps, it seemed they were all created using Warcraft's editor?

“Does this mean we can also create these maps in Warcraft?”

“That sounds a bit interesting!”

“And there are ready-made assets inside!”

After experiencing several RPG game maps, many players developed an interest in the map editor.

Many players also went to study this map editor.

Of course, players who could genuinely create a decent map would be relatively few.

Because even though Chen Xu had optimized the map editor considerably, trying to make it idiot-proof, it still required some learning curve.

Moreover, a truly interesting map wasn't something that could be created so simply.

It still required a basic understanding of games, relevant data theory, and player feedback to create a relatively interesting map.

But for Chen Xu, generating player interest through RPG maps was already enough.

And some players had already released some simple maps.

However, they were quite rudimentary, belonging to the heavily modded type of RTS Versus map.

In these maps, the population cap setting was removed, and all unit types were thrown into a single building.

The speed of unit production and resource gathering in the game were both significantly increased.

This allowed players to mass produce units and then decide who's superior.

In terms of balance, it was naturally poor, but in terms of entertainment, it gave players something to strive for.

And this was a very good omen.

Just like Minecraft's MOD community, how many ordinary players could build massive and magnificent structures, and all sorts of Redstone mechanisms?

Most players were still the type who built matchbox houses, and whose Redstone technology at most involved copying a minecart and an automatic chicken farm.

Further down the line, with the operation of the player community, the popularity of Warcraft would naturally continue to rise.

Of course, Chen Xu would still provide some catalysts in the early stages.

For example, releasing official tutorials for the game editor to help more players understand how to use the tool.

As well as the operation and maintenance of related communities.

As the popularity of RPG maps in Warcraft gradually increased.

Even Warcraft's sales saw a slight increase.

A large number of previously lapsed players also returned, and concurrent players even reached new highs.

This greatly surprised the major game developers and designers who had been following Chen Xu.

Especially the effect of Warcraft's map editor and the gameplay of its RPG maps astonished other game designers in the industry.

“It can actually be like this!”

Just like the players, game designers who had deeply investigated it were equally stunned.

RTS-type game development designers, in particular, felt bewildered.

“Didn't we agree it was just pure RTS gameplay?”

Although your game graphics were a bit more refined, the plot more excellent, the gameplay balance more perfect, and the concepts more outstanding, everyone was still making RTS games.

“But what the heck is this editor?”

“Experiencing RPG, tower defense, and casual games within an RTS?”
