Chapter 177: An Excellent Firelinker, Fearless! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

As the game screen turned black, an unskippable cutscene followed.

First on the screen was a dimly lit dungeon; a group of rats scurried past the camera, then the camera slowly moved, revealing the general scene of this dim dungeon.

The camera finally zoomed into a prison cell, at the base of the wall beneath a torch, a Hollow, skeletal in appearance, sat on the ground, whether alive or dead was unknown.

With that, a low narration began.

“The Dark Sign represents being afflicted by the Undead Curse, so all Undead will be captured, sent north to be imprisoned, until the end of the world.”

“This is also your fate.”

The camera shifted and arrived at another cell.

The character Song Ren had created earlier was in the corner of the cell, hidden in the darkness.

“Wait a minute, how did I become a Hollow?”

Song Ren was immediately shocked. Earlier, he had spent a long time in the character creation interface, and finally created a character that wasn't scary but full of personality.

Yet upon entering the game, he had directly turned into a Hollow whose appearance was indiscernible?

What was the point of all that character creation then!

As Song Ren was speechless, the in-game character suddenly raised its head.

A ray of sunlight shone in from the skylight above.

With a “thud,” a skeletal corpse fell from the skylight, landing on the cell floor, a white glow emanated from the corpse.

Song Ren, who had played Dark Souls, knew this white glow represented a collectible item.

After throwing the corpse from the skylight, the knight left directly.

Song Ren had also seen this segment of the plot in the promotional trailer at the previous exhibition, but it wasn't complete.

But he had a rough understanding of the background by connecting the dots.

In the previous game, players played as the Ashen One, who were unburnable trash, incapable of linking the fire even if they wanted to.

As for the Undead, they were clearly burnable trash, and this place called Undead Asylum could almost be understood as a landfill, specifically for imprisoning the Undead.

After briefly summarizing the available information, and looking at the UI interface that appeared in the game, Song Ren controlled his character to approach the corpse, picked up the white glow, and immediately saw a notification that he had obtained the key to open the cell.

After familiarizing himself with the basic controls, which were no different from the previous Dark Souls, it was clear that no major changes had been made to the combat system.

This filled him with joy; the combat system was familiar, did this mean he wouldn't have to suffer anymore?

After all, in the previous game, he had played for hundreds of hours.

Getting started with the new game should be quite fast, right?

However, his happiness didn't last long, as Song Ren soon discovered a crucial issue.

“How am I over-encumbered? And aren't I a knight? I have armor, but I'm holding a broken sword. Where are my shield and sword!?”

“What the heck is this? Is it because I became a Hollow that I lost all my strength?”

Song Ren was completely dumbfounded. You know, in the previous Dark Souls, even the Deprived character started with a Small Club.

But now he only had a small broken sword? Did this mean no starting weapons were given, and he had to rely on drops?

And then there was the equip load; although a full set of knight's armor was given, it was over-encumbered!

His rolls and even walking were as slow as a turtle's.

But the crucial thing was, wasn't this supposed to be the starting equipment for the class? How could it be over-encumbered?

Watching the knight in the game roll on the ground, with those sluggish movements, Song Ren felt a pang of pained expressions.

“Perhaps this is the increased difficulty? A knight starts over-encumbered but has high defense, while a normal character starts with very low defense?”

“And I can also temporarily take off my equipment to gain agility. Is this a compromise?”

As an excellent Firelinker, Song Ren's greatest advantage after playing Dark Souls was this:

When encountering something seemingly unreasonable in a game, he wouldn't blindly assume the game designer made a mistake somewhere, but would instead ponder if it held a deeper meaning.

Now, in his mind, he had already found perfectly convincing reasons for choosing a knight but starting without a shield and sword, and for the armor being over-encumbered.

Looking at the broken sword in his hand, Song Ren felt a pang of pained expressions.

Especially after checking the weapon's base attack power, it left him even more speechless.

In the previous game, this thing was considered a nuisance even to keep in the inventory because it took up space.

After searching the cell, Song Ren was now absolutely certain that this broken sword would be his early-game weapon.

As for the armor on his body, after some thought, Song Ren decided to take off his helmet and armor.

After all, he wasn't some rookie Firelinker, but a battle-hardened Ashen One from the previous game.

Even though he had become Undead in the prequel, his experience was still there.

Although many veteran players joked that armor in Dark Souls was completely useless, and wearing it was like folding paper.

But in reality, it could genuinely increase the margin for error for new players, so armor with suitable defense or resistance should be worn if possible.

But there was also a prerequisite, and that was not to be over-encumbered.

Because excessive equip load would affect rolling, and rolling could be said to be the most core aspect of the Souls-like games.

So when faced with the trade-off between defense and agility, Song Ren still chose agility.

“However... this counts as a different kind of Deprived, doesn't it?” Looking at his bare-chested character, Song Ren was speechless.

His character creation was for nothing, and choosing this class was also for nothing!

Using the newly acquired cell key, he opened the iron door.

With a creak, the iron door was pushed open, but Song Ren felt a little nervous at this moment.

Because it was too dark here, his vision was severely limited. In the previous game, spawning in the Cemetery of Ash at least had a hazy brightness.

But this prison cell was truly a bit like the Underworld.

Scattered small monsters were all huddled in dark corners, without health bars, truly easy to miss if not paying close attention.

Fortunately, these Hollows were very easy to deal with, even simpler than the regular Hollows on the High Wall of Lothric, and arguably had no desire to attack at all; it was just unknown what the situation would be like later.

Along the way, there were also some blood-stained in-game messages on the ground, mostly instructing players on controls.

“The damage is so low! In the previous game, it was one or two hits, but now it takes three or four hits. Is the difficulty of the new game just weakened stats?” Song Ren muttered to himself after dispatching a few Hollows along the way.

But he didn't pay too much attention to it, and continued to explore forward.

The early-game prison certainly wouldn't have overly difficult areas.

Along the path, there were just one or two Hollows.

All were easily dispatched by the broken sword in his hand.

The only slightly different thing.

That was, just like the game's title, Dark Souls.

The setting of this prison was slightly gloomy and dark.

Compared to the previous Dark Souls, where one spawned in the Cemetery of Ash, this prequel felt a bit more chilling.

But after experiencing the baptism of Silent Hill PT, this was just a small matter.

Although at the time he had been baptized by watching other players' playthrough videos, and it was the kind with bullet comments and high-alert warnings, it was still a baptism.

Along the way, he didn't encounter many difficult points; in fact, Song Ren felt it was even simpler than the previous game.

Because at the very beginning, he had even lost a little health.

But now?

No damage taken the entire time!

After all, I'm not who I used to be, I've come a long way!

With a sigh, after climbing up the ladder from the well, Song Ren arrived at the first bonfire.

“Bonfire, the first discouraging boss is coming!”

Seeing the bonfire in front of him, Song Ren's eyes lit up.

However, he wasn't afraid, but rather filled with excitement.

After all, he had evolved. What if he didn't have a shield? What if he didn't have a weapon?

An excellent Firelinker is fearless!
