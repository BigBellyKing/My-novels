Chapter 91: The Fire Fades, and No King Sits Upon the Throne

Online, various players were excited by *Sanguosha* and *Fall Guys*.

In every exhibition area of the gameplay Expo, ordinary players could be seen grouped together, playing *Sanguosha* and *Fall Guys*.

However, on this fifth day, the final day of the expo.

Many players, as well as gaming media, noticed something.

In front of the Nebula Games exhibition booth, located in Exhibition Hall 6, many people wore expressions of surprise.

"What's going on!? How did the style change?"

"Holy cow, is this a trailer for Chen Xu's new game? Not just *Fall Guys* and *Sanguosha*, but a new game!"

"Is it a medieval-style game? That armor and greatsword look pretty cool!"

"Finally! Finally, some ladies! But why are their eyes covered?"

At the Nebula Games exhibition booth, all previous posters for *Sanguosha* and *Fall Guys* had been replaced.

A Black Knight, covered head to toe in black, wielding a sword and shield, wore a pointed iron helm, chainmail beneath a black leather vest, and a scarlet cape that seemed to drift with the wind.

A warrior, holding a Dragonslayer Swordspear, rode upon an Ancient Dragon like a king.

A burly knight held a weapon resembling a Guandao.

A knight, with armor resembling an onion, carried a sword and shield.

A blind maiden, holding fire in her hands, wore a white crown that covered her eyes and a black robe.

At the same time, the previously colorful *Fall Guys* cosers had transformed into a group of cosers clad in various armors, holding weapons and shields.

If this had been at the start of the expo, it would have been hard to attract much player attention.

Because, essentially, everyone else was uniformly like this.

But after four days of continuous exposure, many players had grown accustomed to the *Fall Guys* cosers.

This sudden change back to the original style, on the contrary, sparked even greater curiosity among many players.

Meanwhile, some players who had visited the Nebula Games exhibition booth on the first day recalled something.

That on the first day, Chen Xu had told them that there would be a major announcement on the final day.

So, Nebula Games also brought a new blockbuster!?

Players outside the exhibition area gathered in a dense crowd.

At this moment, Chen Xu finally stepped onto the stage, smiling as he looked at the players below and said: "I believe many players have already guessed it."

"Yes, that's right. Today, we have another piece of news for everyone: we've been secretly developing a major title that will launch on the PC platform."

"Constantly pursuing self-breakthrough, continuously exploring all unknown mysteries; now the fire fades, and no king sits upon the throne. This will be a story of fire and Fire Keepers."

"Please look forward to it."

As Chen Xu's words fell, the players present appropriately erupted in cheers.

Even some media personnel who happened to be in Exhibition Hall 6 were surprised.

Is Nebula Games developing a major title now?

Is this the main event of Nebula Games' expo this time?

Are *Sanguosha* and *Fall Guys* just appetizers?

Similarly, game designers and developers from other exhibition areas all wore pained expressions.

"What the hell!"

"This is an expo!"

"An expo! Do you even know what an expo is?!"

Why does Nebula Games, why does Chen Xu always have so many tricks up his sleeve!

This isn't for you to hold a game launch event!

Watching countless players flock over, everyone wore a pained expression.

This included NetDragon and TengHua, whose relevant personnel had been closely monitoring the situation.

Especially Meng Zuo, who still hadn't recovered from this blow.

It shouldn't be like this!

It shouldn't be!

What exactly went wrong?

Everything should have been his first!

Whether it was blockbusters or promotions, why did the final outcome turn out so differently?

However, for ordinary players, the previous four days of *Fall Guys* and *Sanguosha* had completely ignited their enthusiasm.

If Chen Xu had announced news of a so-called new game on the first day, it would probably have just been a fleeting sound.

But now, it was completely different.

Amidst thunderous applause and cheers.

On the pre-prepared LCD screens, the CG animation, rushed to completion with overtime work over the past two months, began to play.

Unlike the simple cutscenes of *Dark Souls* in his previous life, although the content remained unchanged, the visual presentation was definitely on a different level.

After all, this simple cutscene was directly produced by a top domestic CG company commissioned by Chen Xu; from a visual effects standpoint, it was absolutely up to par. To use an old cliché, just by looking at it, one could tell it was a AAA-level production.

Due to time constraints, the CG company had been working overtime every single day, though, of course, they were well compensated.

The cost of this single CG animation, less than three minutes long, was almost comparable to the pure development cost of *Outlast*.

A brief black screen, then the voice of an old woman resonated.

"Yes, indeed. That is Lothric."

"Homeland of the past Lords of Cinder, and the confluence of wandering souls."

As the old woman's weathered voice spoke, a ruined and desolate capital slowly appeared on screen. Though now dilapidated, one could still faintly sense how prosperous this capital must have been in its prime.

Under dim light, biting cold winds swept, scattering snowflakes.

Grey dust shrouded the massive capital, and the entire world was enveloped in dead silence.

"Thus, pilgrims all journey northwards, and learn the meaning of the prophecy."

Amidst the heavy snowfall, a group of hunched figures, carrying what resembled a turtle shell wrapped in chains on their backs, leaned on staffs as they trudged forward against the biting wind and snow.

Thick clothing tightly encased their bodies, but their exposed arms were like burnt kindling, displaying a black, cracked state, with even faint orange-red speckles of light visible.

Finally, one of the pilgrims could no longer bear it, collapsing to the ground and falling silent.

"The Fire Fades, and No King Sits Upon the Throne."

Muffled drum beats gradually began, accompanying the old woman's weathered narration.

It made countless players in the audience feel as though they had entered this mysterious world, eager to know what kind of game and story this was.

"When the Age of Fire wanes, the bell tolls across the land, awakening the slumbering Lords of Cinder from their coffins."

As the muffled bells tolled, a violin concerto, and the mixed chanting of soprano and tenor voices began.

The camera instantly cut.

Gigantic sarcophagi split open, and from dark and deep underground caverns, countless black goo pulsed and throbbed, with a crown faintly visible in their midst.

"Aldrich, Saint of the Deep — Aldrich, Devourer of Gods."

From sarcophagi and mountains of corpses, a group of armored soldiers wielding Farron Greatswords slowly rose, their blood-soaked dark red cloaks fluttering behind them.

"Abyss Watchers — Farron Undead Legion."

A massive greatscythe struck the ground, stirring up a cloud of dust. From a colossal sarcophagus, a colossal figure, like a small mountain, slowly rose. Its arms, holding the greatscythe outside its armor, were cracked, and flames were visibly emanating.

Accompanied by an earth-shattering roar, the flames on the giant's body reignited.

"Yhorm the Giant — Lonely Lord of the Profaned Capital."

With Yhorm the Giant's roar, the mixed chanting of soprano and tenor reached its crescendo.

Combined with the violin concerto, it instilled in every player a sense of 'epicness'.

But the next moment, all sounds abruptly ceased.

The screen plunged into darkness, and the world fell silent.

The old woman's voice resonated once more.

"Indeed, the Lords will abandon their thrones, and the Ashen Ones will flock here."

"They are nameless, incapable of becoming kindling, and accursed Undead."

A pair of fair hands appeared on screen, slowly placing a blindfold, made of a dark, liquid-like substance flowing from a candelabra, over her eyes. Then the camera zoomed out, and the woman slowly rose.

Her silver-white long hair, black robe, and tall stature made her look like a Saintess.

"For this reason, the Ashen One truly desires embers."

In the darkness, the fire still burned. The blindfolded woman turned, slowly moving forward, carrying a 'corpse'.

Finally, the screen plunged into darkness, and the game title appeared in the center: *Dark Souls*.

Below it, in less conspicuous small print, was a line: Release date to be determined.

P.S.: Will you Link the Fire? If not, hand over your Recommendation tickets and monthly passes, or else the Fire Keeper might drag you away to be burnt as kindling.
