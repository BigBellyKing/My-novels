As time progressed, both projects advanced rapidly.

The new employees who joined later finally understood why Qin Yi, Yang Xin, and Ruan Ningxue held Chen Xu in such high regard. Their daily work was as smooth as silk; everything was handled in one go, without any friction or hindrance whatsoever. It was as if the path forward was coated in lubricant – just run, sprint, and slide, and you'd reach the happy destination.

The entire team had creative discussions, but no arguments. This was because the core of the game was already firmly established. Everyone just needed to experiment towards that goal.

Under such circumstances, even overtime felt like happy overtime. After all, the overtime pay Chen Xu offered at Nebula Games was truly generous, and all sorts of benefits were maximized.

Among the improvements to Sanguosha, most were based on enhancing the player experience rather than altering the rules.

Of course, beyond the rules, Sanguosha still possessed some truly excellent aspects. These were the in-game dialogue and voice acting. It's fair to say these added significant flair to Sanguosha, and could even be considered among the top tier. Many classic lines were particularly memorable for players.

Some players who hadn't played Sanguosha might not know the origin of these lines, yet they might have heard them. For instance, Zhao Yun's 'Advancing and retreating with ease is the mark of a true weapon,' Zhuge Liang's 'Knowing Heaven's will is easy, defying it is hard,' and Guan Yu's 'I see you as merely a marked head for sale.'

As for the gameplay modes, it was provisionally set to a standard 5-player game, meaning one Lord, two Rebels, one Loyalist, and one Spy. Other modes, such as National War Mode, would definitely be saved for later updates. After all, a game truly isn't suitable if its content is too abundant from the start, because players need time to get accustomed and have a learning curve.

Even the Zelda series, hailed as the best in the previous life, from its first 3D installment, Ocarina of Time, to later titles like Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess, and then the renowned Breath of the Wild, showcased content that was outrageously rich at each step, but also progressively introduced players to various systems and content settings.

Therefore, for a game, trying to be comprehensive or presenting a huge amount of content to players at the very beginning can sometimes fail to make players feel how rich your game content is. Instead, they might only feel deterred, because it's too damn complicated; why should playing a game feel like studying for a postgraduate exam, delving into so many system settings!

As for the other game, Fall Guys, it was similar to Overcooked in this regard. Besides enhancing the player experience, the biggest key was game content updates. It would also support integration with the 'Workshop,' allowing players to create their own maps.

In the previous life, many players believed Fall Guys' meteoric rise and subsequent decline were due to cheating. That was indeed a factor, but certainly not the main one. Because if cheating causes a game to decline, there's usually a very clear pattern:

Normal gameplay — encounters cheats — changes mindset — quits the game.

This is the journey of a normal player quitting due to cheats, but it wouldn't cause a game to die out instantly. The core reason that truly caused Fall Guys to decline rapidly was the loss of game content.

As a lighthearted casual game with a variety show obstacle course style, what truly determined its content was the fun derived from overcoming each level. Once players figured out and tired of all the levels, the game essentially lost much of its appeal.

And after the Fall Guys development company in the previous life achieved great success, what did they do? They were certainly creating new levels; that was undeniable. But what they did most was release skins and organize collaborations. By the time they realized that without new maps, the game would die out, it was already too late.

So for Chen Xu, what he had to do was maximize player enthusiasm to last longer, and allow Fall Guys to have a long-term lifespan through the Workshop. As for making it into a timeless multiplayer game, that wasn't realistic. Because Fall Guys' game attributes were similar to those of internet trends. It could be popular for a while, but wanting it to remain popular indefinitely was simply impossible. It wasn't a matter of game quality, but rather a problem with content depth.

................

As the exhibition date drew closer, the atmosphere within Nebula Games was relatively relaxed. This was because the progress of both games was very encouraging. Sanguosha had already begun testing various functions of its online multiplayer version; only some of the generals' voice acting remained to be completed. The same went for Fall Guys; the game's action levels were all finished, and the main remaining content was in the sound effects department.

Within the company, employees from various departments also served as the first batch of testers for the games. However, at present, everyone seemed to prefer Sanguosha a bit more. Mainly, Fall Guys lacked players, so they couldn't experience the chaotic and humorous feeling Chen Xu described. In contrast, Sanguosha, after a brief familiarity with its basic content, was immensely enjoyable to play.

"We were once lord and minister, why must we meet in war?" Yang Xin sighed with a bitter expression.

"The Emperor is foolish and without principle; I merely follow Heaven's will!" Ruan Ningxue gleefully played two 'Southern Barbarian Invasion' cards from her hand, taking away the last two health points of Liu Bei, who was playing as the Lord.

"No way, one more round! I won't accept this! How do you always draw so many Stratagem cards, Xiaoxue? Every time I play Zhuge Liang, I'm left with only one 'Attack' card!" Yang Xin protested, refusing to concede.

"Sister Xin, just admit you have the 'African' attribute (bad luck)," Ruan Ningxue said with a smile.

"By the way, I wonder what that big project Mr. Chen mentioned earlier really is!" Qin Yi, who had been silent, spoke up. During this time, besides the development of Sanguosha and Fall Guys, they were also working on the big project Chen Xu had mentioned before. However, each of them was working separately on their respective tasks, so they weren't clear on the specifics.

"A rather dark Western mythology story, a bit like Ragnarok," Yang Xin, who was in charge of the plot, mused and summarized.

"Pretty much," Ruan Ningxue nodded.

"Mythology? My combat system here feels a bit like medieval knight duels," Qin Yi scratched his head.

"Brother Qin, why think so much? We'll find out when Mr. Chen launches the project," an employee beside him said.

"Exactly! I'm more curious about what kind of cosplayer we'll have for this exhibition – Toriel, Undyne!" another employee exclaimed excitedly.

"It's a shame Mirror (Game) can't participate in the exhibition, otherwise...!" Qin Yi sighed, a hint of disappointment in his voice.

"Pah! Men!" Yang Xin feigned disdain.

"Exactly! How vulgar!" Ruan Ningxue chimed in, supporting her from above.

"That's right, Old Qin, your ideological awareness needs improving. Besides, female cosplayers are a dime a dozen; how can we compete with other companies? If we're going to play, let's play something different. Look at this!" At that moment, Chen Xu and his assistant Lin Rou entered, carrying a large box.
