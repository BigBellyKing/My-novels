Chapter 245: Too Many Choices Is Also a Kind of Suffering! (Seventh update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)

Then followed a simple dialogue cutscene, which allowed Zhang Yi to understand some of the game's story background.

The identity of the Hunter he was now playing was the Reconnaissance Team of the Fifth Fleet, whose purpose was to go to the New World to search for the secrets of Elder Dragon migration.

And forty years had passed since the first investigation.

Thinking of Nergigante in the promotional concept art, and Rathalos in the promotional CG animation, Zhang Yi's heart was filled with anticipation.

At the same time, looking at the cabins packed with Hunters, he felt an even greater sense of emotion.

Just the Fifth Fleet alone had so many companions, not to mention the four Fleets before it.

Once they truly reached the New World, they should all be recruitable teammates.

As for the Mohawk-haired, self-proclaimed familiar Hunter in front of him, according to typical storylines, he would clearly be a good companion for the player.

And judging by the usual trope of stories, a Hunter from each Fleet would likely join the protagonist's party.

Finally, under the protagonist's leadership, they would uncover the secret of the Elder Dragon migration, and the protagonist would become the legendary Azure Star.

Although the game had just begun, Zhang Yi was already mentally picturing the game's plot.

Just as Zhang Yi was fantasizing, the ship in the game suddenly shook violently!

Lights flickered, and the books, wine glasses, and food on the table all fell to the floor.

The ship's entire deck began to tilt.

The Hunters in the cabin were in a chaotic mess.

The Mohawk-haired young man, a member of the Hunter Reconnaissance Team, quickly ran towards the deck.

At the same time, Zhang Yi's bun-haired companion next to him also shouted a line: “Hurry, partner, let's go out and see!”

The investigator, acting as a companion, quickly ran towards the deck, and Zhang Yi's character automatically followed.

A black and white Palico also hopped out behind them.

Arriving on the deck, they saw that the once calm sea was now raging with colossal waves.

Huge waves crashed onto the deck.

The entire ship swayed violently, and all the Hunters could only grab ropes, looking around in panic.

‘CRASH!’

Just as everyone was at a loss, suddenly a colossal, strange black creature, like a volcano, rose from the ocean.

Under the night sky, the previously calm sea suddenly surged violently. A black volcano suddenly rose from the seabed, and the ship, located on its back, was directly split in two.

Amidst the turbulent storm, Zhang Yi noticed that this colossal black volcano was not, in fact, a volcano as he had imagined.

It was actually a living creature!

As this gigantic ‘black volcano’ continuously rose from the water, the ship carrying the Hunters of the Fifth Fleet slid off its back, and the game's protagonist was involuntarily thrown off.

A moment later, the camera moved to the creature's back, where black rocks and flowing lava surrounded them. As for the other Hunters, they had clearly scattered.

At this moment, the receptionist's voice could be heard calling from afar.

Simultaneously, some specific operation guidelines appeared.

Climbing, running, etc...

Clearly, like most games, this was a story segment and tutorial, instructing players on how to play.

However, what truly surprised Zhang Yi was that in his conversation with the receptionist, he learned the name of this volcanic creature: Zorah Magdaros!

“This can't be a monster I'll have to fight later, right? It's so enormous, trimming its nails wouldn't even count! If I really had to fight it, it'd be like scraping calluses!” Zhang Yi, sitting in front of his computer, was utterly stunned.

He had originally thought that the Anjanath, Rathalos from previous trailers, and Nergigante from the promotional concept art, were already excessively large.

And right from the start, he was told that this creature, resembling a volcanic island, was also an Elder Dragon?

Shocking as it was, this segment of the story basically contained little actual content, merely a simple explanation of how to operate in the game.

After one round, Zhang Yi basically understood, and also noticed a characteristic.

“Just like the Undead, they can't jump on the spot, but unlike the Undead, they have the attribute of taking no fall damage – what an invincible enhancement!” Zhang Yi couldn't help but exclaim, looking at his pink-haired, very playful Hunter in the game.

Following the receptionist all the way, Zhang Yi soon controlled his character to climb to the top of Zorah Magdaros's head.

Then a cutscene triggered, where the Hunters in the game used grappling hooks to grab onto Wingdrakes in the air, carrying the investigators away from Zorah Magdaros's body.

This cutscene of leaving Zorah Magdaros's body reminded Zhang Yi of the scenes in Dark Souls when leaving the High Wall of Lothric and the Northern Undead Asylum; there was a slight similarity!

And with this game's vibe of hunting dragons, wasn't it hinting at something?

Inexplicably, a very peculiar feeling arose in Zhang Yi's heart.

But before he could think much more, as the Wingdrake flew through the clouds, the beautiful scenery that appeared before him stunned him.

The sun rose from the horizon, and the outline of the New World appeared in his sight.

Gigantic ancient trees reaching straight into the sky, Aptonoth resting on the coastline.

Peaceful and serene, this scenery, existing only in a fantasy world, made Zhang Yi's eyes widen.

The visual presentation, however, could definitely be considered top-tier.

More importantly, the peculiar art design was absolutely stunning.

After arriving in the New World, Zhang Yi, along with the bun-haired receptionist, understood his basic current situation.

He also learned basic operations like map-reading from the receptionist; the next step was the main quest to find the Hunter base.

However, Zhang Yi didn't rush to advance the main quest immediately.

Instead, he curiously observed his surroundings.

The clear blue sky, floating white clouds, distant ocean waves and sandy beach, and the sea breeze gently swaying the plants, accompanied by chirping insects and birdsongs.

Turning a small corner in the dense forest, he was greeted by another entirely new scene.

On the wide land ahead were many Herbivores foraging; according to the receptionist, these were an extremely docile type of dragon.

Zhang Yi carefully controlled his Hunter, approaching a foraging Herbivore for a close-up observation.

Upon discovering Zhang Yi, the uninvited guest, the creature showed no intention of attacking. Instead, Zhang Yi himself was startled and ran in the opposite direction.

The game's opening, from the shock and tension of Zorah Magdaros to the tranquility of the Ancient Forest, made him feel incredibly impressed.

The next segment of the story was similar to the escape from Zorah Magdaros, except that the escape from Zorah Magdaros taught players normal game operations.

This Ancient Forest segment, however, taught players normal game systems, such as how to read the map, gather resources on the map, what the green Scoutflies were for, hiding from Jagras in the tall grass, and climbing vines.

“Why are there no weapons yet? I can't fight!” Zhang Yi felt a bit pained.

Although the scenery was beautiful, he still wanted to try out the game's combat system with a weapon, as hunting and combat were the core of the game, no matter how he looked at it.

After a slight grumble, Zhang Yi continued to advance the story.

Following the investigator deeper and deeper.

Just as they were about to reach the Fleet's base, Astera Base, they were attacked by a Great Jagras, but luckily the Investigation Leader saved them.

As for the Great Jagras, it became food for the Anjanath.

“That's an Anjanath? I thought it was just a super weak little monster!”

In the cutscene, watching the Anjanath tear at the Great Jagras, Zhang Yi in the game exclaimed.

After all, in the previously released promotional videos and animations, the Anjanath was first beaten badly by Hunters, and then again by Rathalos, giving him the illusion that it was very weak.

But now, looking at its massive body, Zhang Yi had a completely different feeling: it was quite fierce!

After overcoming the danger, they finally arrived at Astera Base.

A massive base built with wood and beast bones, the entire Astera Base looked like a fortress, presenting a strong visual impact.

Inside the base, all the members of the Fifth Fleet they had seen earlier had arrived and were busy transporting supplies.

After a conversation with the Commander-in-Chief, Zhang Yi also took a tour of the Astera Settlement under the guidance of the Squad Leader.

With a high-tower design, from the lowest to the highest level, each floor had different areas and functions.

The lowest level was the commercial district, and further up were the Processing Workshop for forging weapons and armor, dining areas for meals, and the Hunters' quarters.

Besides these, there were also Ecological Research, Botanical Research, Argosy, the Command Center... each scene had its own characteristics.

For example, in the Canteen, a blindfolded Palico and its assistant chefs were enthusiastically preparing various ingredients.

Inside the Processing Workshop, artisans swinging iron hammers were also constantly forging equipment for Hunters.

The entire camp was full of life, with every Hunter performing their respective duties.

After the brief tour and introduction, the Squad Leader led Zhang Yi to the Hunter's Lodge, instructing him to choose a weapon and begin his official hunting quest.

“It's here, it's here, it's finally here!”

Zhang Yi was somewhat excited watching this scene.

The previous series of tutorials, though revealing the beauty of the New World and the grandeur of the Astera Settlement.

He still longed to start hunting quickly.

After all, this game was called Monster Hunter; hunting was the main theme!

But after the excitement, Zhang Yi fell into a state of decision paralysis.

Because there were simply too many weapons in this game!

Having too many weapons to choose from was also a kind of suffering!

He felt like every single one was powerful!
