Chapter 271: A Game Company That Doesn't Make CG Is Not a Good Game Company! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Along with the transmog events and two brand new quests in *Monster Hunter: World*, and the Kingdom of Lordaeron on *Minecraft*'s official server, this quickly caused a stir among the player base.

Because they felt Nebula Games must be hinting at something. Although they couldn't provide any substantial evidence, judging from the style, they could already completely guess.

In *Monster Hunter: World*, whether it was the transmog weapons or monsters like the Frost Dragon and Chimera, they were completely different from the original monsters in *Monster Hunter: World*.

Of course, the difficulty could only be described as moderate; most players could clear it with their own abilities. And the 'cheese' tactics that were ineffective against Tempered monsters could still be used against the Frost Dragon and Chimera. After all, there was no need for it to be too difficult; it was just a warm-up event, incidentally bringing players some new weapon transmogs to make them feel a sense of novelty.

Similarly, the Kingdom of Lordaeron in *Minecraft* also sparked much discussion among players. In terms of scale, there were already many magnificent structures among players. For example, in previous multiplayer mode servers, player-built cities in the sky and Lava Cities were already mostly constructed, showcasing their grandeur.

While this Kingdom of Lordaeron was exquisite, it was still some distance from being truly shocking or stunning, as players had seen many such creations before. But the key was the hidden meaning; after all, it appeared on the official server, and before this, most of the building complexes on the official server were related to Nebula Games.

The 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' and 'Forbidden City' were just building complexes created by Nebula Games for demonstration purposes in the early days, but what about this Kingdom of Lordaeron? Searching through all the games released by Nebula Games, one could say there wasn't a trace of it. So many players had a bold guess: that it might be a new game Nebula Games was currently developing. For this, players online were endlessly debating.

“There's only one truth: the Kingdom of Lordaeron, along with the Frost Dragon and Chimera, must be content from Nebula Games' new title!”

“That's unlikely, right? *Monster Hunter: World* has only been online for just over a month, and they already have a new game?”

“Why not? Nebula Games isn't some small workshop anymore.”

“I still feel it's a bit mystical.”

“But speaking of new titles, a fantasy theme is a given, as Nebula Games excels at making them. But what genre do you think it is? RPG or ARPG, or an action genre like *Monster Hunter: World*?”

“I don't know what genre it is, I just know that Chen Xu is definitely going to pour his love into the game again, and this time, I won't fall for it!”

“+1! Whether it's an RPG or action, damn it, Chen Xu is poisonous; I never expected *Monster Hunter: World* to actually be about monsters hunting us!”

“Heh heh, the two bros upstairs, stop fooling yourselves, okay? Your combined playtime in *Dark Souls* is over 2000 hours, and for *Monster Hunter: World*, do you have eight livers? You've played 210 hours in such a short time online? Is that really seven hours a day on average?”

“What can I do? The Attack Jewels just won't drop!”

“Exactly, besides the one they gave at the start, I haven't gotten a single one yet!”

“You two upstairs, you won't get angry if I say I've already gotten three in less than 100 hours, right? Brother!”

“Lucky King, get lost!”

…………

Players online were discussing the news about *Monster Hunter: World* and *Minecraft* animatedly, while also flooding the official Weibo accounts of Chen Xu and Nebula Games with comments, hoping to get some accurate answers.

However, for now, Chen Xu has not responded to the news. He wanted to let everyone discuss it more; the buzz hadn't fully ignited yet, so adding fuel to the fire now would be a bit premature.

So, Chen Xu was still steadily at Nebula Games, working on the development of *Warcraft* or, more precisely, the design of its CG cutscenes. The framework of *Warcraft* was also slowly being constructed.

The outsourcing for this part still went to the companies that had previously collaborated with Nebula Games. For Chen Xu, he preferred to collaborate again with companies he had worked with before. After all, it was more convenient, including the handover between employees of both companies; with prior experience, efficiency would significantly increase.

Of course, collaborating a second time with a previously partnered company was contingent on them being able to meet Chen Xu's requirements. Otherwise, no matter how cheap or discounted the price, Chen Xu wouldn't continue to cooperate with them. After all, if quality couldn't be guaranteed, what good was a low price?

Chen Xu also provided relatively detailed annotations for the modeling dimensions in the game, some special requirements, and the action design. Therefore, whether it was the art asset modeling or the actions, the other party's efficiency was relatively high. Because they clearly understood the client's exact requirements. Although it was an RTS game, Chen Xu had very high demands for it.

What remained was the production of CG for the game, because a game company that doesn't make CG is not a good game company!

Regarding the storyboarding, it was actually the CG company's job. However, Chen Xu planned to design it himself; after all, his current capabilities were not bad, and with the various presentations of *Warcraft* from his previous life, Chen Xu understood better than anyone else what kind of actions, visuals, and performances he wanted to present. As for why CG was chosen instead of real-time rendering? It was simple: for better expressive results.

Both in this world and his previous one, many games used real-time rendering for in-game cutscenes. The biggest advantage of doing this was saving money. Because it utilized the game's own resources, and with the development of game graphics technology, the effects were definitely not bad. However, upon closer inspection, the difference between CG and real-time rendering was still clearly visible.

Of course, this refers to technology of the same era. To compare CG animation from several years ago with real-time rendered scenes from a game several years later would be unreasonable. For example, the 'Wrath of the Lich King' CG produced by Blizzard in his previous life could be said to be still impressive even ten years later.

Chen Xu placed considerable importance on *Warcraft*; now that he wasn't short on money, he naturally aimed for the best. Of course, the entire game wouldn't be done entirely with CG animation; if so, it would probably take tens of hours, which Chen Xu genuinely couldn't handle. After all, CG was truly expensive, and there were indeed game companies that were almost driven to ruin because of CG.

For example, if one were to name a CG animation company that was 'delayed by games' in his previous life, many would mention Blizzard. But in terms of CG, Blizzard could only barely be considered second place; the true elder brother was Square Enix, who developed the Final Fantasy series.

Blizzard declared: 'I spare no expense for CG animation.' Square Enix declared: 'What is that? I can't even be bothered to make CG animation; if I'm going to do it, I'll make CG movies. For CG movies, I'd even sacrifice my life!'

A major CG movie, *Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within*, almost drove the company to bankruptcy. If that didn't work, they might as well marry an honest person and remarry into a wealthy family. After many years, they had a change of heart, first testing the waters with a 10-minute CG; 'Oh, it seems the audience likes it!' they thought. So, why not continue? Then this time, they changed their strategy: 'Let's target the DVD market instead of the big screen.' Wow! They made a fortune! And this CG movie was the famous *Advent Children*.

Then they got carried away again. Square Enix declared, 'What are other game developers doing for game promotion?' 'Promotional videos? Lame! We'll coordinate with a full-length CG movie!' And then? They almost lost their pants (lost everything). So, while Nebula Games was wealthy now, if they were to produce CG animation for the entire game, it would still be a bit much to handle.

Chen Xu's idea was to choose key plot points and major scenes in the game for CG production, such as Arthas's transformation, the final epic battle between Illidan and Arthas, Jaina's display of deep father-daughter affection leading to Rexxar killing Daelin in the Battle of Theramore Isle... Although even just making these would still incur extremely high costs, Chen Xu considered it very worthwhile. By establishing the *Warcraft* IP, there would be plenty of opportunities to make money in the future.
