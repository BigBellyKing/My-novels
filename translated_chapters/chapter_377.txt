The popularity of Red Dead Redemption was soaring, coupled with Chen Xu's considerable reputation among players.

This official Weibo post immediately caught the attention of players.

However, the content within it sparked much discussion among them.

'The final ending satisfies us? Mr. Chen is lying again!'

'Satisfied? Absolutely not! We strongly demand Arthur's resurrection!'

Looking at Chen Xu's official Weibo, many players saddened by Arthur's death vented their emotions through comments.

But there were also many players who grew even more curious about the final ending Chen Xu mentioned.

And these players clearly understood one thing:

Arthur's death was almost an unchangeable fact.

Given this, what would the subsequent story be like?

What would become of the Van der Linde gang members?

After venting on the official Weibo, Song Ren, like many other players, entered the game to play from John Marston's perspective.

The timeline had now advanced to eight years after Arthur's death.

During this period, John Marston had been living incognito with his wife Abigail and son Little Jack.

The game's story leaned more towards a peaceful, family-oriented narrative.

Taking his wife and son, John Marston found work on a ranch near Strawberry Town.

He lived a simple life, milking cows and chopping wood.

Then there was the ranch owner's wife, who even wanted to invite John Marston to her room for a cup of coffee.

Well, let's skip that part.

Most cowboys, in reality, were different from the imagined figures who lived by the gun, licking blood from their revolvers.

They were more often found milking cows, helping mares give birth to foals, and engaging in other farm activities.
