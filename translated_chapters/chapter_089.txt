Chapter 89: Heated Discussion

After a full day of the exhibition, Chen Xu, along with the various staff members of Nebula Games and the cosers, were all utterly exhausted.

This was mainly due to the immense enthusiasm of the players.

Although both Sanguosha and Fall Guys could be downloaded onto mobile phones and played as long as one was inside the exhibition hall.

But with so many players attending, and combined with Nebula Games' themed exhibition booth, it truly heated up the atmosphere.

And the most crucial point was that players kept coming in waves, one group leaving and another arriving.

The entire exhibition would be held for five days, and after the initial rush of the first day, the popularity of Nebula Games' exhibition area hadn't diminished in the slightest.

In fact, due to the word-of-mouth from players who visited Nebula Games' exhibition area on the first day and experienced Fall Guys and Sanguosha.

On the second and third days, more and more players flocked to Nebula Games' area.

The exhibition's official organizers even had to dispatch another batch of security personnel to Exhibition Hall 6, or specifically Nebula Games' exhibition area, to maintain order on site.

It was clear that Nebula Games had become the most dazzling highlight of this exhibition.

Even the long-awaited VR blockbusters from NetDragon and TengHua, which players had anticipated, saw their hype gradually overshadowed by the craze for Fall Guys and Sanguosha.

There was no way around it; although both of these games were VR blockbusters.

But the key was that there was still a long time before their launch, and even if TengHua and NetDragon were giants in the gaming industry, it was impossible for them to start large-scale promotion at this time.

Their participation in this exhibition was merely a suitable warm-up.

But who knew they would run into such a situation.

As for why they couldn't compete in popularity, it was also very simple.

Because players couldn't even experience the game content!

For a VR game, players had to queue up to experience it, and with limited time, each player could only play for about ten minutes to get a feel for the game's quality.

Simply put, it was just to let players have a taste, naturally incomparable to Fall Guys and Sanguosha.

Although they could only be played within the exhibition area, it's important to know that both of these games allowed players to experience the complete content.

What's more, both Sanguosha and Fall Guys were incredibly addictive!

Thus, a very peculiar phenomenon appeared at this year's exhibition.

No matter which exhibition area you visited, you could see people in line holding their mobile phones and power banks, playing Fall Guys and Sanguosha while they waited.

And with the sensational performance at the exhibition, on the first day, mainstream media still focused on TengHua and NetDragon's VR blockbusters.

But on the second, third, and fourth days... basically, all gaming news was completely dominated by Fall Guys and Sanguosha.

It directly ignited the entire gaming industry, becoming the main topic of discussion.

………………

In a chat group for industry designers, many designers were discussing the news about Nebula Games' two games at this year's gameplay Expo.

"Who among you attended this year's gameplay Expo? What's the deal with Chen Xu's new games?"

"Yeah, insider bros, tell us, what's up with Sanguosha and Fall Guys?"

"A strategy Three Kingdoms board game card game, and a cartoon-style variety show obstacle course game."

"The game quality is indeed quite good. Sanguosha has more content depth, but Fall Guys is a bit 'demonic' (addictive). Even now, my head is filled with that brainwashing music and those wobbly little characters."

"+1, it's really super addictive!"

"The high popularity is partly due to game quality, but more importantly, Chen Xu's promotion strategy was brilliant!"

"Exactly, if we're talking about the best promotion at this gameplay Expo, I only salute Chen Xu, okay!"

"Yeah! From the showgirls and cosers to the games, he calculated everything!"

"Next time, I feel mobile games might see a boom. Mainly because Chen Xu is too cunning. Everyone else was queuing, but his new games could be played anywhere, anytime in the venue, and that's how it spread directly."

"Don't even think about next time! Do you think other game developers and designers won't think of it? Chen Xu was the first to 'eat the crab' (try something new) and got results. If you try to do the same thing next year, you won't even get warm shit (it will be too late and ineffective)."

"I can only say that Chen Xu really mastered this year's gameplay Expo."

"Do you think Sanguosha and Fall Guys will become the next trendsetters for small-scale games, just like Overcooked before?"

"Highly likely! The players at the exhibition were practically addicted, and online players are equally hyped!"

Many game designers who were sensitive to the market had a flash of inspiration, seeing the current online popularity of Fall Guys and Sanguosha.

If Sanguosha and Fall Guys could lead the next wave of casual games, then quickly developing at this time to be among the first batch of copycat games would very likely allow them to "drink a mouthful of soup" (get a share of the profits)!

Although those who previously jumped on the Overcooked bandwagon basically didn't make any waves.

But at least that first batch of games didn't lose money, and even made a little profit.

And these two games, Fall Guys and Sanguosha, are also completely different from Overcooked.

Non-cooperative games naturally have a wider player base.

At the same time, the current expectations of online players can be said to be very high!

Designers from many small and medium-sized developers in the industry were calculating in their minds.

Meanwhile, in major player communities, players were also buzzing with discussion.

"I can only say, Chen Xu really wasn't lying this time! Fall Guys is truly a blast to play!"

"I'm at the exhibition right now, already looking forward to tomorrow coming quickly. I'm addicted to Sanguosha!"

"So envious! After the exhibition, Chen Xu should launch these two games, right? From the online videos, their completion level is very high!"

As the exhibition progressed, the popularity of Fall Guys and Sanguosha continued to ferment.

More and more players began to learn about these two special new games at the exhibition.

Seeing players who attended the exhibition showing off their gaming video experiences online.

Consequently, many players petitioned under Chen Xu's official Weibo account, asking him to release the games.

In reality, this kind of behavior was basically just players unilaterally letting off steam.

They didn't expect to receive any reply at all.

But to the surprise of all players, on the fourth day of the exhibition, Chen Xu actually replied on his official Weibo account.

Under the players' eager anticipation, Chen Xu's official Weibo account simply replied with one sentence: "Sanguosha and Fall Guys will be launched early on the Nebula Games platform. Sanguosha will be a free-to-play game, while Fall Guys will be a buy-to-play game priced at 48 Yuan."

This timing was just right, right before the end of the gameplay Expo.

The game's popularity was at its peak.

Many players had long had their hearts itching with anticipation due to all sorts of news spreading from the gameplay Expo.

After Chen Xu posted this message, players who had the Nebula Games platform immediately chose to log in, download, and purchase.

And those who didn't have it immediately went to download it.

As for all of this, it was naturally all part of Chen Xu's plan.

Combining with the inherent popularity and traffic of gameplay Expo, he conducted scarcity marketing, thereby achieving the goal of promoting the Nebula Games platform.

Although many people criticize scarcity marketing, it must be said that it is indeed very effective, especially when the hype has been built up.

Of course, it shouldn't be overdone, otherwise players would curse them for "playing monkeys" (treating them like fools), which would be counterproductive.

(PS: I'm inexperienced, I heard there are things called recommendation tickets and monthly passes. Can someone bring them out for the author to see? [adorable face])
