Chapter 156: Can This Game Still Be Played? (Sixth update, requesting subscriptions, monthly passes)

For players of Dark Souls, "it's like New Year's again" perfectly describes the feeling.

In fact, hearing news about a prequel made many fervent Dark Souls players even more excited than New Year's.

Meanwhile, in Nebula Games' office, Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, Qin Yi, and others sitting in the meeting room wore bewildered expressions.

Outside, players were incredibly excited, major game media outlets reported the news of a Dark Souls sequel coming, and fellow designers and developers in the gaming industry quietly observed.

But the insiders knew the truth: this so-called prequel hadn't even had a folder created for it!

Even the image Chen Xu posted on the official Weibo account was temporarily pulled from last year's promotional materials.

And everyone in the meeting today clearly understood that it was basically convened for this Dark Souls prequel game.

“Mr. Chen, there's only a little over a month until the gameplay Expo. Trying to get a playable demo out isn't very realistic!” Before the meeting even started, Qin Yi, sitting below Chen Xu, whispered to him.

“Yeah, even though the overall framework is there, a month is too rushed, isn't it?” Ruan Ningxue also chimed in.

Everyone shared the same sentiment: creating a playable test version for players at the gameplay Expo would be too difficult.

Even with daily overtime, it felt like they wouldn't make the deadline.

“Why are you all so flustered? Whether it's interviews or the official Weibo account, didn't I say? During the gameplay Expo, we'll bring players new content. Isn't a trailer also content?” Chen Xu sighed, looking at everyone.

In terms of professional capability, Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and Qin Yi had also continuously learned and improved over the past two years, becoming fully capable of working independently.

They could complete the tasks he assigned very well, but they still lacked a bit in personal understanding.

As gaming industry professionals, they hadn't even mastered the most basic skill.

Can a game developer who can't 'make grand promises' be considered a qualified developer?

Look at those renowned game developers and producers in his previous life; which one wasn't proficient in all sorts of 'making grand promises' techniques?

Their official Weibo accounts would post various photoshoots with celebrities, making people suspect they were using public funds to chase stars, and occasionally a photo from a trip or of a dish. When asked about game progress by players, the answer would definitely be 'it's being made'.

And a company starting with 'B' [Blizzard] was even more extreme: at an exhibition, they would directly display a game title, then play a magnificent series theme song with scene texture stretching camera shots, and that would be it.

At least here, he was preparing to make a promotional CG!

After listening to Chen Xu, everyone was speechless, but also relaxed.

Because viewed this way, the time was actually quite ample.

One must remember that at this time last year, they were developing Sanguosha and Fall Guys while simultaneously producing promotional CG.

As for this year, although the time was about a month shorter than last year.

They only needed to focus on one project.

Moreover, the Dark Souls framework itself was already in place, which would save a lot of time for subsequent development.

Glancing at the time, staff from all departments had arrived. Chen Xu also stood up to conduct today's meeting.

“Alright, I believe everyone is clear on today’s meeting topic.” Chen Xu said, opening his laptop on the conference table.

A document appeared on the projector screen behind him, with the title: Dark Souls Prequel.

Below it was a subtitle: Age of the First Flame.

The attendees didn't show too much surprise about this.

Because Chen Xu had already revealed this prequel game to players on his official Weibo account, with the game's background set in ancient times, the era of the very first linking of the Fire.

So, this subtitle was also consistent with the game's plot.

The only thing everyone was curious about was what differences this prequel game would have compared to its predecessor.

“The Dark Souls prequel won't undergo too many changes in its combat system, aside from some numerical adjustments,” Chen Xu said, looking at everyone, first establishing a cornerstone of the game.

Chen Xu had no intention of changing the core combat system.

Because, in his previous life, the combat system styles of Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 3 were essentially the same, as both were helmed by Hidetaka Miyazaki.

It was just that due to technical limitations, some 'difficulties' arose in the details.

The most direct example was when drinking Estus Flasks in the game.

In Dark Souls 3, players could move slightly while drinking potions, the biggest advantage being a more fluid combat experience.

In Dark Souls 1, however, drinking potions was a static action. This was a technological limitation, as early Hidetaka Miyazaki had virtually no funds when developing Dark Souls 1. The highly artistic maps weren't decided upon from the start; rather, they were a compromise due to insufficient budget, yet they unexpectedly became the most classic aspect.

Of course, drinking potions in Dark Souls 1 wasn't the most 'pained expressions' inducing aspect. Even more so was Dark Souls 2, which many Dark Souls players had disowned from the 'Souls series' lineage. It added a 'swiftness attribute' to the game's settings, resulting in an incredibly 'pained expressions' inducing experience when drinking healing items in the early game. Especially with the speed of the Deprived starting class, countless players complained that they might as well be drinking urea bottles, otherwise why would it be so hard to swallow.

Of course, Dark Souls 2 wasn't without its merits. Aside from map design, its combat system leaned more towards a 'sense of realism'. However, this was completely different from Dark Souls 1's inherent style, leading to a situation where some players who had played Dark Souls 1 liked it and considered it an improvement, while those who disliked it found it 'utterly disappointing', as a series game, it directly changed its game style.

Therefore, Chen Xu largely did not intend to change the combat system, only making some minor adjustments to the details.

As for BOSS and monster settings, Chen Xu skipped them for now, as they didn't need to be addressed at the moment.

So currently, Chen Xu's main focus was explaining the game's map design combined with its game mechanisms, so that everyone could understand the differences in this game.

“The biggest difference from the predecessor is that we'll be doing a large number of reworks on the map. The interconnected design feature will be even more vividly expressed in the prequel, becoming one of the core player experiences. So, to allow players to more subtly feel its charm, there will be some small changes in game mechanisms at that time.” Chen Xu said, smiling at everyone.

Small changes in game mechanisms?

Hearing Chen Xu's words, Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin looked curious, but seeing Chen Xu's faint smile, they somehow felt that these 'small changes' might not be so small after all.

Sure enough, the next moment, Chen Xu's explanation stunned them.

“For example, bonfires in the game cannot be directly teleported from.” Seeing everyone's curious expressions, Chen Xu seemed to recall something and smiled widely.

“Bon... Bonfires cannot teleport?!” Qin Yi's eyes widened.

Including Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, and other employees in the meeting room, everyone looked shocked.

They hadn't misheard, had they?

Bonfires on the game map cannot teleport?

If there was one thing in Dark Souls that made players feel most at ease, what would it be?

It was the bonfire.

Because upon reaching a bonfire, you could return to the Firelink Shrine and 'communicate' with the Fire Keeper, essentially saving your progress.

But now bonfires couldn't teleport?

Can this game still be played?!

If they wanted to go back and see the Fire Keeper, they would probably have to trek through mountains and rivers, overcoming numerous obstacles.

And what if they were carrying tens of thousands of souls, wanted to go back to level up, and then died twice on the way? Wouldn't that completely numb a person?
