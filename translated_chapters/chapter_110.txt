Chapter 110: Online Press Conference

On the official Weibo account, every day, many players would @ Chen Xu.

As for the main content, besides the loyal players who were still playing *Sanguosha* and *Fall Guys*, most were players looking forward to *Dark Souls*.

The official news released so far was roughly a promotional trailer shown at an exhibition, along with various Concept Art for weapons and scenes.

The only things players could understand about this game were that the protagonist seemed to be meant to Link the Fire of hope, and that the game's worldview would be relatively dark, with a high probability of being somewhat heart-wrenching, like *Valiant Hearts: The Great War*.

However, many players expressed that they could already accept this.

It was just that the game's plot was a bit more heart-wrenching.

Having just experienced the tear-jerker that was *Valiant Hearts: The Great War*, they could still endure it.

The only remaining question was when the game would be released.

As for the players' enthusiasm, Chen Xu did not make them wait long.

Advertisements for *Dark Souls* appeared on various game media websites and video websites.

And it made many people excited, because these advertisements mentioned many things.

For example, its unique freedom and distinctive combat system, all of which made players highly anticipate it.

At the same time, the physical edition of *Dark Souls* was already in production.

Unlike his previous life, in this Parallel World, the main medium was still digital games.

As for the physical edition, it was more for collecting, such as purchasing the corresponding deluxe edition, which would include some collectible figures, an official art book, and other such items.

However, for players, the most exciting news was that this time for *Dark Souls*, Nebula Games would be holding an Online Live Broadcast Press Conference, bringing the latest Actual Gameplay Demonstration of the game, as well as its release and launch date.

These announcements, combined with the promotion, instantly ignited the popularity of *Dark Souls*.

The gaming industry was also surprised by this.

'Chen Xu seems to attach great importance to *Dark Souls*!'

'Indeed, judging from the current promotional scale, while it can't compare to top-tier projects from TengHua and NetDragon, it's still a major investment on the PC platform, isn't it?'

'After all, it's Chen Xu's first big-budget production, and frankly, Nebula Games' risk resistance capability is very high now!'

'That's right, not to mention the long-term operation of *Sanguosha*, *Fall Guys* alone after the New Year has already made Nebula Games a fortune.'

'But I'm more interested in *Dark Souls*, this ARPG. From Nebula Games' external promotion, it seems a bit different from traditional ARPGs!'

'How can it be different? Can an ARPG break new ground? It's either story-driven, action-oriented, or focused on numerical balancing. Aren't these the main types of ARPGs?'

'I don't think it will be that simple. After all, every one of Chen Xu's works since his debut has been quite unexpected.'

'Although that's true, his previous games weren't large-scale games. This is Chen Xu's first time involved in major projects, so it's not guaranteed that he'll perform well.'

As Nebula Games began its promotional warm-up for *Dark Souls*, many game designers in the industry started discussing it.

However, ordinary players completely ignored these elements; they just eagerly awaited the time to pass quickly so they could attend Nebula Games' online press conference sooner and get the news of *Dark Souls*' official launch.

………………

Time advanced, and soon it was that day.

The live broadcast venue was in Nebula Games' office, but it had been specially decorated. On the table were custom-made Fire Keeper collectible figures from *Dark Souls*, and a bonfire with a Coiled Sword stuck in it.

Behind it hung *Dark Souls* art concept posters.

On all major live streaming platforms, Nebula Games' live stream room was featured on the homepage.

Nebula Games had already arranged this with the major live streaming platforms. It was a win-win business cooperation.

This online press conference would also include some bullet comment lottery events, giving away limited edition collectible figures and deluxe edition games for *Dark Souls*, and also randomly drawing some ordinary players to give away standard edition game CD keys.

The live broadcast hadn't started yet; the live stream room only showed the background.

However, a great many players, who had arrived upon hearing the news, were already sending bullet comments in the live stream room. Even with the setting of one comment every thirty seconds, the bullet comments streamed like snowflakes.

Clearly, through its many previous quality independent games, Nebula Games still had considerable player attention.

Of course, most of them were probably just watching the excitement.

After confirming all the segments, including the video stream playback and related screen transitions, Chen Xu appeared on camera precisely on time.

“Hello, player friends watching the live broadcast! I am Chen Xu, the lead producer of *Dark Souls*. I believe everyone here today is focused on one thing, so I won’t waste time with pleasantries. Let's get straight to the point and first take a look at what the actual in-game performance of *Dark Souls* looks like!”

Without any unnecessary opening remarks or pleasantries, Chen Xu got straight to the point.

After all, this was an online game launch press conference; everyone was here to see the game. Why bother with so many irrelevant things?

As Chen Xu's words fell, the live stream room instantly switched to another screen.

Unlike the previous promotional animation.

This time, it was a pure actual gameplay demonstration animation.

One could clearly see the UI display interface appearing in the video.

The video, lasting about one minute, primarily featured a BOSS battle and a regular mob battle.

First to catch the eye was Gundyr the Ash from Firelink Shrine.

Its massive body looked incredibly imposing, especially the glaive-like weapon in its hand, which was terrifying.

After the BOSS swung its weapon, the video clearly showed cracks appearing on the ground.

The character in the video was re-recorded by Chen Xu later.

It was mainly used to demonstrate some basic game operations, such as blocking, rolling, parrying, execution, and backstabs on mobs.

Of course, to give players sufficient surprise, Gundyr the Ash's second phase was directly skipped in the video.

At the same time, actions like jumping while running, and in-game messages serving as hints on the ground, were basically all showcased in the video.

In response, countless players watching the live broadcast, as well as some concerned media and industry designers, discussed animatedly, each having their own opinions.
