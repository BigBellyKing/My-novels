The next day at ten in the morning, in an office building in Modu.

Chen Xu had just finished signing the lease agreement with the agent and the landlord, and was now sitting on the sofa chatting with Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue.

“Chen Xu, the rent for this office building must be quite a sum each month, right?” Yang Xin asked casually, looking at the surrounding layout.

“Hmm, we’ve signed for three months for now. The rent is manageable; it’s mainly the game development machines and other office equipment that are the biggest expenses.”

Regarding the rent, it’s 5 Yuan per square meter per day. He rented two open-plan rooms, totaling 160 square meters. Just the rent alone is 24,000 Yuan a month, with property management fees of 20 Yuan per square meter per month calculated separately. Of course, if they were in a smaller city, this amount might only be a tenth. But that’s clearly unrealistic, as the talent gap between small and large cities is simply too significant.

“That’s simple,” Yang Xin, sitting nearby, volunteered readily. “My company just closed down anyway, and all sorts of development prototypes and such are already available. Chen Xu, you can just give me a little something for them then.”

“But speaking of which, are we the only two main developers in this company?” Yang Xin asked Chen Xu.

Currently, including himself, the company has a total of four employees. Yang Xin will be doing game development with him, while the other two were employees from Yang Xin’s previous company. One is responsible for finance and administration, and the other for operations. After testing their work capabilities, Chen Xu hired them both.

“Yes, it’s just the two of us right now, but the core team is missing a Lead Artist!” Chen Xu sighed, then his eyes drifted to Ruan Ningxue, who was holding an ice cream stick beside him.

In Chen Xu’s plan, besides himself, he needed someone with considerable artistic talent. And Ruan Ningxue was his target.

As for the team only having three people, Chen Xu wasn’t worried about that. After all, the game development industry in this world was different from his previous life; a core development team of three was currently enough according to Chen Xu’s plan.

Chen Xu himself could handle the numerical design, level design, and core game design. Most of the remaining content, such as art modeling output, could be entrusted to outsourcing teams. Because these weren’t highly technical tasks, they just required a lot of time. Although outsourcing these aspects would certainly incur higher costs, Chen Xu was more willing to invest financial capital rather than time.

All that remained was whether he could ‘lure’ Ruan Ningxue into the team. After witnessing Ruan Ningxue’s artistic prowess during the development of *Mirror (Game)*, Chen Xu had set his sights on her.

“Exactly, Ningxue, join us… Oh right, Mr. Chen, what’s our company called?” Yang Xin suddenly remembered something and asked.

“Nebula Games,” Chen Xu said with a hint of helplessness.

“Actually, Senior Sister, I think there isn’t much difference between comics and games; both are meant to present stories from the heart to readers and players,” Chen Xu said earnestly, looking at Ruan Ningxue. “And in the future, Nebula Games will also have comic-related business. For some games, we’ll release corresponding comic volumes and such. If Senior Sister is interested, you can absolutely continue working on this area then.”

Game extensions into comics, or comic adaptations into games, these were actually very normal operations. And unlike his previous life, where most comic adaptations into games were essentially just cash grabs from fans, in this Parallel World, Chen Xu understood that while most game design philosophies lagged behind his previous life, comic-adapted games were uniquely leading the pack.

Hearing Chen Xu’s words, Ruan Ningxue showed a moved expression. Finally, as if having made up her mind, she nodded and said, “So, from now on, I should call you Mr. Chen, Junior Brother!”

“It’s just a title; Senior Sister can call me whatever feels natural,” Chen Xu said with a smile, seeing Ruan Ningxue join the team.

“Xiaoxue, how could you agree so readily? I clearly used to ‘draw such big cakes’ for you too!” Yang Xin, nearby, looked speechless. Although Ruan Ningxue joining made her happy too, the key was that she didn't know how many times she had tried to persuade her without success, so why did it work now that it was Chen Xu?

“Sister Xin, yours was purely ‘drawing big cakes.’ Even if you succeeded with one game, I wouldn’t even consider it,” Ruan Ningxue said, exasperated. Chen Xu had *Mirror (Game)* as a baseline, plus a very clear direction for the company’s development. On your side, the more games you made, the smaller your company became, and the fewer people you had.

“Alright, to celebrate Senior Sister joining us, I’ll go over some upcoming arrangements,” Chen Xu said, looking at the two of them.

Hearing Chen Xu’s words, even though they had just joined and didn’t even have office equipment yet, both Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue showed serious and expectant expressions. After all, they joined Chen Xu’s company not to idle away their days, but to achieve something.

“Next, we’re going to develop a new game, a metagame-type game,” Chen Xu said.

Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue showed confused expressions. Metagame, yuan-game?

“A metagame? Aren’t we continuing to develop 18R games?” Ruan Ningxue asked, a little surprised.

“Of course not. 18R games are just our starting capital,” Chen Xu shook his head. He had no intention of building an Illusion (developer)-like company in this Parallel World.

“But Mr. Chen, what kind of game is a metagame?” Yang Xin was a little bewildered. She had, after all, developed three games and even earned the title of Game Designer. But she had never even heard of this so-called metagame. As for Ruan Ningxue next to her, there was even less to say.

“Simply put, a metagame refers to content within a game that breaks away from the game itself, creating a direct interaction between the game and the player,” Chen Xu explained.

“Have you read *Don Quixote*? In that novel, the author occasionally steps into the story, commenting on the plot,” Chen Xu explained.

“Breaking the Fourth wall?” Yang Xin was still a bit confused, but Ruan Ningxue seemed to grasp it.

“Exactly,” Chen Xu nodded with a smile. Regarding metagames, Chen Xu had noticed that some types had already appeared in the Parallel World, but they hadn't yet formed a complete system. Similar applications existed in novels, comics, and other genres, but they hadn't become a distinct category either.

“Our next new game will be a metagame, and its name is *Undertale*. I’ll explain the more detailed content when we begin work.”

“Of course, besides *Undertale*, during this period we will also develop a DLC character pack for *Mirror (Game)*, to sell more while the heat hasn’t dissipated yet.”
