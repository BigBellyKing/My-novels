For many timid players, this installment of "Resident Evil Village" was an absolutely perfect work. It wouldn't make players feel too scared, yet it wouldn't devolve into an action-shooter game either. One could say it struck a perfect balance, making the experience very comfortable for many players.

Especially the Lady and her three daughters in the first stage provided plenty of amusement for many old lecherous men, letting them indulge to their heart's content.

At this moment, Song Ren's mood was surging with excitement.

"Mr. Chen really knows his stuff! This peeping perspective gives me a criminal feeling."

Inside the game, the Lady sat before a luxurious dressing table, reporting the situation to Mother Miranda. Outside the window, a pair of sly eyes watched her. Ethan, controlled by Song Ren, cautiously peeked through the window crack, observing the Lady's graceful figure inside. Her dressing table and her stool, they were truly enormous!

'Mother Miranda, I regret to inform you, Ethan Winters escaped from that idiot Heisenberg.' 'Because he's in my castle, and my daughters can't handle him! If I find him...'
The Lady, holding the phone, suppressed her anger.
'No... Mother Miranda, yes, I am, of course, aware of the ritual's importance. I will not disappoint you.'

Hanging up the phone, the Lady sat in silence for a moment, then abruptly stood up, grabbing the dressing table. She astonishingly lifted it high and smashed it aside.
'To hell with your ritual! I'll make that wretched man pay...'

Watching the Lady angrily leave the room, Song Ren couldn't help but click his tongue. With that kind of strength, hitting Ethan would be like an adult beating a child, wouldn't it?

After confirming her departure, Song Ren secretly slipped into the room. A bunch of keys hung on a lamp in the corner, though he didn't know what doors they opened yet. Putting away the keys, Song Ren was about to open the door and look around for any other collectibles. However, the moment he opened the door.

"Damn it!" A startled cry escaped Song Ren's lips. A colossal figure bent over and entered the doorway – it was the Lady who had just left. She snatched Ethan.
'Found you!'
'All for a child who isn't even here!'
'You ungrateful scum!'
'Sneaking into my house and daring to lay your filthy hands on my daughters!'
'And now you try to steal my things, you're utterly audacious!'

The Lady, gripping Ethan, fully displayed her furious strength, violently throwing Ethan to the ground and smashing through the floor. With a crash, and Ethan's scream, he fell directly into the basement.

'Rest while you can! I will show you what fear is, and then utterly destroy you!'
Listening to the Lady's voice in his ear, Ethan retorted with a bold challenge:
'Bring it on, who's afraid of whom?'

Looking up at the hole above, Ethan shook his head and observed the basement with his pistol. It appeared to be a storage area beneath the castle, a cramped space filled with cluttered items, and very winding.

However, what gave Song Ren some relief was that the basement wasn't very dark; almost every corner had a kerosene lamp, which could be said to be full of goodwill.

After winding through the basement, Song Ren finally found an iron gate, just like the one before entering the castle. Creak... Ethan reached for the latch with his right hand, pushing with effort.

"Wait, what's that sound? Footsteps!?" Song Ren paused slightly as he pushed the iron gate, because a muffled thud of footsteps reached his ears. But he hadn't encountered any monsters in this basement before, so whose footsteps were those? Before he could even turn around, the next second he saw a cold glint flash, followed by Ethan's arm being severed and breaking off.

Turning his head, the Lady stood there with a sinister grin, five blade-like claws on her hand. That single strike had directly severed his right wrist, and blood suddenly spurted from the wound.

'Did you think I'd let you escape? I'll tear you limb from limb! Don't even dream of seeing that child!'
Accompanied by the Lady's roar, the escape began anew.

In the narrow basement, clutching his severed hand, Song Ren fled frantically, feeling utterly helpless.

"Damn it, his left hand was messed up, now it's his right hand's turn. What kind of karma is Ethan building up?!"

You thought losing two fingers, taking an arrow to the knee, being stabbed in the stomach by a contrarian, and then having his blood drained by the big Lady, with hooks piercing his hand and knee joints, was already bad enough?

It turns out that was nothing. Now, another "physical breakup" was directly staged, switching from his left hand in the previous game to his right.

With his right hand severed, Song Ren realized he couldn't use weapons, nor could he use hand sanitizer.

Leading the Lady on a chase through the basement, he showcased a wave of King Qin's Pillar-Circling technique. During this, he even retrieved his severed right hand, which was utterly absurd.

After getting his hand back, Ethan frantically pushed the railing, but then the Lady reappeared, hitting him with a claw that turned the screen blood-red. He was clearly in a near-death state, prompting him to run around in a panic.

Finally, passing through the basement stairs, he arrived at a circular platform scene resembling an elevator in a Souls-like game, and took down the sculpture in the middle.

Boom... A tremor, and the elevator began to ascend slowly, leaving only the Lady's exasperated curses.

"My hand... can it still be saved?" Song Ren looked at his severed hand, feeling a pang of discomfort.

He had previously lost two fingers and thought they would grow back, but they were still missing. Now his entire right hand was gone.

Just as Song Ren was feeling discomfort, Ethan in the game pulled out a bottle of hand sanitizer with his left hand, which only had three fingers remaining.

Splash, the hand sanitizer was poured onto his severed right arm. Then he took out his newly retrieved right hand, aimed it at the broken wound, and reattached it.

He then twisted it left and right a few times, and just like that, as the circular elevator ascended to the castle's central plaza, his wrist was reattached.

Aside from the visible tear in his sleeve, the hand looked as good as new.

"What is this? What is this? This is utterly insane!" Song Ren was dumbfounded. He had thought that Ethan would reattach his hand later; after all, how could he use weapons without a hand?

But he never imagined it would be this method.

This was an absolute medical miracle!

Healing wounds with hand sanitizer was one thing, but this hand sanitizer could reattach severed hands too?

At least in the previous game, they stapled it back on!
