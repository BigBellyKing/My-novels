Chapter 720: Doesn't He Know Who the Support Is? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

“Your level is too high, isn't it? And your equipment, how is it so good?”

Zhang Yi, who had just reached level 16 and had painstakingly farmed for a Black King Bar according to recommended equipment, glanced at Wang Han's Ogre Magi next to him.

At this moment, her Ogre Magi was already level 18 and had learned its third-level ultimate ability. Its equipment was also quite luxurious: Power Treads, Hand of Midas, Force Staff, Magic Wand, and an Urn of Shadows.

His Dragon Knight, on the other hand, only had Power Treads, Black King Bar, Blink Dagger, and a Sange, still a little short on gold to get a Heaven's Halberd.

During the Laning Phase, he thought that the Ogre Magi was only slightly strong in the early game. After all, if a support isn't strong early on, how can they protect their carry through the early game and into the late game?

But by mid-game, he noticed something was off.

Wang Han's Ogre Magi, ever since getting the Hand of Midas, could actually trigger the hero's ultimate ability Multicast when using Hand of Midas, transmuting two units at once. At level three, it could even transmute three units.

Besides turning units into 160 gold, the Hand of Midas's more crucial effect was boosting the original experience by 2.1 times. And this item's cooldown was only 90 seconds.

Furthermore, Multicast could also trigger other corresponding skills.

An Ogre Magi at level 18, facing a Windranger with half health who had activated Windrun, cast a Fireblast.

In Zhang Yi's bewildered gaze, a '×4' symbol appeared above Windranger's head.

‘Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!’

After four consecutive explosions, the low-health Windranger was instantly killed.

A deep voice resonated across the entire match: [Godlike]

Watching the Blue Ogre, who had already racked up nine kills, Zhang Yi couldn't help but feel speechless.

He then compared his hero's stats with hers. He had a talent that granted extra armor, yet his armor was only 6 points higher than hers.

As for health, Power Treads, Black King Bar, Sange, and two Strength Bracers he hadn't sold yet—all health-boosting items—only gave him 400 more health than the Blue Ogre.

This hero, with such stats, was a support?

He felt it was utterly absurd!

“Why do you keep casting Bloodlust on me? Doesn't it cost mana? I already have the buff, you don't need to cast it on me, there's still two-thirds of the duration left.” Zhang Yi asked, somewhat confused, seeing the Blue Ogre cast Bloodlust on him again.

Ever since the Laning Phase ended, why did she keep casting Bloodlust on him?

The skill didn't even stack!

Zhang Yi finally couldn't help but voice his confusion.

Hearing Zhang Yi's words, Wang Han, sitting beside him, rolled her eyes: “What do you know! I'm priming a hit.”

As she spoke, Wang Han watched as the Bloodlust didn't trigger Multicast. She walked towards Zhang Yi, who was last-hitting creeps, and then activated the Hand of Midas skill: Transmute.

In Zhang Yi's dumbfounded expression, four of the creeps in front of them instantly turned into a pile of gold, flying towards the Blue Ogre. At the same time, the Blue Ogre immediately leveled up to 19.

“Quadruple the fun, excellent!” Wang Han beamed.

“That works too! You can even trigger quadruple with such a low probability!?” Zhang Yi was shocked.

He could understand double Multicast, given it had a 75% chance. But quadruple Multicast, according to the description, only had a 35% chance!

“Unlucky Kings can never experience or understand the joy of Lucky Kings, and Lucky Kings can't understand the astonishment of Unlucky Kings.” Wang Han said softly, finishing off the last remaining creep with a Fireblast.

Hearing Wang Han, Zhang Yi's face darkened.

She hit a sore spot!

“Aren't you a support! Why are you kill stealing from me!” But Zhang Yi quickly changed the subject, attempting to initiate a confrontation.

“Support? Look at our levels, doesn't your heart know who the support is?” Wang Han pinged Zhang Yi's level, then her own.

Zhang Yi: ...

..................

Five people, three lanes. Basically, no one ran to other lanes. At the same time, the AI matches on easy difficulty wouldn't converge mid, so Invoker Carl, Mirana, and Terrorblade—the three random players—like Zhang Yi and Wang Han, played in their own lanes, with no intention of going elsewhere.

As time progressed, even if they weren't used to the last-hit mechanic and mostly last-hit by chance, with the AI not buying equipment, everyone's levels and equipment gradually crushed the computer.

Later on, Zhang Yi's Dragon Knight, transforming into an Ice Dragon with Black King Bar, combined with the Blue Ogre's Bloodlust, could only be described as covering the sky and obscuring the sun, reminding him of Onyxia in World of Warcraft.

The only thing Zhang Yi complained about was that he couldn't kill steal from Wang Han's Blue Ogre. Although he was tanky and dealt damage after getting his equipment, even dealing damage while tanking the tower, compared to the Ogre Magi with Multicast, if she just paid attention to the enemy hero's maximum health, one Fireblast, if Multicast triggered, would basically finish them off.

His final score as Dragon Knight was 7-0-21, while Wang Han's Ogre Magi was 13-0-13.

However, what impressed Zhang Yi wasn't his Dragon Knight, but the Invoker mid and Terrorblade bot lane.

Terrorblade was terrifying enough with his illusions and Metamorphosis active. But the Invoker mid was also formidable. Following Zhang Yi's initial instructions, after trying all his skills, he permanently used Alacrity and Cold Snap. As for equipment, he directly replicated Zhang Yi's Dragon Knight build; aside from replacing Heaven's Halberd with a Daedalus, the rest of the equipment, if not identical, was largely similar.

But his damage output was far more terrifying than Zhang Yi's. When Zhang Yi transformed into an Ice Dragon, he looked fierce, but his damage was sustained damage, like cutting meat with a blunt knife. As for this Invoker, with three Sunstrikes and Alacrity, he quickly basic attacked the enemy heroes to death, a pure burst damage machine.

“Dragon Knight bro, your recommendations are awesome! This Invoker playstyle is brilliant!” The Invoker player mid cheered happily as the enemy's base exploded.

“My Terrorblade is also super strong, it's just that the third skill's cooldown is too long, even longer than my ultimate ability.” The Terrorblade player was also happy.

“Just average, just average.” Zhang Yi also laughed cheerfully.

On the post-match screen, Zhang Yi also happily looked at the relevant data.

In DOTA, the various data displayed are very rich. Physical Damage, Magical Damage, Pure Damage, damage dealt to buildings, as well as Damage Taken, healing done, including gold per minute (GPM), experience per minute, and total experience and gold at different minute marks, all appear on the scoreboard.

Even what equipment was bought at what time, each player's skill point allocation, and the various items bought by the support were all clear at a glance. Even someone who hadn't experienced the match could roughly infer the entire battle process and key turning points from this data.

Although many players might not seriously look at this data, such detailed information is still very useful.

For players who performed poorly, if they don't see this data, they won't know where they played badly and how to improve. And for the most impactful players in the game, this data also serves a good purpose: to redirect their inner resentment and make themselves feel better.

Even if they lost, they could still drag the progress bar to the ten-minute mark and say to others: Look at my Laning Phase economy at ten minutes. Then sigh, indicating that their performance in this match was doing one's utmost.
