Chapter 269: There's No Such Thing as a Protagonist (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Inside Nebula Games' studio.

Ruan Ning, Yang Xin, and Qin Yi were discussing matters related to the game.

“Although it's an RTS, this time the workload feels particularly massive! It's no less significant than our previous Monster Hunter: World!” Ruan Ningxue exclaimed with emotion.

“Indeed, and from the worldview and plot setting, it’s quite grand. Dwarves, Elves, Orcs, and Undead, as well as Goblins and Elemental Creatures – so many different races!” Yang Xin nodded in agreement.

“But with so much content involved, I wonder what the plot will be like. It seems most RTS games on the market don't have much of a story,” Ruan Ningxue said curiously.

“I'm not sure either. I haven't received any plot-related materials yet,” Yang Xin shook her head, indicating she didn't know.

“I believe that regardless of the plot, based solely on the gameplay, this RTS will definitely be a success!” Qin Yi, who had just finished inputting data and sported two dark circles under his eyes (a sign of hard work), said excitedly.

“That exaggerated?” Hearing Qin Yi's words, the two were somewhat surprised.

Although they had confidence in the game they were developing, the final product wasn't out yet, so no one could truly say what it would be like.

“Of course! It's incredibly rich, and the various types can form multiple variables, which is absolutely crucial for an RTS,” Qin Yi said, beaming with excitement.

He had been extremely excited while inputting and structuring the numerical design during this period.

Although Chen Xu had primarily given him tables, as a Gaming Industry Professional, Qin Yi could somewhat glimpse the potential.

Compared to other RTS games on the market, at least in terms of numerical design, it was definitely top-tier.

“Alright, take a good rest this period. Arrange your work schedule reasonably, no need to be so stressed!” Chen Xu, who had walked out of his office, said upon hearing Qin Yi's words and noticing his dark circles.

Although Chen Xu had given all the work content to Qin Yi, he hadn't rigidly scheduled the time, allowing Qin Yi to arrange it himself. However, it was clear that Qin Yi had completely transformed into a workaholic, directly intending to complete all the workload in the early stages.

After a couple of caring remarks, Chen Xu approached Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue, showing them the organized line art.

“The line art for the main characters in the game is complete, and I've written detailed requirements. You can add some finer details. I've also roughly organized the corresponding introductions for the plot. You two will be responsible for the initial review for the outsourcing side,” Chen Xu told them.

Receiving the thick stack of line art from Chen Xu, Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin gasped in admiration at the first image on the manuscript paper.

“So cool!”

Most of the drafts were still preliminary, but the first few, Chen Xu had already colored.

On the first drawing, there was a handsome young man with golden hair, wearing silver-blue knight armor and a cape, with a lion-headed belt around his waist.

Behind him, he carried a massive hammer, his entire expression incredibly resolute, his eyes conveying a pursuit of justice. Coupled with the warm tones of the background, it made the young Paladin in the drawing appear exceptionally righteous.

Meanwhile, in the blurred background, golden light enveloped this young Paladin.

Next to it, the character's identity was written: Arthas Menethil, Prince of Lordaeron, a valiant and selfless Paladin of the Knights of the Silver Hand.

This must be the protagonist!

So handsome!

Looking at the first drawing, everyone couldn't help but marvel.

But when they turned to the second drawing, their expressions instantly froze.

The protagonist of the second drawing was also Arthas, but the entire style had completely changed.

His former silver-blue knight armor had now turned dull, and his golden hair had become a lifeless gray.

His expression remained resolute, but the gaze in his eyes conveyed not justice, but evil.

The mighty hammer that once symbolized a Paladin in his hand was now replaced by a Demonic sword glowing with blue light and engraved with magic runes.

Next to the drawing was a description of the character.

The protagonist was still Arthas, but at this moment, his identity had changed from Prince of Lordaeron and Paladin of the Knights of the Silver Hand to a Death Knight of the Scourge.

“How extreme!”

“Mr. Chen, is Arthas the game's protagonist? Did he turn from righteous to antagonistic? Or is it a case of a reformed prodigal being more precious than gold?”

Looking at the two line art pieces before them, everyone couldn't suppress their inner excitement and began discussing.

The main focus of their concern was the meaning represented by these two pieces of line art.

As for the plot, no one was clear yet, as Chen Xu hadn't mentioned it at all.

However, everyone still knew some basic settings.

For instance, the game was divided into Human, Orc, Elf, and Undead races, which were the four factions players could control.

And now, an artwork of Arthas showed an extreme shift in identity and stance, from righteous to evil, from prince to Death Knight.

This had already set everyone's imaginations soaring: did the controversial prince become corrupted into an evil Death Knight, or did the evil Death Knight revert to a righteous Paladin?

“Protagonist? In certain events and periods, Arthas was indeed a protagonist, but in the grand story of Warcraft, Arthas is merely a brilliant stroke within an entire era,” Chen Xu explained, shaking his head at their words.

“Huh?!”

Hearing this, everyone was a little confused.

“Mr. Chen, do you mean multiple protagonists?” Qin Yi asked, guessing.

“No, there's no such thing as *the* protagonist, or rather, each period has its own protagonist,” Chen Xu replied, shaking his head.

“Just like the History of Civilization, every period and every race has its own glorious stories, with numerous heroes emerging. Whether evil or righteous, characters like Arthas and Illidan, or even the Human, Orc, and Elf races, they are the so-called protagonists in certain periods, but they are not eternal,” Chen Xu simply explained.

Listening to Chen Xu’s words, everyone pretty much understood what he meant.

It wasn't about describing the game's story from one person's perspective, but from a broader viewpoint.

Thinking about it that way, it indeed seemed very well-suited for the RTS genre!

And the scope was also grander.

“Alright, Warcraft will continue to be developed in its current mode. However, the crossover with Monster Hunter: World and the building complexes for Minecraft can now begin.”

“Consider it a warm-up promotion for the early stages of the game,” Chen Xu said, looking at everyone.
