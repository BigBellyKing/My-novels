Chapter 273: Industry and Player Attention (6th update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Is the RTS market large?

It is still a relatively large market.

Not just domestically, but also overseas.

But it's difficult to enter.

For the same reason, RTS-type games aren't hard to make, but they are hard to make well.

Moreover, RTS games are different from typical ARPGs and RPGs.

For a typical RPG game, if there's a good one and a slightly inferior one, it doesn't mean the inferior one will necessarily fail completely.

Because the content of these games is limited.

After players experience one, if they're still interested in the same type, as long as it's not too outrageous, a portion of players will usually still get their hands on it.

This is also a characteristic of single-player games; the market is not a zero-sum market.

But RTS games are different.

Because RTS is a competitive game, not just about single-player content, but more about player versus player confrontation.

In this situation, an excellent RTS game can often sweep the entire market.

Unless there's an equally excellent and evenly matched RTS on the market, or one with unique characteristics.

For example, if my RTS has a modern warfare setting and yours has an ancient warfare setting, this difference can attract different player demographics, but this is based on the condition that the gap isn't too large.

But once there's a significant disparity in balance or player experience, one RTS will inevitably dominate the entire player market.

Because when the number of players decreases, it signifies a shrinking player pool.

It becomes increasingly difficult to match with players of similar skill levels; new players and veteran players get matched together, directly leading to a deterioration of the competitive environment.

Of course, when the deterioration reaches a certain point, the environment will gradually improve again.

Because by then, only players who are deeply invested in the game will remain, with no new players at all.

Everyone is evenly matched, forming a small circle.

For players who still love the game, this feels like a good thing.

But for a game developer and designer, when a game exhibits such a phenomenon, it essentially has one foot in the grave.

Any sequels are basically out of the question in the short term; perhaps after five or six, or even seven or eight years, one could try to see if player nostalgia could be sparked for a sequel or remake.

It is precisely because of these characteristics that, although the RTS market size is not small, truly few game developers, both domestically and internationally, are willing to venture into it.

But now that Nebula Games is suddenly making an RTS, it's clearly not a decision made on a whim.

The crossover with Monster Hunter: World, and the crossover with Minecraft, are enough to prove that Nebula Games is playing for real.

Furthermore, on the Channel Alliance's side, the game with the highest concurrent players currently is
