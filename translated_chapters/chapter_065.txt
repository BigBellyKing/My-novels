Chapter 65: Players' Discussion

The next day, a special interview article about Chen Xu from Game Timespace was already out.

"The Transmission of Love, Every Game Filled with My Passion for Players"

This was the title of the entire article from Game Timespace.

Clicking into the article, the content was basically what Chen Xu had previously discussed with Wu Tian.

Of course, some content and topics were deleted.

Meanwhile, some content was also polished.

The main focus was on the positive side, for example, encountering difficulties during game development, even contemplating giving up at one point, but ultimately the team overcame the challenges and delivered a perfect, passion-filled game to the players.

This process of artistic embellishment, if Chen Xu didn't know it was pure nonsense, he would have been moved himself.

As a leading domestic game media, Game Timespace still held considerable influence among players.

At least in terms of traffic, this was true.

After this interview article was released, numerous player comments immediately appeared below it.

'So *that's* the origin of Chen Xu calling himself the 'Warrior of Love'!'

'By the way, why do I always feel like it's full of bluster?'

'+1, I feel like the editor who conducted the interview was completely fooled by Chen Xu.'

'If you only look at Undertale and To the Moon, I feel like 'Warrior of Love' is a fitting title, but Outlast... LOL!'

'Even now, I still feel that Chen Xu's interpretation of Outlast is pure bluffing!'

'The key is that the bluffing is quite convincing!'

'Don't just discuss whether Chen Xu is a big bluffer, aren't you curious about the new game mentioned in the article?'

'Oh right, Chen Xu's new game is called Overcooked. Is it a cooking game?'

'Who knows? Just from a game title, who can guess? It's like Mirror (Game); can you imagine how explosive the content is just from the name?'

'Say no more, I'd willingly crown it the king of Gentleman's Games; even now, no second game can rival it. I've played it so much it's not working for me anymore.'

'Sigh, no choice. Who told Chen Xu to have such a smooth journey in game development?'

The release of this article, aside from making more players aware of Chen Xu, didn't cause much of a stir.

Although Overcooked was mentioned, there wasn't much revealed beyond just the game's name.

And Chen Xu wasn't a big shot yet, not to the extent where players would be eager to play and know all information just by hearing his name.

Moreover, with the New Year approaching, games from various companies, regardless of their scale, also began their promotions.

In such circumstances, aside from Chen Xu's hardcore fans, most casual players weren't too concerned about Overcooked.

Chen Xu, however, didn't pay too much attention to this.

After all, Overcooked hadn't officially been promoted yet.

In terms of production costs, Overcooked's cost was only one-third compared to the previous Outlast.

Of course, this excludes server and other expenses; the server aspect wasn't solely for Overcooked's servers.

It also served the Nebula Games platform.

For Chen Xu, two months was enough.

Looking at Overcooked from a mature perspective, its key core elements and flaws were basically very clear.

Development progress was naturally very fast.

Compared to the previous, relatively simple version with only one or two themes and some content filled with free engine assets.

The current Overcooked was already very complete.

And compared to the previous Outlast, this time Chen Xu also specifically filmed a related game trailer for Overcooked.

Rather than just promoting it through his official Weibo account as before.

After all, Overcooked represented the Nebula Games platform's first true launch into the player market.

Its inherent meaning was also completely different.

Time moved forward. Before Chinese New Year's Eve, the annual spectacle began across the country: the Spring Festival travel rush.

Inside Nebula Games, the annual holiday leave had also begun.

However, some employees chose to stay.

After all, Overcooked was scheduled to launch on the third day of the Lunar New Year, and it involved the Nebula Games platform and related community operations.

So, some people still needed to stay behind to handle any potential emergencies.

Of course, Chen Xu was not stingy at all when it came to overtime pay.

And in major game forums and related communities.

Players were discussing various new games for the New Year period.

'Doesn't feel like there are any good games launching this New Year!'

'Yeah, I looked and nothing particularly interesting.'

'TengHua Games' new title, Age of Gods, feels pretty good.'

'Yeah, and NetDragon's blockbuster, Demon God, is really anticipated!'

'Anticipated, yes, but both are VR blockbusters. VR experience stores in fourth-tier small counties don't open during the New Year.'

'Don't all entertainment venues open during the New Year?'

'Mine just aren't opening, what can I do?'

'These VR blockbusters are only fun if you can spend a lot of time on them. I don't have much time during the New Year, so I'll check if there are any PC games.'

'It seems many game companies are also releasing PC games.'

'Quick, look at Chen Xu's official Weibo! He also made a new game, seems like a couple's game.'

'I saw it, feels so heartwarming! Just right to play with my girlfriend. Did Chen Xu really become a Warrior of Love this time?'

'The Overcooked mentioned before? It really is a cooking game! Cooking with your girlfriend?'

'Couple's game? I'm a single dog, why are you talking to me about couple's games?'

'Bro upstairs, even single dogs need dreams! Besides, this game doesn't necessarily have to be played with a girlfriend; you can play it with your buddies too!'

'Exactly, and Nebula Games platform is having a special New Year launch discount: Buy One Get One Free!'

During the Spring Festival, games from various major developers showcased their unique strengths.

Among them, the most eye-catching were naturally the two blockbusters from TengHua and NetDragon.

Both of these are domestic gaming giants, old rivals, one could say. They are competitors in terms of both distribution channels and games.

This time, the two blockbusters launching concurrently during the New Year certainly grabbed a lot of attention.

However, both companies launched VR blockbusters this year, with not much happening on the PC front.

And in the PC market, with the release of Overcooked's promotional video on major game media websites and Chen Xu's official Weibo account.

It also attracted the attention of many players.

I'm so short~ [I've complained for you]
