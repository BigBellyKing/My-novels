Chapter 494: Simple and Enthusiastic Yharnamites (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Scratching his head, Song Ren was utterly bewildered.

Even before playing, he had actually already planned his playstyle and strategy. That was to find a decent shield and then play cautiously, which would minimize the game's early-game malice. He planned to switch to other playstyles after completing his first playthrough and starting a new one.

After all, while Song Ren couldn't claim to be a master of the previous Dark Souls games, he had certainly put in hundreds, if not thousands, of hours, giving him some insight. If he could defeat the monsters early on, there was no rush to level up, which would save him many detours and allow his desired playstyle to take shape more effectively.

But why was there no shield now? Looking at the Hunter Axe and Shotgun in his hands, Song Ren felt a strange sense of confusion.

He had already understood settings like Visceral Attack and Gun Parry through the in-game messages on the ground. But honestly, he still wanted a reliable shield, because only Dark Souls players could truly understand how wonderful it was to have a greatshield.

“However, Mr. Chen said there are shields, so there must be shields in the game; I just don't know at what point in the game they can be acquired.” Song Ren debated it for a moment but didn't dwell on the matter too much.

After all, he had a competitive challenge with Old Zhang. Even though he had a five-minute lead, he wasn't sure what situation Old Zhang was in. Moreover, from the various system introductions, he felt that the difficulty of Bloodborne shouldn't be too high.

Leaving aside the Rally mechanism, the most crucial point was that players could carry up to 20 Blood Vials in the game. For example, after leaving Iosefka's Clinic, he still had 4 Blood Vials on him, in addition to the two he used to tear apart villagers earlier. And he could buy more Blood Vials from the merchant at the hot spring, just by paying some Blood Echoes.

Stocking up 20 Blood Vials before facing a BOSS, what BOSS couldn't be defeated? So Song Ren felt he had to race against time. Treating someone to a meal was a minor matter; losing to Old Zhang, now that was a major issue!

Of course, before exploring the unknown path to find the BOSS, Song Ren had one more thing to do. Using the lantern to warp back, Song Ren returned to Iosefka's Clinic. Facing the werewolf with one-third of its health remaining, Song Ren immediately switched his Hunter Axe to its long-handled form, charging up a Windmill Attack. The axe blade struck the werewolf fiercely, sending up a spray of blood.

At the same time, Song Ren was pleasantly surprised to find that this Windmill Attack not only dealt high damage, clearing one-third of the werewolf's health, but it also had a knockback effect. The struck werewolf was sent flying several meters away before a white orb appeared on its body.

“Holy cow, this Hunter Axe isn't invincible!?” Song Ren was stunned. He never expected this Hunter Axe to have a knockback effect. Wouldn't it be possible to kite some mobs that could be knocked back, like the werewolf in front of him, with this playstyle?

He picked up the white light from the werewolf, luckily a Blood Vial, then continued along the previous path. Along the way, he encountered Yharnam villagers carrying torches and Hunter Axes, whom Song Ren still took down with a single Windmill Attack. This also confirmed his conjecture: the long-handled mode of the Hunter Axe indeed had a knockdown effect. Although his stamina bar only allowed for two swings, the damage was ridiculously high.

As for the shotgun, Song Ren felt it was a chicken rib (of little value). He tried to perform a Gun Parry, but it was useless; instead, he was cut twice for nothing, and the bullets barely scratched the enemy. He didn't know if the damage would increase after reinforcing it or getting a better gun, but for now, he really didn't want to use it.

“Anyway, this gun is just a transitional weapon; once I get a shield, it'll be time for you to retire.” Song Ren sighed, put away his gun, and chose to two-hand his long-handled Hunter Axe.

Returning up the ladder to the lantern previously located in central Yharnam, Song Ren noticed a lit room in front of the lantern where he could interact.

‘Oh, you must be a Hunter, and not from around here.’

‘My name is Gilbert, and I’m also a foreigner, you must be having a grand time, aren't you?’

‘The people of Yharnam... they treat guests in a very special way.’

From Gilbert, Song Ren gathered quite a bit of useful information. For instance, the Paleblood, which seemed closely related to the main storyline, might have some information available from an organization called the Healing Church. However, to reach the Healing Church, he would need to cross the canyon to the Cathedral Ward east of Yharnam.

This served as a map guide for the player, as the map design is a major characteristic of Souls-like games. There are no minimaps or world maps; players rely solely on their own exploration. Coupled with the high difficulty, skilled Souls series players practically know the maps by heart, and their bodies have fallen in every corner of the map.

However, what Song Ren found regrettable was that he was one of the earliest players to enter the game, and he hadn't quit the game in between. Therefore, he didn't see any lingering souls of other deceased players or their in-game messages on the ground.

“The Yharnamites treat outsiders in a special way? Heh heh? How special can it be? Like the Undead Burg, with simple folk who are warm and hospitable?” Song Ren chuckled, not taking it too seriously.

After a brief conversation, Song Ren prepared to continue exploring. He tried to push the door beside him, but it was locked, just like the one on the first floor. Clearly, this was a shortcut that would be unlocked from some point in a later area of the map.

Ignoring the path he couldn't yet take, Song Ren proceeded with his long-handled weapon. He didn't know if this form would be effective against BOSSes, but it was incredibly useful against mobs.

Continuing forward, around the staircase corner to his right, Song Ren spotted a villager holding a torch with his back to him. Next to this villager, there was also another villager lying there, looking like a corpse.

“Tsk tsk, Mr. Chen's traps can only fool rookies; an old Firelinker like me won't fall for it.” Song Ren chuckled, though with a hint of emotion. Indeed, it was that familiar taste!

Song Ren didn't target the Yharnam torch bearer who had his back to him. Instead, he switched his Hunter Axe to its short-handled mode, walked up to the monster pretending to be a corpse, and unleashed a charged Split Mount Hua with Force. As the axe struck the 'corpse,' a health bar UI suddenly appeared above its head, instantly depleted by the charged axe blow.

“One point for me!” Song Ren beamed, his spirits, which had been somewhat low due to the weapon's design, instantly lifted. “Is that all?! You think you can ambush me?” Song Ren laughed heartily and happily walked down the stairs.

As soon as he descended the stairs, Song Ren wanted to check the difference between the two paths, front and back. Suddenly, from behind him, four patrolling Yharnam villagers, like rabid dogs, charged at Song Ren.

‘Away!’ ‘Away!’

Frantic cries erupted from the villagers' mouths, demonstrating their simple and enthusiastic hospitality towards outsiders. Torches, shields, pitchforks, butcher knives, and scythes—four different weapons savagely hacked at Song Ren. The cramped terrain, combined with his already depleted stamina from running down the stairs, and the characteristic high attack power of mobs in Souls-like games, plunged Song Ren into a moment of silence.

[YOU DIED!]

The familiar death screen appeared on the monitor. Authentic Souls, authentic death screen—this flavor was just right!
