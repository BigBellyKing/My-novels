                <p>Chapter 658: The Old Riddler (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>As the influence of <em>World of Warcraft</em> continued to spread,</p>
<p>more and more rookie players also joined in succession.</p>
<p>Nearly two months had passed since its release.</p>
<p>The first batch of hardcore players had basically all experienced the joy of conquering the Molten Core raid dungeon.</p>
<p>At the same time, the team was also arranging some subsequent versions for <em>World of Warcraft</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, for most ordinary players, dungeons like Upper Blackrock Spire were no longer considered difficult.</p>
<p>However, raid dungeons were still often out of reach for many ordinary guilds, especially the Thunderfury that countless warriors yearned for.</p>
<p>Currently, only the most top-tier raid teams could even attempt it.</p>
<p>Inside Molten Core, Old Song was working with Zhang Yi and other team members to conquer it.</p>
<p>“NICE! We finally cleared it!”</p>
<p>“Raid leader, awesome!”</p>
<p>“Cleared! Finally cleared!”</p>
<p>As two colossal figures collapsed with a boom, a group of people in the team shouted excitedly.</p>
<p>Old Song, as the leader of the guild team, looked at the jubilant crowd, who were as lively as a festival, with a face full of black lines.</p>
<p>“What are you guys so happy about? We only just cleared two gatekeepers!”</p>
<p>Old Song looked at the excited people in the team and felt utterly speechless.</p>
<p>A bunch of useless people!</p>
<p>The game had been online for so long; he wouldn't even mention things like Thunderfury. As for the Tier 1 set, he didn't know when he'd ever gather all the pieces!</p>
<p>After taking down the two massive gatekeepers and experiencing continuous wipes, Old Song sighed, looking at his damaged equipment. He then disbanded this week's raid squad.</p>
<p>“Old Song, look on the bright side. This is a small step in dungeon progression, but a giant leap for our guild,” Zhang Yi comforted him from beside.</p>
<p>“Sigh, let's not talk about it. I'm going back to Crystal Lake to butcher some Murlocs to vent,” Old Song lamented.</p>
<p>This was something he often did when he was bored.</p>
<p>To this day, he still couldn't forget the first monster that took his first death when he first stepped into the world of Azeroth.</p>
<p>Murlocs must die!</p>
<p>“Don't farm Murlocs, Old Song! Look at the official Weibo account! Mr. Chen seems to have a new game!”</p>
<p>Just as Old Song was about to use his Hearthstone to return to the place where his dream began and bully some Murlocs,</p>
<p>Wang Han's voice suddenly came from the voice channel.</p>
<p>Old Song, who was preparing to return to the newbie village to bully Murlocs, paused but immediately opened the official Weibo account.</p>
<p>Many other ordinary players who had been following Chen Xu did the same.</p>
<p>'New game again?'</p>
<p>'Holy cow, so fast?'</p>
<p>'Not that fast, is it? Calculating the time, it seems about right. It's just that I've been grinding <em>World of Warcraft</em> every day, so I didn't notice the time.'</p>
<p>'But this new game seems a bit different. Cartoon art style? Could it be like <em>It Takes Two</em>?'</p>
<p>While <em>World of Warcraft</em>'s popularity maintained steady growth, the promotional CG for Chen Xu's new game arrived.</p>
<p>But upon clicking it, many players were taken aback.</p>
<p>Because at first glance, the art style of this brand-new game was surprisingly cartoonish.</p>
<p>It wasn't that no game developers made cartoon-style games, but most game developers would default to a more realistic art style for VR equipment.</p>
<p>This included Nebula Games. Although it had cartoon-style games like <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, and <em>It Takes Two</em>,</p>
<p>none of them were on the VR platform. This time, it could be said to be the first.</p>
<p>So, when the promotional CG was released, players were very curious about what kind of game this would be.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>At the beginning of the video, Nebula Games' LOGO flashed by.</p>
<p>Like the opening animation of <em>Uncharted</em>, it was set on a turbulent sea.</p>
<p>A small boat with a lantern hanging from its bow sailed across the ocean, slowly advancing towards a distant lighthouse.</p>
<p>The sky was pouring with rain, accompanied by strong winds and lightning.</p>
<p>'Bring me the girl, and our debt will be wiped clean. That's the agreement.'</p>
<p>The first-person perspective looked down, and a wooden box opened in front. Inside, there were two photos with indistinct faces and a handgun.</p>
<p>He picked up the handgun from the box, and at the same time, rain blurred his vision.</p>
<p>The camera suddenly moved to the clouds, and the game's title LOGO appeared: <em>BioShock</em>.</p>
<p>As the screen faded to black, a symphonic BGM played in the background. The scene shifted to a place resembling a library.</p>
<p>A short-haired girl in blue and white clothing held a book, looking warily at the camera.</p>
<p>'Who are you?'</p>
<p>'I am DeWitt. I'm one of you!'</p>
<p>As the scene flashed by, a look of panic appeared on the girl's face.</p>
<p>'He's coming. You… you should leave quickly!'</p>
<p>'Why?'</p>
<p>'You'll regret staying!'</p>
<p>Accompanied by the cry of a hawk, a colossal figure appeared outside the window.</p>
<p>Then the earth shook, and the entire building seemed to be on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>As the camera shook, the scene switched.</p>
<p>In the darkness, a man grabbed a hand and ran forward.</p>
<p>'This is not a good place.'</p>
<p>'From now on, it will only get worse.'</p>
<p>In the dark scene, only the spot where the little girl stood was lit, and beside her was a scene resembling an operating room.</p>
<p>Red blood covered the floor, and behind her, an old man with an indistinct face sat motionless in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>'A girl in flames, this fire can burn the whole world.'</p>
<p>The next moment, the scene moved to a huge airship. An old woman with an indistinct face stood with her back to the camera, and the entire city was engulfed in war.</p>
<p>'Though I don't yet understand the details, the details won't change this damned outcome!'</p>
<p>This promotional video excited players, but also left them feeling a bit strange.</p>
<p>Although the game's art style was cartoonish, it was very beautiful, which wasn't what surprised players. Moreover, combined with the transition from bright to dark colors, it added a theatrical feel to the game.</p>
<p>What truly puzzled players was what kind of game this was exactly.</p>
<p>This short, minute-long promotional video didn't reveal much content to the players.</p>
<p>Every point had a little something, but no point was explored in depth.</p>
<p>It was, as always, the style of the old riddler.</p>
<p>If there was one thing that could be linked, it would be the steampunk theme.</p>
<p>The giant hawk robot, the massive machinery, and the airship that destroyed the city at the end – all these elements had clear steampunk characteristics.</p>
<p>As for other aspects, many players were simply bewildered.</p>
<p>“Did anyone understand this trailer?”</p>
<p>“Completely bewildered, Mr. Chen is such a riddler!”</p>
<p>“Isn't that normal? It's just a promotional trailer; what kind of information were you expecting it to reveal?”</p>
<p>“But I feel a bit creepy. The cartoon scenes at the beginning were really beautiful, but the dark scenes that appeared later scared the hell out of me.”</p>
<p>Facing this short, less-than-a-minute long promotional video, players discussed amongst themselves.</p>
<p>And they reached a unanimous conclusion: Chen Xu was simply an old riddler!</p>
<p>It was getting more and more excessive!</p>
