                <h2>Chapter 448: Animus (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h2>
<p>A video was launched on Nebula Games' VR platform and official website.</p>
<p>The content was very simple, just a few pictures and a narration.</p>
<p>‘Damascus during the Crusades, the Holy City of Jerusalem, Florence during the Renaissance, the Eternal City of Rome, Constantinople…’</p>
<p>‘In the long river of history, there was a war that people never knew.’</p>
<p>‘It lasted for thousands of years and never stopped.’</p>
<p>‘The struggle between freedom and order.’</p>
<p>After watching the entire video, many players were dumbfounded.</p>
<p>The video, less than 30 seconds long in total, seemed to reveal a lot of content, yet also not much at all.</p>
<p>Crusades?</p>
<p>Isn't this the new game theme developed by Zeus?</p>
<p>And what's with this Renaissance stuff?!?</p>
<p>Of course, many players were also very excited.</p>
<p>“What's this all about? Mr. Chen, don't be Riddler-like!”</p>
<p>“Exactly! I completely don't get it!”</p>
<p>“Guys, isn't this hint obvious enough? Mr. Chen is hinting at a new game!”</p>
<p>“But why is the time span so vast? The Crusades and the Renaissance are separated by several generations!”</p>
<p>“Don't ask me, how would I know? But combined with where Chen Xu went before, and this short film, isn't it obvious enough?”</p>
<p>“Damn, Mr. Chen is as usual, making grand promises at lightning speed.”</p>
<p>“23333, I'm just asking if you'll eat that ‘pie’ when the time comes!”</p>
<p>The messages published on Chen Xu’s and Nebula Games’ official Weibo accounts left many players a bit confused.</p>
<p>The only thing they could think of was that it might be related to Nebula Games' new game, and the background seemed to be set in the Renaissance.</p>
<p>But the key question was, what type of game was this?</p>
<p>Many players discussed various possibilities under Chen Xu’s official Weibo account, but they didn't get any replies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zeus received the latest news and was thoroughly annoyed.</p>
<p>It's you guys again?</p>
<p>And why announce it now, not earlier?</p>
<p>Before, when you went on that trip to Italy and players online were discussing it so fiercely, why didn't you announce that you were making a medieval-themed game set in the Renaissance?</p>
<p>You kept quiet then, and now you pull this stunt, trying to piggyback on the medieval hype we generated, right?</p>
<p>Zeus was stamping his feet in anger, but he said nothing online, mainly because he couldn't.</p>
<p>After all, Nebula Games' previous products were all quality titles, and Nebula Games wasn't some small game developer. Why would they need to piggyback on hype?</p>
<p>Of course, Chen Xu could honestly say it was just a coincidence.</p>
<p>As for piggybacking on hype, that sounded too unpleasant.</p>
<p>Between game companies and designers, could this be called piggybacking on hype?</p>
<p>One could only say this was about fostering prosperity in the gaming industry alongside friendly competitors, adding bricks and tiles to the industry's development.</p>
<p>See, Zeus's ‘Medieval’ theme got a wave of promotion, and we at Nebula Games followed closely behind. Didn't player attention and excitement immediately surge?</p>
<p>And since you at Zeus have already worked so hard, just leave the rest to us at Nebula Games.</p>
<p>With this thought in mind, after nearly a month of location scouting, Chen Xu and his team returned to Nebula Games, and a brand-new small application was uploaded to Huanyu VR's Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>That day, Zhang Yi, who was about to log in to <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> for a couple of quick random matches, paused the moment he logged into the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>He found that the Nebula Games Platform had a pop-up window today, and it wasn't even for a Nebula Games product.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was stunned instantly.</p>
<p>Pop-up windows on the Nebula Games PC platform were a major recommendation slot. Only Nebula Games' own first-party games or exceptionally high-quality third-party games could get one.</p>
<p>As for the Huanyu VR Nebula Games Platform, there had never been a single pop-up window, not even for <em>Uncharted</em> before. But now, there was one?!</p>
<p>This immediately shocked players like Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>“animus? What is this?” Zhang Yi looked puzzled, especially by the developer of this software, which struck him as very strange.</p>
<p>It appeared to be a product from a company called Abstergo. Its LOGO was three trapezoids interlocking to form an eye-like triangle, which looked quite mysterious.</p>
<p>“What kind of company is this, to get a pop-up on Nebula Games? That awesome? And what exactly is this ‘animus’ thing? There's no description either? And it's quite large!” Scratching his head, Zhang Yi was full of questions.</p>
<p>However, with a touch of curiosity, he directly downloaded the application.</p>
<p>If it were some shady channel, he definitely wouldn't download it; who knew what kind of bizarre thing it might be. But since it was on the Nebula Games Platform and even had a pop-up, its safety should be guaranteed, and he was indeed curious.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi quickly finished downloading animus.</p>
<p>Then he clicked to enter.</p>
<p>Accompanying a black screen, a strange white space appeared before Zhang Yi. He tried to move his vision, only to find he couldn't move yet. His vision was a vast white, with many lines connecting, looking like the code world from a sci-fi movie.</p>
<p>At this moment, a gentle female voice appeared, introducing it to him.</p>
<p>“This is animus, a brand new program released by Abstergo Entertainment.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps you're wondering what kind of device animus is. Let us answer that for you.”</p>
<p>“Everyone carries DNA inheritance, and within your genes are stored the memories of your ancestors from thousands of years ago.”</p>
<p>“And animus is a machine that allows you to experience the magnificent life of your ancestors.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps your ancestor from a thousand years ago was a warrior.”</p>
<p>As the voice faded, Zhang Yi was astonished to find the world before him transformed into an ancient town.</p>
<p>And now he could move.</p>
<p>“Using animus allows you to interact with the world you see. Try it now.”</p>
<p>As the words fell, Zhang Yi found he could move: running, climbing, and simple attacks. But soon, the surrounding noises grew louder, and everything around him became increasingly blurry.</p>
<p>“Of course, if a user performs actions in the seen world that deviate from their genetic memory, the synchronization rate will decrease. Synchronization rate is essential for maintaining animus; if you lose sync, you must re-read the memory.”</p>
<p>The screen shifted back to the previous white virtual scene.</p>
<p>“Now, please try using it again.” The gentle female voice spoke again.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was equally surprised; he had now come back to his senses.</p>
<p>What's all this mysterious ‘animus’ and ‘Abstergo’ nonsense? This was Nebula Games' promotion for a new work!</p>
<p>It was just like the easter egg from <em>Uncharted</em>.</p>
<p>“So Nebula Games’ new work involves traveling back to ancient times using this machine?” Zhang Yi was very surprised.</p>
<p>At the same time, he followed the guidance of this 'animus' for some kind of verification.</p>
<p>But just as Zhang Yi was still thinking, the screen suddenly locked onto a tall tower, and a red cross mark appeared before his eyes, with a small line of text next to it – ‘May the Father of Understanding Guide Us’.</p>
<p>“You have been chosen!”</p>
<p>The previous gentle narration turned into a cold, mechanical voice. The next moment, Zhang Yi returned to the world of fragmented data.</p>
<p>At the same time, only an exit option appeared before him.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?!”</p>
<p>The sudden change startled Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>What's happening, what happened?!</p>
