                <p>Chapter 444: A World Where Only Zeus Gets Hurt (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Inside Atari's office.</p>
<p>Antorini held a review report in his hand, feeling quite delighted.</p>
<p>Although, in his opinion, the launch of Element World was a bit rushed, everything that needed to be done was completed. Moreover, the media review scores released in advance were also very good. While there was a difference compared to Uncharted, it was only a gap of 0.1 to 0.2 points. From this perspective, the two games were essentially neck and neck.</p>
<p>Such a review report also gave Atari and Zeus a lot of confidence. Various promotions proceeded simultaneously. On major live streaming and video platforms, many streamers began broadcasting Element World.</p>
<p>After all, Uncharted is a linear game, and after all this time, most people had essentially played through it. Although there were still more challenging Brutal difficulties, and achievements for collecting all treasures on the map, apart from those obsessed with trophies and achievements, most players wouldn't play a second time, as the main story content would be the same as before. Furthermore, Element World also held a “Sword Hunt” event this time, which attracted a lot of players' attention. Although there were only four spots in total, the generated popularity was quite substantial. As the saying goes, 'What if I'm the one who cracks the puzzle?' With the launch of Element World, players online eagerly anticipated it for a time.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>At Nebula Games, Chen Xu was approving the camera shots provided by Ruan Ningxue. The shots were from the classic plane scene in Drake's Deception, which could be said to be a classic in the entire series, no less than the car chase levels or train levels. Even the scene of hanging onto a plane in Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation was inspired by the plane scene in Uncharted.</p>
<p>“That's about right,” Chen Xu nodded, giving his approval.</p>
<p>Currently, the main tasks for the team, besides the development of Uncharted's three DLCs, included one other thing: the construction of the Nebula Games Platform on the VR platform. Previously, due to the smaller number of games, this work hadn't been undertaken. But now, some classic games were being ported to the Huanyu VR Platform, so this area also needed to be expedited.</p>
<p>Previously, players could enter various Nebula Games VR themes from one to another, with specially designed transition animations. For example, in the Monster Hunter: World VR theme, players would sit in a Palico cart, and then their vision would go black. Dark Souls was simpler: players would just teleport while sitting at a bonfire.</p>
<p>Outlast's VR theme, however, was the most emotionally stimulating and immersive among all VR themes. For instance, players walking in a dark basement would be grabbed by the Fat Security Guard Uncle and thrown to the ground. Not only that, but Outlast's VR theme was also the richest among all themes, featuring not only the Fat Security Guard Uncle but also the Scissors Doctor, Andrew with the nimble tongue, Frank with a chainsaw, and more. It had everything, fully showcasing Nebula Games' conscientiousness. Furthermore, and even more conscientiously, Outlast's theme was given to players for free once during every festival, ensuring that every Nebula Games player who owned Huanyu VR had a copy of this theme, making them feel as familiar with Mount Massive Asylum as they would with their own homes.</p>
<p>Combining various VR themes, players could then access different games within the platform from a single theme, instead of having to switch between themes. This aspect wasn't complicated; it just required some time.</p>
<p>“By the way, Mr. Chen, what do you think of Element World? The online media scores seem really high!” Yang Xin asked Chen Xu during their lunch break. The buzz around Element World these past two days was incredibly high, showing great potential to replicate Uncharted's previous momentum.</p>
<p>“It's a very good game,” Chen Xu pondered. “Subsequent media and player reviews should be quite high, but I estimate it won't satisfy Zeus.”</p>
<p>Regarding this game, he had also experienced it through Zeus's gaming pod. Although it was marketed as an open world, Chen Xu felt it was more akin to a box garden game like Shenmue from his previous life. This was because the main content of the game was confined to various ruins, with puzzles and exploration being the primary focus.</p>
<p>“Huh!?” Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, and Qin Yi looked at Chen Xu, somewhat bewildered. They didn't quite understand what Chen Xu meant. Player and media scores were good, but Zeus wasn't satisfied—what did that imply?</p>
<p>Everyone was a bit confused, but Chen Xu didn't intend to elaborate. He smiled and changed the subject.</p>
<p>“The follow-up work for the Uncharted trilogy and the Nebula Games Platform are no longer major issues. Next, everyone should prepare themselves; we might have to go on a business trip,” Chen Xu said with a smile, looking at everyone.</p>
<p>Hearing this, no one dwelled on Chen Xu's earlier mystery. Most of them were stunned. A… business trip?!</p>
<p>Aren't they a game company?! What kind of business trip?</p>
<p>Chen Xu smiled, had his assistant Lin Rou send over some compiled information to everyone's phones. Everyone opened it and saw, good heavens, it was a month-long trip to Italy? Florence, Monteriggioni, San Gimignano, Venice, Rome—not a single one was missed.</p>
<p>“It's mainly preparation for the development of some future games,” Chen Xu said, stretching as he looked at everyone. There was no other way; since Nebula Games didn't have a branch in Italy, the headquarters had to go in person.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>At Nebula Games, Chen Xu was leading his team, preparing for a difficult outdoor art reconnaissance trip, and had already contacted a large travel agency. Of course, the main purpose wasn't tourism, but to save time. Having a tour guide could better plan routes, and with the travel agency's arrangements, they wouldn't have to worry about food, lodging, or transportation, allowing them to fully dedicate themselves to the scouting work.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, online discussions about Element World began to slowly ferment. It must be said, you never know the extent of players' power. Just like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, even after Chen Xu fixed bugs like wall-clipping from his previous life, there were still players who broke the fastest kill record, directly defeating Ganon in 40 minutes by exploiting glitches.</p>
<p>Element World was no different. On the very first day, two players had already passed the trials for the ‘Sword Hunt event’, astonishing countless ordinary players. They were still scratching their heads over a single ruin, and someone had already completed the Sword Hunt trial?</p>
<p>In less than two days, the Sword Hunt event concluded. However, it generated significant buzz, and online player reviews were also very positive.</p>
<p>“Atari really nailed it this time!”</p>
<p>“Yeah! The design of the various ruins is really ingenious!”</p>
<p>“I feel like some of the ruins are no less impressive than the shrines in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild!”</p>
<p>“Exactly! Exactly!”</p>
<p>Players who enjoyed puzzle-solving genres gave it high praise. But praise aside, Atari and Zeus soon noticed a problem: the game's sales were off.</p>
<p>On the first day, sales were very impressive, thanks to the hype from the event and promotions. But as time went on, sales increased like an old woman crossing the road—little by little. This left Zeus and Atari a bit baffled.</p>
<p>To be fair, Element World's sales were actually quite high. But the crucial point was that Uncharted was overshadowing it, and Zeus had high expectations for Element World. So, why weren't sales climbing higher?</p>
<p>The reason for the stagnant sales was actually simple: the game's puzzles were too intricate and too difficult. While Element World's level design for the ruins was indeed ingenious, it was too brain-burning, directly deterring many players. Relying on guides to progress—who could handle that? Moreover, unlike PC platforms, looking up guides for VR games was quite cumbersome.</p>
<p>Secondly, although it was advertised as an open world, the world outside the ruins didn't offer much in terms of exploration. In this aspect, Element World differed from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, where players could freely explore outside the shrines and still have a lot of fun, even without entering them. Low on health? Try Hearty Durian. Low on stamina? Try Stamina Elixir.</p>
<p>However, Element World's core was primarily the exploration of ruins. For players who loved deep puzzle-solving, Element World completely hit their sweet spot. And in terms of quality, even players who didn't particularly enjoy Element World admitted it was a good game.</p>
<p>But being 'good' wasn't enough; they didn't enjoy playing it, and found little fun in it. Even Souls-like games offered some enjoyment to ordinary players. For example, finding a veteran player to drop some items, or carefully relying on equipment to power through the first playthrough, or following a guide. And as action games, even with a guide, combat in Souls-like games still relied on the player's own skill. But puzzle games were different; they felt like being a puppet on strings, so even with a guide, the experience of a puzzle game was far inferior to that of Souls-like games.</p>
<p>This led to Element World's sales being far lower than Zeus had hoped. Sometimes the game industry is just that unreasonable: good player and media reviews? That doesn't necessarily mean a game will be a bestseller.</p>
<p>The film industry is the same; for example, The Shawshank Redemption in his previous life—a classic? Explosive reputation? But box office sales weren't high. Element World's current situation was similar.</p>
<p>However, despite the frustration, Atari and Antorini, as the designer, adjusted well. After all, they didn't lose money, and they earned a good reputation. Atari's industry reputation wasn't particularly good before, but Element World gave them their first taste of widespread praise. Antorini felt the same; the high praise for Element World was a validation for him.</p>
<p>The only one feeling less than cheerful was Zeus. What's the use of a high reputation! It wanted sales, and to drive growth for the Zeus platform through those sales. Although there were undoubtedly puzzle game enthusiasts who bought Zeus specifically for Element World, just look at Uncharted next door. At this moment, Zeus thought about its investment in Element World and immediately felt a sharp pain in its chest.</p>
<p>The achievement of 'A world where only Zeus gets hurt' was complete!
