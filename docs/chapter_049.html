                <p>Chapter 49: I'm a Tough Guy! What Am I Afraid Of!</p>
<p>Listening to the rustling wind in his headphones, and then glancing at the Asylum far away on the screen.</p>
<p>Sun Yixie fell silent for a moment.</p>
<p>“Before I play this game, I want to ask everyone, if… I mean, if I say I have some difficulties right now, can I not play?”</p>
<p>“Alright, then… then can I go turn on the light? Don't worry.”</p>
<p>After speaking, Sun Yixie stood up, leaned forward, and clicked the light switch.</p>
<p>The next moment, in the camera's view, a room that looked a bit like a storage room lit up.</p>
<p>Immediately, the bullet comments in the live streaming room started to flood in.</p>
<p>“????????? Cowardly and lecherous Sun Yixie!”</p>
<p>“Didn't you say playing horror games was as easy as breathing?”</p>
<p>“Turning on the lights already, are you scared already?”</p>
<p>“23333333, Brother Sun, if you really can't do it, let's wait for Brother Huang to come back and play together, at least you'll have company.”</p>
<p>“2333333, as easy as breathing, so why did Brother Sun turn on the lights?”</p>
<p>“Turn off the lights! Turn off the lights!”</p>
<p>“Turn off the lights! Turn off the lights!”</p>
<p>“Turn off the lights! Turn off the lights!”</p>
<p>Following Sun Yixie's act of turning on the lights, the screen full of bullet comments eventually unified into a single message.</p>
<p>And that was ‘Turn off the lights! Turn off the lights!’.</p>
<p>“Turn off what lights?! What the heck, why turn off the lights! Shut up!”</p>
<p>“I'm going to say it one more time, horror games are like breathing to me, absolutely no pressure, of course, I occasionally get startled.”</p>
<p>“But it's just a tiny bit of tension.”</p>
<p>Looking at the bullet comments in the live streaming room, Sun Yixie tried to use external factors to alleviate his panic.</p>
<p>Sitting back down in his chair and putting on his headphones, Sun Yixie officially started the game.</p>
<p>Through some of the game's previous explanations, he also understood some basic content.</p>
<p>That is, in <em>Outlast</em>, he plays an unarmed reporter.</p>
<p>Generally, horror games are divided into two types.</p>
<p>One type has a combat system, meaning players can use firearms or other weapons to kill monsters or BOSSes.</p>
<p>The other type has no combat system, where players solve puzzles, run, and avoid monsters.</p>
<p>Currently, the first type is mainstream in the market, while the second type, though it exists, is not mainstream.</p>
<p>At least there are few big productions, and the <em>Outlast</em> before him was clearly a major production in the horror game genre.</p>
<p>Sun Yixie could feel it just from the scenes and atmosphere.</p>
<p>The graphics, compared to an AAA-tier game, certainly had a considerable gap.</p>
<p>But it was also presented quite realistically.</p>
<p>And as a horror game, this realistic immersion easily made people a little nervous.</p>
<p>“Darn it, I'm not scared! How could I be scared, don't rush me, let me check the controls first.”</p>
<p>Sun Yixie looked at the secondary screen, trying to interact with the bullet comments to relieve some pressure.</p>
<p>Inside the unmanned guard post at the entrance, he found a battery.</p>
<p>After searching the main entrance, Sun Yixie found a few items in total.</p>
<p>A DV camera, a battery, and a blue folder.</p>
<p>“This should be what we use to replace the flashlight later, right?”</p>
<p>Sun Yixie pulled out the DV camera, put in the battery, and turned it on.</p>
<p>Looking at the extremely eerie fluorescent green screen, Sun Yixie, as a game streamer, had played quite a few games.</p>
<p>Seeing the DV camera's settings, he pretty much guessed some things.</p>
<p>Later, there would likely be some dark environments, and he would have to use this DV camera to find his way.</p>
<p>He spoke confidently, but deep down, he was still a little nervous.</p>
<p>After confirming there was nothing else to explore, Sun Yixie pushed open the large iron gate and stepped into the courtyard.</p>
<p>With a European architectural style, the entire Asylum was incredibly silent, and through the windows, he could see the lights in some rooms of the building flickering on and off.</p>
<p>It was as if a pair of eyes was watching him from one of the lit rooms.</p>
<p>Controlling the protagonist to advance along the small path, Sun Yixie's footsteps suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>Because in the Mount Massive Asylum before him, the lights on one floor suddenly turned on, and at the same time, a black figure appeared at the window.</p>
<p>His eyes, originally like slits, suddenly widened.</p>
<p>Sun Yixie controlled the protagonist to open the camera and use its zoom function to look, preparing to get a glimpse of what that thing was.</p>
<p>But the other party seemed to have noticed someone watching him, and instantly darted to the side.</p>
<p>From his perspective, he only saw a blurry black shadow.</p>
<p>At the same time, the room's lights were turned off again.</p>
<p>Immediately, Sun Yixie felt a chill run from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head.</p>
<p>Nothing had happened, and he hadn't even seen any terrifying monsters.</p>
<p>But he just felt a little nervous inside.</p>
<p>The Mount Massive Asylum before him was like a monster with its jaws wide open, waiting for him to enter.</p>
<p>Moreover, the surrounding environment and layout were very strange, especially the riot police vehicles at the main entrance, which made him feel particularly odd.</p>
<p>Why would there be riot police vehicles at the entrance of an Asylum?</p>
<p>He walked to the main gate of the Asylum and found it was locked and couldn't be opened.</p>
<p>After wandering around for a bit, Sun Yixie finally found a small hole in the iron gate on the left and squeezed through.</p>
<p>Next came a series of in-game operation prompts.</p>
<p>Actions like running, jumping, climbing, and crouching.</p>
<p>And the game's camera and details were also very well done, something Sun Yixie hadn't experienced in previous horror games.</p>
<p>Through his headphones, he could clearly hear the protagonist's heavy breathing.</p>
<p>Following the operation prompts, he reached a window, and just as he climbed in, all the lights in the room suddenly went out.</p>
<p>The entire room plunged into darkness.</p>
<p>At the same time, Sun Yixie, who was playing the game, flinched at the sudden darkness.</p>
<p>“233333, what did I just see?”</p>
<p>“Haha, Brother Sun actually has eyes!”</p>
<p>“I'm dying of laughter, Brother Sun seemed to flinch just now, didn't he?”</p>
<p>“Brother Sun, if you're scared, just say so!”</p>
<p>Seeing Sun Yixie's reaction, the bullet comments in the live streaming room also started flooding in with various messages.</p>
<p>Compared to his usual streams, today's bullet comments were more numerous, clearly indicating that many viewers were also scared and sending messages to alleviate their fear.</p>
<p>“D-darn it! What's there to be scared of?! I'm a tough guy! What am I afraid of?! There's nothing to be afraid of!”</p>
<p>After turning on the DV camera's night vision mode, the ghastly green tint of the screen made the entire game atmosphere even more eerie.</p>
<p>Sun Yixie encouraged himself by shouting loudly while holding the camera and beginning to explore.</p>
<p>Pulling open a slightly ajar door, Sun Yixie walked forward.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the television, which was off, automatically turned on, emitting a sharp noise.</p>
<p>“Ahhh!”</p>
<p>This sharp noise immediately startled Sun Yixie.</p>
<p>Sun Yixie, seen on camera, trembled all over from fright, accompanied by a world-class tenor's shout. He kicked the table with his legs, sending his wheeled chair rolling backward, while simultaneously covering his eyes with both hands and slumping back into the chair.</p>
<p>After a few seconds, realizing there seemed to be no further sound in his headphones, he parted his hands, which were covering his face, just a little, and peeked at the computer screen through the small gap with the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>In the pitch-black room in the game, there was only a static-filled television.</p>
<p>After confirming there was no danger, Sun Yixie finally lowered his hands, moving them from covering his face to covering his chest, a look of immense relief on his face.</p>
