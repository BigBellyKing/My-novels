                <p>Chapter 17 Isn't It Normal for Young People to Be Spirited?</p>
<p>"This is outrageous! How can there be such a person!" Ruan Ningxue exclaimed, looking quite angry.</p>
<p>It was important to remember that <em>Mirror</em> had her participation too.</p>
<p>"This person is cunning; he just wants attention, whether it's criticism or support," Yang Xin said, comforting Ruan Ningxue.</p>
<p>"Exactly, people like this are not uncommon; you find them in every industry," Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>"So, Chen Xu, are we just going to pretend we don't know?" Ruan Ningxue felt a bit wronged.</p>
<p>If they didn't fight back, others would just walk all over them. But if they did, wouldn't it be playing right into the other person's hands?</p>
<p>"Of course not, he wants to pick a fight, doesn't he? Let's give him what he wants!" Chen Xu chuckled, then opened his official Weibo account and sent a message.</p>
<p>'To certain self-proclaimed veterans: games are art, but they are also commercial products, just like films have art-house movies and commercial blockbusters. <em>Mirror</em> has never claimed to be art.'</p>
<p>'Of course, some veterans who claim their works are art must have been attacked by young people who lack "wude" (martial ethics), because for a work that can truly be called art, its ratings are quite indefensible!'</p>
<p>After sending the official Weibo message, Chen Xu also updated the store description for <em>Mirror</em>.</p>
<p>This was mainly because his official Weibo account had too few followers.</p>
<p>There were only a little over a thousand, and most of them had followed him previously through his comics.</p>
<p>After all, while <em>Mirror</em>'s sales were decent, most Gentleman's Gamers wouldn't pay much attention to its game producer.</p>
<p>Seeing the official Weibo post Chen Xu had sent, Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue were stunned.</p>
<p>"Chen Xu, didn't you say the other party was doing this on purpose? Isn't this exactly what they wanted?" Ruan Ningxue asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>"Someone's already being provocative; if I don't respond, wouldn't that make me too cowardly?" Chen Xu shrugged, a smile on his face.</p>
<p>Yang Xin, on the other hand, had her eyes light up: "<em>Undertale</em> isn't a very large game in scope. If we work some overtime these days, we can definitely get the asset production on schedule!"</p>
<p>Chen Xu nodded, "Exactly. Before, I was wondering how to promote it, but now... this free traffic is too good to pass up."</p>
<p>"However, everyone will have to work hard these next few days," Chen Xu said.</p>
<p>It was just like in the business world: when the top two fight, it's often the third one who gets wiped out.</p>
<p>The gaming industry was much the same.</p>
<p>The most terrifying thing wasn't being criticized, but being ignored.</p>
<p>As for the quality of <em>Undertale</em>, Chen Xu was quite confident.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>As Chen Xu and his two colleagues entered "overtime maniac" mode,</p>
<p>the buzz around Chen Xu's official Weibo post slowly began to grow.</p>
<p>Although Chen Xu's official Weibo account didn't have many followers,</p>
<p>there were still a great many players active in <em>Mirror</em> during this period, and they were redirected to the post.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhong Mei had already been targeting <em>Mirror</em>, so many people were quietly watching to see how <em>Mirror</em> and Chen Xu would react.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, they really did catch something.</p>
<p>At first, many people regarded Zhong Mei's official Weibo post as a joke.</p>
<p>After all, it wasn't the first time he had done something like this.</p>
<p>But with Chen Xu's official Weibo post following right after, the nature of the situation completely changed.</p>
<p>Anyone could see that Chen Xu was implicitly referring to Zhong Mei.</p>
<p>A single clap makes no sound; Chen Xu's response instantly drew in countless 'melon-eating' onlookers.</p>
<p>Various media outlets reported on the incident, and many 'melon-eating' players also joined in.</p>
<p>Sparking widespread discussion.</p>
<p>'Holy crap, what's going on?'</p>
<p>'They're fighting, they're fighting!'</p>
<p>'So Chen Xu is the creator of <em>Mirror</em>!'</p>
<p>'Bro upstairs, does this designer named Chen Xu have some kind of background?'</p>
<p>'No, why?'</p>
<p>'If not, then what are you exclaiming about?'</p>
<p>'Haha, Chen Xu's words are really cutting deep.'</p>
<p>'Spot on, Zhong 'Big Cannon' has indeed made two decent games, but they're far from being works of art.'</p>
<p>'I support Chen Xu! What's wrong with liking Gentleman's Games? Bring on the sequel and new DLC characters, GKD!'</p>
<p>'I actually think Zhong 'Big Cannon' is right this time; Gentleman's Games truly aren't respectable.'</p>
<p>'Bah! It's easy to talk tough after putting on your pants! Wasn't Zhong 'Big Cannon' the one who started provoking first?'</p>
<p>With Chen Xu's response, the buzz around the incident immediately soared, attracting attention from a large number of players.</p>
<p>Among them were many players who supported Chen Xu, as Zhong Mei's reputation, both in the gaming industry and among players, was not very good.</p>
<p>However, there were also some who couldn't stand Chen Xu and sided with Zhong Mei, given that <em>Mirror</em>'s game genre was indeed prone to controversy.</p>
<p>But one thing was certain: Chen Xu and Zhong Mei instantly became the focus of attention for many media outlets and players.</p>
<p>To say the entire gaming world was a bit of an exaggeration, but with various media outlets vying to report on it, most players who followed the independent game scene recently were basically aware of the incident.</p>
<p>Chen Xu's official Weibo account also gained over a hundred thousand followers overnight.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>At the same time, in the offices of Hapai Culture &amp; Sports, Zhong Mei also learned of the news through his assistant's reminder.</p>
<p>However, he wasn't angry; instead, his face was filled with excitement.</p>
<p>"Excellent! We should indeed seek out young designers who are just starting out but have a bit of fame. This is what being young is all about! Spirited! If you're not spirited, can you still be called young?" Zhong Mei exclaimed, his face beaming with joy.</p>
<p>What was that online interview for before?</p>
<p>Wasn't it for buzz?!</p>
<p>Look now, hasn't the buzz arrived?</p>
<p>How long has it been since someone proactively stepped forward to cooperate?</p>
<p>Having someone cooperate and having no one cooperate are two different concepts!</p>
<p>Look at how enthusiastic the media reporting is now. Before, to stir up this topic, he had specifically bought some traffic.</p>
<p>But it hadn't caused much of a stir. And now?</p>
<p>With a response, he didn't even have to lift a finger; the traffic came automatically!</p>
<p>But he still needed to add more fuel to make the buzz even stronger!</p>
<p>With a smile, Zhong Mei opened his official Weibo and posted a message: "Some game designers are very adept at quoting out of context. I have never said my own games are art; I am merely someone who hopes to develop a game that can be called art."</p>
<p>"But judging by the games some designers develop, they may never understand in their lifetime how to create a true game, rather than relying on some cleverness... or rather, petty cleverness."</p>
<p>After the official Weibo message was sent, Zhong Mei even specifically @mentioned Chen Xu.</p>
<p>However, to Zhong Mei's surprise, the other party replied incredibly quickly; in about five minutes, he was @mentioned by them.</p>
<p>'That's what I should be saying too. The new game, <em>Undertale</em>, will officially launch on July 15th. Perhaps some designers can take a look and see if a game like this can be considered a true game, and if it possesses any artistic merit.'</p>
<p>Zhong Mei's smile suddenly froze on his face.</p>
<p>This move, it felt so familiar!</p>
<p>Thanks to 'Dimension within me' for the 500 tip.</p>
