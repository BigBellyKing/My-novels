                <p>Chapter 323: The White House Falls (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Clicking open the video, Zhang Yi's vision was first enveloped in darkness, then the Nebula Games LOGO appeared.</p>
<p>This was a standard opening.</p>
<p>But the next moment.</p>
<p>A sound reached Zhang Yi's ears. Ssshhh... it seemed like something falling, then... 'Boom!' a loud crash.</p>
<p>This was immediately followed by rapid gunfire, screams, shouts, and explosions.</p>
<p>In the darkness, coupled with the VR gaming pod's stereo sound, Zhang Yi was instantly plunged into that wartime atmosphere.</p>
<p>Even though it was still just a black screen, Zhang Yi could already be certain.</p>
<p>This was a completely different game from Rainbow Six Siege.</p>
<p>Because in Rainbow Six Siege, while there were also explosions and gunfights, they were essentially all indoor combat.</p>
<p>And now, this Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, although the screen hadn't appeared yet, just the sound effects alone made him feel an atmosphere of war.</p>
<p>‘Move it! Move it! Quickly!’</p>
<p>‘Attack! Attack! Requesting fire support!’</p>
<p>‘Attack! Attack!’</p>
<p>‘R-P-G!’</p>
<p>‘I’m hit!’</p>
<p>‘Shoot! Shoot!’</p>
<p>‘Two o’clock! Requesting suppo—’</p>
<p>Amidst the cacophony, the darkness before Zhang Yi's eyes finally gave way.</p>
<p>It was replaced by a blur.</p>
<p>Content from a promotional video, presented in a first-person perspective?</p>
<p>The sounds were a bit noisy, and the vision was also a bit blurry.</p>
<p>Then, a soldier lying prone on the ground slowly stood up.</p>
<p>But the next moment, before he could react.</p>
<p>A bullet instantly pierced his head.</p>
<p>It was then that the classic bullet time sequence appeared; accompanied by the bullet and blood, the camera followed the bullet's trajectory, slowly ascending.</p>
<p>“Oh my god!” As the bullet's path stretched out, Zhang Yi was utterly shocked.</p>
<p>What did he see!?</p>
<p>This battlefield was actually the White House!</p>
<p>America's most iconic administrative building, the White House located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington D.C.!</p>
<p>And the tattered Stars and Stripes flag, all unequivocally indicated that the White House had fallen!</p>
<p>This was utterly insane!</p>
<p>In an instant, Zhang Yi's eyes widened.</p>
<p>Countless soldiers moved through a hail of bullets and explosions, torrential rain poured down in the dark night, but it couldn't extinguish the flames ignited by the blasts.</p>
<p>The once magnificent White House was now nothing but ruins and rubble.</p>
<p>In the sky, a fighter jet strafed enemies outside the White House furiously, its endless fire spitting out a fierce line across the air.</p>
<p>But at that moment, a roar came: R! P! G!</p>
<p>With a trail of sparks and exhaust, a rocket struck the fuselage dead-on, accompanied by a thunderous explosion and the brilliant flash of fire in the night.</p>
<p>In the sky, a Blackhawk falls!</p>
<p>The entire White House was completely engulfed in war, only the tattered Stars and Stripes still fluttered.</p>
<p>The White House—fallen!</p>
<p>“Holy shit! This is absolutely incredible!”</p>
<p>Eyes wide, Zhang Yi yelled out in astonishment.</p>
<p>With the enhancement of VR's panoramic view and stereo sound, the entire atmosphere of war was vividly brought to life.</p>
<p>Of course, even more crucial was the setting!</p>
<p>It was simply insane!</p>
<p>Who could have imagined that Chen Xu would pull off such a crazy scene in this game called Call of Duty: Modern Warfare?!</p>
<p>The White House falls!</p>
<p>My god!</p>
<p>It was utterly crazy!</p>
<p>Zhang Yi roared in his heart, but goosebumps had already risen all over his body from excitement.</p>
<p>Apart from everything else, just the sight of the White House falling before his eyes was enough to fill him with excitement.</p>
<p>A must-buy!</p>
<p>There was nothing more to say!</p>
<p>This Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was definitely a game he had to buy!</p>
<p>While Zhang Yi was excited, the video continued to play.</p>
<p>‘Why did you do this!? Where did you get the nukes?’</p>
<p>A man with a mustache and a boonie hat expertly used hand-to-hand combat techniques on an enemy, slamming him to the ground and beating him severely.</p>
<p>‘Who is it!?’</p>
<p>‘Who! Tell me! His name!’</p>
<p>Looking at the badly beaten enemy on the ground, the officer with the boonie hat wore a cold expression.</p>
<p>However, the man tied to the chair, despite being beaten into a daze, still didn't utter a word. At this point, the camera zoomed in.</p>
<p>The expression on his face was one of terror.</p>
<p>Just then, the phone next to him rang.</p>
<p>“Sir, his phone is ringing.”</p>
<p>The soldier handed the phone to the captain.</p>
<p>After answering the call, the officer with the boonie hat said nothing, turned, and shot the interrogated enemy dead.</p>
<p>‘Sir, who was that?’ the soldier next to him asked, voicing his confusion.</p>
<p>‘Zakhaev... Imran Zakhaev.’ Tossing the phone aside, the officer in the boonie hat seemed lost in a memory.</p>
<p>As his words faded, the image on the screen slowly disappeared.</p>
<p>The next moment, the camera ascended into the air, offering a God's-eye view of the land.</p>
<p>This was a city engulfed in war.</p>
<p>Countless attack helicopters, tanks, and armored vehicles were in the process of evacuating.</p>
<p>But just then, a blinding flash of intense light erupted from the city.</p>
<p>A massive explosion rang out, and then a mushroom cloud ascended.</p>
<p>Dust filled the sky, and a visible shockwave radiated outwards from the epicenter.</p>
<p>Countless buildings collapsed instantly; helicopters in the sky, armored vehicles and tanks on the ground, all plummeted or were directly overturned and exploded.</p>
<p>As the dust cleared, the entire city center was a massive crater.</p>
<p>The city was nuked!</p>
<p>“Oh my god!” Swallowing hard, Zhang Yi had already had a hunch when the mustachioed officer interrogated the enemy earlier.</p>
<p>But he never imagined there would actually be such a scene. Was this part of the game's story?</p>
<p>No way!?</p>
<p>The scene flashed, and countless armored divisions and fully armed soldiers slowly advanced in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Outside Earth, an EMP missile was launched into space, causing a space station to disintegrate, with astronauts cursing in panic.</p>
<p>On the Champ de Mars, countless soldiers desperately resisted enemy tanks, armored vehicles, and attack helicopters, while the Eiffel Tower, standing amidst the bombing, crashed into the Seine River.</p>
<p>In a night of thunder and torrential rain, a cruise ship sailed on the ocean, where a special operations team left no armed militants alive on board.</p>
<p>A thrilling snowmobile chase in a vast snowy landscape.</p>
<p>A city chase against tanks amidst a hail of bullets and explosions, turning the once prosperous city into ruins under a baptism of fire.</p>
<p>Cars on the streets exploded and burned, sending sparks and engulfing the city in flames.</p>
<p>Assault boats facing helicopters on a turbulent river.</p>
<p>A desperate escape from drone bombing in a mountain town.</p>
<p>Almost every imaginable intense action sequence was vividly showcased in this promotional video.</p>
<p>Finally, as two nuclear missiles ascended, the game's title officially appeared.</p>
