                <p>Chapter 458: Emotional Players (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Song Ren was utterly speechless looking at the Animus that had sent him back out.</p>
<p>He could still connect, but he found that once connected, it only displayed the central city area of Florence.</p>
<p>Moreover, there were no NPCs on the streets, and just like the previous VR theme, the usable space was particularly small.</p>
<p>If it had been before, Song Ren might have enthusiastically wandered around a bit.</p>
<p>But having just finished experiencing the game, he now had no such mood. It was simply too much!</p>
<p>He was having such a great time!</p>
<p>Why did it suddenly end? Intentionally stopping the trial content here, Mr. Chen was simply too much. Song Ren was speechless; this cliffhanger was absolutely brilliant!</p>
<p>Although he felt that Assassin's Creed's gameplay was quite free, for example, he could dart through the streets and alleys of Florence, parkour on rooftops, and swim in the water.</p>
<p>However, he could also clearly sense that Assassin's Creed, much like Uncharted, placed a lot of its focus on the game's storyline.</p>
<p>More importantly, the cliffhanger in this trial was placed with exquisite precision.</p>
<p>Here, the player, portraying Ezio, witnesses his father, younger brother, and older brother tragically betrayed by Uberto, the fat Magistrate.</p>
<p>At the same time, Ezio finally seemed to transition from a thug to the path of an Assassin.</p>
<p>He also had his Hidden Blade repaired by Da Vinci and learned how to conceal his Assassin's footsteps.</p>
<p>Everything was ready, just waiting to head to the target location to assassinate the traitor, when it suddenly cut off.</p>
<p>This was absolutely maddening. After all, at this point, all players were immersed in the game and had high expectations for the upcoming assassination and revenge sequence.</p>
<p>But? It was gone!</p>
<p>Song Ren, emerging from the Huanyu VR gaming pod, had a bewildered look on his face.</p>
<p>At that moment, his phone, placed beside him, vibrated. A message from Zhang Yi appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>“Old Song, how do you feel about the Assassin's Creed trial? Don't spoil anything for me, I just want to know your general impression!”</p>
<p>Having finally endured work until quitting time, Zhang Yi, on his way home, thought about immediately trying out the Assassin's Creed trial. He couldn't resist sending a message to Song Ren, who had already played it, to ask for his opinion on the game.</p>
<p>Looking at Zhang Yi's message, Song Ren, who had just come out of the VR gaming pod, sat silently on a nearby stool for a moment, then began to reply.</p>
<p>“How should I put it? I think the game's graphics and the depiction of Renaissance Florence are very well done, giving a truly immersive sense of realism.”</p>
<p>“But these aren't the most crucial aspects. The truly critical point is that the game's plot is full of twists and turns. Even though it's just a trial version, it's enough to give your emotions in the game a rollercoaster-like experience.”</p>
<p>“This is a game that, after playing, you'll immediately want to vent your pent-up emotions on Chen Xu's official Weibo account.”</p>
<p>“That's all I can say.”</p>
<p>Summarizing his one-hour-plus trial experience, Song Ren sent the message to Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, who had just arrived home, saw the message from Song Ren.</p>
<p>He was immediately stunned. Such high praise!</p>
<p>Although he hadn't played it yet, his anticipation was completely maxed out. After taking off his shoes, the first thing Zhang Yi did was rush straight to the gaming pod. He didn't even think about preparing dinner; at most, he'd ask Wang Han to bring some back when she returned.</p>
<p>The most critical thing now was to experience the Assassin's Creed trial version immediately.</p>
<p>An hour and a half later.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, emerging from the Huanyu VR gaming pod, felt like his teeth were about to shatter.</p>
<p>Now he finally understood what Song Ren's words meant!</p>
<p>This storyline, this cliffhanger – is this something a human being could do?!</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>Online, naturally, a series of related topics like 'Death to Chen Xu' and 'Warrior of Love', filled with players' 'love' for Chen Xu, became trending topics.</p>
<p>This time, the players were furious, as this trial chapter was truly hateful! First, a harmonious family, then three of them died directly. And just as the truly exciting assassination sequence was about to begin, it was cut off.</p>
<p>Could they tolerate this?</p>
<p>“I'm disgusted! How can there be such a designer?!”</p>
<p>“After Uncharted, I thought Chen Xu had become friendlier. Turns out, I was damn wrong!”</p>
<p>“What kind of spirit is this, tirelessly trying to torment players?”</p>
<p>“Honestly, it's not that bad. The father, older brother, and younger brother felt like mere plot devices, and they didn't appear much.”</p>
<p>“Plot devices? Then kill them off at the beginning! Why the hell arrange several warm scenes, especially climbing the tower with my brother to enjoy the view, and then going to find Cristina? I thought this was going to be a heartwarming game!”</p>
<p>“It's filled with Mr. Chen's deep malice! But from a certain perspective, since three people died right at the start, there shouldn't be much left to kill later, right?”</p>
<p>“Whether or not there's more killing, I've already gotten used to it. The key is that this trial content is cut at such a crucial point!”</p>
<p>“It's just so frustrating!”</p>
<p>Many players were on the verge of a breakdown. Damn it, Chen Xu, hurry up and release the game!</p>
<p>They really couldn't take it anymore. If they hadn't played it before, it would have been fine, but after experiencing the trial content, players were completely drawn in by Assassin's Creed's content and details.</p>
<p>Instead of an open world, it adopted a sandbox-like gameplay, coupled with the Animus setting, making Assassin's Creed's visuals on par with Uncharted.</p>
<p>Yet, in terms of gameplay freedom, it offered a surprisingly liberating experience.</p>
<p>This allowed many players to become completely immersed during their playthrough.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Assassin's Creed II itself was a narrative-driven game without RPG elements, and the in-game cinematics were perfectly executed.</p>
<p>This allowed players to 'possess' Ezio and experience his story.</p>
<p>And the final plot point in the trial version was the game's first major conflict.</p>
<p>These were all points that made players unable to stop, yet just when you were most excited, it abruptly ended.</p>
<p>It could be said that many players were a little emotional at this moment.</p>
<p>Each of them wanted to send Chen Xu some local specialties from their hometown.</p>
<p>Of course, despite the excitement, many players who hadn't pre-ordered rushed to buy the game. After all, this Assassin's Creed promotion wasn't just for pre-order players; it was available to all players on the Huanyu VR platform.</p>
<p>So, some players who hadn't intended to pre-order, after experiencing this seemingly free trial version, cursed Chen Xu while simultaneously reaching into their wallets to pull out cash and hand it over to Nebula Games.</p>
<p>Thus, a series of surprising phenomena quickly appeared online: one moment a player was cursing Chen Xu, and the next, they posted a screenshot of their Assassin's Creed purchase.</p>
