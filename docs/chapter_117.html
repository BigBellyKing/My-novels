                <h1>Chapter 216: How Can You Build a Beautiful House Without Materials? (Please subscribe, monthly pass)</h1>
<p>Upon hearing Zhang Yi’s words, Wang Han, who was sitting there eating duck leg rice, shot him a glare.</p>
<p>What kind of talk was that!</p>
<p>How was it embarrassing!</p>
<p>What's wrong with the name Master Builder?</p>
<p>People always need to have hope!</p>
<p>Besides, it might be a bit ugly, but it's a house, isn't it?</p>
<p>“Hmph, don’t talk about me. I think if you were to come, it wouldn't be much better. This game looks simple, but it’s actually quite difficult. Just imagining the structure of the house would be a torment for you,” Wang Han said, unconvinced, to Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>This was Wang Han’s most intuitive feeling.</p>
<p>She hadn't experienced much of the game yet.</p>
<p>But just building this house, she felt she could play for a long time.</p>
<p>And while the game's controls weren't very complicated, she had seen Chen Xu’s promotional trailer on the official Weibo account, and the houses and castles in it were beautiful.</p>
<p>However, it was only when she personally started building a house that she truly understood the difficulty.</p>
<p>Because there were no reference objects, she couldn't just copy a blueprint.</p>
<p>Building a house purely from her imagination turned out to be really hard.</p>
<p>Especially when you imagine a house in your mind, you unconsciously associate it with real-life houses.</p>
<p>But the crucial point is that in the game, everything is built with these cubic blocks. If there are discrepancies with what you imagined, you can only use your experience to choose blocks to substitute.</p>
<p>And so, as the substitutions accumulated, the result ended up completely different from the picture in her mind.</p>
<p>“I get it!” Wang Han exclaimed, clapping her hands with a look of sudden realization as she tidied up the finished roast duck rice on the table.</p>
<p>“What do you get?” Zhang Yi asked, looking bewildered, sitting in Wang Han’s seat.</p>
<p>While Wang Han was eating, he had also sat in her seat and tried out <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>
<p>Although he hadn't gone through a new player tutorial like Wang Han, he understood some basic operations. He had just crafted a stone hoe and was about to go look for coal to make two torches when Wang Han’s sudden shout startled him.</p>
<p>“Hmph hmph! Why did I build such an unusually shaped structure?” Wang Han asked Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Zhang Yi couldn't help but complain inwardly.</p>
<p>That prison from just now, could that be called 'uniquely shaped'?</p>
<p>It was just ugly! And ridiculously ugly at that!</p>
<p>Of course, he definitely wouldn't voice these inner thoughts; he merely adopted a listening posture.</p>
<p>“As the saying goes, ‘A skilled housewife cannot cook without rice.’”</p>
<p>“Of course, the title of Master Builder, while I might not have achieved it yet, I feel my abilities are more than just this. The real reason I built that house was the lack of materials. That’s why I couldn’t construct the style I wanted!” The more Wang Han spoke, the more confident she became.</p>
<p>Looking at the 'prison house' built of wood before her, Wang Han had to admit one thing: the house was indeed quite ugly.</p>
<p>And she started pondering. After all, she had only used wood throughout the entire process. How could she build a beautiful house with just that?</p>
<p>If she had more materials, the room she built would definitely look much better!</p>
<p>As the saying goes, a skilled housewife cannot cook without rice.</p>
<p>The same goes for building a house.</p>
<p>Without good raw materials, how can one build a beautiful house?</p>
<p>So, Wang Han directly exited the game, then looked at the save seed named 'Master Builder World' and chose to delete it.</p>
<p>It was a bit of a dark history.</p>
<p>Thereupon, Wang Han started by choosing Creative Mode and gave her character a new name: Ziqing.</p>
<p>“What kind of strange name is that? Not calling yourself Master Builder anymore?” Zhang Yi, sitting next to her, asked curiously, looking at Wang Han's new name.</p>
<p>“Hmph, haven't you heard the allusion to 'supernatural workmanship'? Ziqing is the protagonist of that idiom,” Wang Han huffed, explaining the origin of her chosen name.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, next to her, took a sip of water and remained silent.</p>
<p>It was still unknown what the house would look like. The only reference point was the previous 'prison darkroom'.</p>
<p>But as for the name, she certainly had a knack for choosing them.</p>
<p>Ziqing, and supernatural workmanship. He wanted to see what kind of astonishing building she could construct.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, sitting next to her, stared at the computer screen, ready to see what kind of world-shattering architecture Wang Han would create.</p>
<p>“The things in this Creative Mode are so rich!” Wang Han exclaimed with surprise upon entering the game.</p>
<p>Compared to Survival Mode, where you start with nothing, Creative Mode was completely different.</p>
<p>Not only could she control her character to fly freely, allowing for more unrestricted construction.</p>
<p>The crucial point was that destroying things only took one hit, and she had infinite resources.</p>
<p>Even more importantly, she could access all sorts of materials, most of which she had never seen before.</p>
<p>Various types of glass, doors, windows, carpets, and so on—everything was available.</p>
<p>Seeing these materials, Wang Han felt invigorated, imbued with a strange confidence.</p>
<p>“You think my house-building is bad, huh? Let me show you how good my skills really are.” Thinking of Zhang Yi’s recent words, Wang Han’s expression became very serious and focused.</p>
<p>From now on, she was going to prove herself.</p>
<p>To prove that the previous prison house was absolutely just an accident.</p>
<p>Looking at the various materials in her inventory, and utilizing the ability to fly, Wang Han quickly chose a picturesque spot with beautiful mountains and clear waters.</p>
<p>First, she laid the foundation as before. This time, with materials at hand, Wang Han decided she could be a little more extravagant.</p>
<p>She wanted to build a larger mansion.</p>
<p>She first filled the ground entirely with stone blocks, and then her mind conjured up various spectacular buildings she had seen during her travels.</p>
<p>She selected building materials and stacked eight pillars.</p>
<p>Then, she began building walls around these pillars, using them as load-bearing columns.</p>
<p>Wang Han meticulously refined the design around the foundation.</p>
<p>She laid down some carpets and various other decorative items on the ground.</p>
<p>At the same time, Wang Han also discovered a very magical block, a block called Glowstone.</p>
<p>It could even emit very bright light, directly replacing the function of torches.</p>
<p>She glanced at the unbuilt roof and decided to cap it directly with Glowstone.</p>
<p>This way, it would remain sparkling bright throughout.</p>
<p>Glass, Diamond Ore, Emerald — anything that looked pretty, Wang Han used it all.</p>
<p>After about fifteen minutes, Wang Han felt she had built enough. She stepped back to admire it, but the next moment, she fell silent.</p>
<p>The house before her was just… strange.</p>
<p>While building, Wang Han’s mind had envisioned something magnificent and grand.</p>
<p>But as she continued building, and then looked at the actual product, she didn't know where she had gone wrong.</p>
<p>In any case, it had unconsciously become different from what she had imagined.</p>
<p>It felt a little unfamiliar.</p>
<p>Although it was clearly the shape of a house, it just looked odd no matter how she viewed it.</p>
<p>It was perfectly square, looking very orderly.</p>
<p>The material in front of the door was similar to marble, with glass replacing the walls, creating a transparent effect.</p>
<p>The entire ceiling was made of Glowstone, shimmering brightly.</p>
<p>For the overall structure of the house, Wang Han had referenced the symmetrical design of the Forbidden City.</p>
<p>She even specifically built a rather long flight of steps at the entrance, dug a ditch filled with water, and laid a wooden bridge over it.</p>
<p>But the idea was great, yet just like architectural renderings versus actual buildings, the gap between her imagination and the reality was too vast!</p>
<p>The Glowstone glittered, but a ceiling made of so much Glowstone looked strange no matter how you saw it.</p>
<p>And the ditch at the entrance, according to her inner vision, was meant to evoke the poetic imagery of 'small bridges, flowing water, humble homes,' but now it just looked like a sewer.</p>
