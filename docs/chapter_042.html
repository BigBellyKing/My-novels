                <p>Chapter 42: Exceptional Reviews</p>
<p>Amidst various discussions among online players and media.</p>
<p>At three o'clock in the afternoon, the Game Department's website, along with official game announcements made via official Weibo accounts and public accounts, simultaneously released the latest selection news.</p>
<p><em>To the Moon</em> successfully secured first prize in this Game Design Competition, while <em>Galaxy Heroes</em> took second place.</p>
<p>Chen Xu, from Nebula Games, also received a phone notification from the Game Department.</p>
<p>The content of the call was an invitation for him to attend the award ceremony at the Game Department.</p>
<p>Concurrently, the official game store also prominently displayed the award notification for <em>To the Moon</em> on its homepage.</p>
<p>And on the homepage of the official game store, an appreciation review was also posted, naming <em>To the Moon</em> as the first prize winner.</p>
<p>‘Imagine, on your deathbed, sitting in bed, recalling all the joys and regrets of your life, especially the regrets.’</p>
<p>‘You always tell yourself that if you could go back, you would do this, fulfill that dream, but it always seems like something diverts you from achieving your dreams: family obligations, work, spending time with friends.’</p>
<p>‘And now, as you are about to pass away, you have no more time. What if you could alter your memories at the end of your life, to fulfill that dream in your dying mind?’</p>
<p>‘This is just the tip of the iceberg for <em>To the Moon</em>. It's not a grand production; it doesn't have exquisite graphics or complex gameplay. But what I want to say is, just like producer Chen Xu’s previous game, <em>Undertale</em>, <em>To the Moon</em> has taught all designers of video game narratives a lesson, raising the bar for this genre of games to such a high level.’</p>
<p>‘To review the entire game, it's difficult to discuss without spoilers, but we can only say that if you are a player who values story-driven games, then this game is a must-play.’</p>
<p>‘Such a viewpoint might be influenced by time, but at least for now, this is absolutely a perfect game.’</p>
<p>‘The dialogue is perfect. There are many witty jokes in the collaboration between Dr. Eva and Dr. Neil, providing humor to break up what is often a somber story.’</p>
<p>‘The story is perfect. The tale of Johnny and his wife Liva has many twists and turns, some bittersweet, some utterly poignant, and it’s not merely a mix of humor and sorrow.’</p>
<p>‘The music is perfect, filled with beautiful piano melodies, each track shining on its own, recurring at different thematic story and choice moments, just as you would expect from the best films.’</p>
<p>‘<em>To the Moon</em> is about a life: the people, places, hardships, and joys that make us human.’</p>
<p>‘The entire story begins as a mixed potpourri, but as the years are rewound, it culminates in a satisfying crystallization.’</p>
<p>‘Without a doubt, this is absolutely a game that can be called perfect.’</p>
<p>This appreciation article from the Game Department can be said to have given <em>To the Moon</em> an exceedingly high evaluation, fully affirming its status in the gaming world.</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games' office.</p>
<p>Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue also saw the Game Department's announcement immediately, both letting out cheers.</p>
<p>"Chen Xu, look quickly! <em>To the Moon</em> is already on the recommended list of the Official Game Platform!" Yang Xin exclaimed, her face full of excitement.</p>
<p>This is the Official Game Platform!</p>
<p>And this game even won first place in this event.</p>
<p>This was something Yang Xin wouldn't have dared to imagine before.</p>
<p>For her, who was determined to achieve great things in the gaming industry, it was so exciting that she could barely contain herself.</p>
<p>Her entire face was flushed red with excitement.</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue next to her was the same, her face full of excitement.</p>
<p>As for the new employees who joined Nebula Games during the period <em>To the Moon</em> was launched, they were equally excited.</p>
<p>Even though this game had nothing to do with them.</p>
<p>Yet, such an achievement fully proved that Nebula Games had a promising future, and since they were about to work for this company with unlimited potential, they were naturally very happy.</p>
<p>"Oh, right, are you going to attend the award ceremony for <em>To the Moon</em> next?" Yang Xin asked Chen Xu, having just thought of something.</p>
<p>"Yes, the Game Department's leaders just informed me," Chen Xu nodded.</p>
<p>"An award ceremony! Will it be on TV?" Ruan Ningxue, standing nearby, asked curiously.</p>
<p>"You're thinking too much. It's not a commercial award ceremony; it's basically just showing up, getting a certificate, that kind of thing," Chen Xu shook his head and said.</p>
<p>"Ah, I see!" Ruan Ningxue realized.</p>
<p>"Alright, enough about that. Let's talk about the company. I'll give you a heads-up: after the National Day holiday, we'll begin developing a new project, and this time, it will be a relatively big move."</p>
<p>"Additionally, before the end of October, the platform aspect will also need to be set up. For time-consuming, labor-intensive, non-core areas, we'll go directly with outsourcing."</p>
<p>Chen Xu looked at everyone and spoke.</p>
<p><em>Mirror</em>, <em>Undertale</em>, and <em>To the Moon</em> are all small in terms of cost and scale.</p>
<p>But in terms of sales, they are absolutely successful.</p>
<p>The funds provided by the three games are still barely enough for Chen Xu to develop a large AAA-tier game.</p>
<p>However, he can certainly venture into developing some more refined, larger-scale games.</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu's words, everyone's expressions turned serious, but more so, they were filled with anticipation.</p>
<p>After all, who in the gaming industry doesn't dream of participating in big projects?</p>
<p>Whether from the perspective of personal goals or career resume.</p>
<p>After chatting with the team for a bit, Chen Xu returned to his office, leaned back in his chair, and looked at the UI interface that only he could see.</p>
<p>It must be said that <em>To the Moon</em> really earned him a hefty wave of points.</p>
<p>It amassed enough points for three ten-pulls for him, in addition to what <em>Undertale</em> and <em>Mirror</em> had provided.</p>
<p>Currently, his points had grown to 4.5 million.</p>
<p>Enough for forty-five draws.</p>
<p>However, looking at these points, Chen Xu did not immediately make a move.</p>
<p>He planned to hoard them for a while first.</p>
<p>As for the next new project, Chen Xu hadn't decided yet, as development would have to wait until after the National Day holiday anyway.</p>
<p>During this period, Chen Xu estimated that, at the current rate of increase, he would likely accumulate enough points for another ten-pull by then.</p>
<p>After all, <em>To the Moon</em>, having just won first prize and landed on the Official Game Platform's recommended list, would definitely attract a large number of players.</p>
<p>And these players meant warm, fresh points!</p>
<p>Saving up for a ten-pull, from a superstitious belief perspective, would also increase the chances of getting good items.</p>
<p>Don't be like before, where out of twenty-one consecutive pulls, all he got were two Memory Capsules and not even a single rare skill book.</p>
