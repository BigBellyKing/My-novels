                <p>Chapter 213: Playtest Experience (Fifth Update, Seeking Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>In the Nebula Games office.</p>
<p>Most of the previously planned buildings were already completed, with only a small number still in the final stages.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, TengHua's Voyage has also announced its launch date, it's January 21st!" Qin Yi said, a little nervously.</p>
<p>"It's fine, don't forget our plan. You don't need to worry about the后续 promotional efforts for Minecraft; I've already arranged it with the Operations Department," Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>"As for Voyage, it's completely different from Minecraft, and I think their launch time will be quite awkward," Chen Xu said with a confident smile.</p>
<p>With only Don't Starve as a reference, and Don't Starve itself being a rather unique sandbox game with strong objectives.</p>
<p>This led many Game Designers to only see the survival aspect.</p>
<p>As a result, all other elements focused on survival, overlooking the biggest feature of sandbox games: creativity.</p>
<p>For example, Meng Zuo's Wasteland.</p>
<p>Including TengHua's newly launched Voyage, just from the promotional videos and materials, Chen Xu could tell that the other party had clearly gone astray.</p>
<p>They completely ignored creativity, violating the core characteristics of a sandbox game.</p>
<p>If he had to say, based on the content the other party had released so far, Chen Xu felt it leaned more towards a box garden game like Shenmue, creating an exquisite game world for players to explore.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Chen Xu believed these games would still sell well.</p>
<p>On one hand, the quality was there; on the other hand, although they had strayed, they incorporated some sandbox elements, and the gameplay itself did have some appeal.</p>
<p>But for them to become incredibly popular, the probability wasn't very high.</p>
<p>As for Voyage's launch date, if it were scheduled after Minecraft's official launch, or even simultaneously with Minecraft's playtest, Chen Xu didn't think the impact would be too significant.</p>
<p>Because, once again, the gaming industry is not a zero-sum industry, and while Voyage is advertised as a sandbox game, its gameplay is entirely different from Minecraft. As for now?</p>
<p>Chen Xu could only wish them good luck.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>On January 3rd, Minecraft officially opened for trial downloads.</p>
<p>It would last for five days.</p>
<p>Players who had been following the game eagerly began to download it and couldn't wait to experience it.</p>
<p>Hang Wang, sitting in front of her computer, looked at the unlocked game screen, happily took out her phone, and snapped a photo.</p>
<p>What? Use the system's or game's built-in screenshot function?</p>
<p>No way, I'm going to take a picture with my phone, and even upside down, with the focus slightly off.</p>
<p>After taking the photo, Wang Han sent it to Zhang Yi: "When are you getting off work!? I've already started playing!"</p>
<p>Almost immediately, Zhang Yi, on the other end of the phone, messaged back: "Soon, half an hour. It'll take over an hour to get home. Do you want me to bring you food?"</p>
<p>This was the message she was waiting for. Seeing Zhang Yi's message, Wang Han happily typed: "Bring me a roasted duck rice from downstairs when you get back, with cumin on the duck frame, no chili powder."</p>
<p>After a brief chat with Zhang Yi, Wang Han didn't hesitate to click on the Minecraft icon.</p>
<p>She had to admit, Don't Starve had truly amazed her before.</p>
<p>The last time she had been so engrossed in a game was Fall Guys and It Takes Two.</p>
<p>In between, she had looked at other game developers' sandbox games, but they were generally uninteresting.</p>
<p>She had been eagerly anticipating Minecraft for a long time.</p>
<p>Although it had a pixel style, and the previous promotional trailer didn't seem to show much, she was still very excited.</p>
<p>After all, Don't Starve hadn't even had a promotional trailer, just a text-based official Weibo account promotion from Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Upon entering the game, the Nebula Games LOGO was skipped.</p>
<p>What came into view next was a scene resembling a grassland, but with pixel graphics.</p>
<p>White clouds drifted across the distant sky, and sunlight penetrated them, shining upon the earth.</p>
<p>The clouds in the sky formed the game's name and LOGO: Minecraft.</p>
<p>At the same time, the shadows cast by the sunlight were also reflected on the ground.</p>
<p>Moreover, the initial loading interface was quite interesting because it wasn't a typical flat UI interface; it was an interactive game UI interface.</p>
<p>In this interface, the player controlled Steve, located on an isolated island.</p>
<p>It wasn't large and was surrounded by invisible walls.</p>
<p>In the distance was the boundless sea and the slowly rising morning sun.</p>
<p>On this island, there were also several houses.</p>
<p>They were labeled with content such as 'Exit Game', 'Options Settings', 'MOD modules', and 'Start Game'.</p>
<p>Everything was composed of individual blocks.</p>
<p>Hang Wang had previously thought that the pixel style would make her uncomfortable.</p>
<p>But now, having entered the game, she realized that, just like in Chen Xu's previous official Weibo promotional video.</p>
<p>Although the game was pixel-style, the combination of high-definition textures and lighting and shadows gave these pixel blocks a unique charm.</p>
<p>"It seems a bit different from what I imagined; the visuals in the trailer must have been real."</p>
<p>Looking at the ingenious UI interface, Wang Han couldn't help but exclaim in her heart.</p>
<p>Before, knowing that Minecraft was a pixel game, her biggest concern was the visual content.</p>
<p>Although she wasn't a graphics-focused player herself, she still hoped to play games with better visuals.</p>
<p>While Minecraft was pixelated, Chen Xu had meticulously handled the art presentation.</p>
<p>In addition to various high-definition textures and lighting and shadow effects, some subtle adjustments were also made.</p>
<p>In Minecraft, players can clearly see the changes in lighting and shadows, especially since Minecraft also has a weather system.</p>
<p>The effect of a rainbow and mist combined with lighting and shadows on a sunny day after rain can be described as outstanding.</p>
<p>Especially this loading interface, which intuitively allowed players to experience the game's visuals.</p>
<p>Without overthinking, Wang Han first checked the MOD modules, which, like Don't Starve before, had no content.</p>
<p>She then went into the house to start the game.</p>
<p>There were a total of four modes to choose from.</p>
<p>The first was 'single-player game', the second was 'multiplayer game', the third was 'LAN game', allowing players on the same network to play together.</p>
<p>The fourth was 'community game', where players used their own host as a server to build game saves.</p>
<p>However, it was currently in Early Access mode, so only single-player game and LAN game were open.</p>
<p>Of course, even in single-player game, players could invite friends through the Nebula Games Platform to join their server.</p>
<p>It sounded like the LAN mode wasn't very useful.</p>
<p>But this mode was mainly prepared for future mobile players, and although PC players generally wouldn't use it, as players would say, "I might not use it, but you can't not have it." Plus, it wasn't much trouble, so it was developed simultaneously.</p>
<p>"I can only play single-player mode for now," Wang Han muttered to herself, then selected the mode and entered the game.</p>
