                <p>Chapter 33: Full of Doubts</p>
<p>Continuing the conversation with the two bear kids, Dr. Neil received another piece of information: when Johnny wasn't sick, he often visited a lighthouse on the edge of a cliff.</p>
<p>And Johnny built his house in such a remote location specifically to guard that lighthouse? Clearly, something was going on there!</p>
<p>So Dong Zhen also followed the two bear kids towards the lighthouse.</p>
<p>On the way to the lighthouse, everyone chatted about various random topics, which added some amusement to the otherwise boring journey.</p>
<p>Boy Kid: 'Do you play role-playing games too?'</p>
<p>Dr. Neil: 'Uh... I don't...'</p>
<p>Girl Kid: 'He's not cool enough, he can't play!'</p>
<p>Dr. Neil: 'If I put my mind to it, there's nothing I can't do!'</p>
<p>As he finished speaking, the two bear kids discovered a sleeping squirrel and let out exclamations of surprise.</p>
<p>'Look, a squirrel!'</p>
<p>At this moment, Dr. Neil stood ready: 'Oh no! A terrifying Squirrel Monster!'</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Dong Zhen, playing the game in front of his computer, looked bewildered.</p>
<p>The next moment, an impassioned BGM started playing. The squirrel, Dr. Neil, and the two kids stood opposite each other, and simultaneously, a crude RPG turn-based UI interface appeared.</p>
<p>'Don't be afraid, children, I'll protect you!'</p>
<p>The two bear kids behind them exchanged glances, shrugged, and showed expressions of helplessness.</p>
<p>At the same time, 'Attack' and 'Defend' options appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>'What the heck, there's a system like this? Why does it feel so weird?!'</p>
<p>'Oh my goodness!'</p>
<p>Dong Zhen was completely stunned, looking at the game whose art style had suddenly changed.</p>
<p>Clicking the 'Attack' button, four skills appeared.</p>
<p>'Volcanic Jump Kick, Whirlwind Palm, Fist of Decisive Battle, Shoes?'</p>
<p>Dong Zhen, bewildered, randomly picked one.</p>
<p>Then a new option appeared: 'Shouting Volume'.</p>
<p>There were three options: 'Loud', 'Louder', 'Loudest'.</p>
<p>'Are you crazy!'</p>
<p>'What is all this?'</p>
<p>Dong Zhen was completely dumbfounded.</p>
<p>He decisively chose 'Loudest'.</p>
<p>'Your turn is over, Squirrel Monster!'</p>
<p>Dr. Neil shouted at the top of his lungs.</p>
<p>At this moment, the two bear kids behind him stepped forward.</p>
<p>'Stop it—! Or I'll tell Mom you're abusing animals!'</p>
<p>'Yeah, she'll call the police to arrest you!'</p>
<p>The next moment, the RPG UI instantly disappeared. The squirrel glanced at Dr. Neil as if he were an idiot, then turned and scurried away.</p>
<p>'What kind of development is this? I just got into it! I've been trolled!'</p>
<p>At this point, Dong Zhen understood. Clearly, this was a joke in the game, referencing turn-based RPGs.</p>
<p>Because most RPGs have a similar progression.</p>
<p>The bullet comments in the live stream were constantly scrolling across the screen.</p>
<p>'Holy crap, I really thought it was a turn-based RPG!'</p>
<p>'I just got into it and now I'm out of it!'</p>
<p>'Haha, I knew it, why did the art style suddenly change?'</p>
<p>'What the heck, I've been trolled!'</p>
<p>'Chen Xu is so devious!'</p>
<p>'23333333 (laughter), I think it's quite interesting. This isn't a comedy game, is it?'</p>
<p>'Haha, I think it might be. From the beginning until now, it's been full of humor!'</p>
<p>In the game, Dong Zhen steadily progressed and arrived at the lighthouse by the sea.</p>
<p>In front of the lighthouse was a tombstone.</p>
<p>The name of the tombstone's owner was: Liva.</p>
<p>'The old man's wife's tomb.'</p>
<p>Looking at the tomb before him, Dong Zhen recalled that the housekeeper in the house had mentioned Johnny once had a wife, but she had passed away long ago.</p>
<p>Clearly, this was the old man's wife's tomb, but why was she buried in front of the lighthouse?</p>
<p>Did this lighthouse hold any special meaning for the old man and his wife?</p>
<p>With a hint of doubt, Dong Zhen entered the lighthouse and climbed to the top.</p>
<p>Here, there were paper rabbits just like those in the basement, but one paper rabbit was different.</p>
<p>It was folded from a mix of two different colored papers, which would take a long time and be more difficult than folding a regular paper rabbit.</p>
<p>This one could also be collected, seemingly a crucial item.</p>
<p>But Dong Zhen's confusion only grew.</p>
<p>After going through all this, it seemed no questions were answered; instead, he accumulated a belly full of new questions.</p>
<p>The lighthouse and the paper rabbits, what did they truly mean?</p>
<p>Full of doubts, he returned to Johnny's room and, with Dr. Eva, who was already prepared, activated the machine.</p>
<p>Johnny, the old man lying on the bed, his life was about to unfold before everyone's eyes.</p>
<p>But just as they had done before, a medium was needed to enter Johnny's memories.</p>
<p>The purpose was to access the old man's childhood memories, allowing them to implant the dream of becoming an astronaut. Through the machine, this dream would become a persistent goal in the old man's virtual memories.</p>
<p>Thus, in the end, the old man would be able to fabricate a future for himself: one where he became an astronaut and successfully landed on the moon. This would fulfill his dying wish.</p>
<p>Therefore, to achieve this goal, they needed to gradually progress from the old man's recent memories towards his childhood memories.</p>
<p>Before embarking on their journey, they discovered a musical score on the piano downstairs from the old man's room—'To Liva (for river)'.</p>
<p>And the composer was Johnny; clearly, this was a piece he wrote for his wife.</p>
<p>Behind the house, the two doctors found Johnny, but through their conversation, they discovered something very strange.</p>
<p>Dr. Neil curiously asked Johnny why he wanted to go to the moon.</p>
<p>But even Johnny himself was very confused.</p>
<p>'I'm sorry, but I really don't know.'</p>
<p>'I just... want to go.'</p>
<p>Looking at the confused Johnny before him, Dong Zhen, like many viewers in the live stream, was also a little bewildered.</p>
<p>He himself didn't know why he wanted to go to the moon?</p>
<p>Then why did he have such a strong obsession?</p>
<p>'Could it be the origin of an alien invasion of Earth? No, that's not right either.'</p>
<p>Dong Zhen, filled with confusion and curiosity, continued to advance the game's plot. Using the rabbit obtained from the lighthouse earlier, he performed a memory jump, pushing backward through Johnny's memories.</p>
<p>As time progressed, the memories in the game were of Johnny's elderly years.</p>
<p>The house was full of paper rabbits, and old Johnny simply sat at the piano, playing the song he wrote for his wife, Liva, over and over again.</p>
<p>Clearly, Liva had already passed away at this time.</p>
<p>'Paper rabbits, what deep meaning do these paper rabbits truly hold?'</p>
<p>Dong Zhen was certain at this moment that these paper rabbits must have some connection to Johnny's wish to go to the moon.</p>
<p>But what exactly was the connection?</p>
<p>This segment of the game was also very simple: find memory objects related to Johnny.</p>
<p>After finding them all, a not-so-difficult puzzle game would allow them to continue progressing through Johnny's memories.</p>
<p>Playing up to this point, one thing was clear: <em>To the Moon</em> was not a game rich in gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p>It was a story-driven game.</p>
