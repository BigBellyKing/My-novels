                <h2>Chapter 33: Full of Doubts</h2>
<p>Continuing the conversation with the two Boy Kids, Dr. Neil received another piece of information: when Johnny wasn't sick, he often visited a lighthouse by the cliff.</p>
<p>And Johnny built his house in such a secluded place just to guard that lighthouse? Clearly, there must be something going on!</p>
<p>So Dong Zhen followed the two Boy Kids towards the lighthouse.</p>
<p>On the way to the lighthouse, everyone discussed various random topics, which added some fun to the otherwise boring journey.</p>
<p>Boy Kid: ‘Do you play role-playing games too?’</p>
<p>Dr. Neil: ‘Uh… I don't…’</p>
<p>Girl Kid: ‘He's not that cool, he can't play them!’</p>
<p>Dr. Neil: ‘If I want to, there's nothing I can't do!’</p>
<p>As soon as he finished speaking, the two Boy Kids discovered a squirrel in deep slumber and let out cries of surprise.</p>
<p>‘Look, a squirrel!’</p>
<p>At this moment, Dr. Neil stood ready: “Oh no! A terrifying Squirrel Monster!”</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Dong Zhen, playing the game in front of his computer, looked utterly bewildered.</p>
<p>The next moment, an impassioned BGM started playing. The squirrel, Dr. Neil, and the two children faced off against each other. Simultaneously, a crude RPG turn-based UI interface appeared.</p>
<p>‘Don't be afraid, children, I will protect you!’</p>
<p>The two Boy Kids behind him exchanged glances, shrugged, and showed helpless expressions.</p>
<p>At the same time, “Attack” and “Defense” options appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>“What the heck, there's a system like this too? Why does it feel so weird?!”</p>
<p>“Oh my goodness!”</p>
<p>Dong Zhen was completely stunned, looking at the game whose art style had suddenly changed.</p>
<p>Clicking the “Attack” button revealed four skills.</p>
<p>“Volcanic Jump Kick, Whirlwind Palm, Fist of Decisive Battle, Shoes?”</p>
<p>Dong Zhen looked bewildered and randomly picked one.</p>
<p>Then a new option appeared: Scream Volume.</p>
<p>There were three options: Loud, Louder, Loudest.</p>
<p>Are you crazy?!</p>
<p>What are these?</p>
<p>Dong Zhen was completely dumbfounded.</p>
<p>He decisively chose “Loudest.”</p>
<p>‘Your turn is over, Squirrel Monster!’</p>
<p>Dr. Neil shouted at the top of his voice.</p>
<p>At this moment, the two Boy Kids behind him stepped forward.</p>
<p>‘Stop it—! Or I'll tell Mom you're abusing animals!’</p>
<p>‘Yes, she'll call the police to arrest you!’</p>
<p>The next moment, the previous RPG UI disappeared. The squirrel glanced at Dr. Neil as if he were an idiot, then turned and scurried away.</p>
<p>“What the heck kind of development is this? I just got into character! I got trolled!”</p>
<p>At this point, Dong Zhen understood. Clearly, this was a meme playing on the trope of an RPG turn-based game within the game.</p>
<p>Because most RPGs have a similar progression.</p>
<p>The bullet comments in the live stream room kept flashing across the screen.</p>
<p>‘Holy cow, I really thought it was a turn-based RPG game!’</p>
<p>‘Just got into character and now it's immersion-breaking!’</p>
<p>‘Haha, I knew it, why did the art style suddenly change?’</p>
<p>‘Damn it, I got trolled!’</p>
<p>‘Chen Xu, this guy is so evil!’</p>
<p>‘23333333, I actually find it quite interesting, isn't this probably a comedy game?’</p>
<p>‘Haha, very likely! From the beginning until now, it's been full of humor!’</p>
<p>In the game, Dong Zhen proceeded as planned and arrived at the lighthouse by the sea.</p>
<p>In front of the lighthouse was a tombstone.</p>
<p>The name of the tombstone's owner was: Liva.</p>
<p>“The old man's wife's tomb.”</p>
<p>Looking at the tomb, Dong Zhen remembered that the housekeeper had mentioned Johnny had a wife who had passed away long ago.</p>
<p>Clearly, this was the old man's wife's tomb, but why was she buried in front of the lighthouse?</p>
<p>Did this lighthouse have any special meaning for the old man and his wife?</p>
<p>With some doubts, Dong Zhen entered the lighthouse and climbed to the top.</p>
<p>Here, there were paper bunnies similar to those in the basement, but one paper bunny was different.</p>
<p>It was folded from two different colored papers mixed together, which would take a long time and was more difficult than making a regular paper bunny.</p>
<p>This, too, could be collected, and it seemed to be a key item.</p>
<p>But Dong Zhen's confusion only grew.</p>
<p>After going around in such a large circle, it seemed no questions were answered; instead, he accumulated a belly full of new questions.</p>
<p>The lighthouse and the paper bunny, what could they possibly mean?</p>
<p>With a head full of doubts, he returned to Johnny's room and, with Dr. Eva, started the machine.</p>
<p>Johnny, the old man lying in bed, his life was about to unfold before everyone's eyes.</p>
<p>But just like before, entering Johnny's memory required a medium.</p>
<p>The purpose was to enter the old man's childhood memories, so they could implant the dream of becoming an astronaut. Through the machine, this dream would become a persistent goal in the old man's virtual memory.</p>
<p>This way, in the end, the old man could fabricate a future for himself – a future where he became an astronaut and successfully landed on the moon, thus fulfilling his dying wish.</p>
<p>So, for this goal, they needed to gradually move backward from the old man's recent memories towards his childhood memories.</p>
<p>Before embarking on their journey, they found a musical score on the piano downstairs in the old man's house – “To Liva.”</p>
<p>The composer was Johnny; clearly, he wrote this for his wife.</p>
<p>Behind the house, the two doctors found Johnny, but through their conversation, they discovered something very strange.</p>
<p>Dr. Neil curiously asked Johnny why he wanted to go to the moon.</p>
<p>But even Johnny himself was very confused.</p>
<p>‘I'm sorry, but I really don't know.’</p>
<p>‘I just… want to go.’</p>
<p>Looking at the bewildered Johnny, Dong Zhen, like many viewers in the live stream room, was also a bit confused.</p>
<p>He didn't even know why he wanted to go to the moon?</p>
<p>Then why such a strong obsession?</p>
<p>“Could it be the origin of an alien invasion of Earth? No, that doesn't seem right.”</p>
<p>Dong Zhen looked utterly confused. With full curiosity, Dong Zhen continued to push the game's plot, using the rabbit obtained from the lighthouse to perform a memory leap, moving backward into Johnny's earlier memories.</p>
<p>As time progressed, the game's memory was Johnny's old age.</p>
<p>The room was filled with paper bunnies, and old Johnny just sat at the piano, playing the song he wrote for his wife, Liva, over and over again.</p>
<p>Clearly, Liva had already passed away by this time.</p>
<p>“Paper bunnies, what deep meaning do these paper bunnies actually hold?”</p>
<p>Dong Zhen could say with certainty at this moment that these paper bunnies must have some connection to Johnny's wish to go to the moon.</p>
<p>But what was the connection?</p>
<p>This segment of the game was also very simple: find memory objects related to Johnny.</p>
<p>After finding them all, a not-so-difficult jigsaw puzzle game would allow them to continue advancing through Johnny's memories.</p>
<p>Playing up to this point, one thing was clear: “To the Moon” was not a game rich in gameplay.</p>
<p>It was primarily a story-driven game.</p>
