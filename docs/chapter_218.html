                <h1>Chapter 318: Level-based Cinematic Game (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h1>
<p>During the New Year, players were still discussing how Nebula Games was losing money hand over fist.</p>
<p>Although various small green bars meant Chen Xu's hands were almost too busy. After all, players had too much money in their pockets.</p>
<p>But since players were verbally claiming Nebula Games was losing a ton of money, then it was only right for it to actually lose a little. After all, he was good at everything except that he was incredibly honest and never lied. So, Chen Xu held a daily lucky draw on the official Weibo account, offering <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code>, <code>Warcraft</code>, and cash red envelopes, interacting frequently with players. After all, these things were just small potatoes for Chen Xu now. Moreover, the wool always came from the sheep's back.</p>
<p>Opening the work group chat, Chen Xu also sent out a few red envelopes and chatted with Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue about some interesting things. Just then, his phone rang. Picking it up, Chen Xu was slightly taken aback. It was Yang Chen, the head of the Game Department, calling.</p>
<p>"Happy New Year, Minister Yang," Chen Xu said with a smile as he answered the call.</p>
<p>"Happy New Year, Mr. Chen," Yang Chen on the other end also cheerfully returned the greeting. After a few casual exchanges, Yang Chen paused, then began: "Mr. Chen, do you still remember participating in the VR testing the year before last?"</p>
<p>"Of course, is there a new policy from the Game Department?" Chen Xu nodded in response.</p>
<p>"Nothing new on that front, but the new version VR will be launching globally after the New Year. Not just the new version VR domestically, but also the latest generation VR developed overseas will be launching," Yang Chen paused before continuing.</p>
<p>"So, Mr. Chen, if your development plans for after the New Year haven't been finalized, you might consider the VR aspect. <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code> had excellent results, and as one of the first games to support the new version VR, the relevant departments will also open up resources for your use," Yang Chen from the Game Department told Chen Xu. "I've already sent the specific details to your game editor backend; you can review them in detail yourself."</p>
<p>Chen Xu replied: "Alright, Minister Yang, I understand. I'll look into it."</p>
<p>Afterward, Chen Xu chatted with him for a bit more before opening his computer to look into the situation. Regarding the new generation VR technology, Chen Xu had already learned about it when developing <code>Silent Hill PT</code>. The related experience, including the level of game support, was much stronger than the current stage. Especially with the resources opened up by the Game Department, it could completely deliver a more immersive experience.</p>
<p>Similarly, the launch of the new version VR also brought with it a scramble for market share. Overseas, the latest VR was also being launched, and with the domestic VR launch, both sides were essentially vying for market standard discourse power. And what determined this was, naturally, games.</p>
<p>As for whether the new version VR would fail to sell due to its relatively small market share for devices, there was no need to worry too much about that aspect. After all, game compatibility in the Parallel World was much more convenient than in his previous life. All were built on a unified architecture, so while developing games for the new version VR, the old version VR could also be supported, though the sense of immersion might not be as strong.</p>
<p>At the same time, most players who purchased the new version VR would invariably buy games released on the new version VR. After all, there was no other choice. If you weren't going to buy games for the new version VR, why would you buy the new version VR in the first place? Was it just to experience old games?</p>
<p>This time, it seemed like a safeguard for the new version VR, but in reality, it was also an opportunity. Because eventually, the new version VR would gradually phase out the old version VR. Similarly, in terms of the game editor engine, supporting the new version VR's development technology could give Nebula Games a lead over some other game developers. This was clearly one of the benefits brought about by participating in the new version VR testing and matters related to <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code>.</p>
<p>The day after the Game Department communicated with Chen Xu, Meng Zuo also called to discuss this matter with Chen Xu. Of course, the other party represented NetDragon. According to NetDragon's intentions, they were not planning to develop new games but instead focused their efforts on the <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code> project. Although the 'child' wasn't biologically theirs and had no blood relation, NetDragon had half the custody, and if treated well, it could 'honor' NetDragon in the future. So, NetDragon and Chen Xu reached an agreement on this matter.</p>
<p>NetDragon would be responsible for the development of the PC version and the new version VR for <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code>, while Nebula Games would just bear the porting costs based on development expenses. As for the new version VR itself, NetDragon would not be involved in the first quarter. Of course, Chen Xu hadn't intended to bring NetDragon along on this part anyway.</p>
<hr />
<p>Days passed, and the seventh day of the Lunar New Year marked the first day back to official work. Most employees from various departments at Nebula Games had returned to their posts. During this period, news about the new version VR also began to surface online. However, it first spread from overseas, announcing that a new version VR named Zeus was about to launch. Domestically, preparations were clearly in full swing, and less than a day later, they announced their own latest version VR, named Huanyu.</p>
<p>In the initial phase, both sides primarily focused on promoting the new version VR's performance parameters and various features. Essentially, they were making grand promises. Then, the overseas side made the first move: the renowned game developer Atari announced that its new work would be available on Zeus. Atari also stated that the new work would be a film-adapted IP game, based on the highly popular movie <code>Storm Action</code> which launched a few years prior. At the time, <code>Storm Action</code> was a smash hit globally, with box office earnings reaching 800 million USD.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the domestic Channel Alliance also announced that they had reached a strategic cooperation agreement with Atari and would act as the publishing agent for the game. This was clearly aimed directly at <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code>, developed by Nebula Games and NetDragon before the New Year.</p>
<p>As for TengHua Games, they didn't get involved this time. After all, in the new era VR competition between Zeus and Huanyu, unless TengHua's head was squeezed by a door, they would definitely stand with the Game Department. But for the Channel Alliance, it didn't matter; aside from channel providers like Hero Entertainment that had R&amp;D departments, the rest simply followed the publishing agent route. What Huanyu and Zeus were had nothing to do with them.</p>
<p>Ordinary players, on the other hand, were the simplest group. Whichever platform had good games to play, they would support that platform. For a time, players both abroad and domestically were discussing <code>Storm Action</code> and topics related to Atari.</p>
<p>Within Nebula Games, everyone was also talking.</p>
<p>"Atari is truly wealthy and powerful! They directly bought such a huge IP!" Ruan Ningxue exclaimed, looking at the news.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I rewatched that movie a while ago. While it lacked depth, it was super enjoyable to watch!" Yang Xin agreed.</p>
<p>"Adapted into a VR game, it's definitely going to be explosive!" Qin Yi also expressed his sentiment.</p>
<p>Walking over to them, Chen Xu, who had overheard the entire conversation, smiled: "That's not necessarily true. Whether it's a manga-adapted game or a film-adapted game, sometimes they can fall into an awkward situation."</p>
<p>"Changing an IP is simply for the sake of the original work's fan base, but film and games are fundamentally two different mediums," Chen Xu said with a smile. Film-adapted games, or game-adapted films, sound promising. But in his previous life, there were many brutal examples. The only one that could truly be considered a great success was the Resident Evil series, but even that was changed so much its own mother wouldn't recognize it. Following the film's plot, how do you expand a two-hour movie into a main storyline of a dozen or even twenty-plus hours? Endless cannon fodder, convoluted mazes, or quests like an old lady needing help crossing the road? If you really did that, players would mercilessly give it bad reviews. The same goes for game-adapted films; how do you compress a dozen or twenty-plus hours of gameplay into a one or two-hour movie? Compared to film adaptations, themes like novels, which lack visual comparison, are clearly more suitable. Or simply manga and anime-themed games that are purely fan-oriented and remain unchanged.</p>
<p>"What's more, how can adapting an IP be as exciting as creating your own?" Chen Xu said with a smile. "Notify all departments; we're having a meeting this afternoon to prepare for a new project."</p>
<p>"A new project?!" Hearing this, Qin Yi and the others immediately became excited.</p>
<p>"What is it, Mr. Chen?!" Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin looked at Chen Xu expectantly.</p>
<p>"Atari adapted a movie into a game, and it's a special forces theme, right? We'll do one too. A level-based cinematic game, and modern warfare and special forces themes would be perfect for it," Chen Xu said, stretching. (End of Chapter)</p>
