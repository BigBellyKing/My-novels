                <p>Chapter 210: How About Changing It to a Pyramid? (Please Subscribe for Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>The various controversies in the gaming industry regarding sandbox games did not affect Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Minecraft's promotional model and timeline had basically been fully confirmed. After New Year's Day, on January 3rd, which was also the first day of the twelfth lunar month, the single-player test for Minecraft would commence. Multiplayer mode would not be activated for now; only regular friend co-op and single-player functions would be available for five days. By February 1st, also the first day of the first lunar month, it would officially launch online across all platforms.</p>
<p>Including the promotional model, Chen Xu had also finalized this with Zhang Yida. In addition to advertising promotions, this time a special approach was required, which focused on showcasing some jaw-dropping architectural creations and simple Redstone applications within Minecraft. To put it plainly, it was about showing off technical prowess, to let players know what kind of game Minecraft truly was, and what content they could experience within it.</p>
<p>This kind of operation wasn't a new trick. After all, game promotion, despite its variations, always stuck to the same core principles. Just like some games that, right from the start, give players a 'Memory Capsule' experience. In these Memory Capsule moments, players would be max level, with all skills, and clad in divine gear. Why? It was simply to give players a sense of anticipation, allowing them to look forward to subsequent content in the game, to make them understand that the game could be played this way, and that as long as they continued playing, they could experience that exhilarating feeling. Similarly, game trailers and movie promotional clips generally followed this path, building player anticipation for future content. However, limited by Minecraft's relatively unique gameplay, all the in-game content had to be created by Chen Xu and his team themselves.</p>
<p>The only good news, however, was that Zhong Yue and his team at Galaxy Smart Tech had made significant breakthroughs in AI intelligence. Chen Xu guessed this was also due to the impending end of the countdown progress bar; with various patent applications, it seemed Galaxy Smart Tech was going crazy with development. Compared to the industry's top Artificial Intelligence, Galaxy Smart Tech couldn't compete at all, as they weren't in the same conceptual direction. According to Chen Xu's requirements, their primary research focused on in-game performance. Compared to the relatively stiff performance when previously applied in Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame, there had been considerable progress. Leveraging Zhong Yue's technology, Chen Xu had also specifically developed a tool for rapid construction. In his previous life, there were similar tools that could save a lot of time. As for Chen Xu's side, it could be even simpler because, using Galaxy Smart Tech's AI technology, they could first build in the software, and then generate it further through AI recognition in the editor's backend. Of course, some overly complex elements still required Chen Xu and his team to do manually. But it greatly facilitated things, which also gave Chen Xu the confidence to promote the game in this manner.</p>
<p>In the future, they could also use this to periodically release some commemorative official architectural complexes. As for this tool, Chen Xu didn't plan to release it, because even if it were released, players wouldn't be able to use it, as it involved AI computing resources, unless players spent money on it. But aside from the wealthy, Chen Xu estimated that most players wouldn't be able to afford it based on the pricing standards. So, in the future, Chen Xu would still release some simpler 'brush tools' like 'Creator God'.</p>
<p>After completing a part of the architectural complex, Chen Xu stretched, preparing to go check on Qin Yi and his team's progress. After all, Minecraft's content was currently fully developed. Although Dark Souls still had The Ringed City and the Painted World DLCs, that wasn't urgent. They were already being made anyway, and it would be fine even if they were released during the third-anniversary celebration. Therefore, all employees across the company were currently involved in the house-building process, and today was the first day.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu didn't hold much expectation for what they could build. Instead, he planned to use his tools to create the main molds himself, then hand over the finished products to them for minor adjustments and filling in details according to the templates. Upon entering the project room, Chen Xu saw a group of people sitting in rows, all with Minecraft screens on their computers. Everyone seemed to be working in great synergy, exchanging various ideas.</p>
<p>“I'm done here, Qin Yi, you take care of the interior construction.”</p>
<p>“No problem!”</p>
<p>“Sister Xin, is the foundation ready?”</p>
<p>“You can trust me to get things done!”</p>
<p>Hearing their exchanges, which sounded quite professional, surprised Chen Xu. Had he guessed wrong? But a closer look plunged Chen Xu into silence. “Are you building an Egyptian ancient civilization's Pharaoh's pyramid?” Chen Xu finally couldn't help but ask, looking at the screen.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, everyone was stunned for a moment. Pharaoh's pyramid? No, that wasn't right. Although they had considered it before, they ultimately rejected that plan. But soon, everyone realized: what was a Pharaoh's pyramid? Wasn't it just an ancient Egyptian pharaoh's tomb? This meant he was calling their houses ugly!</p>
<p>Immediately, everyone became displeased: “Mr. Chen, this is an architectural masterpiece we all crafted with our wisdom and talent, definitely not some ancient tomb.”</p>
<p>Yang Xin also interjected: “Exactly, exactly! Mr. Chen, you're looking down on us! When it comes to architecture, we know a lot more than you. It might look ugly now, but we actually based it on the Musée d'Orsay in France. Originally, we thought about building the Forbidden City, or perhaps the Mogao Grottoes, but then we reconsidered, thinking the difficulty would be a bit too high. So, we finally decided to build something simpler first.”</p>
<p>Based on the Musée d'Orsay? Chen Xu silently opened a search engine, looked at photos of the Musée d'Orsay, and then looked at the 'lump' in front of Yang Xin and the others. He, for one, couldn't find any way to connect the two. Musée d'Orsay... who gave you the courage to utter such words? “Forget it, I'll fix it for you.” Looking at everyone, Chen Xu sighed and took Yang Xin's seat. First, he increased the in-game movement speed, then Chen Xu skillfully began to build using the tools.</p>
<p>Everyone gathered around Chen Xu, watching him build. His speed was much faster than theirs. They just didn't know what it was going to be. It didn't look like a house either.</p>
<p>“What is Mr. Chen building?”</p>
<p>“Seems like a statue?”</p>
<p>“I get it!”</p>
<p>“Sister Xin, what do you get?”</p>
<p>“A statue! Remember, aren't there various sculptures next to the Musée d'Orsay?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen has been there? He doesn't even need to compare with photos?”</p>
<p>Everyone discussed with curiosity.</p>
<p>It took about twenty minutes for Chen Xu to place the last block. He then let go of the mouse and clapped his hands: “Done!” Looking at the structure before them, everyone fell silent.</p>
<p>“Well, Mr. Chen did build a sculpture, just as Sister Xin said.”</p>
<p>“Yes, and not just any sculpture, but a greatly famous cultural heritage of ancient Egyptian civilization.”</p>
<p>“The famous Sphinx!”</p>
<p>“So, Mr. Chen, what are you implying again?”</p>
<p>Looking at the lifelike Sphinx Chen Xu had just built, everyone exchanged glances.</p>
<p>This damn well implied that the houses they built looked like small burial mounds! “Ahem, ahem, I didn't say that; those are all your own words!” Chen Xu lightly coughed twice. Hearing Chen Xu's words, everyone was speechless. Did they even need to say it themselves? It wasn't an implication anymore, but an explicit statement! But then again, looking closely now, it really did seem quite similar! Square and blocky, made of mud mixed with stone, and currently completely enclosed because windows were planned for later. It looked airtight, needing only torches for illumination. Wasn't it exactly like the ancient tombs seen in archaeological documentaries? Staring intently for a few seconds, especially with the Sphinx before her, Yang Xin hesitated. Because she realized that looking at the Sphinx before her, slowly, the Musée d'Orsay prototype in her mind gradually transformed.</p>
<p>After a moment of thought, Yang Xin looked at her colleague next to her and said: “How about... we make some changes?”</p>
<p>“Make changes?”</p>
<p>“How about we change it to a pyramid? And it seems relatively easier to build!” Yang Xin suggested. “Moreover, you must understand that changing architectural plans is quite normal. It's like painting; perhaps originally Qi Baishi didn't paint shrimp, and Xu Beihong didn't paint horses, but later they discovered their talent for painting shrimp and horses, so they leaned into that direction,” Yang Xin explained.</p>
<p>“Sister Xin, come on now!” Ruan Ningxue, beside her, couldn't help but say. Qin Yi and the others also expressed their feelings. During the development of Minecraft, everyone truly experienced the joy of the game. But when it came to building houses, what they built always turned out different from what they imagined!</p>
