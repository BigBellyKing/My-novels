                <p>Chapter 270: Game Crossover Warm-up (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>The days passed one by one, and Chen Xu's WarCraft development was continuously progressing.</p>
<p>Art assets were constantly being produced. Similarly, related data and the overall game architecture were also being perfected little by little.</p>
<p>For players of Monster Hunter: World, the New World was no longer unfamiliar.</p>
<p>Of course, the Palico's stretcher had also become very familiar.</p>
<p>Before this, Chen Xu had showcased the Light Bowgun's Pierce build and the Gunlance's Guard build through live streaming.</p>
<p>One shield, one cannon, made solo hunting no longer difficult.</p>
<p>Facing Rathian, two words: easy.</p>
<p>Facing Radobaan, two words: relaxed.</p>
<p>Even when facing Nergigante, there were only two words: acceptable.</p>
<p>Passing through felt completely stress-free!</p>
<p>After all, weren't these easy-mode builds prepared for casual players?</p>
<p>But when these players faced Tempered monsters, the feeling was completely different.</p>
<p>Guard and fire?</p>
<p>Who are you kidding?</p>
<p>Still think it's turn-based combat like before?</p>
<p>Against highly efficient AI performance, these players were instantly taught a lesson.</p>
<p>The forum was once again filled with wailing.</p>
<p>"This 'hunting' in Monster Hunter: World has become a verb again!"</p>
<p>"Damn it, the damage from Tempered monsters is so high, and the AI is so strong, how are we supposed to fight!?"</p>
<p>Of course, players who said this were mostly those who had relied heavily on easy-mode builds before.</p>
<p>They were completely unfamiliar with the monsters' moves.</p>
<p>For casual players, with Rocksteady Mantle and Flinch Free decorations, the efficiency of team hunting had increased by more than just a little.</p>
<p>Especially some highly skilled veterans even turned monsters like Nergigante into a combat power measuring unit.</p>
<p>The competition wasn't about who could complete it, but who could defeat Nergigante the fastest.</p>
<p>The originally majestic Nergigante became like "Mei Mei-chan" (Nergigante's affectionate nickname).</p>
<p>Feeling sorry for Nergigante, many players even created fan art of a feminized, pitiful Nergigante online.</p>
<p>This instantly made the monster leap to become the most popular monster in Monster Hunter: World.</p>
<p>Of course, for casual players, it was still quite difficult.</p>
<p>"Old Song! You're flip-flopping again! You went from Gunlance back to Long Sword? What happened to saying you didn't know what a Long Sword was?"</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, who had failed the quest after carting three times, said to Song Ren in the party.</p>
<p>"Ahem, Long Sword is a lifelong faith. I merely temporarily abandoned it before, and now I have rediscovered my faith, just like a protagonist in an anime. There was a moment of confusion, but in the end, I found my belief." Song Ren began to boast.</p>
<p>"Eh, why is the game updating?" Song Ren, in the middle of his boasting, suddenly noticed something: the game prompted that the version was too old, clearly indicating a new update.</p>
<p>"Me too, hey... Old Song, look! There's a new event! New layered weapons added: Frostmourne (Great Sword), Warglaives of Azzinoth (Dual Blades), Flametongue Blade Sulfuras (Long Sword), Hammer of the Lightbringer (Hammer), Elune's Longbow (Bow)..." Zhang Yi, who had just exited the game, also saw the updated content on the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>"Holy crap, that's pretty cool! And there are two brand new hunting quests: 'The Power of Evil: Frost Dragon' and 'Chimera from Ashenvale.' But these two don't really look like Monster Hunter: World monsters, do they!? And what the heck is 'Azeroth' mentioned in the description?" Song Ren was also a bit confused looking at the descriptions.</p>
<p>"Who cares about all that! Let's get into the game and check it out first!" Zhang Yi was also filled with doubts. He had a premonition that this Monster Hunter: World update was a bit unusual, but no matter what, he wanted to get into the game and see.</p>
<p>While chatting with Song Ren in the voice channel, Zhang Yi had already entered the game.</p>
<p>He quickly noticed a large exclamation mark above the Commander-in-Chief's head.</p>
<p>"You've arrived. Something's been amiss lately. A mysterious power, like dead silence and frost, has appeared in the Coral Highlands..."</p>
<p>"At the same time, countless corpse-like monsters have appeared nearby..."</p>
<p>"Investigate alone? Well, if you insist..."</p>
<p>Looking at the Commander-in-Chief's dialogue, Zhang Yi sighed with emotion.</p>
<p>Investigate alone?</p>
<p>I am not, I didn't, you're talking to yourself, aren't you?</p>
<p>But he was used to it.</p>
<p>When he first arrived in the New World, he thought the hunters at the Astera Settlement were his good teammates.</p>
<p>But reality was cruel. He suspected the receptionist was a Deviljho cub; otherwise, how could she cling to a Deviljho's back for so long? And all she did was eat.</p>
<p>The Big Bro of the First Fleet was very enthusiastic, he just never left the dining area on the third floor.</p>
<p>The Guild Master looked fierce, like the Golden-haired Lion King, but he was nowhere to be seen when fighting Nergigante and the final Xeno'jiiva.</p>
<p>The Swordmaster was indeed cool, but only helped once in the Zorah Magdaros capture mission.</p>
<p>As for the rest?</p>
<p>They were all just good-for-nothings.</p>
<p>They called him the White Wind of the New World and the Azure Star who guided the way, but in reality, they just took advantage of the fact that he was mute and couldn't speak, dumping all the dirty and tiring work on him.</p>
<p>Sighing, he took on the mission from the Commander-in-Chief to investigate the anomaly in the Coral Highlands, and under the "companionship" of the Deviljho cub, he set off again with his ever-present Palico.</p>
<p>"These are brand new monsters! A bit ugly!" Entering the Coral Highlands, Zhang Yi quickly noticed some unusual things.</p>
<p>The ground was covered in frost, and approaching it caused a DEBUFF that slowly drained health. Along the paths of the Coral Highlands, some of the usual Wingdrake small monsters had been replaced by a group of rotten corpse-dog-like monsters.</p>
<p>Ghoul was the name Zhang Yi got after killing these monsters.</p>
<p>Venturing deeper, he finally reached the highest point of the Coral Highlands, where Zhang Yi finally saw his objective.</p>
<p>A colossal Bone Dragon, covered in blue light: Frost Dragon.</p>
<p>"Holy crap, it looks pretty cool!"</p>
<p>Amidst Zhang Yi's exclamation, the Frost Dragon apparently noticed this uninvited guest, flapping its skeletal wings and actually taking flight, then spewing a breath of frost from its mouth.</p>
<hr />
<p>Zhang Yi and other Monster Hunter players were surprised by the Chimera, Frost Dragon, and layered weapon customizations introduced by the new game event.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, players of Minecraft were equally surprised.</p>
<p>Because in the official display server, many players discovered a new structure had appeared.</p>
<p>Since Minecraft's launch, more and more spectacular structures had been replicated by players.</p>
<p>Magnificent buildings like Irithyll of the Boreal Valley and Lothric Castle had not yet been added by Nebula Games to the official Minecraft display server, but players had already created them, which was quite astonishing.</p>
<p>The display server primarily showcased Nebula Games' official creations.</p>
<p>However, its purpose was mainly to guide players in the early stages, so only a dedicated operations team managed it later on.</p>
<p>Naturally, their efficiency couldn't compare to players. So far, only two new building complexes had been added to Minecraft's official server.</p>
<p>One was the Astera Settlement from Monster Hunter: World, and the other was the toy castle from It Takes Two.</p>
<p>But now, many players suddenly discovered that a new building complex had appeared in Minecraft's official display server.</p>
<p>A magnificent human city-state.</p>
<p>Named: Lordaeron.</p>
<p>Symmetrically arranged building complexes, dense yet distinctly layered.</p>
<p>The central area was a massive arched castle, with a long canal behind the city gate, accessible only by drawbridge to the central castle hall.</p>
<p>At the front of the castle, there was also a gigantic clock tower, displaying Lordaeron's flag with its iconic symbols: a Twin Single-Headed Eagle Crest and a lion.</p>
<p>At a glance, it was simply incredibly magnificent.</p>
