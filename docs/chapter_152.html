                <p>Chapter 251: This is it?! (Fifth Update)</p>
<p>Looking at the Great Jagras in front of him, Zhang Yi was a little impatient.</p>
<p>Because this BOSS, just like the BOSSes in the punishing difficulty mode of <code>Dark Souls</code> before, fully demonstrated what it means to ‘If the enemy doesn't move, I don't move’.</p>
<p>Pulling out a Whetstone from his item pouch, Zhang Yi sharpened his Great Sword. After all, he had been harassed by several Crested Raptors on the way there, and his Great Sword's sharpness had decreased.</p>
<p>Looking at the Great Jagras in front of him, Zhang Yi shouldered his Great Sword and ran towards it.</p>
<p>However, before Zhang Yi could even attack, the Great Jagras saw him charging and initiated its own attack.</p>
<p>Facing the Great Jagras's attack, which was like that of a large lizard, Zhang Yi did not choose to dodge by rolling. Instead, he opted to directly absorb some of the Great Jagras's damage.</p>
<p>His main intention was to observe the opponent's attack patterns to make a judgment.</p>
<p>"This damage is indeed much higher than that of the previous Crested Raptors!"</p>
<p>Looking at the dropping health bar, Zhang Yi was a bit surprised.</p>
<p>Because of that single charge from the Great Jagras, his health bar dropped by about a tenth.</p>
<p>Clearly, this BOSS still posed some threat.</p>
<p>However, despite this, Zhang Yi felt no concern.</p>
<p>After all, the margin for error was still very large.</p>
<p>Unlike <code>Dark Souls</code>, where two hits would leave him critically wounded and three hits would kill him.</p>
<p>Taking seven or eight of these attacks was no big deal!</p>
<p>And the most crucial point was that, unlike <code>Dark Souls</code> which confined battles to a single area.</p>
<p>In <code>Monster Hunter: World</code>, he found that there was no area restriction during combat.</p>
<p>"Perfect, I'll use this guy to test out my Great Sword!"</p>
<p>Zhang Yi became excited.</p>
<p>The previous Crested Raptors and Great Jagras didn't have enough health for him to fully unleash his Charged Slashes, let alone True Charged Slashes.</p>
<p>A single Strong Charged Slash would instantly down them.</p>
<p>Now was the perfect chance to enjoy himself with this Great Jagras!</p>
<p>"One slash! Two slashes!"</p>
<p>Together with his Palico companion, Zhang Yi furiously attacked the Great Jagras.</p>
<p>The strategy was very simple: slash once, then immediately charge up in place.</p>
<p>When facing the Great Jagras's attacks, during the charging animation, his character was in a hyper armor state, directly tanking damage to trade blows.</p>
<p>"True! Charged Slash!" Looking at the Great Jagras, Zhang Yi had already assumed his stance.</p>
<p>The in-game character held the Great Sword with both hands, exerting force.</p>
<p>'Clang!' The Great Sword's three-charge in the game emitted a prompt.</p>
<p>The Great Sword's highest damage True Charged Slash was unleashed in an instant!</p>
<p>Looking at the Great Jagras in front of him, Zhang Yi's mind already envisioned the scene of the Great Jagras being instantly defeated by his True Charged Slash, utterly exhausted.</p>
<p>But in the next moment, the Great Jagras suddenly shifted its aggro, twisting its rear and pouncing towards the nearby Palico.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Hunter in the game, wielding a Great Sword larger than himself, performed a spinning slash.</p>
<p>Boom! Rumble!</p>
<p>Two consecutive True Charged Slashes struck the ground directly.</p>
<p>Stirring up a cloud of dust.</p>
<p>And after "hitting the ground" with his Great Sword, the Great Jagras over there had just redirected its aggro, turned around, and charged, sending him flying far away.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was utterly bewildered: "????? What's going on? That works too?"</p>
<p>Looking at his character getting up from the ground in the game, Zhang Yi in front of the computer was completely stumped.</p>
<p>Did that mean his skill missed!?</p>
<p>However, this bewilderment was only brief, because fighting the Great Jagras was still relatively smooth.</p>
<p>What Zhang Yi wanted to complain about was that the Palico kept drawing the Great Jagras's aggro, and his charged attacks kept hitting the floor.</p>
<p>Despite this, Zhang Yi couldn't really scold the Palico.</p>
<p>Because he hadn't turned off damage indicators, he found that the Palico's attacks were actually quite considerable.</p>
<p>And even though it made his Great Sword into a "hoe for hitting the ground," pioneering the "true ground-chopping sword style."</p>
<p>It did make his battle much easier; when the Great Jagras was distracted, he could output damage freely, even if he often missed.</p>
<p>Moreover, when his health was low, the Palico would even bring Vigorwasps, and breaking the Vigorwasp's nectar sac could instantly restore a lot of health.</p>
<p>The fight with the Great Jagras went quite smoothly. Initially, because he didn't understand its attack methods, he was knocked down many times, but after fighting for a bit, Zhang Yi realized that the Great Jagras, despite looking intimidating.</p>
<p>Was actually quite weak. Not only were its movements slow, but its damage wasn't as high as he thought.</p>
<p>The only noteworthy thing was that it was much tankier than the previous Crested Raptors and Aptonoths.</p>
<p>However, this actually made Zhang Yi feel quite satisfied, as he could slash freely.</p>
<p>Under the combined assault of Zhang Yi and his Palico, the Great Jagras quickly became covered in wounds.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Great Jagras also realized that it was no match.</p>
<p>After one furious charge, this time the Great Jagras did not continue its active assault, but instead fled directly into the depths of the forest.</p>
<p>"This monster can escape too!"</p>
<p>Seeing the Great Jagras flee, Zhang Yi in front of the computer was surprised, clearly not having anticipated such a situation. However, he followed the green Scoutflies in pursuit.</p>
<p>And because it had just eaten a Crested Raptor and hadn't fully digested it, its movement was very sluggish with a big belly. Soon, Zhang Yi caught up.</p>
<p>At this moment, the Great Jagras was clearly at its last gasp, even limping as it walked, evidently in a severely injured state.</p>
<p>Just like before, Zhang Yi charged forward with his Great Sword and Palico.</p>
<p>After just a few slashes, the roaring Great Jagras was quickly brought down.</p>
<p>At the same time, a line of text popped up on the screen: [Main Objective Achieved].</p>
<p>"I still feel like I haven't had enough fun!" Walking up and carving materials from the fallen Great Jagras, Zhang Yi felt a lingering sense of unfulfillment.</p>
<p>Although the Great Jagras wasn't difficult, the main issue was that with his Great Sword, despite its high damage, its attack speed was a bit slow.</p>
<p>So, out of ten slashes, about half missed.</p>
<p>Especially that True Charged Slash, he only landed it once throughout, but it had to be said the damage was indeed high.</p>
<p>He also discovered that the Great Sword's hyper armor wasn't truly invincible.</p>
<p>While it could withstand normal attacks, attacks that could knock him airborne could still break his hyper armor state.</p>
<p>"I wonder what new monsters there will be later!"</p>
<p>Looking at the countdown timer, Zhang Yi sighed inwardly.</p>
<p>Based on his experience so far, Zhang Yi felt he could give <code>Monster Hunter: World</code> a nine out of ten. As for the remaining point, he'd save it for later.</p>
<p>Mainly because he found the new player tutorial a bit illogical.</p>
<p>When fighting the Great Jagras, the Investigation Team Leader kept telling him various operations, clearly acting as the tutorial NPC.</p>
<p>But this guy just stood there watching. We're all Hunters, why don't you come help me fight!</p>
<p>What's the point of just watching from the side!</p>
<p>Is being the Commander-in-Chief's grandson so impressive?</p>
<p>The Hunter's Guild doesn't need nepotism!</p>
<p>I despise princelings like you the most!</p>
<p>While inwardly complaining and humming a tune, Zhang Yi returned to Astera Base to turn in the quest, preparing to receive new quests for a fresh round of hunting.</p>
<p>However, just then, a prompt box popped up.</p>
<p>[Demo content ends here. The game officially launches on August 7th. Please look forward to it.]</p>
<p>It's... over?!</p>
<p>Zhang Yi looked at the prompt in front of him, utterly bewildered.</p>
<p>(End of Chapter)</p>
