Chapter 3: Dinner is Served, Bros (Please Vote for Recommendations!)

As soon as Teacher Lu's livestream started, the bullet comments began to flood the screen.

“Dinner is served, bros!”

“Yo? Why isn't the streamer turning on his camera?”

“Came from Bilibili video, Substitute-Protect-Toxic is really dirty!”

Teacher Lu opened *Pokémon: Battle* while reading the bullet comments.

“Why isn't the streamer turning on his camera—I need over 100,000 subscribers before I'll show my face.”

In a flash, a string of question marks scrolled past.

“???”

Is this streamer really that unique?

Though his voice is kinda nice, you're probably just some Beta driving a tank, right?

“Ten-year veteran fan here, Teacher Lu is definitely a looks streamer!”

“No one really follows Teacher Lu just to see his face, right? No way, no way!”

“There are recorded clips of Teacher Lu on Tieba, he's only on screen for less than five seconds, but he's definitely a male god!”

“Male god is too much praise, I'm just ordinary, at best an actor-level handsome.”

Teacher Lu said it without batting an eyelid.

“Thanks to 'When will Teacher Lu's new movie be released' for the airplane… Soon, I'll discuss the script with Carnie first.”

“Thanks to 'Teacher Lu and Female Machamp Stick Together' for the ten membership cards… We won't talk about Female Machamp today.”

“Today, I'll continue to bring you Pokémon battle tutorials.”

The bullet comments were surprisingly consistent.

“Streamer, please do a Substitute-Protect-Toxic tutorial!”

“My starter Pokémon is Bulbasaur, please give me a detailed guide!”

Teacher Lu glanced at the bullet comments.

“Thanks to 'How to Substitute-Protect-Toxic with Bulbasaur' for the airplane.”

“People who can afford a starter should have no problem evolving it into Venusaur… So let's talk about Venusaur's tactical positioning.”

Teacher Lu opened the team editor and dragged Venusaur into the team.

“Venusaur has many playstyles, for example, a Sunny Day team, using Chlorophyll to boost speed and output damage.”

“Or, building upon Substitute-Protect-Toxic, learning Synthesis and Leech Seed, acting as a field stayer.”

“Talk is cheap, I'll demonstrate one for you to see.”

Cutting to the game screen, Teacher Lu matched with an international friend from the Johto League, ID: “Billiard Boy Like the Wind.”

“Konnichiwa.”

Teacher Lu greeted him politely in Japanese, while locking in Venusaur.

His opponent's first Pokémon to enter the battle was a Typhlosion named “Explosion Taro.”

---—

Kanto, Pallet Town.

The girl with orange pigtails gently patted her reddened cheeks, taking a deep breath.

“It's fine, it's just watching a movie together, he probably won't overthink it…”

Gathering her courage, Tokiwa Lilac nervously pressed the doorbell. Moments later, a male voice came through the intercom.

“It's you.” Red chuckled, “The door's open, just come up to the second floor.”

Enter, enter Red's house?

Tokiwa Lilac felt her cheeks burning red, but a hint of curiosity stirred in her heart.

At this time, he should be training, right?

Pushing the door open somewhat cautiously, a figure leaped down from the second floor, quickly pouncing into Tokiwa Lilac's arms.

“Pika-chu~~!”

“Long time no see, Pikachu.”

Tokiwa Lilac smiled, gently stroking Pikachu.

“Pika!”

Pikachu happily leaped down, then swiftly climbed the stairs along the wall.

Looking up, Tokiwa Lilac's face instantly flushed.

At the top of the stairs, a young man with short black hair and determined eyes caught Pikachu, resting it on his shoulder. He smiled:

“Yellow, I found a very interesting Trainer today!”

Inside Red's room.

The room was clean and tidy, cabinets filled with trophies, yet the furnishings were simple: just a bed and a computer.

“Make yourself at home!”

As soon as he spoke, Red awkwardly realized that he was occupying the only chair.

“I, I'll just sit on the bed…”

Tokiwa Lilac said in a voice as soft as a mosquito's buzz, her face red.

“That works too.”

Red scratched his head, then his eyes suddenly lit up.

“Oh, by the way, Yellow, come look at this!”

Tokiwa Lilac leaned closer, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear, and asked curiously, “Isn't this the game you often play?”

“*Pokémon: Battle*.”

Red smiled, “It's very similar to real battles, requiring real-time commands via microphone. I use it to relax when I'm tired from training.”

“You… even when you're resting, your mind is full of battles, battles.”

Tokiwa Lilac's cheeks flushed slightly.

But Red didn't notice, excitedly saying, “Come watch this person's livestream!”

“This person's tactical understanding of Venusaur is absolutely spot-on!”

“Unless he's also a powerful Trainer in real life, he couldn't possibly have such awareness.”

“Ahhh, I really want to battle him and exchange tips on raising Venusaur!”

“Pika-chu~!”

“Haha, Pikachu, you want to battle him too, right?”

Tokiwa Lilac looked curiously at the livestream screen.

A classic 6v6 battle, a Master Ball tier showdown, ID “Has Teacher Lu Underperformed Today” versus “Billiard Boy Like the Wind.”

As it was an international livestream, the platform provided real-time subtitle translation, allowing both of them to understand Teacher Lu's commentary.

“How dare this guy send out Typhlosion! And 'Explosion Taro' no less, just watch me use Toxic or not, that's all there is to it!”

Despite being a type-disadvantage battle, Venusaur used “Toxic + Protect” to slowly wear down and defeat Typhlosion. 

Subsequently, Venusaur consecutively defeated Aipom and Sunflora.

From start to finish, the red team's “Teacher Lu” only sent out Venusaur, yet completed the feat of a one-Pokémon sweep of three opponents.

A string of question marks filled the screen.

“I'm speechless, beat Typhlosion with a type disadvantage, and still at full health!?”

“Teacher Lu isn't underperforming anymore, my youth is over!”

“Stop it, this isn't Pokémon battling at all!”

Tokiwa Lilac murmured, “Red, this ID, could it be… ”

“Ah, it must be Gold.” Red coughed, “I remember he likes playing this game too.”

In the virtual image, Venusaur's Leech Seed formed vines, burrowing into Togekiss's body, continuously draining energy.

Togekiss cried out, flapping its wings, but the Air Slash it unleashed was blocked by a glistening barrier.

In the livestream, Teacher Lu's commentary came through: “Protect, not Protect, Protect, and the opponent just explodes!”

“Toxic can be replaced by Leech Seed, using them together is even better!”

Togekiss's body glowed purple, a sign of poisoning, yet it was still being tormented by the vines formed by Leech Seed.

Even if an attack luckily landed once, the wound on Venusaur's body wasn't even as big as a pinky finger before Teacher Lu had Venusaur use Synthesis…

Overwhelming bullet comments floated across the screen.

“Please, just be human!”

“Is this Substitute-Protect-Toxic? I love it, I love it!”

“A sweep of four! Venusaur swept four!”

With a thud, Togekiss in the livestream screen fell from the sky.

On the other hand, Venusaur was not only revitalized but also wanted another Synthesis for a SPA treatment…

Tokiwa Lilac couldn't help but softly exclaim, “The timing control is too good!”

“It is.” Red nodded, “Even Gold is no match for him.”

Amateurs watch the spectacle, while experts see the craft.

*Pokémon: Battle*, as a real-time command simulation battle, was sufficient to reflect a Trainer's tactical prowess.

Unlike ordinary viewers, Red and Tokiwa Lilac, two powerful Trainers, saw something deeper—

Behind the “Substitute-Protect-Toxic” tactic was actually a precise control of timing, which severely tested a Trainer's commanding ability.

It could be confirmed that the streamer with the ID “Has Teacher Lu Underperformed Today” was definitely an experienced Trainer.

Even… Gold was no match for him!

“Now you know why I didn't go training today, right?” Red chuckled.

“Observing Trainers' battles, that's an important part of training!”

Tokiwa Lilac wanted to retort, 'This is clearly just a game!'

But even if it was a game, it was no less than a high-level Pokémon battle.

Curiosity burning, Tokiwa Lilac and Red watched the livestream screen with full concentration.
