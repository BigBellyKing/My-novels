Chapter 12: Gastly: I Train Myself (Please vote for recommendations!)

The 'Piplup Cup', held every summer, is organized for rookie trainers.

Most participants are high school seniors and college freshmen from Pokémon Academy.

As an official event recognized by the association, good rankings can help in obtaining the [Junior Trainer Certificate].

But Lu Ye had no intention of becoming a trainer, so naturally, he didn't plan to participate.

The summer heat was scorching.

Inside the rented apartment, the fan whirred.

Lu Ye was sitting in front of his computer, editing his next video for release.

Gastly faced the fan, mouth wide open, mist constantly drifting, its voice echoing with the fan's sound.

“Awoo wooo wooo wwww~~~”

Regarding 'Gastly's Nurturing Manual', Gastly's study had progressed to the practical combat section—'How to Command Gastly in a Real Battle'.

“Gastly's temperament is quite lively, often exhibiting unexpected performances in battle…”

Gastly studied the book, nodding frequently.

“Sii-gya!” (That sounds somewhat reasonable!)

“Therefore, rather than rigid training, it's better to cultivate Gastly's autonomous combat awareness…”

“Kek?” (How does one cultivate it?)

“Different Gastly have different personalities, and their battle styles also vary; finding the most suitable domain is key.”

“Kek kek!” (Understood, understood!)

Gastly floated in mid-air, smugly grinning, a look of 'I've completely understood it now' on its face.

In two days, Gastly had not only learned Confuse Ray, but also mastered Night Shade with ease.

And the source of all this knowledge—

Green's 'Gastly's Nurturing Manual'.

Had been licked to tatters by Gastly, even the writing was blurred.

This was truly a case of literally *devouring* the book!

Glancing at Lu Ye, Gastly saw that he was still fully engrossed in his computer.

Gastly couldn't help but feel a little dejected.

It spread the book open and laid it over its face.

Gastly, bored, repeatedly popped in and out of shadows.

The Moomoo Milk in the fridge was gone, and the suspicious blue drink was also running low.

The can of drink named 'Speed Enhancer' had visibly increased the movement speed of Gastly's dark mist.

Since Gastly naturally possessed the ability to merge with shadows, its stealth had also improved somewhat.

As it was blowing bubbles, Gastly spotted a line of text in the Nurturing Manual and immediately perked up.

“How to handle a Pokémon when its mood is low.”

“Kek kek!” (How do you handle it?!)

“One, use items and Pokémon food to increase the Pokémon's friendship.”

“Sii-ka!” (Everything at home is eaten up Σ(°△°|||))

“Two, engage in activities like camping and picnics with your Pokémon.”

“Sii-gya!” (He ignores me (╬▔皿▔))

“Three, motivate your Pokémon with a battle victory.”

“Kek!” (This is it! (ω))

Gastly tilted its head, pondering for a long time.

Suddenly, it remembered seeing competition information on the phone yesterday.

Floating slowly to Lu Ye's side, Gastly licked Lu Ye's cheek with its tongue, blinking its eyes.

Gastly: (⊙⊙)

“Oh.” Lu Ye immediately understood.

“Are you hungry? Take the phone and order some takeout!”

Successfully getting the phone, the Gastly whose plan succeeded accidentally let out a laugh.

“Jie jie jie!”

“…What's wrong with you? Why are you laughing so terrifyingly?”

Gastly chuckled, held the phone in its mouth, and slid its tongue up and down the screen.

Rurina's gravure? Not this…

Elesa's fashion show? Not this either…

What kind of strange things does this guy usually watch?!

Gastly looked peculiar, then its eyes suddenly lit up.

【The 'Piplup Cup' Rookie Trainer Competition sincerely invites all young people aspiring to become trainers to participate!】

Filling out the registration information also required Lu Ye's ID card.

Gastly rummaged through boxes and cabinets for a long time before finally finding the ID card.

It laboriously filled out the registration form with its sharp fangs, and after more than half an hour, Gastly let out a long sigh of relief.

【Mr. Lu Ye, your registration review has passed. Your participant ID is: 3534】

【The preliminary rounds will begin next Wednesday. Please note the time】

Nodding contentedly, Gastly rallied its spirits, its eyes seemingly burning with fire.

I must win this competition for my master!---

Finally finishing editing the video, Lu Ye stretched.

He turned his head and saw Gastly diligently studying the Nurturing Manual.

This caused a subtle shift in Lu Ye's mindset.

“I train myself?”

Lu Ye didn't need to intervene at all; Gastly clearly arranged its own diet, tactics, and training.

This made Lu Ye's expression strange, and he couldn't help but feel the illusion that he was useless.

“System, can you check what moves Gastly currently knows?”

【Do you wish to spend 500 BP to activate VIP1 privilege 'Pokédex'?】

【Yes/No】

“Yes.” Lu Ye's mouth twitched. “Are there V8 privileges too?”

【Remaining BP: 570】

【Target searching… Target confirmed!】

【Gastly】

【Type: Ghost + Poison
Ability: Levitate
Known Moves: Confuse Ray, Lick, Mean Look, Will-O-Wisp, Curse, Night Shade】

After seeing the move list, Lu Ye's first reaction was surprise.

In reality, there's no four-move limit, so the number of moves can, to some extent, reflect a Pokémon's strength.

Of course, many of these six moves might have been learned with the help of Green's Nurturing Manual.

But even so, it was enough to shock Lu Ye!

“It's that strong?!”

“And I caught it with just one Poké Ball!”

Lu Ye scanned the move list again, immediately clicking his tongue in wonder.

“Dirty, simply dirty!”

“Out of six moves, five cause status conditions. It would be a disservice to your move set if you weren't my Pokémon!”

Confuse Ray causes confusion, Lick causes paralysis, Will-O-Wisp causes burn.

Mean Look prevents escape, Curse continuously drains the opponent's HP.

If you add Toxic and Hypnosis…

Then this wave would be a definite knockout!

In reality, status conditions can stack.

This is also why Lu Ye's 'Substitute-Protect-Toxic' strategy was so infuriating.

Now, Lu Ye seemed to have discovered a brand new path to glorify infuriating tactics.

“Confusion, paralysis, burn, poison… these status conditions can totally be applied together!”

Gastly, the god of dirty tactics!

Even though he had determined the training direction, Lu Ye was simply too lazy to train it.

Being a trainer isn't worth it!

Isn't it better to stream and make easy money?

The number of subscribers in the live stream room has already reached 80,000; with a little more effort, he can achieve his small goal of showing his face.

At this critical moment, the system released a new task.

【Task: 'I'm Really Not a Million-Level Traffic Star'】

【Task Description: Publish a video with a million-level view count】

【Task Reward: 1000 BP, Random Skill LV3*1, Random Purple Item*1】

Lu Ye had already experienced the benefits of system items.

Just the Enhanced Version of the Speed Enhancer had significantly boosted Gastly's speed.

If he could pull an item worth hundreds of thousands, sell it, wouldn't he just take off?

The video Lu Ye had just finished editing was the new video he intended to release.

'Teacher Lu Teaches You Battle 04: Minimize Team'.

If there was any strategy more infuriating than Substitute-Protect-Toxic.

It was undoubtedly the Minimize Team, represented by the pink devil!

Chansey, holding an Eviolite, had outstanding Special Defense and could continuously raise its evasion rate by using Minimize.

Unable to hit it, unable to wear it down.

While being incredibly tanky, its damage was also high—

How can there be such a cool Pokémon as Chansey!

A meaningful smile appeared at the corner of Lu Ye's mouth.

He moved the mouse and clicked the “Upload” button.
