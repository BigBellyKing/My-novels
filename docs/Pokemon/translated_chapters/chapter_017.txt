Chapter 17: This Round, Oh This Round, Is a Backstab (Please give recommendation votes!)

Lu Ye, who was in class, looked at the screen full of system notifications with a bewildered expression.

[Gained awe from passersby, BP+1, BP+1, BP+1...]

[Brilliant tactical command! BP+10]

[Interrupted Quilava's 'Blaze' Ability, BP+20]

[Achieved first victory, Rating: Absolutely Splendid! (BP+100)]

[Remaining BP: 575]

Without doing anything, the system inexplicably gained 300 BP, making Lu Ye feel a little embarrassed.

“Did I glitch the system?” Lu Ye muttered.

Just then, his phone vibrated. Tian Youwei used a string of question marks to express his inner excitement.

[Chat Interface]

Tian Youwei: Awesome, Brother Luzi!

Tian Youwei: You entered the competition without telling me? And you actually won against someone from the Battle Department?!

Lu Ye: Wasn't I honestly staying in the classroom attending class?

Tian Youwei: Holy cow, you're still pretending?!

Tian Youwei: Wait a minute... this couldn't have been part of your plan, could it?

Almost all contestants that day knew that a formidable individual had appeared at Field No. 7, completely crushing the Battle Department opponent solely through their Pokémon's self-directed battling.

This clearly showed the formidable individual's usual dedication to training Gastly's battle intuition.

While other rookies were still struggling with move power, this formidable individual had already embarked on the path of 'Pokémon self-directed battling'!

One must know, even most Elite Trainers found it difficult to achieve this!

It was said that after the battle, Gastly had an expression like 'That's all?', and even its Trainer didn't show up.

This further convinced reporters that this mysterious Trainer was the biggest dark horse of the competition!

Thinking of this, Tian Youwei's body tensed, and he seemed to understand something instantly.

Tian Youwei: Holy cow, not even accepting interviews is part of your plan, isn't it?

Lu Ye: ???

Tian Youwei: I'm convinced! Brother Luzi, may we prosper together and not forget each other!

Putting down his phone, Lu Ye wore a blank expression.

What in the world is going on?!

I'd rather not be a Trainer, so why would I participate in a Trainer competition?

Just then, his phone vibrated, and an unfamiliar message arrived.

[ID: 3534, Mr. Lu Ye, you have a new competition message]

[Congratulations on entering the 'Piplup' Rookie Trainer Cup Group A group stage]

[Please proceed to Field No. 4 this Saturday to participate in the competition. We wish you a successful match!]

Lu Ye was completely dumbfounded.

Competing in a vacuum?

I didn't even participate in the preliminary rounds, so how did I get into the group stage?!

Just then, a flashback to the sneaky Gastly from that morning and its uncontrollable mischievous grin suddenly flashed through Lu Ye's mind.

It couldn't be that guy, secretly entering the competition...

Without a Trainer's command, it actually won?!

Lu Ye inexplicably felt a pang in his chest.

This round, oh this round, is a backstab! —

Lu Ye found the registration text message, deleted by Gastly, in the recycle bin.

Not only did that guy secretly sign up, but as if to give Lu Ye a surprise, it even deleted the text message.

Lu Ye deliberately put on a stern face, waiting at home for the late Gastly.

“Kek!” (I'm back!)

A ghostly face peeked out from the crack in the door, and Gastly 'whoosh'ed its entire body through.

“Ta-da!” (Your great me has made a dazzling entrance!)

Lu Ye feigned anger, saying coldly, “Why are you back so late?”

Gastly chuckled, shook the contestant badge on its head, and proudly raised its head.

“Did you go to the preliminary rounds today?”

“Kek!”

“And you won against your opponent?”

“Keeek~~!”

“And I heard it was a complete massacre?”

Gastly: (*≧▽≦)~~!!

A familiar feeling of exhaustion welled up in his chest again.

Lu Ye sighed, and shakily sat back down on the sofa.

I really didn't want to be a Trainer!

But why is my Gastly so proactive?

Not only can it train its own moves, but it can even sign up for competitions by itself?!

For others, this would undoubtedly be an excellent opportunity to naturally embark on the path of a Trainer.

But for Lu Ye, this was a definite backstab!

He didn't even have time to grift for money, let alone participate in competitions to be a Trainer?!

Looking at the triumphant and joyful Gastly, Lu Ye found it hard to dampen its enthusiasm.

Eventually, Lu Ye forced a smile: “You did very well!”

“Keep up the hard work next time!”

“Kek!” Gastly happily grinned wide.

Lu Ye sat on the sofa, his hands clasped over his forehead, lost in thought.

The 'Piplup' Cup held a certain influence throughout Zhejiang Province.

But the preliminary rounds had mixed quality, and Gastly might have won by sheer luck.

Once it entered the group stage, it would be facing strong contenders from various Pokémon Academies.

Instead of wasting effort on this, it would be better to seriously consider his streaming career.

Although it felt a little unfair to Gastly.

But if it lost a match, it probably wouldn't be so keen on competitions anymore, right?

Ultimately, Lu Ye decided to skip the group stage attendance altogether.

“In the group stage, you must do your best!” Lu Ye said seriously. “Furthermore, I won't be making an appearance until the finals.”

Lu Ye spoke eloquently: “Opponents in the group stage alone won't be able to trouble you.”

“This is not only to hone your battle intuition but also a test for you!”

Gastly paused, then opened its large mouth, its eyes seemingly burning with raging flames.

“Kek!”

This is my master's trust in me!

Since even he said so, then as long as I train hard, I will definitely advance to the finals!

Thinking of the three Dragon Flame Berry blocks remaining in the cabinet, Gastly's expression became resolute, unusually serious.

This appearance of facing a formidable enemy, however, made Lu Ye a little worried.

It couldn't really advance to the finals, could it?

No, it won't. Gastly has only been training for less than a month. Even if it ate Dragon Flame Berry blocks, Speed Enhancers, Fire Gems...

...it still wouldn't win against those Battle Department students who've trained for at least a year.

Probably.

The next round of competition was on Saturday, three days later.

To prevent burning through the walls again, Lu Ye tacitly allowed Gastly to train its moves outside.

That night, moonlight streamed in through the screen window.

Lu Ye opened his eyes; Gastly on the ceiling was long gone.

Coming to the windowsill, Lu Ye looked around, gazing towards the construction site next to the residential area.

[Spirit Vision Lv1 check — 79, Success!]

At the construction site, several wisps of Will-O-Wisp flickered on and off, set against the purplish-red sky, gradually blending into the night.

Night wind blew, and Lu Ye lay on the windowsill, silently watching Gastly.

About two hours later, the firelight gradually ceased.

Rustling sounds came from the door, and Lu Ye returned to bed, feigning sleep.

Gastly quietly slipped into the room, 'slurp'ed a lick on Lu Ye's cheek, and returned to the ceiling to sleep soundly.

Lu Ye's lips curved slightly upwards, and he let out a soft sigh.
