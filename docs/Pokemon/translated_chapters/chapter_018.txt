Chapter 18: Gastly's Substitute (Please vote for me!)

The rumors about Gastly from Venue 7 and 'that man' continued to circulate within trainer circles.

Some said it was a big-shot author who had just caught a Gastly and was leveling it up in this rookie tournament.

Besides that, the other reward was this small gray USB drive, the TM 'Substitute'.

This USB drive contained detailed instructions on how to use 'Substitute', training techniques, and practical applications for different Pokémon.

No matter how poor, one couldn't skimp on education; no matter how tough, one couldn't make Pokémon suffer.

Therefore, trainers were more willing to pay high prices for genuine TMs.
