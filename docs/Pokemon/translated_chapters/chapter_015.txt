15. Chapter 15 Teacher Lu, your house is on fire! (Please vote!)

Two days later, night, rented apartment.

Lu Ye's expression was serious as he nodded at Gastly.

Gastly's expression was equally serious, staring intently at the Energy Cube before it.

It was dark red and enchanting, flowing with a transparent amber luster, like the color of blood.

This was an Energy Cube made from the 'Dragon Flame Berry', a purple item from Lu Ye's second Ten-pull Gacha.

Remaining BP: 270

Dragon Flame Berry: Capsaicin stimulates nerves, increasing a Pokémon's Special Attack to a certain extent. (Heard this thing is called Dragon Fruit in a parallel world? And it's sweet?)

As a rare Berry that can enhance a Pokémon's attributes, the Dragon Flame Berry was quite uncommon on the market.

Lu Ye's second ten-pull also yielded the following items.

Ten-pull List: Moomoo Milk*3, Oran Berry*3, Junior Fishing Rod Set*1, Dragon Flame Berry*2, Dive Ball*1

Lu Ye currently had no plans to catch a Water-type Pokémon, so the Dive Ball and Junior Fishing Rod Set were set aside for now.

The main harvest, however, was these two crimson Dragon Flame Berries.

After Lu Ye went full throttle and processed the Dragon Flame Berries into Energy Cubes.

His neighbors thought a murder had occurred next door and almost called the police.

The first attempt at crafting failed, and the second only yielded five Dragon Flame Berry Cubes.

But the five Dragon Flame Berry Cubes were of high quality, demonstrating Lu Ye's mastery of 'Energy Cube Crafting Lv3'.

"Try it," Lu Ye said seriously. "If it works, I'm going out to set up a stall!"

"Kek!"

Gastly nodded, extending its trembling tongue, which seemed to freeze in place, resting on the Dragon Flame Berry Cube for five seconds.

"...Just eat it already!"

A drop of cold sweat slid down Gastly's face and 'plop', landed on its stiff tongue tip.

Taking a deep breath, Gastly quickly curled the Dragon Flame Berry Cube into its tongue and began chewing, as if bravely facing martyrdom.

Three seconds later.

"How does it feel?" Lu Ye asked eagerly.

Gastly's dark ghostly face visibly flushed.

Gastly struggled to open its mouth wide, its large white eyes bloodshot.

"Hoo—!!"

As Gastly gasped for air, a cluster of dark purple flames roared out of its mouth!

Lu Ye maintained his sidestepping posture.

The dark flames 'bang!' exploded on the wall, continuing to burn as if affixed to it, charring the entire wall black!

In the dead silence.

Gastly widened its innocent eyes, trying to play it cute and get away with it.

A drop of cold sweat slid down Lu Ye's forehead.

"The power of this Will-O-Wisp, it's almost like Flamethrower?!"

Will-O-Wisp is usually a ghostly blue phosphorescent flame with low power.

But after consuming the Dragon Flame Berry Cube, this Will-O-Wisp nearly burned through the wall!

Lu Ye couldn't tell for a moment whether it was Gastly's exceptional talent or if the Dragon Flame Berry Cube's effect was simply too potent.

Breaking out in a cold sweat, Lu Ye once again firmed his resolve not to become a Trainer.

After calming himself, Lu Ye put his hands on his hips, gazing at the charred wall with a complex expression.

Beside him floated a dejected-looking Gastly.

"I can't blame you for this," Lu Ye sighed. "Looks like I'll have to keep experimenting with recipes."

"Hiss-gek~~"

"Hmm? You're saying it actually tasted pretty good?"

"Kek!"

Lu Ye rubbed his chin, falling into deep thought.

The quality of the Dragon Flame Berry Cube was definitely not an issue; that incident earlier probably wasn't a side effect, but rather a result of its excessively good effect.

"But if the effect is too good, I can't exactly sell it for money!"

What if it causes a few more fires? Where would I go to explain myself?

Lu Ye scratched his head and sighed, "Never mind, the remaining four Dragon Flame Berry Cubes are all yours, you little rascal!"

Gastly chuckled, gently picking up the four remaining crystalline red cubes and placing them into a glass jar, carefully preserving them in the cabinet.

Lu Ye let out a hollow laugh. "I'm not going to steal them from you, why hide them so deeply?"

Gastly glanced at Lu Ye. "Ska!" (You never know!)

This disdainful look deeply stung Lu Ye.

Lu Ye gritted his teeth and said, "You just wait!"

What appeared in Lu Ye's palm was a Fire Gem, glowing with a red light.

Although its energy wasn't as abundant as a Fire Stone, for Gastly, this was definitely a rare delicacy!

Gastly immediately grinned, extending its scarlet tongue, gazing longingly at the Fire Gem.

"Slurp—"

Unable to help itself, Gastly swallowed, looking pitifully at Lu Ye.

From Gastly's perspective.

I'm so cute, won't you just give in obediently?

From Lu Ye's perspective.

A sinister Gastly was staring intently, its eyes bloodshot and constantly drooling.

Unable to resist a shiver, Lu Ye reluctantly tossed the Fire Gem to Gastly.

"Eat it sparingly, it cost tens of thousands!"

Frankly, even the Pokémon of Elite Trainers didn't necessarily have better meals than Lu Ye's Gastly.

Only half a month had passed since the world line shifted.

Gastly had already consumed 'Moomoo Milk', 'Speed Enhancer', 'Dragon Flame Berry Cubes'...

Now, with the addition of the Fire Gem, pseudo-legendary treatment was nothing more than this!

Gastly held the Fire Gem in its mouth, looking a little bewildered at Lu Ye's retreating back, its eyes gradually turning into wavy lines.

Tears welled up in its eyes; Gastly, who had wandered the city for a long time, once again felt the warmth of home.

"Kek!"

"Holy crap, don't suddenly pounce on me! Dark Mist is poisonous! Don't—"

Lu Ye didn't like keeping Gastly inside a Poké Ball.

Firstly, Ash's Pikachu had left an extremely deep impression on Lu Ye.

Secondly, Poké Balls, to some extent, restricted a Pokémon's freedom, making them seem a bit cold.

Of course, compared to the fiercely competitive natural environment, many Pokémon preferred to stay inside Poké Balls.

So generally, Lu Ye wouldn't interfere with Gastly's choices.

The next day, Lu Ye hurried to the campus for class, and Gastly lay by the door crack, seeing him off.

"Aren't you coming with me?" Lu Ye asked in surprise.

"Kek kek!"

"Alright, just be careful at home by yourself."

Lu Ye's expression was strange. "Just don't set anything else on fire!"

Last time, the wall was burned down, reducing Lu Ye's assets by '500', leaving him with only about 4000 yuan.

If he didn't scrounge up some quick cash soon, his household would barely be able to make ends meet!

A flicker of embarrassment crossed Gastly's face, and it nodded frantically under Lu Ye's suspicious gaze.

Watching Lu Ye leave, Gastly breathed a sigh of relief, then fetched the Fire Gem from the cabinet.

Placing it on the ground, Gastly flipped the Nurturing Manual to the 'Will-O-Wisp' page and slowly nodded.

The preliminary rounds it signed up for last time should be tomorrow.

My master has his own things to attend to; I can't take up his time.

I need to hurry up and train properly!

Gastly absorbed the Fire Gem's energy, and powerful fire elements surged into its Dark Mist, dyeing it a deep red.

Around Gastly, three eerie black flames slowly blossomed.

Corrosion, Attachment, Burning – these were precisely the basic characteristics of Will-O-Wisp mentioned by Green in the Nurturing Manual.

Different Trainers would have different builds, for instance, adding 'Toxic' to Will-O-Wisp, or enhancing its 'Splash' effect.

At this moment, violent fire elements encircled it, forcing the three black flames to erupt with extremely high temperatures.

The dark, thick mist became viscous, and Gastly 'aww~' swallowed another Dragon Flame Berry Cube.

The surrounding temperature rapidly increased, and with a 'bang', the Fire Gem exploded into smithereens!

The three Will-O-Wisps merged at this moment; amidst chaos and repulsion, flames shot skyward!

Will-O-Wisp: Burst!

That evening.

Lu Ye returned to his rented apartment with his backpack; sirens wailed loudly in the streets.

Firefighters, with their ladders, were directing a Blastoise to carry out fire suppression work.

Many onlookers had gathered. Lu Ye asked the old security guard curiously, "Elder, whose house is on fire?"

The elder swept a complex gaze over Lu Ye. "Sixth floor, your place."

Lu Ye: ???

Under Gastly's control, the fire wasn't serious, and neighbors had promptly called the police.

After receiving a lecture, Lu Ye was fined 1000 yuan and paid 1000 yuan in compensation.

One person and one Gastly scurried back home, scorch marks still evident on the wall.

"It's a miracle Sister Liu didn't kick me out!" Lu Ye mumbled.

He glanced at Gastly, finding it curled into a ball, trembling disconsolately.

Lu Ye sighed, comforting it, "This time it's my fault; I shouldn't have left you home alone."

"Ska..."

"There, there." Lu Ye patted the dejected Gastly. "Don't cry."

"Let's get tidied up, how about I treat you to a late-night snack later?"

"Kek! (;Д｀)"

Teacher Lu: My house is on fire (Video)

Gold: An astonishingly powerful Flamethrower!

Green: Judging by its persistence, it should be Will-O-Wisp.

Group member 'Gold' has been muted by the administrator for two hours.

In private chat with 'Red'

Gold: I just joined the group! How did I get banned already?!

Red: ...You really need to be more careful!

Gold: Then why wasn't Green muted???

Red: ...

Staring at the dimmed avatar.

Gold, wearing goggles and with an arrogant expression, slammed his pool cue onto the table with a 'bang', gritting his teeth.

"Even if it's just a game..."

"I absolutely have to beat Teacher Lu!"
