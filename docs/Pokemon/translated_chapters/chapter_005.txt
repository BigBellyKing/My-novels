Chapter 5. Suggested Title: Too Many Elements (Please Vote for Recommendation Tickets!)

As I said before, Lu Ye was professionally trained; no matter how funny it was, he wouldn't laugh.

But this cheat system still made Lu Ye's lips curve upwards unreservedly.

“I knew it, how could a transmigrator not come with a cheat system?”

“Let me check, what exactly is this system good for!”

Faint text appeared before Lu Ye's eyes, its effect similar to the attribute bar in a virtual online game.

【Current BP: 1720】

【Click to view details, to see the detailed source of BP.】

“View details.”

【Video views exceeded 1,000,000, BP +1000】

【Livestream popularity exceeded 100,000, BP +50】

【Consumed 'Normal-grade' Farfetch'd dish, BP +20】

【...】

“I can probably understand the first few… but eating Farfetch'd also gives BP!?”

【BP, also known as 'Battle Points', consuming quality dishes can enhance the host's physique and provide the host with an equivalent amount of BP】

【Completing system tasks, unlocking achievements, Pokémon battles, fulfilling hidden conditions, etc., can all grant BP.】

The system replied emotionlessly in a mechanical voice.

Lu Ye held his forehead, a headache brewing: “Then what does BP have to do with video views?!”

【Utilizing the internet to expand influence is one of the essential qualities of a Legendary Trainer】

“Huh? I never wanted to be a Trainer!”

The system was silent for a long while, then slowly a line of text appeared.

【This system is also known as the 'Legendary Trainer Nurturing System'】

【Once bound, no refunds. Please confirm receipt】

“Can you do something normal for once?”

Lu Ye's mouth twitched, and he ultimately let out a long sigh.

“Forget it, I can accumulate BP by being a streamer anyway, so it's all roads leading to Rome.”

“From today onwards, this system shall be called the 'Super Streamer Nurturing System'. Who agrees, who disagrees!”

【Ding—Spend 1000 BP to rename the system to 'Super Streamer Nurturing System'?】

【Yes/No】

“I only have a little over 2000 BP in total, and renaming it costs 1000 BP? Scummy management!”

Lu Ye declared righteously: “No!”

“It's just a broken system, it can't force me to become a Trainer, can it?”

The system was silent for a moment, then actively brought up the gacha screen for Lu Ye.

【Existing functions: Ten-pull Gacha, Shop… First ten-pull guaranteed SR, limited-time offer】

“Are you a planner from NetEase or Tencent? Do you need me to top up 6 yuan for the first time, and then activate a Battle Pass deluxe gift pack?!”

Lu Ye was exasperated, but still couldn't control his hand, and clicked open the 'Ten-pull Gacha' interface.

“The gacha interface is quite flashy, though…”

【The host can set the display form of the Ten-pull Gacha, including: Crate opening, Talisman drawing, Briefcase opening…】

“Are you sure this won't cause copyright disputes?” Lu Ye's mouth twitched. “Isn't this the CSGO crate opening interface?”

“And Rainbow Six and Onmyoji… Damn it, you even stole the UI from Hearthstone and Rhodes Island?!”

【Parallel world, please do not take offense】

Lu Ye said helplessly: “Set the display form to Hearthstone card packs.”

【UI setting complete, drop rates disclosed. Please check yourself, Host】

【Drop Rate Disclosure: 60% White Common, 30% Blue Rare, 9% Purple Epic, 1% Orange Legendary】

Lu Ye, momentarily at a loss for words to complain, covered his forehead and said:

“Even the drop rates are disclosed… you really keep up with current regulations.”

“Never mind, let's just do a ten-pull to test the waters.”

【Spend 1000 BP for one Ten-pull Gacha?】

【Yes/No】

“Yes!”

“Bang—!”

Two ancient-looking card packs appeared out of thin air. Lu Ye grabbed one and started spinning it clockwise continuously.

Shimmering fragments scattered, and the card pack was opened by a mysterious force, five cards fluttering in the air.

【Rare!】

Out of five cards, only one was Rare: the nutritious 'Moomoo Milk'.

【Moomoo Milk: 100% nutritious milk, drinkable by both humans and Pokémon. (It's also Tauros's favorite.)】

The remaining three common items were an 'Oran Berry' to restore a small amount of stamina and two 'Pecha Berries' to cure poison.

“As expected, blue skies and white clouds—an old gacha-cursed individual.”

Used to it, Lu Ye shrugged and opened the other remaining card pack.

After three unremarkable common cards, the system suddenly yelled in a sarcastic tone.

【Epic!】

“Why are you shouting so loudly?!”

Lu Ye examined the card and suddenly froze.

【Japanese Lv3: You can skillfully use Japanese, and accurately use different accents, honorifics, and dialects. (Captain, don't shoot, it's me!)】

In an instant, Lu Ye felt as if something extra had appeared in his mind, and immediately put it to use.

“Kusa (bilingual Chinese and Japanese)”

According to the user manual, Lu Ye gained a general understanding of the skills provided by the system.

Lv1 was a level achievable by an average person with effort, Lv2 was a considerably excellent degree.

Lv3 was a top-tier industry level, Lv4 was cross-domain proficiency, and Lv5 was the absolute limit within human capabilities.

With Japanese Lv3, it wouldn't be difficult for Lu Ye to even imitate a Natsume Soseki-style essay in Japanese.

Of course, imitating was too tiring. Lu Ye planned to plagiarize a novel by a big-shot author if he got the chance.

“Only one card left.”

Lu Ye calmed his mind and flipped over the last card.

The system roared again, but this sound, to Lu Ye's ears, was like heavenly music.

【Wow—!!】

【Golden Rare!】

Lu Ye: “???”

I thought it was a Legendary, but you're just screaming about this.

The so-called Golden Rare was nothing more than a can of alkaloid, also known as 'Speed Enhancer,' a suspicious blue drink.

【Speed Enhancer (Enhanced Version): Can increase a Pokémon's Speed stat to a certain extent. The Enhanced Version has a more significant effect. Not recommended for human consumption】

(Drink it, and you'll run even faster than a Hong Kong reporter!)

Lu Ye: “...This description always feels like something bad is going to happen.”

Although it stated it was not recommended for human consumption, the description seemed eager for Lu Ye to drink it all.

Lu Ye pondered for a long time, then ultimately shoved the suspicious blue drink into the cabinet.

“I'll wait until I catch my first Pokémon, then let it drink this and see…”

“Things from the system shouldn't be a problem. Even if I'm not a Trainer, being able to run faster is never a bad thing.”

“Speaking of which, I haven't even found a Poké Ball yet. I should check out a Pokémon shop tomorrow.”

With the remaining 720 BP, Lu Ye decided to save up until he had 1000 BP to try another Ten-pull Gacha.

Before going to sleep, Lu Ye chugged the can of Moomoo Milk, smacking his lips: “A bit sweet.”

【Consumed 'Delicious-grade' Moomoo Milk, BP +40】

【First consumption, Host's physique +1!】
