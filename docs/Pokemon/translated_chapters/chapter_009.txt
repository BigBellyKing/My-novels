9. Chapter 9: I Choose You! (Please Vote for Me!)

Gardenia stared blankly at the fallen Breloom.

As a Grass-type expert, she knew everything there was to know about Breloom's habits and battles.

But her opponent's audacious move still caught her completely off guard.

“Using a Toxic Orb to activate Breloom's Poison Heal ability?” Gardenia murmured.

“What a bold idea!”

In reality, it wasn't that no one had ever proposed a Poison Heal strategy for Breloom, but it was usually a passive tactic.

The Toxic Orb's poison placed a significant burden on the Pokémon, and even the 'Poison Heal' ability couldn't fully absorb it.

Therefore, Grass-type Trainers generally opted for Breloom with the 'Technician' ability, enhancing its close-quarters combat capabilities based on Grass-type sustainability.

But “Teacher Lu's” current strategy seemed to have opened a door to a new world for Gardenia.

“What if the sustained healing effect of Leech Seed cancels out the Toxic Orb's poison?”

Gardenia integrated this strategy into reality, her mind furiously constructing possibilities.

“Then, using Substitute to share the poison's burden, Poison Heal could completely absorb all of the Toxic Orb's poison!”

“Leech Seed, Toxic, Toxic Orb, Substitute... what an incredibly bold training method!”

A fervent expression appeared on Gardenia's face. “This strategy can absolutely be applied in reality!”

Suddenly, Gardenia's breathing quickened as she clicked on “Teacher Lu's” homepage, eager to find out more.

“Highest ranking... World Number Seven!?”

Gardenia's eyes widened instantly.

Glancing at the fan group she had just joined, Gardenia's expression subtly changed.

“R-Red is actually here too!

“And Champion Green!”

“Even *they* are Teacher Lu's fans!?”

Gardenia felt a momentary apprehension, murmuring, “Surely Miss Erika knows such a famous Grass-type master?”

“For this year's type specialist competition, I wonder if I could consult him...”

Opening a Poké Ball, red light flashed.

Gardenia looked at her other Breloom with the 'Poison Heal' ability, her mind carefully replaying the battle.

“So he wasn't intentionally provoking me; rather, the essence of the Poison Heal strategy *is* truly this way...”

Gardenia's gaze became resolute, and she tightened her grip on the Poké Ball.

“I still need to work harder!”

After a glorious broadcast, Lu Ye's stream reached 70,000 subscribers.

In just one evening, Lu Ye received nearly 2,000 yuan in donations.

Although the exact net income still needed to be calculated, it was enough for Lu Ye to treat himself.

He took an ice-cold Coke from the mini-fridge, opened it with a “fizz,” and leaned lazily back in his gaming chair.

“System, check remaining BP!”

[BP: 970]

Thanks to the excellent broadcast effect, Lu Ye had gained nearly 200 BP, and it wouldn't be long before he could do another Ten-pull Gacha.

Going into the next room, Gastly was still floating over the Nurturing Manual with a focused expression, diligently studying it.

Like a strict teacher, Gastly stared intently at the document, a small claw formed from dark mist holding an Oran Berry.

“Kek!”

As if reading something brilliant, Gastly nodded in satisfaction, then bit into the Oran Berry with a “chomp,” juice overflowing.

Lu Ye's expression couldn't help but turn strange.

Well, isn't that something, treating an academic paper like something to savor!

Hearing the movement, the dark mist swiftly converged.

Gastly turned back in surprise, then immediately grinned happily, extending its tongue to lick Lu Ye.

“Kek~!”

Lu Ye tried to pat Gastly's head, only to find his hand passing through the dark mist, his fingertips feeling a chilling, numbing sensation.

Suddenly, the system's emotionless broadcast sounded in Lu Ye's ear.

[Gastly, a thin gaseous lifeform. If surrounded by its gas, even an Indian Elephant will collapse within ten minutes.]

Lu Ye's face changed slightly. “Damn it, why didn't you say so sooner?”

Fortunately, Gastly liked Lu Ye's touch and consciously controlled its poison, transforming it into a wisp of gas that circled Lu Ye's palm.

Lu Ye breathed a sigh of relief and smiled, “Do you want some late-night snack?”

Gastly's bell-like eyes widened, blinking rapidly.

Gastly: (⊙⊙)

“Here, take the phone and order yourself.”

Lu Ye handed the phone to Gastly, simultaneously retrieving the document dampened with drool.

Glancing at “Gastly's Nurturing Manual,” Lu Ye said in surprise, “Good job, kid, you even took notes!?”

“Kek!” Gastly, holding the phone in its mouth, proudly raised its head.

Just earlier, Lu Ye had half-jokingly told Gastly to mark down how to use Confuse Ray.

In less than two hours, the manual was filled with soggy, sticky drool-underlined annotations, all made by Gastly itself!

“You little rascal, you're a goddamn genius!”

“Kek~~(`)”

Lu Ye didn't mind too much, putting the Nurturing Manual back in its place, and chuckled.

“Stop grinning foolishly, hurry up and order takeout!”

Move training was by no means an overnight affair.

Mastering “Confuse Ray” in just two hours was clearly a pipe dream.

Fortunately, Lu Ye didn't have high expectations for Gastly; his main goal was still to save a bit on electricity bills...

“Kek!”

Gastly carefully placed the phone on the table, its eyes gleaming as it stared at the dazzling array of delicacies on the screen, sucking back its drool with a slurp.

But it still couldn't help but show a somewhat infatuated smile, extending its long tongue to lick the Farfetch'd on the menu.

Gastly: (﹃)

“Farfetch'd, huh... we had that last time, let's try something different.”

Lu Ye rubbed his chin. “How about barbecue? This place's lamb skewers seem to have good reviews.”

Gastly: (ω)

Gastly's eyes sparkled in agreement.

“Extra spicy, cumin, ice-cold beer... all set!”

Half an hour later, Lu Ye set up a table by the window.

A cool evening breeze wafted in, and the table full of fragrant grilled skewers made one's mouth water.

Gastly, sipping Moomoo Milk, was red-faced from the spice but still ravenously licked at the glistening skewers.

“Eat slowly, no one's going to snatch it from you!”

“Hiss~~~kek!”

Although it was a spiritual being, after finishing the skewers, the dark mist around Gastly was clearly a bit more solidified.

Speaking of which.

These skewers taste pretty good, perhaps they're Wooloo...

Taking a sip of his cool, crisp beer, Lu Ye smiled. “How did you end up here?”

“I saw online that Gastly's habitat isn't usually in towns.”

Gastly paused, lifted its head and was silent for a moment, then buried itself face-first into the pile of lamb skewers.

“Don't want to talk about it?”

Lu Ye gently poked the dark mist around Gastly and smiled.

“It's okay, we're family now.”

The evening breeze blew, and Gastly suddenly looked up—

Even its eyes became wavy, moved to tears.

“Kek kek~(;Д｀)!”

“Don't wipe your snot on my clothes! No, don't!”

Lu Ye, who nearly got enveloped by Gastly and almost experienced “the suffocating African elephant,” narrowly escaped.

He took out a suspicious blue drink from the cabinet, “Speed Enhancer (Enhanced Version),” for Gastly's breakfast tomorrow.

Lu Ye placed Gastly on the ceiling, making it its bed.

It had to be said, waking up to see a silly grinning ghost every time gave Lu Ye a considerable sense of security.

“Lights off, Gastly.”

“Kek!”

Following Lu Ye's command, Gastly cut the power to the room.

But even Lu Ye didn't notice that after he fell asleep, a faint glow slowly lit up around Gastly, circling back and forth like fireflies.

This was precisely what Lu Ye had asked Gastly to master that morning—

“Confuse Ray”!

The old book needs to wait for the editor to grant permission before notifications can be posted... Just explaining it here to all the homies who read my old books.
