8. Chapter 8: Incredibly Tanky Yet Deals High Damage (Please give recommendation votes!)

“I'll just take a quick look.”

This was Lu Ye's initial thought.

However, upon opening the file, Lu Ye was instantly captivated by the vast ocean of professional terminology and nurturing knowledge within, deeply immersing himself.

It was akin to a Minotaur warrior, fresh out of the novice village and clueless about the future, suddenly receiving an idiot-proof guide from a big-shot author in a strategy group.

From Gastly's diet and habits to move training, every detail was covered, making it even more comprehensive than an academic paper.

Below the paper, the sources of information were thoughtfully noted—

Yukinari Oak's “An Inquiry into the Inclusion of Ghost-types in Companion Pokémon Studies”;

Agatha's “The Origin of Fear—From Gastly to Gengar”;

In the acknowledgments, Green mentioned that the Kanto Ghost-type Elite Four member, Agatha, and Green's grandfather, Yukinari Oak, seemed to have a connection.

Green utilized Professor Oak's scientific research methods and combined them with Agatha's empirical theories to deduce this nurturing method.

Green seemed to want to publish this paper under Yukinari Oak's name, aiming to alleviate the conflict between the two.

However, it ultimately came to nothing, benefiting Lu Ye for free.

“What a filial and good grandson.”

Lu Ye was somewhat moved.

“Even if it were auctioned, this nurturing method would be worth a lot of money!”

A nurturing manual produced by “The Nurturer” Green would be at least Purple Epic quality.

Although not as profound as Giovanni's “Secrets of the Earth,” it was still a rare treasure for Ghost-type trainers.

“What a pity,” Lu Ye sighed. “This thing isn't of much value to me.”

“Some of the methodologies are pretty much what I expected... Never mind, let Gastly take it and play around with it.”

Lu Ye had little interest in nurturing Pokémon.

But since it was just sitting there, he might as well let Gastly study it itself.

A flash of red light, and a Gastly, a wisp of black mist, blinked its big eyes, curiously looking around its new home.

“Just stay here and don't wander off.”

Lu Ye dodged Gastly's extended tongue. “I'm about to start streaming!”

“Kekeke?”

“Bored, huh? Hmm... Here, take this children's book and read it!”

Gastly looked at Lu Ye with an idiotic stare.

Your children's book has no illustrations, is densely packed with tiny text, and is full of academic jargon?

“Oh? You can read?”

Lu Ye placed the freshly printed [Gastly's Nurturing Method] in front of Gastly.

“Then let me test you: how many ways to use Confuse Ray are mentioned in this paper?”

Confuse Ray is one of the moves Gastly can master in its early stages.

Green believed that Gastly, born from optical pollution, had a natural affinity for Confuse Ray.

Therefore, Gastly's Confuse Ray also had considerable room for training—

Lu Ye, however, was too lazy to train it.

He couldn't let Gastly disrupt the stream, but he also couldn't keep it cooped up in a Poké Ball forever. Letting it learn some knowledge couldn't hurt!

“Kekeke!?”

Gastly was stumped by Lu Ye's question, its small face instantly turning pale, floating weakly in the air.

A moment later, Gastly perked up, intently pressing its eyeballs against the paper.

“Kekeke!”

I *must* completely understand this paper today!

Lu Ye nodded in satisfaction.

“Oh, right, there are Berries in the cabinet. If you get hungry, just go in and eat some!”

After instructing Gastly, Lu Ye went to his computer and opened the streaming platform.

“Huh? The subscription count is already 60,000.”

Lu Ye rubbed his chin. “In a few more weeks, I should be able to complete the mission!”

【Mission: "I'm Really Not a Looks-Based Streamer!"】

【Mission Description: Complete the small goal of 100,000 subscriptions】

【Mission Reward: 1000 BP, Random Skill lv1, TM 'Substitute' *1】

Lu Ye had also asked if this so-called Substitute was reliable.

The System replied, it's not a question of reliability; it's the kind that's... really dirty, the kind that can chain combos with other moves.

Lu Ye felt a little regretful.

“I thought I'd awaken something like Killer Queen or Star Platinum, but it turns out it's really just Substitute.”

Opening the stream, the already ravenous audience members poured in one after another.

“Dinner's served! Dinner's served!”

“First time watching, is this the streamer for Battle-focused players?”

“Teacher Lu, please do another tutorial on Substitute-Protect-Toxic!”

Lu Ye glanced at the bullet comments: “Today, I'll give you something different.”

Opening the team editor, Lu Ye dragged a cute Breloom into his team, immediately drawing a flurry of question marks.

“What's the point of Breloom???”

“Its Base Stats aren't high, and its resistances are weak; it's not practical!”

“Venusaur is better! Streamer, switch to another Pokémon!”

Lu Ye was unfazed, and clicked on the matching interface.

“Oh no, Teacher Lu is about to throw the game!”

In the virtual image, Lu Ye was matched with a Sinnoh region player, whose ID had official certification next to it.

【Sinnoh Eterna City, Eterna Gym Leader, Gardenia.】

“Holy crap, a Grass-type Gym Leader from the Sinnoh region!”

“This is a genuine Grass-type expert! Isn't Teacher Lu just showing off in front of an expert by using Breloom?”

“The opponent is also leading with Breloom!?”

Evidently, Gardenia was using her own personal image as her profile card.

On the lush green field, the spirited young woman with orange, ear-length short hair, wearing a green cape and brown shorts, revealing her navel, took out a Poké Ball.

A flash of red light, and two Breloom, one large and one small, appeared on the field.

Clearly, Gardenia's Breloom was much better nurtured than Lu Ye's!

“It's over, he's going to crash and burn!”

“LOL, surely no one actually thinks Teacher Lu can beat a Gym Leader, right?”

“It's not even a Hidden Ability Pokémon, and he has the nerve to bring it out to battle!?”

In the virtual arena, Gardenia's Breloom launched the first attack.

It charged with extreme speed, its fist-claws striking Lu Ye's Breloom's abdomen at sonic speed, directly knocking it back over three meters!

“He's just digging his own grave here!”

“Everyone said not to use Breloom! Wouldn't it be better to just use Venusaur?”

With the situation critical, Lu Ye calmly explained:

“The opponent's Breloom likely has the Hidden Ability 'Technician'.”

“And my Breloom's Ability... is 'Poison Heal'!”

Mach Punch hit a vital spot, but Lu Ye's Breloom did not fall.

Trembling, Breloom let out a shriek towards the sky, its injuries visibly recovering at a rapid pace!

“Holy crap, is that Breloom holding Leftovers? How is it recovering so fast!”

“It's a Toxic Orb! Teacher Lu's Breloom is holding a Toxic Orb!”

With the Poison Heal Ability, a Pokémon in a poisoned state will continuously recover HP.

And a Toxic Orb can inflict a poisoned state on a Pokémon.

When combined, they create a nearly bug-like recovery speed!

The two Breloom constantly exchanged blows, but while one's HP continuously dropped, the other recovered more HP than it lost.

A string of question marks flooded the bullet comments.

“???”

“I'm scared!”

“Is this unfair play, is it?!”

After nearly a hundred turns, seeing no hope for her Breloom to win, the tormented Gardenia voluntarily surrendered.

Amidst a flurry of question marks, the live stream's popularity surged to 600,000.

“Teacher Lu is inhuman!”

“He's truly both intelligent and courageous as f***!”

“Is this the legendary Myriad Poisons Return to Origin!?”

In the virtual image, Lu Ye recalled his Breloom, a faint smile on his face.

“The 'Toxic' in Substitute-Protect-Toxic isn't 'Toxic' (the move), it's 'Poison Heal' (the Ability)!”

A flood of gifts filled the screen, subscriber counts soared, and the system's BP points continuously rose.

“Listen to that, is that something a human would say?”

“Holy crap, even a Gym Leader surrendered?”

“Teacher Lu is awesome!!”

Strange, I can see comments in my backend, but the comment section seems to have been eaten by Qidian... Please give recommendation votes~!!
