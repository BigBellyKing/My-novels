Chapter 16: Sexy Gastly, Online Substitute Player (Please vote for recommendations!)

Wednesday, Modu University.

The beautiful and sweet-voiced English teacher was lecturing on the podium.

Outside, the sun blazed fiercely, while inside, the mild air conditioning made people drowsy.

Liang Dayou elbowed Lu Ye and whispered, “Third brother, you look a bit off.”

“The house almost caught fire last night, how could I sleep well?”

“Ah? Did someone in your neighborhood raise a Fire-type Pokémon?”

Lu Ye rested his chin on his hand, a look of unspeakable bitterness on his face.

He couldn’t possibly say it was the Ghost-type Gastly that almost set the house on fire, could he?

Although the ignition point of phosphor fire is only 40°C, Gastly’s Will-O-Wisp also came with area-of-effect explosion damage!

This was simply more ferocious than the Ember of some Fire-type Pokémon!

“Lu Ye, Liang Dayou, both of you pay attention, okay?” The English teacher said softly.

“Learning English well is the foundation for becoming a Trainer, you see!”

Liang Dayou vowed, “Don’t worry, Teacher, I’ll keep an eye on Lu Ye!”

The English teacher tilted her head sweetly.

Lu Ye looked at the “JAVA Programming” book on Liang Dayou’s desk, smiling without a word.

Bringing a programming book to English class, Brother Dayou, you’re really something!

“Oh, right, why haven’t I seen Brother Youwei today?”

“Brother Youwei went to participate in a competition,” Liang Dayou whispered, “that ‘Piplup Cup’ preliminary round.”

“He actually went to compete?”

Lu Ye was surprised, “I heard over three thousand people are participating this year, and several from Jiaotong University’s Battle Department also went?”

“Yeah, the competition is pretty fierce! But there’s a 50,000 yuan prize, great rewards attract brave (or desperate) men!”

Lu Ye, who was about to be in debt, sighed, “That’s really nice, I wonder who will be the champion this year!”

Outside the ‘Mercedes’ Arena Center in Pudong District, it was already packed with contestants for the preliminary rounds.

Most were high school seniors and college freshmen from Pokémon academies, aiming to achieve a good ranking to qualify for the Junior Trainer Certificate assessment.

As an officially recognized event by the association, freshmen from the Battle Departments of prestigious universities like Modu University, Zhejiang University, and Jiaotong University all participated.

Tian Youwei, dressed in a designer trainer uniform with a custom Poké Ball case on his waist, took a deep breath: “No nerves, no nerves!”

Tian Youwei had always dreamed of becoming a Trainer. Although he narrowly missed the score to get into Modu University’s Battle Department, he firmly believed that even as a self-taught individual, he could still become a Trainer with a bright future!

Looking around, Pidgeotto with sharp gazes, sturdy Machop, beautifully patterned Beautifly…

The Battle Department students were in groups, chatting and laughing, making the non-professional Tian Youwei feel even more out of place.

Tian Youwei took another deep breath.

“Contestants who have reported their ID and name, please proceed to the designated arena!”

“ID: 2527, contestant Yu Hong, please proceed to Arena 7!”

“ID: 3534, contestant Lu Ye, please proceed to Arena 7!”

It wasn't his turn this round, and Tian Youwei had initially breathed a sigh of relief.

But upon hearing that familiar name, he couldn’t help but widen his eyes.

Didn’t Brother Luzi say he wasn’t participating?!

Hurrying to the entrance of Arena 7, Tian Youwei originally wanted to cheer for Lu Ye and tease him a bit.

But instead, he witnessed a scene that left a deep impression on him.

A sinister-looking Gastly, wearing a contestant badge, flashed a creepy grin at the staff.

The young lady responsible for checking identities was dumbfounded. She leaned down and said, “Little guy, where’s your Trainer?”

“Kek kek!”

“Did you get separated from him? But without a Trainer, if a Pokémon competes alone…”

The uniformed young lady thought to herself, isn’t that just a de facto forfeit!

“Sss-kar~~~!”

Gastly’s bloodshot eyes widened, trying to cutely bluff its way through.

Eeek!

The uniformed young lady, startled, shivered and showed an awkward, pale smile.

“Why haven’t the contestants for Arena 7 entered yet?”

A man in a suit walked over quickly, and the uniformed young lady immediately perked up.

“Supervisor, it’s like this…” She said to Gastly with regret.

“You can’t compete alone without a Trainer!”

“Kek…” Gastly’s face turned ghastly pale.

After hearing what happened, the supervisor pondered for a moment.

With his keen sense of smell, he detected a new business opportunity.

If this Gastly could really defeat an opponent without a Trainer, it would undoubtedly be an excellent marketing tool, greatly aiding the competition’s publicity.

This was a zero-cost, high-return attempt!

The supervisor pushed open the entrance gate and smiled, “Little guy, welcome to the competition!”

“Kek!”

Gastly’s eyes gleamed. Wearing Lu Ye’s contestant badge, it excitedly floated into the arena.

“Supervisor, you’re…”

“Notify the media reporters,” the supervisor mused.

“This will be an excellent publicity opportunity!”

“Dear audience friends, welcome to the battle live from Arena 7!”

“From the blue side, contestant Yu Hong, a freshman from Jiangnan University’s Battle Department, his participating Pokémon is…”

“Oh my, it’s Quilava, the evolved form of the starter Cyndaquil, whose high temperature can reach 150°C!”

“As for the red side, it’s contestant Lu Ye from Modu University’s Finance Department, and his participating Pokémon is Gastly!”

“Uh… it seems contestant Lu Ye isn’t present?”

In the stands, Tian Youwei looked at the eager Gastly with a puzzled expression.

What exactly was Brother Luzi up to?

He actually let Gastly compete alone!

Even if he forfeited, there was no need to bring Gastly all the way to the arena!

Yu Hong was also completely bewildered.

Was he getting a bye in the very first match?

This happiness came too suddenly!

Seeing that the supervisor had no objections, the referee blew the whistle: “Begin the battle!”

Yu Hong shouted, “Quilava, use…”

The word ‘Quilava’ takes 0.3 seconds, and ‘use’ takes 0.2 seconds.

Given that Gastly’s Base Speed Stat is 80, and Dragonite’s is also 80.

Combining these conditions, Dragonite can circle the Earth in approximately 16 hours.

Question: How long does it take Gastly to circle a 10*10 standard battle arena?

Before Yu Hong could finish speaking, Gastly was already grinning menacingly, closing in on Quilava, and its ominous dark mist completely enveloped Quilava!

“Eee—!”

Quilava’s sharp flames on its back instantly weakened, its front paws sank to the ground, and it let out a cry of pain.

The sudden turn of events on the field elicited gasps from the audience.

“What the heck?!”

“It’s over? That was too fast!”

The commentator exclaimed, “Without any commands, Gastly actually managed to get the first strike!”

At this moment, Quilava curled its body into a wheel shape, its flames surged, and it forcibly broke through the dark mist with ‘Flame Wheel’!

Yu Hong breathed a sigh of relief: “Ember!”

But Yu Hong’s command did not take effect.

With a thud, Quilava crashed into the side of the arena and stopped, dizzy and seeing stars!

Gastly retracted the dazzling ‘Confuse Ray’ from its body, chuckled, and slowly approached the confused Quilava.

“Get up, Quilava!” Yu Hong hissed, “Use Ember!”

Gastly: ???

It’s not like it’ll just get up because you tell it to, right?

No matter how deep the bond, one must still adhere to the basic rules of battle!

“Eee—!!”

However, under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Quilava screamed skyward, and the flames on its back suddenly flared up!

Gastly: Σ(っ°Д°;)っ

With the 'Blaze' ability activating, and seeing its opponent about to cheat, Gastly quickly slurped Quilava.

One Lick caused paralysis, two Licks directly finished it off.

In the silent stadium, Gastly’s ‘slurp’ sound was clearly audible.

Gastly: (*⊙~⊙)

“The winner, Gastly… no, the winner is Lu Ye?” The referee’s voice was somewhat uncertain.

He glanced at the supervisor, who was animatedly explaining something to the reporters.

“Who exactly is this Lu Ye…?”

“Isn’t he from the Finance Department? How did he beat someone from the Battle Department!”

“The Trainer was offline the whole time and still won?”

“Not just killing, but crushing the spirit?!”

Tian Youwei glanced at the bewildered Yu Hong, then at the grinning Gastly.

A subtle sense of disorientation arose in his heart.

Is this really the Gastly that my Brother Luzi raised?

It’s actually been secretly training to this extent…

Brother Luzi, and you said you didn’t want to be a Trainer! ?

Please give recommendation votes!!
