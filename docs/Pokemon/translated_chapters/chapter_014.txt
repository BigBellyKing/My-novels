Chapter 14: Pokéblock Crafting (Please vote for me!)

Three days later, Lu Ye, who was taking the elective course 'Pokémon Battle Studies', received a message from the system.

【Ding—Mission “I'm Really Not Million-Level Traffic” completed!】

【Mission Description: Post a video with a million-level view count】

【Mission Reward: 1000 BP, Random Skill Lv3*1, Random Purple Item*1】

“It seems the Minimize Team video has already surpassed a million views,” Lu Ye muttered.

“By that calculation, hitting 100,000 subscribers for the stream should be soon, right?”

Lu Ye’s stream had been stuck at the 90,000 subscriber mark.

But with the buzz from this video, he believed the day Teacher Lu would show his face wasn’t far off!

On the sports field, many groups of two were engaged in noob-on-noob Pokémon battles.

Although Lu Ye majored in Finance, he still had quite a few Pokémon-related courses.

This elective course, 'Pokémon Battle Studies', was worth 4 credits.

Its nature was similar to a PE class; everyone was just going through the motions, like practicing Tai Chi.

However, Gastly seemed very enthusiastic about battling and had already pinned Brother Dayou’s Slowpoke to the ground and 'rubbed' it five or six times.

On the field, Brother Dayou’s pained shouts echoed: “Slowpoke! Wake up, Slowpoke!”

Lu Ye said helplessly, “It’s just Hypnosis, not a coma. Why are you shouting so loudly?”

“Ah… is that so?” Brother Dayou scratched his head.

Tian Youwei, standing nearby, clicked his tongue in wonder, “Amazing, Brother Luzi, you’ve trained it to this level right after catching it!”

Lu Ye’s expression was strange. “What if I told you I really haven’t trained it? Would you believe me?”

“Are you kidding? You’re almost stronger than someone from the Battle Department!”

In fact, Lu Ye had been busy with streaming and hadn't had time to train Gastly.

Entirely self-taught, Gastly had learned the new move 'Hypnosis', taking its dirty tactics to the next level.

“I always feel like I’m a good-for-nothing,”

Lu Ye mumbled to himself.

“Whether I’m here or not, it’s all the same!”

Recalling Gastly, Lu Ye went to the side of the field and checked the system.

【Remaining BP: 1570】

【Ding—The “Pokémon Nurturing Studies” branch, Pokéblock Crafting Lv3, has been unlocked!】

【Pokéblock Crafting Lv3: You can create high-quality Pokéblocks, are intimately familiar with all Berry types and their characteristics; success rate when crafting Pokéblocks increases by 60% (Teacher Lu’s secret recipe Pokéblocks, both affordable and filling!)】

【Random Purple Item * Fire Gem】

【Fire Gem: Contains abundant Fire-type energy, enhancing a Pokémon's perception of fire and increasing the power of Fire-type moves. (I won't tell you this is a one-time use item.)】

Looking at the reward for the million-view mission, Lu Ye’s expression was complicated.

“This random skill is actually quite good; after all, Pokéblocks have always been expensive.”

“But this Fire Gem… I really want to sell it for money!”

The system didn't say these items couldn't be sold.

However, Lu Ye, an anonymous seller, might run into trouble.

After a long pause, Lu Ye sighed.

“Never mind, Gastly also knows Will-O-Wisp. I'll just let it play with it.”

Gastly can absorb energy from matter, and such an energy-rich gem is the best supplement for it.

With the help of this Fire Gem, Gastly might further refine its mastery of Will-O-Wisp.

“…Why do I feel like I've taken another step towards becoming a Trainer?”

“No, I can't jinx myself.”

“Besides, I really can't afford to be a Trainer!”

A week had passed since the worldline shift.

Lu Ye had gained a deeper understanding of the Trainer profession.

If “high risk factor” was a defining characteristic, then “pay-to-win” was undoubtedly another!

Without spending millions, can you afford to raise a pseudo-legendary Pokémon?

Without spending tens of millions, are you fit to raise an Elite Four-level Pokémon?

To a certain extent, the amount spent and a Pokémon's strength are undoubtedly directly proportional.

Even with the system, Lu Ye wasn't confident he could genuinely raise a team of top-tier Pokémon.

Lu Ye had asked Red in the chat group about his Pokémon's monthly expenses.

【Teacher Lu: Boss Red, approximately how much does your team cost per month?】

【Battle-focused players: …Snorlax is a bit expensive, probably 2,000,000 per month.】

【Green: 2,000,000 is indeed not expensive.】

【Tokiwa Lilac: Ah Σ(°△°|||)︴, my monthly allowance is only 2,000!】

【Green: You're raising Raticate, Butterfree and such, so of course it's cheap to raise them.】

【Tokiwa Lilac: (○｀ 3′○)】

【Teacher Lu: 2,000,000 for a team?】

【Battle-focused players: No, that’s for one Snorlax. It costs 2,000,000 a month.】

Lu Ye immediately closed the chat group.

Listen to that, are those even human words?

Staying in a group with you rich folks, I feel a lot of pressure!

Putting down his phone, Red curiously asked Green, “Why did he suddenly ask that?”

Green: “He’s probably trying to calculate how much it would cost to raise a Gengar.”

Red: “How much did Old Lady Kikuko’s Gengar cost?”

Green: “Only fifty million, not much.”

Red: “Indeed.”

——

After class, Lu Ye returned to his rented apartment.

Besides feeding Gastly the Fire Gem,

Lu Ye also planned to study his newly acquired skill.

【Pokéblock Crafting Lv3: You can create high-quality Pokéblocks; are intimately familiar with all Berry types and their characteristics; success rate when crafting Pokéblocks increases by 60%】

Pokéblocks provide essential nutrients to Pokémon, and some Trainers selectively choose Pokéblocks.

For instance, Dragon Flame Berry Pokéblocks can boost a Pokémon's Special Attack, and Sand Scale Berry Pokéblocks can increase a Pokémon's Speed.

Pokéblocks significantly increase the nutritional efficiency of Berries, making their price relatively high.

As is well known, Pokéblocks are categorized into four qualities: Low, Medium, High, and Perfect.

“High-quality Pokéblocks, their market price must be in the tens of thousands, right?”

Lu Ye mumbled, “Or should I buy some Berries, turn them into Pokéblocks, and then sell them?”

Before he could finish, Lu Ye slapped himself.

“Can you show some ambition!” Lu Ye scoffed, “That small profit margin, you could earn more hustling for a night!”

“Ah, bah!”

“Am I the kind of person who relies on their looks to make a living?!”

Ultimately, to improve Gastly’s diet, Lu Ye decided to buy a machine.

A household Berry Blender was also sold online, priced at 10,000 per unit.

After confirming the order, Lu Ye was left with only about 5,000 yuan.

“Hiss~!” Lu Ye gasped, wincing in pain.

That night, a Machamp from the Same-City Logistics Company carried the Berry Blender on its shoulder up to the sixth floor, giving the landlord a huge fright.

The delivery guy said, “Bro, sign here.”

Lu Ye’s mouth twitched as he pointed at the waist-high package and asked, “Are you sure this thing is the household version?!”

“It’s the low-spec version,” the delivery guy chuckled awkwardly. “Completely understandable!”

The more integrated a machine, the more expensive it is; that’s an undeniable truth.

For 10,000 yuan, a household Berry Blender could only be this kind of old-fashioned model.

The deafening roar made the landlord mistakenly think Lu Ye was doing renovations.

Until half an hour later.

Lu Ye gazed at the sparkling, translucent block and swallowed.

【Pokéblock Crafting Lv3 Judgment—68! Crafting successful!】

【Oran Berry Pokéblock (High Quality): The most basic Pokéblock, restores a certain amount of a Pokémon’s HP. (Meet the rainbow, eat the rainbow!)】

Oran Berry’s flavor is complex, with sour, sweet, bitter, and astringent depending on luck, but its restorative effect is significant.

Gastly extended its scarlet tongue, deftly rolled the Pokéblock into its mouth, and immediately squinted its eyes.

“Hiss~~~Kek!”

Gastly: (′▽`〃)

That expression, as if experiencing first love, made Lu Ye a little curious.

“Is it really that delicious?”

Biting into a Pokéblock, a sweet and sour sensation instantly bloomed on his taste buds.

Before Lu Ye’s eyes, a golden wheat field seemed to appear, along with a girl wearing a straw hat, her long hair flowing, shyly turning around…

…revealing Gastly’s hideous ghostly face.

“Holy crap!”

“Hiss-Kek, hiss-Kek!”

Gastly happily flew circles around Lu Ye.

“Alright, stop bothering me, I’ll make you another one right away!”

Gastly: (´▽)
