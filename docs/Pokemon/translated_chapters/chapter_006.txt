Chapter 6: Great Mighty Dragon! Revered Ksitigarbha! (Please vote for me!)

Early Sunday morning, Lu Ye met his landlady, Sister Liu, who was collecting rent in the hallway.

“Ah, Little Lu, did you hear any strange noises last night?”

“Huh? I went to bed quite early yesterday. What kind of noises?”

“I’m not sure… many people in the complex said they encountered strange things. The lights in the hallway just wouldn’t turn on.”

“Our elevator clearly only has B1, but many tenants said they saw a B2 button…”

“It’s nothing, Sister Liu, maybe the light bulb is broken. I’ll go check it later,” Lu Ye said with a smile.

Sister Liu breathed a sigh of relief, comforted. She said softly, “I made fish head soup today. I’ll have Mime Jr. bring it over later.”

Lu Ye nodded, then halfway down the corridor, he reacted, his expression odd.

“Fish head soup… could it be Magikarp?!”

It was an old six-story building, and even the elevator was a freight elevator, so a short circuit in the wiring was normal.

Lu Ye arrived on the first floor, checking the electrical valve and replacing a light bulb.

“Strange, the light bulb was fine.”

Lu Ye scratched his head and, on a whim, stepped into the elevator.

The air in the dim freight elevator was damp, and mold grew over the sublet advertisements.

Below “B1” was a faded, unclear button – “B2”.

Lu Ye rubbed his eyes, but only the “B1” button appeared before him.

“Running into a ghost in broad daylight?” Lu Ye swallowed.

“System, how should I usually handle this kind of situation?”

【Recommended skill: Holy Light Lv1 requires BP: 2000, Smite Lv1 requires BP: 3000, Great Mighty Dragon Lv1 requires BP: 5000】

“You even have Smite and Great Mighty Dragon?!

“Forget it, now’s not the time to complain about this – can you suggest some skills I can actually afford?”

【Recommended skill: Spirit Vision Lv1 requires BP: 500】

【Spend 500 BP to unlock skill 'Spirit Vision Lv1'?】

“Make it quick, make it quick!”

【Remaining BP: 260】

【Spirit Vision Lv1: Enhances vision, with a small chance to see spiritual entities. (Your vision is extraordinary, but be careful, too much Spirit Vision is sometimes not a good thing…)】

Lu Ye didn't have time to think much, cautiously looking around. A drop of cold sweat trickled down his forehead.

“Nothing… at all?”

In the empty freight elevator, a cold wind swept through, carrying a musty smell. A dim, yellow incandescent light bulb creaked and groaned.

An old security guard outside the elevator yawned.

“Young man, you’ve been standing in there for ages… You’re not relieving yourself in there, are you?!”

Lu Ye left the elevator, his expression strange.

“Grandpa, are there any urban ghost stories around here?”

“Of course, my granddaughter told me about them.” The old man became interested. “She said there’s a Kuchisake-onna, who’s actually a Pokémon called Mawile.”

“And that Cat-faced Old Lady, guess what – Zoroark!”

“Hold on, grandpa.” Lu Ye’s face was odd. “Your granddaughter knows quite a lot!”

“That’s right, my granddaughter is an elite trainer!” The old man said proudly.

“I know you, kid, the tenant on the sixth floor. Haven’t seen you go out for half a month.”

“Look at you, so young, instead of becoming a trainer and making a name for yourself, you’re cooped up here being a small streamer, what’s the big idea!”

“Thanks for the kind words.” Lu Ye hastily retreated.

Walking to the Pokémon shop, Lu Ye recalled the scene from earlier.

“It shouldn’t be a supernatural event, just a Ghost-type Pokémon… that’s perfectly reasonable.”

Lu Ye was a staunch materialist.

As the saying goes, the Master did not speak of strange powers, chaotic spirits – and indeed, a Fighting-type Machamp would have a tough time against Ghost-types.

“At that time, I’ll ask the shop owner to find a few elite trainers to perform an exorcism, then it should be fine.”

He exhaled, calming himself, then opened Meituan to search for nearby businesses.

“For lunch, there’s a Kaiseki cuisine place here… Slowpoke tail sashimi, 3888 yuan a serving? Never mind that!”

“I should go buy Poké Balls first,” Lu Ye muttered. “There are a few Pokémon nurseries nearby, I can go check them out later.”

In the System Shop, a red-and-white Poké Ball cost 200 BP, which was a bit expensive.

In comparison, a Poké Ball in reality cost 500 yuan, making it seem much more affordable.

Arriving at the Pokémon shop, Lu Ye spent 2500 yuan to buy five Poké Balls, leaving him with 17000 yuan.

However, in the nursery, Lu Ye didn’t see the starter Pokémon he wanted.

“Eevee and Rockruff are very popular Pokémon,” the clerk said regretfully. “Even for pre-orders, you have to wait six months in advance.”

“It’s alright, I was just asking.”

Similar to expensive pets in his previous life, an Eevee cost 30,000 yuan, and a Rockruff was close to 50,000 yuan.

Lu Ye was truly short on cash.

Pokémon Eggs for Weedle and Wurmple were very cheap, two or three hundred yuan for one, and their potential was left to fate.

Bird Pokémon Eggs for Pidgey and Taillow were also for sale, around 2000 yuan.

But Lu Ye figured, instead of buying such common Pokémon, it would be more cost-effective to catch one himself in the wild.

“If you’re going to catch Pokémon yourself, please be sure to pay attention to safety,” the clerk said, sweating. “In recent years, there have been many news reports of accidental injuries.”

His plan to get an Eevee fell through, so Lu Ye could only return to his residence in resignation.

The sun set in the west, and a hazy dusk spread as a flock of Spearow flew across the sky, letting out hoarse cries.

“Gaa—!”

Lu Ye toyed with the miniature Poké Ball in his hand, then with a snap, held the enlarged Poké Ball in his palm, thoroughly enjoying himself.

He smoothly walked into the elevator, when a drop of cold sweat suddenly trickled down Lu Ye’s forehead.

“Oh no.”

The vision before him suddenly blurred, the style changing abruptly, as if someone had suddenly inverted the color palette of this world.

If he had to describe it, it was like a JoJo’s Bizarre Color Shift –

That row of elevator buttons was covered in terrifying green bloodstains.

The incandescent light bulb above his head shook wildly, emitting a screaming “creak,” its filament flickering violently, and finally, with a “hiss,” it went out.

In the dead silence, the smell of rotten mold filled his nostrils, and a damp, cold draft licked Lu Ye’s neck like a scarlet tongue.

Lu Ye shivered all over.

The automatically closing elevator door slowly opened after descending to the second basement floor.

【“Spirit Vision Lv1” Judgment – Great Success!】

Before Lu Ye’s eyes appeared a fluorescent green, visible like “Eagle Eye” vision.

At this point, Lu Ye had actually calmed down, raising his head expressionlessly.

A pair of bulging white eyeballs, a smile stretching to the ears, a scarlet tongue, and a long tongue.

Gastly suddenly approached, looking at Lu Ye like that, big eyes staring into small eyes for a minute.

“Click—”

A white light abruptly lit up.

Lu Ye lowered his head, his hands trembling, and sent a message to his live stream’s fan group.

“What do I do if I run into a ghost late at night? Online and urgent!”
