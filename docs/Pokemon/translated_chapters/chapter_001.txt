## Chapter 1: Sir, The Times Have Changed (Please vote!) 

“Ding-a-ling-ling—” 

Lu Ye opened his hazy eyes, stared at the ceiling, and let out a long yawn. 

“Another uneventful day.” 

It was the weekend, and the Pikachu alarm clock by his bed showed noon, but Lu Ye had only just woken up. 

He went to the washroom, and while waiting for the water to run, he took the opportunity to order takeout. 

“Dodrio Express, Pelipper Fresh… Haha, businesses are getting more creative with their names now.” 

Several newly opened shops had Pokémon-related names, which made Lu Ye feel especially fond. 

See? This is what you call the world's number one IP! (Tactical lean-back) 

Lu Ye didn't overthink it, casually ordering a “29.9 yuan Farfetch'd Shop Set Meal (includes free pancake)” and placed his phone aside to start washing up. 

“Splash! Whoosh—” 

He cupped some water and splashed it on his face. 

The reflection in the mirror was a tall, handsome, ancient Greek-style beautiful youth. 

The youth's hair was messy, and he had thick dark circles under his eyes, which only made his gaze seem deeper. 

It made one sigh, for handsome people, even dark circles looked like natural aegyo-sal. 

It was truly quite immersive. 

After washing up, Lu Ye returned to his rented cubicle and comfortably settled into his gaming chair. 

He turned on the computer, entered the password “Sakurajima Mai,” and the Pikachu animated screensaver immediately lit up. 

“Pika-chu (`)~!” 

Lu Ye skillfully opened Bilibili, looking for today's 'eating with' videos. 

As a freshman at Modu University and a part-time gaming UP Master on Bilibili, Lu Ye's main work on the platform was editing and commentating on Pokémon battles. 

With his unique style and professional knowledge, he had attracted nearly 100,000 followers. 

Although Lu Ye himself was a high-level player in game battles, having once reached the seventh-highest rank in the world, he was extremely unlucky, even having a famous incident of “Hydro Pump missing three times in a row.” 

This was why Lu Ye was always teased by his audience as being “eating with” (meaning his bad luck was entertaining to watch). 

Streaming while making videos— 

That's why Lu Ye rented a place outside of school, only going to campus for classes. 

“Huh?” 

Lu Ye browsed the homepage, muttering, “There are so many Pokémon content recommendations on the homepage today.” 

“Has Pokémon's popularity surged again?” 

Out of the ten recommended videos on the homepage, eight were actually related to Pokémon. 

[Bear Grylls: Look what we found, a wild Caterpie.] 

[Suggested change: Splash] 

[Hua Nong: My brother's berries are ripe, going up the mountain to pick some.] 

… 

“Today's homepage content isn't quite right.” 

“What's with the Caterpie? Protein is six times that of beef?” 

“And berries, it can't possibly be Oran Berries or Sitrus Berries, can it…?” 

Lu Ye scratched his head, completely bewildered, and turned to the gaming section, suddenly widening his eyes. 

The battle video he posted last night had actually shot straight to the top of the gaming section! 

Lu Ye swallowed hard and clicked on the video titled [Teacher Lu Teaches You Battle 03: Substitute-Protect-Toxic]. 

He took a deep breath. 

“Views, 1.2 million!?” 

WTF, I'm shattered! 

“Cover art is a notice of admission to a new school.” 

“Learned it, I'm going to challenge the Gym Leader with this.” 

“Please, just be a normal human!” 

After being stunned for a long time, Lu Ye happily scrolled through the bullet comments, but a hint of doubt arose in his mind. 

“Substitute-Protect-Toxic” was clearly a very basic tactic, so why did it suddenly become so popular? 

Could it be that some big shot in the gaming section decided to promote my video? 

But I haven't done any shady dealings recently. 

Rubbing his chin, Lu Ye scrolled down to the comment section. 

In the comment section, a level 6 certified account with the ID “Battle Person” meticulously explained the “Substitute-Protect-Toxic” tactic. 

[Battle Person: “Substitute-Protect-Toxic” refers to a tactic where Pokémon learn “Toxic,” “Substitute,” and “Protect,” and this combination forms the core of the strategy. 

In battles, trainers need extremely strong on-the-spot adaptability to skillfully utilize this tactic. 

Regarding the execution of this tactic, the UP Master has explained it very thoroughly. 

Grass-type and Poison-type trainers have a natural advantage and can diligently learn from this tutorial. 

Above all, thank you to the UP Master for such a high-quality tutorial! 

PS: It seems to have been posted in the wrong section; it would be better in the Battle section.] 

After reading this lengthy comment, a huge question mark appeared in Lu Ye's mind. 

What is the Battle section? 

When did Bilibili launch a “Battle” subsection? 

Replies below: “Master Ball capture,” “Holy crap, it's actually a real person!”, “Red, Mommy loves you!” 

Scratching his head, Lu Ye liked the “Battle Person” comment and then clicked on his homepage. 

Instantly, a drop of cold sweat trickled down Lu Ye's forehead. 

“Well-known UP Master in the Battle section, 9th Indigo League Champion, World Masters Tournament Champion…” 

Lu Ye stammered, unable to speak coherently. 

“R-Red!?” 

“You've got to be kidding, isn't Red the Battle Person from the Special manga, how could he be a Bilibili UP Master?!” 

He clicked on Red's image gallery, and there was a sunny-smiling young man of about twenty. 

He wore a red cap, a black vest over a red waistcoat, and a fluffy Pikachu stood on his shoulder. 

If it was cosplay, this was ten times more similar to the Red Lu Ye imagined! 

And this real-life Pikachu was incredibly cute, exactly like the one in “Detective Pikachu”! 

Lu Ye was utterly dumbfounded. 

“Don't panic when things happen, calm down, calm down!” 

“The sequence of events is that I woke up this morning, found my video suddenly went viral, and a big shot appeared in the comment section.” 

“The big shot is a world champion, the protagonist from the Pokémon world, Red.” 

“Ha! Doesn't that make everything clear?!” 

“…Clear my butt!” 

“Did I transmigrate, or is this world messed up?” 

“Could it be a worldline convergence, and Red has even come to be an UP Master?!” 

Lu Ye was professionally trained; no matter how absurd something was, he could accept it. 

But this… 

Just as Lu Ye's brain crashed, the phone suddenly rang. 

“Hello, your takeout has arrived. Please come to the window to pick it up.” 

“Oh, okay.” 

Lu Ye walked to the window, then suddenly remembered this was the sixth floor. 

Sixth floor asking me to come to the window to pick it up, are you planning to send a Pidgeotto to deliver my meal!? 

Suddenly, a dark shadow flashed by, and a brightly colored, gracefully crested large bird landed at the window, its long beak holding a package bag, smiling and waving its wings at Lu Ye. 

Lu Ye was dumbfounded. 

The delivery person shouted from downstairs. 

“Remember to leave a good review, dear!” 

Lu Ye had already forgotten how he took the takeout from Pidgeotto's mouth. 

He only remembered flocks of Pidgey flying across the sky outside the window, Oddish toddling in the flowerbeds of the community downstairs, a Rapidash leaving a graceful figure on the elevated road. 

His landlady, leading an orange-furred, black-striped Growlithe, walked past in the community, smiling and waving at Lu Ye. 

“The Pokémon world, merged with reality…” 

Lu Ye was stunned for a long time, then looked up at the sky, feeling a little moist around his eyes. 

Eighteen years, a full eighteen years. 

I finally waited for this day!
