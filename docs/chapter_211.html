<p>Chapter 311: What is This Dark, Grimy Thing? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>“Haha, this FUZE is so satisfying! I declare this my main Operator!”</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was also exhilarated. At first, he felt his Operator was a bit clumsy. It ran slow, and its shield seemed a bit weak compared to the Flash Shield and Large Shield that other Operators had as skills. But he didn’t expect his skill to be so potent; a series of thumps against the wall, and the enemies were sent flying. The damage was unbeatable! The game experience was superb!</p>
<p>“Gather up! Gather up! Let's form a Thomas Train! Old Zhang, cover our rear, don't let anyone backstab us!” At this moment, as a professional counter-terrorism captain, Song Ren immediately issued the command.</p>
<p>The opposing team had clearly started rotating back from the Gym, Laundry Room, and Side Warehouse. Since everyone was still new to the game, most of the room walls were either reinforced or left untouched. No one thought of breaking down walls that obstructed rotations to allow for better team support. So, after the distress call, his other teammates were only just arriving.</p>
<p>Da-da-da-da-da-da...</p>
<p>A volley of gunfire, but against the Large Shield at the front, these bullets inflicted no damage whatsoever. Wang Yifan felt a little flustered seeing the glass on the Large Shield cracking, but as the enemies fired frantically, he calmed down. The Large Shield only <em>looked</em> like it was about to shatter, but in reality, it was incredibly sturdy, showing no signs of breaking. And he didn't even need to drop his shield and counter-attack with a pistol. His teammates behind him would occasionally seize an opportunity to peek out, using him as mobile cover to shoot.</p>
<p>The only thing that bothered Wang Yifan was that he had to keep pressing the button for the Large Shield, otherwise it would retract. His hand was starting to ache.</p>
<p>“Go, go, go! Form a triangle! Large Shield covers the front, Flash Shield covers the flank, Old Zhang, play freely, Joey, you too, play freely!” Song Ren laughed heartily, then arrived at the bomb site and deployed the defuser. All that was left was to wait for time to run out. The five of them huddled together at the bomb site, leaning against the wall to the left of the large Garage. It was a perfect corner, with IQ and Sledge, who had no defensive abilities, sandwiched safely in the middle.</p>
<p>The Large Shield faced the Laundry Room and the Central Kitchen stairs, which was the enemy's main firing position. The Flash Shield faced the Small Garage, preventing anyone from sneaking in from the Gym for a pick. Meanwhile, FUZE, holding his shield as his primary weapon, faced outwards, concerned about enemies flanking from outside. Although if defending players ran outside the defense zone, attacking players would be alerted to their position, the area directly above the Garage was a restaurant, and players could jump down from its windows. If a defender subtly moved to the second floor and suddenly dropped down, such a surprise attack could genuinely break their Thomas Train Iron Barrel Formation, so constant vigilance was required.</p>
<p>“We got this!” Song Ren exclaimed, beaming.</p>
<p>“Old Song, I think our match is being broadcast!” Wang Yifan suddenly noticed something.</p>
<p>“Broadcast? What's going on!?” Song Ren was a little confused. Rainbow Six Siege didn’t have a spectator system like Warcraft, or perhaps it hadn’t been activated yet! There was no such thing as broadcasting top-tier matches.</p>
<p>“It’s being broadcast within the Internet Cafe! A prompt just popped up, saying we were chosen as lucky customers and got a fifty percent discount,” Wang Yifan said.</p>
<p>“You mean everyone in the Internet Cafe can see our brilliant plays!?” Zhang Yi and the others were stunned. The fight had been too intense; unlike Wang Yifan, who was pushing forward with a shield, they hadn't even noticed.</p>
<p>“Ugh, so annoying! Soon, people will probably be asking us for game tips,” Song Ren sighed dramatically, though he was secretly delighted.</p>
<p>Song Ren was indeed right about that, because their gameplay had attracted the attention of other players waiting for spots outside their private room. In the main hall, a crowd of people was utterly entertained.</p>
<p>‘This group really has some skill!’</p>
<p>‘Yeah! And that Large Shield, it's practically invincible!’</p>
<p>‘I wonder when there'll be a spot. I really want to play!’</p>
<p>‘Don't even think about it for now. I've been to all the other Internet Cafes, and there are no spots anywhere. Might as well sate my craving by watching this big screen.’</p>
<p>‘Looks like this round is already won!’</p>
<p>‘Yeah, the defenders only have three people left, and they don't have any grenades either. Guns can't even scratch the shield!’</p>
<p>Not just the ordinary players outside the Internet Cafe, but even Song Ren inside the game felt that victory was assured.</p>
<p>Several people had already started boasting.</p>
<p>“This is what you call professional! Without a doubt, we are a professional team!”</p>
<p>“Exactly, no need to trade fire with them. We'll just hide behind our shields and let them shoot all they want.”</p>
<p>“But we need to pay attention. When the bomb defusal countdown is almost over, they'll probably make a desperate push.”</p>
<p>“Don't worry, if they dare to come, we’ll make sure they die!”</p>
<p>Song Ren's side was filled with cheerful laughter.</p>
<p>The defenders, on the other hand, felt a sense of despair. Their voice channel had already devolved into finger-pointing.</p>
<p>“Ah! My bad, I just fed them directly,” said the Doctor who had been blown up by FUZE’s Cluster Charge.</p>
<p>“What now? Should we rush them?” Rook, holding an MP5, sounded frustrated. This tactic was simply disgusting. The Large Shield took no damage at all! And time was almost up.</p>
<p>“I wish I had placed my Tripwire in the Garage,” the Tripwire Operator muttered, annoyed.</p>
<p>“It’s alright, there’s still a chance.” But at this moment, Bandit on the defending team noticed a detail. Before this, facing the attacking Large Shield, both Tripwire and Rook had brought Impact Grenades, which explode on impact, dealing damage. The Chicago Mansion map was also a somewhat special map, as most of its structure consisted of wooden boards, and wooden boards could be destroyed in the game.</p>
<p>“You two keep taking turns shooting to draw their fire, whether we succeed or not depends on this one move of mine!” With only a few seconds left until the explosion, Bandit started running towards the Central Kitchen stairs, heading to the second floor. Rook and the Tripwire Operator also fired wildly, drawing Song Ren's team's attention.</p>
<p>“The gunfire has already died down.”</p>
<p>“But this timer is a bit slow!”</p>
<p>“It should be, after all, attacking is too easy in this game, they have to give the defenders some hope.”</p>
<p>Song Ren and his friends were chattering happily, completely oblivious to the danger that was quietly approaching.</p>
<p>Bandit, who had now reached the first-floor restaurant, was also a bit nervous. He wasn't sure if it would work. Because he had just discovered something: the ceiling of the Garage had been blown open. And right above Song Ren's team was the restaurant. This meant that the Garage was visible from the restaurant.</p>
<p>The entire map of Rainbow Six Siege was three-dimensional. Coupled with the fact that his Operator, upon spawning, had chosen a gadget called a Remote Charge. Anyone who played FPS games would know exactly what that thing was. Its power was notoriously immense! He just wasn't sure how effective it would be in Rainbow Six Siege. But right now, it was the only method he could think of.</p>
<p>“Shoot! Cover my footsteps and draw their attention!” Bandit yelled into the voice channel. The next moment, Rook and Tripwire fired frantically, switching to pistols when their rifles ran out of bullets. Meanwhile, Bandit on the second floor had quietly made his way to the ceiling.</p>
<p>As qualified FPS gamers, Song Ren's five-man team fully demonstrated one trait: they never looked up. Taking a deep breath, Bandit didn’t choose to shoot people, but instead pulled out his Remote Charge and dropped it from the gaps in the rebar on the second floor.</p>
<p>Song Ren and his bragging teammates watched as a dark, square object, making a beeping sound, fell from above. It landed perfectly in the center of their group.</p>
<p>“What the heck is this dark, grimy thing?”</p>
