Chapter 792: The Bloody Case Triggered by a Single Chicken

Recalling the scene of being hacked to death by villagers just moments ago, Song Ren felt a sliver of confusion about his life.

Wasn't the legendary Dragonborn life supposed to be starting soon?

How did he end up getting torn apart by villagers just for killing a fat chicken?

Song Ren wasn't the only one in a bewildered state; many players of `The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim` committed the same ‘unforgivable’ sin, just like him.

That is, killing the big fat chicken in Riverwood, and being forced to surrender their first life to the wrathful villagers.

On the forums, Dragonborn who died because of a chicken were wailing, sharing their experiences on chicken killing.

Like most games, `The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim` was released and launched, drawing in a large number of players immediately.

Some players were deaf to the outside world, focused solely on playing the game.

Some believed themselves exceptionally talented and aimed specifically for the event prize money.

But there were also players who preferred an atmosphere of discussion and exchange.

They didn't care much about game progress, but rather would play while posting on forums and Tieba, interacting with like-minded players about their in-game experiences.

Although it was a single-player game, these players managed to create a feeling akin to `World of Warcraft`'s joint dungeon pioneering, which was quite remarkable.

In the past, players mostly discussed plot points, BOSS strategies, or discovered hidden items and quests.

But in `The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim`, everyone's discussion revolved more around a single chicken.

‘Oh my god, I killed a chicken at the start, and the people of Riverwood immediately chased me down! It’s insane!’

‘Haha, me too! I saw that chicken, so big and fat, I couldn’t resist giving it a kick, and then the whole village hunted me down.’

‘I didn’t die facing the Imperial executioners, I narrowly escaped the attack of evil dragons, in dark dungeons I fought Imperial soldiers, slayed frost spiders, and bravely battled giant brown bears, but I never expected to be beaten to death by angry villagers with random sticks because of a chicken!’

‘Newbies, don't believe these people. Killing the Riverwood chicken drops an early-game artifact. These guys are ill-intentioned; you absolutely must kill the chicken when you go to Riverwood!’

‘Exactly, killing the chicken drops equipment and skill books!’

‘Did everyone go to Riverwood? Haha, I didn't go to Riverwood. I plan to run straight to Solitude and join the Imperial Legion!’

‘Didn’t go to Riverwood either, just wandered around aimlessly. There are so many books in the game describing the world’s background; it feels so rich. I plan to be a bard and specialize in finding these books….’

Many players discussed the game's content and experiences. Initially, everyone was talking about the bloody incident caused by the fat chicken in Riverwood.

But as the discussion continued, the topic quickly shifted to other aspects of the game.

Compared to `The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim` in his previous life, Chen Xu had made many modifications.

Aside from not yet releasing the relevant MOD tools and corresponding skeleton module permissions, Chen Xu directly added content like the `Dawnguard` and `Dragonborn` DLCs, as well as `Hearthfire`, which allowed for home management, directly into the base game.

Furthermore, compared to the original, the content of Skyrim was enriched. In the wilderness, beyond just wolves, there would be more wild animals.

There would also occasionally be more battles between the Stormcloaks and the Imperial army in the wilderness.

In some remote areas, the chance of dragons appearing was also not low.

In `The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim`, players do not embody a specific person.

One could say this was the most essential part of `The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim`.

Because it was a game that truly allowed players to live a free life.

`Red Dead Redemption` tells the story of Arthur Morgan and John Marston.

`The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild` tells the story of Link.

`The Witcher: Wild Hunt` tells the story of Geralt of Rivia.

And `The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim` is where players write their own adventure story as the Dragonborn.

It could be a great hero saving the world, a notorious outlaw bandit terrorizing a region, a bard freely roaming Skyrim, or a killer assassin walking in the shadows.

What kind of life it is, that is for the player to write.

………………

“This is Whiterun! It’s a world of difference from Riverwood; this is the distinction between a small county town and a metropolis!”

Standing on the mountaintop, Song Ren gazed at the magnificent Whiterun in the distance, sighing with emotion.

After suffering a setback in Riverwood, Song Ren heeded the advice and became an honest person. However, unlike some players who ignored the main quest and started wandering around, he was still diligently progressing through the main storyline.

Because so far, he hadn't grasped many of the game’s mechanics; in a way, the main quest served as a tutorial for players.

After his感慨, Song Ren confirmed the destination's location, turned around, and began carefully hopping down the cliff face, in the opposite direction of the mountain path.

As a gamer playing an open-world game, how could he possibly stick to the game’s designated paths?

Who follows the main roads when playing `Red Dead Redemption` in the wilderness?

Don't people always cut through the sides of the roads?

When playing `The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild`, don't people just climb mountains directly and then glide with a paraglider?

The great literary figure Mr. Lu Xun once said, ‘Actually, there were no roads on the earth; when many people walked, it became a road.’

The same applies to games. When many people walk, doesn't it become a path?

Isn’t that common sense?

What proper gamer walks obediently?

Song Ren carefully made his jumps, as `The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim` still had fall damage. Although he didn't know whether the Dragonborn’s bone density was harder than a Witcher’s, falling from such a high cliff would likely be fatal for anyone except the Azure Star.

Paying a little attention to his landing spots, Song Ren quickly hopped down the mountain. In the distance were Whiterun’s city walls, the river encircling the city, and a suspension bridge. On the outskirts were vast fields, rural houses, and cattle and sheep pens.

However, before Song Ren could immerse himself in the scenery around Whiterun, a giant in the distance caught his attention.

An archer and two melee warriors were battling a four or five-meter-tall giant wielding a spiked club.

“Don’t panic, let the great Dragonborn come and help—!”

Seeing this scene, Song Ren immediately got excited, drew his sword, and rushed towards the battle. But before he could get close, the giant was already defeated.

Looking at the giant’s corpse on the ground, Song Ren clicked his tongue and corrected himself.

“Let me help you collect the bodies!”

Approaching the corpse on the ground, Song Ren searched it. Apart from the arrows stuck in the giant, not a single hair dropped. It looked so big, but it was so stingy?

Song Ren was speechless.

After exchanging a few words with the surrounding warriors, Song Ren learned their origins. They belonged to a faction called The Companions.

“They feel a bit like mercenaries. Could this be an organization for warriors to learn skills?”

After a simple exchange and learning some basic information, Song Ren speculated. After all, in `The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim`, skills weren't learned through leveling up.

Seeing a new quest for The Companions appear in his directory, Song Ren decided not to do it for now. His goal was still the main quest.

And compared to this quest, which seemed warrior-focused, he actually wanted to be a Mage Lord. After all, from games like `World of Warcraft`, he had gained valuable experience: warriors were poor guys, while Mage Lords were tall, rich, and handsome.

Song Ren didn't dwell on The Companions but continued exploring towards Whiterun.

As for the sheep, cows, and chickens raised by the nearby farmhouses, Song Ren didn't even dare to look at them. The consequences of taking down the fat chicken in Riverwood were still vivid in his memory.
