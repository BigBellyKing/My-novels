## Chapter 560: The Unique Characteristic of Platformer Games (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)

Not only Xiaojie, but many players quickly discovered its unique characteristics after playing for a while.

If one were to judge Super Mario Maker based on first impressions alone, the overwhelming majority of players would share the same thought:

This is a very harmonious and family-friendly game suitable for all ages. And indeed, that is the case, even though it has just launched.

According to internal data from Nebula Games, the number of underage players in Super Mario Maker is second only to Minecraft, making it an unmistakable 'younger audience' game.

However, due to the Versus Mode setting and the trait where only the first-place player earns points, many players initially didn't grasp the deeper mechanics. But as their understanding of the game grew, they discovered numerous opportunities to be... Idiot-ish.

In the previous life, there was a joke describing the multiplayer players of Super Mario Maker:

"Any player who still retains a shred of humanity won't reach S+ rank or become a red-named player."

If S-rank and above players were to be executed by firing squad, not a single S+ player would be innocent, while red-named players would require four shots—because the first three bullets would be blocked by the other three players they'd use as human shields.

Although Super Mario Maker hasn't been out for long—let alone seen any red-named players—the potential for Idiot-ish behavior is already fully present.

Some levels require obtaining a key and defeating the BOSS to meet the clearance conditions. At this point, certain players with Idiot-ish tendencies begin walking the capitalist path, camping at the door to steal the fruits of other Wage earners' labor. It's enough to bring tears to one's eyes, and this is just the most basic form of Idiot behavior.

On some maps, after opening the door, if players have items like springs, P-Switch, or Bob-ombs, they can block the door and pipes. Unless these items are refreshed, other players can't proceed further, effectively disqualifying them from the match.

All sorts of Idiot operations are showcased through videos and live streaming platforms, not to mention firsthand experiences from the perspective of Victims. It's left all players stunned.

Online, more and more discussions about Super Mario Maker are emerging.

While diving deep into Versus Mode reveals the Idiot side of many players, the game's cooperation mode and map-making features also provide a relaxing and enjoyable experience for others.

Both Regular players and veteran players can find joy in it.

A simple platformer game, yet filled with a rich variety of Gameplay.

Thanks to Super Mario Maker, the somewhat fading platformer genre has reignited some sparks.

Platforming games do have significant limitations, however.

It's challenging to create big titles in this genre due to constraints in game content. Every game requires a fundamental element: a complete progression system.

This progression system isn't necessarily the Numerical Design found in RPGs but rather a sense of player feedback.

In traditional FPS games, each round's kills, victories, and accumulated in-game economy serve as progression feedback.

Or, in games without an economy system, simply tallying enemy kills and headcounts functions as progression.

In RTS games, producing Unit types, Peasants mining resources, or Galgame affection mechanics—all these systems serve as progression elements.

This system isn't always explicitly numerical. Some games use subtle methods to provide player feedback on their experience.

Even story-driven games like Uncharted, which lack Skills, rely on advancing the story as a progression element.

Platformers naturally possess this trait.

Due to the inherent Gameplay of platformers, if action or Numerical Design isn't incorporated, the best way to provide player feedback is through progressively difficult Level Design as the game advances.

As the saying goes: Why climb Mount Everest? Because it's there.

Challenging difficulty and surpassing one's limits to grow stronger is a universal instinct—though everyone's pain tolerance varies.

Souls-like games are a prime example.

For platformers, gradually increasing level difficulty is their defining characteristic.

But compared to traditional AAA games, platformers face a major issue in scale: they can't rely on Numerical Design for Level Design.

They must rely solely on map design adjustments, which is why many platformers introduce Saves mid-level.

Without Saves, platformers would turn into games like The one with the big hammer—pure torment.

Imagine if Super Mario didn't have distinct levels and instead forced players to restart from 1-1 every time they saw "YOU DIED." Wouldn't that drive anyone mad?

Super Mario Maker, however, addresses this flaw in platformers with an entirely different approach.

Platformers struggle to achieve big titles?

Then don't aim for big titles—win with quantity instead.

By allowing players to create their own maps using various items and incorporating multiplayer mode, these maps form a perfect cycle of content.

In essence, the fun of Super Mario Maker is symbiotic. Without enough player-created maps, the game would lose its freshness—the most terrifying prospect for a platformer.

Games like Rainbow Six Siege and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare retain freshness despite players using the same firearms every match because each round's opponents and luck create unique scenarios.

But platformers revolve around levels. Even in multiplayer versus, beyond all the Idiot antics, the core is still platforming.

Once a map is memorized, even the least skilled player could complete it blindfolded after hundreds of attempts.

Super Mario Maker's model completely mitigates this flaw, ensuring players encounter fresh, never-before-seen maps every match.

Combined, these two modes function like a perpetual motion machine—self-sustaining and endlessly engaging.
