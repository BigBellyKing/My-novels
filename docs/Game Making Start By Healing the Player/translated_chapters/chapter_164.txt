Chapter 163: The Unknown is the Scariest (Fifth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

It was as if the previous actions were repeating, advancing little by little.

But there seemed to be something different. Li Yue always felt that the lights ahead had grown dimmer, though he wasn't sure if it was just an illusion.

He also heard hollow rustling sounds from an unknown source, along with a grating, teeth-chattering squeak. Walking down the corridor, Li Yue felt as if someone was quietly following behind him, whispering in his ear.

'Ghosts ahead, ghosts behind, ghosts above—this room is full of ghosts!'

'But I just don't know when, or from where, they'll pop out.'

The first half of the corridor was exactly the same as before, but upon reaching the radio, two cockroaches suddenly dropped from above, making Li Yue pause. The ceiling lamp, without any wind, creaked with a teeth-grinding sound. He could see the railing of the second floor from here, so could it be…

Li Yue felt goosebumps erupt all over his body. He took a deep breath and looked up at the second floor.

However…

The second floor was just a pitch-black expanse; there was nothing but the railing. Seeing this, Li Yue let out a sigh, but the taut string in his heart remained completely unrelaxed. For a moment, he had even genuinely hoped to see a monster, which would at least give him some sense of what he was dealing with.

Slowly walking forward, he reached the door at the end. Li Yue reached out to open it. But the door seemed to be locked. Li Yue twisted the doorknob twice, but it only made a clicking sound and wouldn't open. 

"Not letting me go further? Do I have to go back?"

'Thump-thump-thump!'

Just as Li Yue was pondering, a sudden banging sound came from the door around the corner. The previously silent environment was abruptly broken by this violent banging, startling Li Yue. This was, however, a normal human reaction.

He walked to the door, and the monster inside seemed to have noticed someone at the entrance, as it stopped banging. Silence returned, just like before.

"If you have the guts to bang on the door, open it!"

Li Yue tried twisting the doorknob, but it remained locked as before. Clearly, this wasn't the right path. At this point, Li Yue was growing increasingly nervous; unconsciously muttering to himself in response to the game's situations was the best proof of this.

Continuing back down the corridor, Li Yue noticed a fallen photo on the floor in front of the digital clock. It was very blurry, and he couldn't make out what was written on it. Instinctively, Li Yue crouched down to get a clearer look, and then three lines of text appeared on the previously blurry photo.

【Can you hear my voice?】【Can you decipher this message?】【If you come find me, I will wait for you forever.】

'Creak…'

After reading these three lines, just as he stood up from the floor, Li Yue heard the sound of a door opening. Connecting this with the three lines on the photo, his heart began to pound rapidly.

The door opened!

Could it be the door that was being banged on earlier? Did the monster inside get out? With this speculation, Li Yue gathered his courage and returned to the corridor. However, the path was uneventful, with no sudden scares at all.

But just like before, the more uneventful it was, the more nervous Li Yue became. The door around the corner remained closed; only the door leading to the basement stairs had opened again. Continuing forward, he opened the basement door, and as Li Yue expected, behind it was the same long corridor he started in.

But this time it was different. The beginning seemed no different from before, but upon reaching the corner, a series of urgent knocking sounds rang out, followed by the cry of a baby coming from inside the closed room. 

"Don't… don't tell me that door can be opened now!" Li Yue's scalp tingled.

However, trying again, it was still tightly locked. Advancing once more, it was another new cycle.

"Please, I beg you, whatever you are, just come out! Even if you just scare me!"

Li Yue was utterly spooked. No game had ever made him feel so oppressed. Even now, not a single unsettling scene had appeared. But that terror lingered in his heart, refusing to dissipate.

Strictly speaking, from the moment he entered the game until now, all he had done was walk around this corridor, from the entrance to the end, and then repeat. At most, there were some different sound effects in between. Yet, this extremely monotonous scene brought him immense psychological pressure.

This was a very clever psychological suggestion, keeping you constantly in fear. Imagine a bizarre corridor where you are the only one awake, experiencing a supernatural loop. Slowly, strange things happen, letting you know that you are not alone in this room—or perhaps you are the only human. Surprised? Unexpected?

The crucial point is that you don't even know what these 'people' sharing the room with you are like. Human imagination is boundless, and because of this, the unknown is the most terrifying. In typical horror games, the horror point is like a bullet already fired; when the bullet hits you, you scream in pain.

But for the `Silent Hill` series, horror is like a cloth-covered time bomb. You can hear the ticking, but you never know when the bomb will explode, challenging your endurance step by step, gradually raising your blood pressure and accelerating your heartbeat!

………………

Outside the Research Institute, relevant technicians were real-time monitoring Li Yue's data.

"Heart rate and blood pressure are up again!"

"Still some distance from the safety threshold."

Relevant technical personnel and medical staff were observing in real-time based on Li Yue's current physical data. Ye Xun and Tao Fa, standing nearby, exchanged glances and silently swallowed their saliva.

As testers themselves, they knew what those data points meant. How long had it been? Ten minutes? How could he be this scared? What was in this game?

Because the testers needed to remain unfamiliar with the test content, they could only see Li Yue's data; the content of the test DEMO was completely invisible to them. Meanwhile, in another room, a group of designers sat. Some of the more timid ones had unconsciously huddled next to their colleagues.

Chen Xu glanced at Meng Zuo next to him and subtly shuffled a bit to the right. At this moment, one of the designers in the crowd finally couldn't hold back and spoke up: "Um, could you turn on the lights for us? It's too dark, and it's a bit hard to see."

Once someone started, others quickly followed.

"Yeah! Turn on the lights, please. The room lights are too dim; it's bad for our eyes."

"Exactly, exactly, that makes sense."

"Also, I think the air conditioner can be turned off. Is anyone else cold?"

"Yeah, yeah, it's only May; there's no need for air conditioning!"

Watching the `Silent Hill PT` screen synchronized with the tester on the large screen, the designers in the room started chatting amongst themselves, looking for topics. Meng Zuo, especially, was incredibly grateful at this moment. He seriously doubted if he would have been scared senseless if this VR equipment could be experienced by designers as well.

Other game designers felt the same way. One thing they had to admit was that the `Silent Hill PT` before their eyes could only be described as stunning. Even though no jump scare had appeared yet, the game's atmosphere, created by the visuals, lighting, and sound effects, had already plunged people into deep fear. What would it be like when the actual scare points appeared?

They were just watching, not even the VR version, and watching as a group, yet they already felt a sensation called fear. What must the tester, who was actually experiencing it, be feeling?
