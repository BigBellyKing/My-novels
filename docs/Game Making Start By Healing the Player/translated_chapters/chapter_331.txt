Chapter 330: I'm Seriously Blowing Up Veteran Difficulty! (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)

Zhang Yi, having survived the ordeal, let out a long breath.

Although he knew it was all pre-programmed in the game,

he still felt a strange sense of emotion.

Even though it was just a short Prologue level, and he had been killed multiple times in a row,

enduring the repeated display of iconic quotes, Zhang Yi couldn't deny—he was absolutely thrilled.

It wasn't just the game's layered tension, the whistling bullets, and the explosive atmosphere

that impressed him.

More importantly, this game made him feel a genuine connection and bond with the NPC teammates around him.

In previous games, NPC teammates were nothing more than simple Tool-men,

leaving him completely indifferent.

But in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, thanks to powerful atmosphere creation, realistic graphics,

and the NPCs' remarkably high AI performance, Zhang Yi truly felt like he was Soap,

that he wasn't separated from Price, Gaz, and the others.

It was as if he had truly become a member of the SAS.

Here, Captain Price would save him in moments of peril, teaching him the survival rules of the battlefield.

Here, teammate Griggs would Cover the Rear, freeing him from worry.

Here, Gaz would provide cover fire, helping him deal with enemies more effectively.

Here, no one would abandon their teammates.

This feeling made Zhang Yi believe these NPC teammates were flesh-and-blood individuals, not mere tools.

At least based on current performance, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was undoubtedly the most震撼ing game he had ever played.

No exceptions!

This feeling became even stronger upon entering the second mission, titled "Blackout."

Though the veteran difficulty was genuinely tough.

After dying several times in a row,

Zhang Yi quickly gathered some experience.

Enemy marksmanship and firepower were extremely accurate.

Attempting to charge forward head-on was practically impossible.

Cover was an extremely important element in this game.

Once out of cover, enemies would open fire within a second or two—deadly accurate, each one performing like a professional player.

Don't get greedy with shooting. Use cover to eliminate enemies.

Of course, there was a slightly exploitative tactic: move forward slowly and deliberately. When your teammates detect no action from you, they'll advance ahead and assist in taking down enemies.

However, this method was significantly slower than player-driven efficiency.

After all, despite the realism, it was still the player playing the game—NPCs couldn't be expected to eliminate every enemy entirely on their own.

Though some players genuinely wished that were the case.

As for why NPCs in this game exhibited such high AI performance, it was intentional on Chen Xu's part.

This design choice was made specifically to help players better feel the reliability of their teammates,

thereby fostering deeper recognition and emotional attachment to these NPC characters.

In his previous life, players developed deep emotional bonds with the members of SAS and later Task Force 141

not only because Call of Duty: Modern Warfare wasn't a single-protagonist game,

but more importantly, because it gave players a powerful sense of immersion.

During missions, the casual banter and interactions, along with the then-groundbreaking AI isolation,

made players realize these NPC teammates were actually helpful—unlike other games where they were mere decorative accessories.

Whether an NPC teammate was a hindrance or a helper greatly influenced players' feelings toward them.

Take Ashley from Resident Evil 4, for example—a clear negative portrayal. "Obstacle Li," causing trouble and failing at everything!

Or Sheva from Resident Evil 5, basically a silly doll—giving her herbs was like tossing them into a trash can.

On the other hand, characters like Elizabeth from The Last of Us and BioShock Infinite

allowed players to tangibly feel the help these NPCs provided, beyond just story importance.

Though admittedly, their attractiveness and gender played a big role.

But did Call of Duty: Modern Warfare need that?

Absolutely not!

In Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, every player could feel the tangible assistance from these NPCs,

leading to genuine recognition and emotional bonds.

"Captain, I've made it! The rest is up to you!"

In-game Zhang Yi performed a quick sprint and sliding attack, then skillfully dropped flat to the ground.

Amidst the hail of bullets and explosions, listening to Soap's heavy breathing and staring at the blood-red screen,

he eagerly watched Captain Price, Gaz, and Russian援军 Kamarov take down the remaining enemies.

"NICE! Captain, what amazing marksmanship!"

"Awesome shot, Gaz, bro! That was perfect!"

"Kamarov, do you know Fuze? His explosives are pretty intense too!"

"Let's go, brothers! I'll Cover the Rear."

Entering the second half of this mission, it became a standard CQB level—Close Quarters Battle, indoor combat.

The player, as Soap and Captain Price, briefly assisted Kamarov and learned from him the location where Nikolai was being held.

The area was pitch-black, evoking the same feeling as playing Rainbow Six Siege—

except you couldn't demolish the house.

Team members advanced cautiously.

Breaching the door, clearing tripwire bombs on the floor.

Zhang Yi stayed crouched at the back of the formation the entire time, occasionally shouting "NICE!" to cheer on Captain Price.

He had no choice—earlier, he tried to steal credit by rushing to the front.

But because he failed to check a corner, he was instantly eliminated in one second, forced to watch the iconic quote screen again.

That taught him a lesson: if it's not your job, don't take the credit.

At that moment, a private voice message came through. After answering, Song Ren's voice suddenly rang out.

"Bro, how far have you gotten? This game is insane! The atmosphere in the second mission is fully dialed up—especially the Russian army vs. armed militants battle in the mountains. It's incredible!" Without spoilers, Song Ren expressed his excitement.

"Me? I'm on the second mission too, almost finished. By the way, what difficulty are you playing on?" Zhang Yi replied.

"Regular. Why?" asked Song Ren.

Hearing this, Zhang Yi paused for a moment. "I suggest you try veteran difficulty. Because veteran difficulty is where the real fun begins! I'm seriously blowing up veteran difficulty!

On this setting, you'll experience a completely different feeling—deeper immersion, especially that sensation of entrusting your life to your comrades. It's amazing, I'm seriously blowing it up! Plus, you'll learn a lot of knowledge."

After speaking, Zhang Yi hung up and quietly switched the game difficulty back to 【Regular】.

Although every word was heartfelt—he truly believed veteran difficulty was amazing, and he could still progress under that mode—

he still wanted to feel more involved.

Because on veteran difficulty, he felt like a group of god-tier teammates dragging along one pig teammate.

And he was that pig.

On the other end of the call, Song Ren was confused.

"Completely different experience on veteran? Entrusting your life to teammates? That sounds so mystical. And learning knowledge from a game? What's Old Zhang talking about?" Song Ren muttered to himself.

Still, when he reached the third mission, he switched the difficulty from Regular to Veteran.

He couldn't help it—he was curious.
