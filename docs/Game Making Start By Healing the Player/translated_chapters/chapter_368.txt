Chapter 367: Big Brother Dutch with Many Plans (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Carrying his curiosity, Old Dai continued to play the game.

Inside a makeshift base.

A woman named Abigail asked Arthur to go find her husband, John Marston.

Finding someone in the icy wilderness was no easy task.

But Abigail and John Marston were the only couple in the gang, and they also had a child: Little Jack.

So, facing Abigail's request, Arthur was very resistant at first, completely unwilling to go save John Marston, who was also a gang member. This made Old Dai a bit curious: did Arthur have a grudge against John Marston?

However, Arthur eventually agreed to Abigail's request, and a man named Javier from the gang accompanied him.

On the way, Arthur and Javier searched for John Marston, chatting about everything that had happened in Blackwater Town.

Through their conversation, Arthur also learned about some past events.

In the original plan, Dutch and his crew would have made an astronomical sum after this job, but it clearly failed in the end.

And during their escape, in order to get away smoothly, Dutch even cruelly murdered an innocent woman.

Now, not only had they failed, but they had also lost several gang members and were being pursued by Pinkerton Agents, forced to hide in these snow-covered deep mountains and old forests to lay low for a while.

There were no explosions or gunfights, but the magnificent snowy mountain scenery, combined with the cinematic shots of finding John Marston,

and the wolf chase on the way back to the base, still left Old Dai deeply shocked.

Especially the cinematic camera in the game, slowly pulling back into the distance, revealing the vast expanse of white snowy mountains,

made Old Dai feel as if he were watching a movie.

After defeating the wolf pack on the snowy mountain, he rode his horse back to camp.

In the blizzard, the distant scenery was faintly visible.

After rescuing John Marston, players could move freely around the camp.

However, they couldn't stray too far, because if they did, the cold weather would continuously deplete the player's health over time.

Ultimately, if they didn't return to camp to warm up, they would freeze to death in the wilderness.

Playing up to this point, Old Dai already had a faint guess.

That is, the current content was clearly still the prologue of the game; the stage for true free exploration had not yet arrived.

The story continued to advance. After rescuing John Marston, Dutch, the gang's leader, and the team members had to prepare for something.

That was the information they had received earlier in the stable of the woman they rescued, named Sadie.

They planned to use dynamite to rob a train next.

They were currently trapped in the mountains, but that didn't mean they would stay trapped there forever.

Once they left this place, they would need money.

Currently, the gang members were all in a state of panic.

The harsh environment, coupled with being pursued by Pinkerton Agents.

Furthermore, all their money was left in Blackwater Town, and everyone was very uncertain about the gang's future.

So, at this moment, facing Arthur and the gang members, Dutch stepped forward.

'Hosea... everyone... don't worry, we'll get through this crisis, just like before.'

'Arthur, do you trust me?'

'Good, because you know me, son... my plan has only just begun.'

'But we need money.'

'Those Pinkerton Agents, they won't find us.'

'Thank you, Arthur, thank you for your support, it means a lot to me.'

'We'll be fine.'

Watching Dutch encourage everyone in the gang with his highly infectious tone,

even though the current environment was extremely harsh, and their situation was not optimistic,

with Dutch, this wise 'Big Brother' who could always come up with seemingly reliable ideas, leading them, what was there to be confused about?

So everyone followed Dutch's orders, preparing to raid the O'Driscoll gang's outpost to find dynamite and rob a train.

He seemed like a very trustworthy 'Big Brother'.

He also had the demeanor of a chivalrous outlaw, recalling how Dutch had stopped Micah earlier and taken in the woman named Sadie.

No matter how critical the situation, there was no need to panic, because Dutch, as the 'Big Brother,' had many good plans to lead everyone to victory and prosperity.

Was this the leader of the Van der Linde gang?

Old Dai couldn't help but sigh with emotion at this moment.

As the story progressed, Arthur and his companions soon arrived at the O'Driscolls' camp they were attacking.

This was the first large-scale battle in the game.

Compared to the previous battles at the farm and against the wolf pack on the snowy mountain, this battle was more intense.

Most of the Van der Linde gang members were deployed.

What amazed Old Dai during the battle was that if he didn't actively attack, the enemies would almost be wiped out by his gang teammates.

Besides that, Old Dai learned to use a new skill here.

The Dead Eye system, when activated by the player, allowed them to enter bullet time.

After aiming, Arthur would immediately fire at different targets.

In the time-stop mode, Old Dai aimed at four people's heads. After deactivating it, watching Arthur instantly kill all four, Old Dai couldn't help but praise it inwardly.

This was absolutely explosive in its coolness!

The operation was a resounding success. Old Dai searched the O'Driscoll gang's corpses on the ground for valuables.

Compared to the previous life's Red Dead Redemption, Chen Xu made a slight change here.

That was the option for players to choose whether to skip the looting and skinning animations, which was a point of contention for players in the previous life.

Although it was meant to enhance immersion, players might initially find it novel. However, later on, having to watch a few seconds of animation every time they looted a corpse or skinned an animal became a rather torturous design for players.

Many players even found themselves in a dilemma: after enemies died, their corpses were marked with countless small black 'x's on the mini-map.

If you didn't loot them, players with OCD found it incredibly uncomfortable.

But if you did loot them, the time spent watching the animation for looting corpses was longer than the time you spent fighting.

So here, Chen Xu also gave the choice to the players.

In this operation, they not only found the tools for robbing the train but also brought back an unlucky fellow named Kieran from the O'Driscoll gang.

He was one of the O'Driscoll gang members, but the O'Driscoll gang was different from the Van der Linde gang.

Like traditional Western outlaw gangs, the O'Driscoll gang would take in any man with combat prowess, regardless of who they were or their background, leading to a motley crew of members.

Kieran, on the other hand, belonged to the lowest rung of the O'Driscoll gang; simply put, he was the stable boy.

Deep in the blizzard-stricken mountains, despite acquiring the tools for robbing the train,

the gang also needed some supplies.

For example, food.

Next, Old Dai followed a teammate named Charles, who had Native American ancestry, to hunt in the wilderness.

Tracking prey, then hunting with a bow and arrow.

All of this gave Old Dai a very peculiar feeling.

It wasn't like some Western movies where it immediately started with grudges and vendettas.

Up until now, Red Dead Redemption had only featured three battles in total.

One was at the farm, another was on the snowy mountain rescuing John Marston and fighting wolves, and the third was the previous raid on the hostile gang.

Yet, it gave Old Dai a very unique feeling, a sense of everyday life.

Completely different from Beautiful World, which he had played before, Red Dead Redemption had a very slow pace.

Yet, it didn't make Old Dai feel impatient; moreover, this slow-paced experience was quite flavorful.

Because he could clearly feel that the game wasn't deliberately dragging its pace.

Rather, it was because the game's content itself was designed that way.

Accompanying companions could engage in dialogue, allowing players to learn more about them.

It felt as if this was a story that had truly happened in Western history.
