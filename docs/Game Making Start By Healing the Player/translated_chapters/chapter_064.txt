Chapter 64 Promotion Interview

Chapter 64 Promotion Interview

"Qin Yi, the rice is already burnt, and you're still chopping vegetables!"

"What am I supposed to do? You said you'd wash the dishes, but there's not a single plate left to wash! If I don't chop, what else can I do?"

"I'm so mad I could die!"

"I'm dying of anger too!"

Inside Nebula Games' office, Zhao Zhuo, responsible for Level Design, and Qin Yi, responsible for Numerical Design, had the above conversation.

This was the fourth incident observed during testing after the game's DEMO release.

"Mr. Chen, are you sure our game is really meant for couples to strengthen their relationship?" Yang Xin looked at Chen Xu with a strange expression.

Beside her, Ruan Ningxue didn't say anything, but her head bobbing like a woodpecker clearly indicated she shared Yang Xin's thoughts.

"Ahem, of course it's not just for couples—friendship and brotherhood can also be nurtured through this game," Chen Xu solemnly summarized.

"The situation with Qin Yi and Zhao Zhuo is simply due to their strong competitiveness," Chen Xu added.

"I just feel like something's off," Yang Xin muttered, staring at the *Overcooked* game graphics in front of her.

At first, she thought this game was universally lovable.

But now?

She was holding back her judgment, since she had actually tried playing it herself.

Getting through on easy difficulty and clearing the levels wasn't much of a problem.

But aiming for three stars? That immediately spiked her blood pressure. There were moments when she barely managed to hold herself back.

"Alright, for the promotional video, Sister Xin and Senior Sister, you two keep an eye on it. I've got a media interview to attend to."

Chen Xu changed the subject as the two women looked ready to continue discussing *Overcooked*.

"A media interview?" Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue were slightly surprised.

"It's an exclusive interview with Game Timespace, also part of the new game's promotional preparations," Chen Xu explained.

Upon hearing this, the two nodded in understanding.

After exchanging a few more words with Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin, Chen Xu walked toward the office.

Although this interview was primarily intended to promote *Overcooked*,

in truth, quite a few media outlets had recently shown interest in him.

After all, within the broader gaming industry, compared to top-tier game designers and masters, Chen Xu still had some way to go in terms of fame.

But at least in the independent gaming community, the name Chen Xu carried some weight.

"Teacher Chen, what an honor! What an honor!"

Pushing open the office door, Wu Tian, editor from Game Timespace, greeted Chen Xu with an excited expression.

Ever since he accidentally discovered *Undertale* and experienced the profound impact it left on him,

he had quietly followed Chen Xu's work. And Chen Xu had never disappointed him.

*To the Moon* moved him so deeply that even a tough guy like him shed tears.

As for *Outlast*,

although subjectively speaking, he wasn't particularly fond of horror games,

he had to admit it was undoubtedly an excellent horror game—one capable of making even the bravest man pee his pants.

In short, Wu Tian had long admired Chen Xu, the game designer.

So when he learned he had a chance to interview him, he immediately requested the opportunity from the editor-in-chief.

"No need to call me Teacher Chen. Just use my name," Chen Xu said, feeling slightly awkward.

Although in his previous life, with the rise of countless new talents, the glory associated with "Teacher Chen" and his hard drive full of legendary content had long faded,

in the photography world, "Teacher Chen" was still considered a pioneering master.

So whenever someone addressed him as "Teacher Chen," it always felt a bit off to him, somehow not quite legitimate.

Wu Tian paused, momentarily at a loss. To him, "Teacher" was just an honorific—common and perfectly normal within the gaming industry.

"Um… alright then, Mr. Chen. First of all, thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to grant us this interview."

After a moment of thought, Wu Tian changed his tone. Though he didn't understand why Chen Xu disliked the "Teacher" title, calling him by name felt too informal.

"No need to be so tense or formal. Let's just chat casually for now," Chen Xu smiled, pulling a bottle of coke from a nearby box and handing it to Wu Tian, then taking one for himself.

"Um… o-okay," Wu Tian stammered, instinctively accepting the coke, placing it in front of him, and responding meekly as he looked at Chen Xu's friendly smile.

"Then let's start by talking about *Undertale*. Since we couldn't report much on *Mirror (Game)* previously, with *Undertale*, I mainly noticed a gap in the market—a lack of games with meta-concepts, which had previously appeared mostly in novels and films. So I wondered, why not apply this mode to games? And in terms of sense of immersion, games actually have a greater advantage."

"As for *To the Moon*, I believe countless players have already given their answers in their hearts. Regarding *Outlast*, I truly developed it with immense passion. Judging from player feedback, they clearly felt it too."

"When players want something, and the market lacks it, we step in and make it. That's exactly why I say I see myself as a Warrior of Love. Every one of our games overflows with passion for players—passion as intense as a volcano about to erupt."

"The same goes for our new game. Within this new game, too, lies my 'love' for players."

A new game!?

Hearing Chen Xu's words, Wu Tian's eyes lit up.

Finally, a sensational hot topic! Though he understood that Nebula Games' main goal was likely promoting their new game,

at least now there was a bombshell—something exclusive to publish.

Eagerly, Wu Tian asked, "Mr. Chen, could you share a bit of information about the new game?"

"Of course. The new game will be a cooperative game suitable for all ages, launching on February 14th—Valentine's Day."

"We hope this game deepens the relationships between couples. And even if you don't have a partner, you can still enjoy it with your best friends, siblings, or close buddies. Together, experience the joy this game brings."

Chen Xu spoke with a warm, sincere smile.

At the same time, Chen Xu showed two concept art pieces from *Overcooked*.

The adorable Crocodile Chef, the Onion King, and Kevin the Dog. In a lively kitchen, two chefs wearing chef hats smiled brightly.

In four words: harmonious and loving.

Another four: joyful and warm.

At a glance, the game radiated warmth, clearly one of those must-play titles among friends.

……………………

The interview didn't last long—less than twenty minutes.

With a smile as soothing as a spring breeze, Chen Xu personally escorted Wu Tian to the main entrance, watching him step into the elevator.

"Young people these days!" Chen Xu sighed, full of emotion.

Meanwhile, inside the elevator, Wu Tian held his voice recorder and the unopened bottle of coke.

He finally snapped back to reality, reviewing the entire interview in his mind.

He felt a little dizzy.

Shouldn't he have been the interviewer? Why did he feel more like a stenographer?

Looking at the recorder and the coke in his hand, Wu Tian fell into deep thought.

When exactly had he lost control of the conversation?

Perhaps it started with this bottle of coke?

"But anyway, it's not like I gained nothing. The scoop about Chen Xu's new game is substantial. I'd better start drafting the news article quickly!"

"I'll use 'The Transmission of Love' as the main headline. And judging from the concept art, *Overcooked* looks incredibly heartwarming. Looks like players with girlfriends this Spring Festival are in for a wonderful holiday!"
