Chapter 64: Promotional Interview

"Qin Yi, the rice is overcooked, and you're still chopping vegetables!"

"What do you want me to do? You said you'd wash the plates, but there isn't a single clean one to put food on. What else can I do but chop vegetables!"

"You're infuriating!"

"I'm just as infuriated!"

In the Nebula Games office, Zhao Zhuo, in charge of Level Design, and Qin Yi, in charge of Numerical Design, had the following conversation.

This was the fourth such incident arising from testing after the game's DEMO was released.

"Mr. Chen, is this game really for couples, meant to foster and nurture relationships?" Yang Xin looked at Chen Xu with a very strange gaze.

Ruan Ningxue next to her didn't speak, but her head nodding like a woodpecker fully conveyed that she shared Yang Xin's thoughts.

"Ahem, of course, it's not just for couples. Friendships and brotherhood can also enjoy this game," Chen Xu summarized solemnly.

"The reason it's like this is simply that Qin Yi and Zhao Zhuo are both quite competitive," Chen Xu added.

"I just feel like something's not right," Yang Xin muttered, looking at the *Overcooked* game screen in front of her.

At first, she felt this game was genuinely universally loved.

But now?

She remained reserved, having tried it herself.

On easy difficulty and just to clear it, there wasn't much problem.

But aiming for three stars? Her blood pressure would instantly shoot up, and sometimes she couldn't help but get a little frustrated.

"Alright, Sister Xin, you and Senior Sister can keep an eye on the game's promotional video. I also need to accept a media interview."

Chen Xu said, changing the subject as he looked at the two who wanted to continue discussing *Overcooked* with him.

"Media interview?" Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue were a little surprised.

"It's an exclusive interview with Game Timespace, also in preparation for the new game's promotion," Chen Xu said.

Hearing this, the two realized.

After exchanging a few words with Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin, Chen Xu walked towards the office.

This interview, while ostensibly for the promotion of *Overcooked*, was also beneficial for him.

In fact, quite a few media outlets were genuinely interested in him.

After all, in the gaming industry, he still had some gap in recognition compared to those top-tier Game Designers and masters.

But at least within the independent game circle, the name Chen Xu still carried some renown.

"Teacher Chen, it's a pleasure to meet you! A great pleasure!"

Pushing open the office door, Wu Tian, an editor from Game Timespace, greeted Chen Xu with an excited expression.

From the moment he accidentally stumbled upon *Undertale* and experienced the shock it delivered,

he had actually been quietly following Chen Xu. And Chen Xu's subsequent works had not disappointed him.

The emotional impact brought by *To the Moon* made even tough guys cry, and as for *Outlast*...

While personally, he wasn't particularly fond of horror games.

But he had to admit, it was definitely an excellent horror game, one that could make even tough guys wet themselves.

It could be said that he had long admired Chen Xu as a Game Designer.

So, upon learning of the opportunity for an interview, he immediately applied to his editor-in-chief for this chance.

"No need to call me Teacher Chen, just call me by my name," Chen Xu said, feeling a bit awkward as Wu Tian called him Teacher Chen.

Although in his previous life, with the emergence of various rising stars, "Teacher Chen" and his glorious photos on his computer hard drive were no longer a big deal.

But in the photography industry, "Teacher Chen" was still considered a pioneering patriarch.

So, whenever someone called him Teacher Chen, Chen Xu always felt the title sounded a bit disreputable.

Wu Tian paused at his words, somewhat at a loss. After all, from his perspective, "Teacher" was just a respectful title, a perfectly normal way to address someone in the gaming industry.

"Uh... then, Mr. Chen, first of all, thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to accept our interview."

After thinking for a moment, Wu Tian changed his address. Although he didn't know why Chen Xu disliked the "Teacher" title, he couldn't just call him by his first name.

"Don't be so nervous and formal, we can just chat casually first," Chen Xu said with a smile, taking a bottle of Coke from a nearby box and handing it to the other person, then grabbing one for himself.

"Uh... alright... okay," Wu Tian replied, instinctively taking the bottle of Coke and placing it in front of him, looking at the smiling Chen Xu.

"Let's start by talking about *Undertale*. After all, the previous *Mirror (Game)* wasn't very convenient to report on. The main reason for developing *Undertale* was discovering a gap in the market for a certain type of game. Before that, meta-concepts appeared more frequently in novels and films, so I pondered why this model couldn't be applied to games. Furthermore, in terms of a sense of immersion, games hold a greater advantage."

"As for *To the Moon*? How it truly is, I believe countless players have already given their answers. For *Outlast*, I indeed developed it with immense passion, and from player feedback, it's clear they must have felt that as well."

"Players wanted it, and the market lacked similar games, so we made them. That's why I say I feel like a Warrior of Love; every one of our games is filled with a passion for players, a passion like a volcano about to erupt."

"The same goes for the new game; it too nurtures my 'love' for players."

A new game!?

Hearing Chen Xu's words, Wu Tian's eyes lit up where he sat.

Finally, there was an eye-catching hot topic! Although he knew very well that Nebula Games' main purpose was probably also to promote its new game.

But at least there was a major scoop, and it would be an exclusive piece of news.

Wu Tian asked, filled with anticipation, "Mr. Chen, could you perhaps reveal a little information about the new game?"

"Of course. The new game will be a cooperative game suitable for all ages, and it will launch on February 14th, Valentine's Day."

"We hope this game can deepen the relationships between couples. And of course, if you don't have a partner, you can still team up with your good brothers, sisters, and friends to collectively experience and enjoy the beauty this game brings."

Chen Xu said, smiling and with great sincerity.

At the same time, Chen Xu also showed two pieces of *Overcooked* Concept Art.

Adorable Crocodile Chefs, Onion Kings, and Kevin the Dog, two chefs wearing chef hats in a bustling kitchen, everyone with smiling expressions.

To summarize in four characters, it was: harmonious and loving.

And four more characters: full of joy and warmth.

It made anyone feel the game was especially heartwarming, the kind that friends absolutely must play together.

……………………

The interview wasn't particularly long, lasting less than 20 minutes.

With a smile as warm as a spring breeze, Chen Xu personally walked Wu Tian to the main entrance, watching him enter the elevator.

"Ah, young people!" Chen Xu sighed.

Meanwhile, inside the elevator, Wu Tian, holding a recording pen and the unopened can of Coke,

had now come back to his senses. He recalled the entire interview process.

He felt a little dizzy.

Shouldn't he be the interviewer? Why did it feel like he had become a stenographer?

Looking at the recording pen and the Coke in his hand, Wu Tian fell into deep thought.

When did he lose control of the conversation?

It seemed to start with this bottle of Coke, didn't it?

"Well, at least it wasn't a total loss. Chen Xu's new game is definitely newsworthy, but I need to quickly come up with the press release!"

"I'll use 'The Transmission of Love' as the main title. And looking at the Concept Art for *Overcooked*, it feels incredibly heartwarming. It seems players with girlfriends will have a great Spring Festival this year!"
