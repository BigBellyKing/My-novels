Chapter 472: This Life Is Unbearable! Divorce! Must Divorce! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

In a horror game, having a reliable teammate is a blessing.

But the problem was, this teammate didn't seem very reliable right now.

Looking at Mia in front of him, Ethan in the game said with concern, "We'll get out of here, Mia. You rest here for a bit, I'll go look for a way out."

"What the heck... Ethan, don't mess with me!" Song Ren's face was about to collapse.

Even though the room was quite brightly lit, this was a horror game! To separate in this situation, Ethan, have you never died before?

Despite his internal grumbling, Song Ren could only control Ethan to scout ahead in the game.

However, just as he entered the room to check for any information, Mia's scream echoed from outside.

"Ah...!! Get away! Don't come near me!"

Hearing Mia's scream, Song Ren immediately ran back, but he was a step too late.

Where the wall had originally been boarded up with planks, there was now a large hole. And Mia, who had been sitting on the sofa, had vanished.

Song Ren felt a wave of frustration; he knew it wouldn't be that simple. Looking at the smashed hole in the wall, Song Ren quickly searched, but found nothing of value.

Then, he slowly fumbled his way behind the wall hole. Since he was already here, he still had to save his wife!

Passing through the wall hole, he found a stairwell behind it. The long staircase was dark and dim in the game, and also incredibly steep, approximately 75 degrees.

With his flashlight on, he stood rooted to the spot, silent for a long while. At that moment, a creaking sound came, and the tightly shut door on the staircase was suddenly flung open.

Lying in the gaming pod, Song Ren already felt a bit sweaty. The eerie atmosphere, coupled with the deathly silence where not a single sound could be heard, filled him with an uncanny feeling.

After a brief hesitation, Song Ren finally began to slowly ascend.

Coming up from the basement stairs, there was no door jump scare or high-tension moment as Song Ren had predicted. But outside the window, thunder rumbled, and through the glass, he could see that the sky had changed from the dusk of his arrival to deep night.

Along with the thunder, and the sound of wind, rain began to fall. The pattering raindrops on the window, combined with the wind and thunder, made Song Ren feel utterly numb. Especially with the game's setting after coming up from the basement, the atmosphere was simply overwhelming.

The sound of the thunderstorm outside, the cramped corridor, the wooden floor, and the dim lighting—at this moment, Song Ren suddenly felt like crying. Every step he took was a tremendous torment. Because with each step, his feet thudded on the wooden floor, making a 'thump-thump' sound. Coupled with the empty house, it made him suspicious and paranoid, constantly feeling as if someone was grinning sinisterly in a corner, following right behind him, ready to give him a huge 'surprise' at any moment.

Carefully passing through the corridor, Song Ren pushed open the only door he could open. It was a bathroom. The cramped corridor outside reminded Song Ren of `Silent Hill PT` from back then. Fortunately, this bathroom didn't have any high-tension scenes, which made him slightly relieved.

However, in the bathroom drawer, Song Ren found two first aid sprays. Just as he was about to check if there was anything else,

'Thump-thump-thump!'

Urgent knocking suddenly came from the corridor outside.

'Thump-thump-thump-thump-thump-thump!'

'Thump-thump-thump-thump-thump!'

The incredibly urgent knocking sounded very impatient. Although he desperately wanted to turn and run, Song Ren knew it wasn't realistic.

After all, this thing was a game. For the opposite direction, Song Ren estimated there were only two possible outcomes.

The first was that the door wouldn't open at all, forcing players to trigger this knocking sequence. As for the second outcome, that was terrifying. Because if the door could open, it meant Mr. Chen just wanted them, the players, to go in, and what hidden horrors lay beyond that door, he truly couldn't say.

Summoning his courage, Song Ren slowly walked towards the corridor door, but the moment he reached it, the knocking stopped, and even the thunder and rain outside the window vanished.

An immense silence. The only sound in his ears was Ethan's breathing. Song Ren took two deep breaths and bravely opened the main door. Instinctively, he closed his eyes.

But he quickly realized there was no jump scare as he'd imagined. Yet, before he could feel relieved, something that made his skin crawl happened.

From the dark staircase below, a faint climbing sound emerged, growing louder and louder. He shone his flashlight downwards, only to see a person with a grotesque figure slowly climbing the stairs. And her clothing... wasn't it Mia's from before?!

Before Song Ren could figure out what was happening, Mia, who was crawling on the stairs, suddenly sprang up like a spring, instantly pouncing on Ethan's face. Her twisted face, veins bulging, was indescribably sinister and filled with madness.

"Holy cow!"

Song Ren shuddered in fright. Then, Mia grabbed Ethan's neck, threw him upwards, and flung him away, crashing through the stairwell door and landing in the corridor.

Before Song Ren could control Ethan to get up from the ground, Mia was already there, and in her hand was a sharp knife, which she thrust towards his face.

"Holy cow, stop... stop! Domestic violence!" Song Ren waved his hands, blocking Mia's attacks. The sharp blade carved gash after gash into his hands, and blood instantly splattered out.

Song Ren struggled to get up from the ground and kicked Mia away, but Mia, like a madwoman, pounced on him again. Under the VR immersive experience, even with 'Awakening Mode' on, the impact was absolutely overwhelming, filled with the oppressive sensation of death. For a moment, Song Ren almost forgot it was a game.

Especially the last strike, where the knife pierced directly through Ethan's palm. Just watching it made Song Ren feel pain, as if he was back in that level of `Outlast` where his fingers were cut. But this time he was playing in VR, with Huanyu VR no less, and the visual presentation of this `Resident Evil` was still on the level of `Uncharted`.

Looking at his gory and mangled hand, Song Ren felt his blood pressure rise. However, Mia's previous madness had vanished, replaced by an expression of pain.

'I feel... she's trying to get back inside me!'

'Get out! Get out! Stay away from me!'

'Ah!' Mia violently slammed her head against the wall.

'I've done bad things, I deserve this!'

'Get away!'

With the impact, a gash opened up on Mia's head, and blood quickly spurted out. Mia finally couldn't hold on and fainted on the ground. At the same time, a UI pop-up appeared in Song Ren's vision, prompting him to use a first aid spray.

But at this point, he had completely lost that thought. He glanced at the time; it had only been about half an hour since he started playing this game?

Song Ren looked at Mia on the ground. She was unconscious, wearing thin clothing. If it were his old self, he would definitely lean in for a closer look, but now he just instinctively took a few steps back.

"Mia, I'm sorry! You... I definitely can't save you now. Also, I don't think there's any need for us two to continue this life together! Divorce! We should get a divorce! Must divorce!"
