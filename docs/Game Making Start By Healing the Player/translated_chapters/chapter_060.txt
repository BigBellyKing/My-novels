## Chapter 60: Players Always Misunderstand Me!

The online discussion surrounding *Outlast* was still ongoing.

How long this wave of popularity for *Outlast* would last primarily depended on how long it could remain trending on live streaming platforms.

Relying solely on the game’s inherent horror quality to keep *Outlast* popular was unrealistic.

Meanwhile, some game developers and designers online had reportedly begun developing their own horror games, clearly aiming to ride the wave of horror fever sparked by *Outlast*.

As for the genre, it didn’t even need thinking—most would undoubtedly be uniformly escape-based gameplay without combat systems.

Chen Xu didn’t pay much attention to this.

After all, developing *Outlast* hadn’t originally been part of Chen Xu’s plan.

If it hadn’t been for that lucky draw of an item that converted points, he wouldn’t have developed this game at all.

"Time-wise, two months is a bit too rushed," Chen Xu mused, checking the date.

Truly large-scale games, as well as VR games, were still temporarily off the table, just like before.

Capital was still lacking.

Additionally, with the Lunar New Year approaching, even if he wanted to develop a medium-sized game, it wouldn’t be able to launch until after the holiday.

During this period, Chen Xu also planned to hire, through a headhunter, some talent capable of handling areas beyond game development.

Aside from that, there was also Nebula Games Platform.

From a functional standpoint, the Nebula Games Store already had a fairly comprehensive suite of features.

Shop, inventory, community, friends, comments, and even the Workshop (modding platform)—all features present on the Steam Platform from his previous life—were fully implemented.

Of course, some interface UI elements related to recommendations hadn’t been developed yet, since there were only three games on the platform at the moment.

*Outlast*, *To the Moon*, and *Undertale*.

The platform itself was already mature; the key issue was the lack of a player user base.

So far, the Nebula Games Platform had sold only 15,000 copies of games in total.

As for daily active users, it was less than 1,000.

Although the numbers were dismal, Chen Xu still held high hopes for the platform.

"Funds aren’t tight for now. It’s about time to start focusing on the platform," Chen Xu thought.

To accumulate users for the platform as quickly as possible, an exclusive strategy was clearly the most effective.

Major game developers and channels, both domestic and international, all employed similar exclusive strategies.

However, this approach clearly didn’t belong to Nebula Games at this stage.

They had some money, but the capital gap compared to major game developers was still enormous.

To truly implement an exclusive strategy, they’d need to release a game attractive enough.

But the key issue was, releasing this type of game now would only be making profits for others.

After all, gameplay couldn’t be protected, and many multiplayer online games from his previous life that were centered on innovative gameplay were Chen Xu’s trump cards.

Using them now wouldn’t blow up others—it would blow up himself.

‘Multi-channel, buy-to-play, discounted pricing, pass bundling, online multiplayer.’

Sitting in front of his computer, Chen Xu pondered deeply, then picked up a pen and wrote down several keywords on his notepad.

This was the definition he set for the next new game to be developed.

Multi-channel didn’t need much explanation—Nebula Games wasn’t suited for exclusivity at this stage.

The buy-to-play model was intended to work with discounted pricing, better attracting players to spend on the Nebula Games Platform.

As for pass bundling, players who bought the upcoming new game on other platforms would have to register a Nebula Games pass account for authentication.

This might indeed lose a batch of players who found it troublesome, and some channels even prohibited this type of account linking.

But for Nebula Games’ early user accumulation, it was still crucial.

Regardless of whether they spent money or not, and even if players only registered without downloading the platform,

At the very least, trick them into registering a pass account first.

Online multiplayer would better ensure this model, allowing players to cross-platform play together.

As for project selection, this game also wouldn’t be too large in scale.

After all, it was a test game.

Added to that, this year’s Spring Festival came later—Chinese New Year’s Eve was on February 11.

Two months was enough time to develop a low-budget game.

………………

Sitting at his computer, Chen Xu had set a general development direction for the near future.

He stepped out of his office to get some fresh air and, at the same time, consider which game to choose for the next new project.

After all, the range of options was still relatively broad.

It was already past work hours. Some employees who hadn’t gone home for lunch greeted Chen Xu as they saw him.

Chen Xu nodded in response to each one. Looking at the office space, he also considered whether it was time to expand.

When there were fewer people, he hadn’t felt it, but now with the R&D department and other departments sharing the space, the workplace was a bit cramped—workstations separated only by simple partitions.

However, just as this thought arose, before he could dwell on it, Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue approached and interrupted him.

"Mr. Chen, you’ve been turned into a meme!" Ruan Ningxue said with a smile.

"No, it’s not just you—our Mr. Chen’s words have become a meme," Yang Xin said, holding up her phone.

Chen Xu glanced at it and was slightly speechless.

On Yang Xin’s phone was a photoshopped screenshot.

The image showed the protagonist from *Outlast* doing abdominal exercises for the Scissors Doctor who cut fingers, with a caption beside it: "I am a Warrior of Love!"

Yang Xin swiped the screen, and a new meme appeared—a screenshot of the Fat Security Guard Uncle’s decapitation.

Of course, the image was censored with a mosaic, but it still had a line of text beside it: "I am also a Warrior of Love!"

"This meme hasn’t died down yet?" Chen Xu was both speechless and slightly amused.

"Of course not! In the *Outlast* player community, anyone who doesn’t know this meme is truly unworthy of their scare experience!" Ruan Ningxue said cheerfully.

"Exactly!" Yang Xin agreed.

"Who could blame Mr. Chen? Your explanation back then was just too perfect!" Ruan Ningxue pulled up the post Chen Xu had made on the official Weibo account.

The like count had already surpassed 500,000, with over 70,000 comments.

"Players always misunderstand me!" He said it jokingly, but a smile still played on his face, and an idea flashed through his mind.

"Hmm, I’ve decided! I need to prove my ‘Warrior of Love’ label. The next game will definitely be a wholesome one," Chen Xu said with a smile.

Ruan Ningxue looked surprised: "Mr. Chen, you’ve already decided on a new project this quickly? What kind of game is it!?"

"A wholesome game? Mr. Chen, you’re not pulling the same stunt as with *Outlast*, are you?" Yang Xin expressed doubt.

"Don’t rush me. I’ll think it over for a couple of days. Once I’ve confirmed the game’s content, I’ll tell you. But the scale won’t be large. This year, Spring Festival and Valentine’s Day fall together—perfect timing to present players with a very fitting game," Chen Xu said with a smile.
