Chapter 335: Keep On Humbugging (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Players were discussing the performance and story-related content of *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare* online.

The gaming industry had also been paying attention. After all, this was the first game for the New Era VR. Whether it was designers and developers qualified to produce New Era VR games, or simply designers watching the excitement, everyone wanted to know what the final product of *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare* would look like.

Regarding Nebula Games' previous promotional content for *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*, many designers thought that Nebula Games would likely focus the VR console's capabilities on specific levels, with other content requiring players to endure loading screens. Or, they might have compromised on graphics, sacrificing visual fidelity to eliminate loading bars. After all, the New Era VR's capabilities were limited. While it was certain that *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare* hadn't completely squeezed out every last bit of Huanyu VR's power (it being the first New Era VR game), maintaining the promised visual performance would inevitably require resource loading.

Before this, many game designers had discussed Chen Xu's trade-offs: which was better, the effect brought by superior graphics or a more perfect experience? These designers even split into two factions.

But now, it was as if a huge slap had landed across their faces. What were they thinking? Bro! I want both graphics and experience! As for the solution? Throw money at it!

It wasn't that the game had no loading, but Chen Xu was willing to spend big! In *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*, the maps weren't continuous. For example, after the cargo ship mission came Blackout. It was clearly not a seamless map. Normally, in between, players would have to wait for a loading screen. But how did Nebula Games do it? The answer was simple: they played CG cutscenes.

From the moment players jumped onto the helicopter and Captain Price rescued them, combined with narration introducing the game's worldview and some simple story exposition, players seamlessly transitioned from the story to the game experience. It even enhanced the players' sense of identification and familiarity with the in-game characters. Although players could figure out with a little thought that the CG was playing during the loading, would they care? Unless players were doing a second or third playthrough, for those just starting the game, they wouldn't mind at all. This was also related to *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*'s game pace.

In terms of story pace, every level in *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare* was extremely tense and intense, strictly adhering to the concept of '30 Seconds of Intensity.' Although '30 Seconds of Intensity' sounds a bit improper, it's actually a very legitimate design. The first to truly master its application was the *Halo Flood Trilogy* developed by Bungie: intense combat followed by moments for the player to catch their breath, using these breathing points to introduce the game's story and worldview. It breaks down a large game level into smaller sub-levels, each lasting approximately 30 to 120 seconds.

For example, in the opening cargo ship mission of *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*: players entered the ship's cabin to clear enemies in the cabin and dormitories – this was a combat hotspot. As they moved onto the deck later, there were no enemies midway. This was a舒缓区 (calm zone), after which intense combat immediately resumed until the helicopter cleared the enemies on the second floor. Then, Price and Gaz led the players into the ship's interior – again, a calm zone with no combat, until they encountered enemies in the first passage and engaged in a firefight. This relaxed yet intense game rhythm made players feel like they couldn't stop. At the same time, the intertwining of combat and story meant that after a major level ended, players also needed a period of relaxation. Just like the saying, 'a cigarette after the act,' after completing something mentally and physically exhausting, one needs a way to relax mind and body. At this point, turning the loading screen into a game story introduction perfectly maintained the overall pace of the game.

After studying it, many designers had to admit that this was simply a perfect solution. However, perfect as it was, many designers also knew that this could only be used by *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare* or games of this genre. Firstly, it required the game itself to have an excellent script and reasonable level planning; otherwise, it would be like 'clumsily imitating others.' Secondly, only linear games could use this, because players needed to follow a straight path.

Perfect pacing and narration, combined with player empathy for NPCs in the game, along with a smooth shooting experience and high-definition graphics, allowed *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare* to push cinematic gaming to its extreme.

………………

Inside Nebula Games, the team was still developing the subsequent content for *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*, more precisely, the multiplayer content.

“Mr. Chen, now even foreign players know your ‘Warrior of Love’ meme!” In the office, Ruan Ningxue chuckled, looking at some reprinted news online.

“Haha, I saw it too, I saw it too! And on some foreign petition websites, many players have petitioned for Captain Price not to die, with the total number exceeding 150,000 players.” Yang Xin smiled mischievously, because she was well aware of the subsequent plot.

“When the second part comes out, won't the players revolt?” Qin Yi was a little worried. Because compared to the second and third parts, the first part was actually quite mild. If the first part stabbed you once, then the second part would stab you and then rub salt in the wound.

“You people are just looking for trouble. The fact that players are discussing it like this doesn't it show that our game's story is good, and the portrayal is so immersive for players?” Chen Xu coughed lightly twice. “It’s like an actor who plays a villain so brilliantly that the audience hates them so much they grit their teeth if they met them in real life. This just shows that players are deeply immersed in the game.

“Don't mind how harshly players curse; in reality, this is a form of encouragement, it's their love for us, just like the love we pour into the game for them.” Chen Xu looked at everyone and said. He then opened his official Weibo account and quickly found the relevant information. Good heavens, the number of petitioners had already exceeded 300,000. But looking at the momentum, it seemed many domestic players had also joined in the fun.

“Mr. Chen, do you want to respond?” Ruan Ningxue also said with a smile.

“No need to respond.” Chen Xu shook his head. Chen Xu did not intend to respond to these player petitions. If it concerned the game's release date, Chen Xu would respond. But for plot matters, no, because responding would involve future spoilers. As a conscientious game designer, Chen Xu hoped that players would personally experience the fate of each character in Task Force 141. They shouldn't be spoiled beforehand and mentally prepared. If players knew Price wouldn't die in the end, would there still be that element of surprise when Roach and Soap went to the Gulag prison and discovered the prisoner coded 627? This was him, a designer with excellent qualities, always thinking of his players. Although he might bear some misunderstandings, for the players, what did that matter? At this moment, Chen Xu felt as if his entire body was filled with light.

As for Ruan Ningxue and the others, they simply pursed their lips. A few years ago, they would have fully believed Chen Xu's words. But now? Humbug, keep on humbugging. Just pursing their lips was already giving him face.

……………………

Ten days passed. Although the game's story made many players so sad they wanted to cry, and terms like 'Death to Chen Xu,' 'Warrior of Love,' and 'Old Geezer Chen Xu' became increasingly popular, players' enthusiasm didn't wane at all; instead, it grew even higher. Even Yang Chen from the Game Department called Chen Xu to express his astonishment. This was because *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare* significantly boosted Huanyu's sales, even causing stock shortages in some areas. The main reason was that the first part made countless players realize how awesome this game was.

Moreover, FPS is the biggest game category both overseas and domestically. Even though some later players learned the fates of certain characters, essentially being spoiled, the exhilarating design and excellent levels still filled them with a desire to play. As for players who had already played, there was even more to say. Captain Price's fate constantly weighed on their minds. Under these circumstances, on June 10th, *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Part 2* was released. Countless players who had pre-ordered and pre-downloaded the game eagerly jumped in immediately.
