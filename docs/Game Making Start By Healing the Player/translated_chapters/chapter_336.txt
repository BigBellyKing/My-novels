Chapter 335: You Keep on Conning (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Players were discussing online about the performance and story-related content in *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*.

The gaming industry was also closely watching.

After all, this was the first game developed for New Era VR. Whether it was designers and developers qualified to create games for the platform, or simply curious observers in the field—everyone wanted to know what the final product of *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare* would truly be like.

Regarding the promotional content Nebula Games had released earlier about *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*, many designers believed that Nebula Games probably focused all the VR hardware capabilities on certain intense segments, while using loading screens for the rest.

Alternatively, they might have compromised by sacrificing visual quality to eliminate loading screens altogether.

After all, the hardware capabilities of the new VR systems were limited. While it was certain that *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare* wasn't fully exhausting every last drop of Huanyu VR's power—this being the first title for New Era VR—maintaining high visual presentation during gameplay inevitably required resource loading.

Previously, many game designers had debated what trade-offs Chen Xu had made.

Was the impact of better graphics superior, or did a more seamless experience win out?

In fact, these designers had split into two camps.

But now, it was as if a giant slap had hit them across the face.

What were they even thinking?

Pushover!

I want both stunning visuals and perfect gameplay experience!

And the solution?

Throw money at it!

The game wasn't actually free of loading. It's just that Chen Xu was simply willing to spend.

In *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*, the map wasn't fully connected. For example, after the cargo ship mission came the Blackout mission.

Clearly, it wasn't a seamless transition.

Under normal circumstances, players would have to wait through a loading screen in between.

But how did Nebula Games handle it?

The answer was simple: CGI cutscenes.

After the player jumps onto the helicopter and Captain Price pulls them up, the game uses background narration to introduce the game's worldview and some simple story elements.

This seamlessly bridged the transition from story to gameplay.

It even enhanced players' sense of identification and emotional connection with the characters.

Although any careful player could realize that these CGI scenes were essentially loading screens in disguise, did players care?

Unless they were replaying the game for a second or third time, new players wouldn't mind at all.

This approach also aligned perfectly with the pacing of *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*.

In terms of story rhythm, each mission in *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare* was intensely tense and strictly followed the "30 Seconds of Intensity" design principle.

Though the name "30 Seconds of Intensity" sounded somewhat unserious, it was actually a highly effective technique.

The first developer to truly master and apply it was Bungie, in their *Halo Flood Trilogy*.

After intense combat, players were given a brief moment to catch their breath, during which the game would introduce story elements and expand the worldview.

This divided each major mission into a series of small levels, each lasting between 30 to 120 seconds.

For example, in the initial cargo ship mission of *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*, players enter the ship's cabin to eliminate enemies in the rooms and dormitories—that's one combat segment.

Then, as they move forward onto the deck, there are no enemies in between.

This is the relaxation phase. Immediately afterward, intense combat resumes until the helicopter clears the enemies on the second floor.

Then, Captain Price and Gaz lead the player back into the ship's interior—a calm, non-combat segment—until they encounter enemies again in the first corridor and engage in combat.

This rhythm of tension and release made the game feel impossible to put down.

Meanwhile, the intertwining of combat and narrative meant that after completing a major mission, players naturally needed a brief cooldown period.

Much like "a cigarette after the act," after completing something mentally exhausting, one needed a way to relax both body and mind.

At this point, replacing the loading screen with story exposition allowed the entire game to maintain a near-perfect pacing.

After studying this approach, many designers had to admit—it was simply a flawless solution.

However, perfect as it was, many designers also realized this method was only suitable for *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare* or similar linear games.

First, it required an excellent script and carefully planned level design—otherwise, it would be a poor imitation.

Second, it only worked for linear games, as players were expected to progress along a single path.

Perfect pacing, storytelling, emotional connection between players and NPCs, smooth shooting mechanics, and high-quality graphics—

*Call of Duty: Modern Warfare* had elevated cinematic gaming to its peak.

………………

Inside Nebula Games, the team was still working on the subsequent content of *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*—more precisely, the multiplayer component.

"Mr. Chen, now even overseas players know about the 'Warrior of Love' meme!" Ruan Ningxue giggled in the office, browsing some reposted messages online.

"Haha, I've seen it too! Some foreign petition websites already have over 150,000 players signing petitions hoping Captain Price doesn't die," Yang Xin grinned mischievously, fully aware of the upcoming story.

"When we release the second part, won't the players riot?" Qin Yi expressed some concern.

Compared to the second and third installments, the first part was actually quite gentle.

If the first game was like stabbing you once,

then the second was stabbing you and then rubbing salt into the wound.

"You guys just love chaos. The fact that players are discussing like this only proves our story is good and deeply immersive," Chen Xu said with a light cough.

"It's like actors who play villains so convincingly that audiences hate them in real life. Right now, it means players are truly immersed in the game."

"Don't mind the harsh words—they're actually a form of encouragement. It's the players' love for us, just as we've poured our love into the game for them," Chen Xu said, looking at the team.

He then opened his official Weibo account and quickly found the related posts.

Wow, the number of petition signatures had already surpassed 300,000.

And judging by the trend, many domestic players had joined in on the fun as well.

"Mr. Chen, should we respond?" Ruan Ningxue asked with a smile.

"Nah, no need to respond," Chen Xu shook his head.

He had no intention of addressing such fan petitions.

If it were questions about the game's release date, he might respond.

But for story-related matters, he'd rather stay silent—responding would risk spoiling future content.

As a conscientious game designer, Chen Xu wanted players to personally experience the fates of each 141 Task Force character when the time came.

If players already knew Captain Price wouldn't die, would they still feel the same shock when Roach and Soap discover the prisoner labeled '627' in the Gulag?

This was his quality—always thinking of the players.

Even if it meant bearing some misunderstandings, what did it matter for the sake of the players?

At this moment, Chen Xu felt as if he was glowing all over.

Meanwhile, Ruan Ningxue and the others merely rolled their eyes.

A few years ago, they would have fully believed Chen Xu's words.

But now? Conning. You keep on conning.

Rolling their eyes was already being generous.

………………

Ten days passed. Although the story had left many players emotionally devastated, even to the point of wanting to cry,

phrases like "Beat up Chen Xu," "Warrior of Love," and "Old Geezer Chen Xu" became increasingly popular online.

Yet players' enthusiasm didn't diminish at all—in fact, it grew even stronger.

Yang Chen from the Game Department even called Chen Xu, amazed to report that *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare* had significantly boosted Huanyu's sales, even causing temporary stock shortages in some regions.

The main reason was that the first installment had deeply impressed countless players with how awesome the game truly was.

Moreover, as a first-person shooter, FPS remained the most popular game genre both overseas and domestically.

Even though later players had some story elements spoiled in advance,

the game's satisfying gameplay and excellent level design still ignited a strong desire to play.

As for those who had already played it? Even more so.

Captain Price's fate hung heavily over their hearts.

Under these circumstances, on June 10th, *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2* was released.

Countless players who had pre-ordered and pre-downloaded the game immediately jumped in at launch.
