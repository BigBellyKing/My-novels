Chapter 57: Didn't He Say He Was a 'Warrior of Love'?

In the gaming section of Shark TV, initially, only streamers who were familiar with Nebula Games were live streaming *Outlast*.

However, as more streamers began broadcasting, they discovered that the streaming effect was quite good. Both popularity and buzz increased, and the bullet comments in their live stream rooms became incredibly dense when they played this game.

This, in turn, attracted even more streamers, as for them, it was their job, and *Outlast* was clearly excellent live streaming content.

If you randomly clicked into any streamer's room, you would almost certainly hear their heart-wrenching screams.

"I'm not playing anymore, I'm not playing anymore! My closet moved!"

"No! Daddy, I was wrong, please let me go!"

"How did that big guy catch up again? How do I even get out of this sewer?!"

"Looking for a fuse in the women's ward? Completely dark? I'm out of batteries! Does anyone know the way, help me!"

"Where's the gun! Why is there no gun! Give me a gun!"

"Damn it all! That guy in the wheelchair scared me to death! You didn't move when I got here, but then you pull this trick when I try to leave!"

In the live stream rooms of various major streamers, when playing *Outlast*, their screams were utterly pathetic.

Any random screenshot or clip could instantly become viral content.

At the same time, this sparked curiosity about *Outlast* among players who watched the live streams but weren't familiar with the game.

Just like the players on the forums before, they all shared a common thought: Is this game really that scary?

But once they entered the game and tried it for themselves, they were instantly overwhelmed.

Because the game was far scarier than they had imagined.

If jump scares like the 'door jump scare' were just sudden frights that you'd get used to, it would be a bit easier to handle.

But *Outlast* offered far more than just that.

Visual horror, jump scare horror, and psychological horror were perfectly intertwined.

Among these, jump scare horror is a common characteristic of both Eastern and Western horror elements, also known as 'jump scares,' such as the 'door jump scare' and 'turn-around jump scares.'

Visual horror, on the other hand, typically focuses on Western-style horror themes, often featuring unsettling images such as gory scenes.

The soldier impaled by a steel pipe at the beginning of *Outlast*, and the scene where fingers are cut, are classic examples of visual horror.

As for psychological horror, it generally leans towards Eastern-style horror themes, focusing on the fear of the unknown and making players question themselves.

For instance, levels like the basement, women's ward, and sewers, where enemies chase you while the entire environment is extremely dark and you can only use your camcorder for illumination, are classic psychological horror designs.

And *Outlast* successfully combined all three of these horror elements.

Furthermore, in the game itself, the player character, a reporter, can only run and cannot fight back.

This further diminished the player's sense of security.

God knows how desperate it feels in the game when you're being chased by monsters and your camcorder runs out of battery!

All at once, countless players found themselves shrouded in the shadow of the Mount Massive Asylum.

With the recommendations from streamers and an increasing number of 'friendly' players...

Its buzz and reviews quickly soared.

Initially, it only spread within horror game forums.

But later, in major game communities and Tieba, the buzz surrounding *Outlast* rose sharply.

It was filled with discussions from players.

"Holy crap, I'm breaking up with my friends! This is what they called 'a tiny bit scary'? It scared me to death!"

"I'm ashamed to admit, I've disgraced myself among you all. After buying the game, I didn't even dare to enter the main gate of Mount Massive Asylum!"

"23333, hold on there, bro above, you're not the only one who didn't even go through the main gate!"

"Haha, same here. I didn't go in either. I just wandered around outside the gate, then I closed the game and went to watch videos."

"Is it really as exaggerated as you guys are saying? I think this game is pretty simple!"

"What's so scary about it! I've already beaten it!"

"To the two bros above, please unlink your official platform authentication before you speak, okay? One of you has 7 minutes of playtime, the other 5 minutes. What the heck did you beat?!"

"Hehe, I bought the game and didn't refund it, plus I watched videos and live streams, so I understand the entire story. Doesn't that count as beating it!"

"Damn it, I'm speechless at that!"

"To be fair, the game's actual playthrough is too short. Let me give a brief walkthrough for new players: first, we open the game, then enter the courtyard, go to the small door on the left, crawl through the dog hole, then use a shelf to climb through a window into the asylum, and finally, close the game and open a video website to search for *Outlast* gameplay commentary."

Fueled by active player discussions, the buzz around *Outlast* quickly soared.

Simultaneously, its sales entered a period of explosive growth.

More and more players who hadn't heard of it before became curious about *Outlast*.

Of course, most of these players were scared silly.

And a considerable number of players requested refunds.

But despite the numerous refunds, there were also many players who bought the game and didn't ask for one.

These players were supporting the game company in their own way.

With such a large player base,

*Outlast*'s sales were still quite impressive.

However, it was around this time that someone, no one knows who, initiated a trend across major game community forums.

This trend revolved around a statement Chen Xu made during a media interview when he won first prize in the 'Sci-Fi Game Design Competition'.

[After all, I've always considered myself a Warrior of Love.]

This sentence suddenly went viral among *Outlast* players.

"Damn it, how could Chen Xu have the nerve to say that?"

"I never would have thought that after making a game like *To the Moon*, Chen Xu would then release *Outlast*."

"Warrior of Love! Can this *damn thing* be called a Warrior of Love?!"

"By the way, Chen Xu, your game is so scary, do *you* dare to play it yourself?"

"Exactly, exactly! There's not a single bit of love to be seen in this *damn* *Outlast*!"

Countless players began to stir up trouble in the comments section of Chen Xu's official Weibo account.

The contrasting effect was simply too strong.

He had just declared himself a Warrior of Love, and immediately afterwards, he produced *Outlast*, a game so terrifying it could make people wet their pants.

There was absolutely no love to be seen!

However, despite their words, players were essentially just fanning the flames and joining in the fun.

But to the players' utter surprise, Chen Xu actually replied on his official Weibo account.

As for the content, well...
