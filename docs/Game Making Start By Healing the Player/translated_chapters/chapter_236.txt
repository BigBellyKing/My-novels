Chapter 235: Monster Hunter: World (Fifth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

After Chen Xu left, the team couldn't help but start discussing.

“Hunting? The new game is actually a hunting theme? This genre seems a bit niche, doesn't it?” Ruan Ningxue said with some surprise.

Although the Nebula Games Platform was currently booming, and the popularity of Minecraft was soaring.

However, according to the subsequent development Chen Xu had discussed with them in previous meetings, Nebula Games should focus on large-scale games next.

The main goal was to further increase player stickiness to the platform.

After all, for a platform, independent games and medium-to-small scale games from second and third-tier developers, while being the cornerstone of a platform.

Blockbusters that serve as the platform's facade are equally important, requiring continuous player attraction.

But hunting games, whether domestic or international, didn't seem to have any particularly outstanding titles.

“Yes, it seems the best-selling hunting game is The Wilderness (Game) from UA Company abroad, and games with this theme also seem very prone to opposition from some overseas animal protection associations.” Yang Xin nodded in agreement.

“By the way, Brother Qin, weren't you previously in charge of optimizing and researching new AI technology? The new game will definitely apply it, right?” Lin Tao, who was nearby, suddenly thought of something and asked Qin Yi, who had been silent.

Hearing that someone finally asked him, Qin Yi, who had been silent, smiled and lightly coughed twice: “Ahem, of course! The performance of the new AI technology will definitely be very experienced. Actually, it's understood that Mr. Chen's initial plan seemed to be to create a game that could utilize a large number of NPCs.”

“However, during testing, we found that the current technical capabilities were still a bit lacking, even for VR platforms. Although it wasn't impossible to make compromises, the greatest AI expressiveness would be lost. So, in the end, Mr. Chen proposed a fallback solution: to apply the AI's performance to specific monsters, allowing players to experience the joy of hunting. That's how we finally settled on a hunting game.” Qin Yi recalled his previous conversation with Chen Xu in the office, and he, too, had an excited expression.

“I see!” Ruan Ningxue and the others suddenly understood, and various images began to form in their minds.

“The latest AI technology, providing players with a vivid hunting experience, seems to indeed be quite interesting,” Lin Tao speculated.

“Lions, tigers, we can even be bolder, for example, the extinct saber-toothed tigers and mammoths, all these could become hunting prey!” Yang Xin made a bold hypothesis.

“But what about the game's background?” Ruan Ningxue considered this aspect.

“That's simple! Time travel machines! Just like current poachers, in the future, time travel machines have been successfully developed. However, criminals use these time travel machines to go back in time to hunt rare and extinct animals from the future. But this creates a time paradox, causing the information about these creatures to completely vanish in the future. So, the player's role is to stop these time poachers from existing.” Yang Xin's imagination ran wild.

“Sister Xin, isn't this turning into an action-adventure game? Mr. Chen was talking about a hunting game. This becomes about restricting poachers; we can't exactly break the law ourselves, can we?” Ruan Ningxue said.

“So, let players act as poachers? That won't work either, those 'three views' aren't very upright,” Yang Xin scratched her head.

Meanwhile, in the lounge, while Ruan Ningxue and the others were still making bold hypotheses and careful conjectures.

In the office, Chen Xu was refining the concept drafts for the upcoming game.

“Monster Hunter: World,” the project name for the game to be developed next, was displayed on the computer screen.

In reality, before this, thanks to the latest AI technology, Chen Xu had originally planned to develop other types of games.

For example, an open-world game.

Compared to sandbox games, open-world games can certainly be described as an equally great game genre.

Yet, they are fundamentally opposite to sandbox games.

Both share a common core: to make players feel free.

However, they also have completely different points of conflict.

That is, sandbox games are about *creating* a world, while open-world games are about designers *creating* a world and letting players become a part of it.

This is why many players often confuse the three different genres: sandbox, box garden game, and open-world.

And to present players with a vivid and lifelike open world, NPCs are an indispensable element.

With the latest AI technology, if NPCs in the game could behave more logically, it would undoubtedly lead to an explosion in player immersion.

Because a vibrant world is the standard for open-world games; of course, exploration and puzzle-solving like in Breath of the Wild fall into another major direction.

However, after testing, given current technology and player hardware standards, it was still insufficient to achieve the effect Chen Xu desired.

Yet, for a small number of individual or multiple creatures, demonstrating AI behavior was entirely feasible.

Therefore, after conducting some tests, Chen Xu decided to choose Monster Hunter, as it seemed quite compatible with current feedback.

As for why he chose Monster Hunter: World, it was mainly because it was quite special.

Monster Hunter: World was absolutely a landmark title in the Monster Hunter series.

One could even say that its appearance directly saved the Monster Hunter series, which was on the verge of dying out.

In his previous life, Monster Hunter had always been released on handheld console platforms, but the sales of the entire series had been continuously declining, reaching a peak of 5 million with P3, but failing to reach even 2 million by XX.

So, the series finally decided to make a revolutionary breakthrough: bidding farewell to the weak performance of handheld consoles and launching console and PC versions instead.

Ultimately, Monster Hunter: World captivated all players.

Because it was with this title that players truly felt how magnificent the Elder Dragons they once hunted actually were.

And how splendid the world where Elder Dragons resided actually was.

At the same time, some targeted optimizations were made for the new Monster Hunter, such as removing loading zones, and finally, there was no longer a need to ding and strike an awkward pose when drinking potions.

While preserving the original core fun, many negative experiences were optimized, making the overall game combat much smoother.

Of course, reduced difficulty was also a factor, as previous titles in the series still featured difficulties like Super Special and G-Rank 140.

In comparison, the Arch-Tempered monster mechanic in Monster Hunter: World was far too gentle.

After all, in Super Special and G-Rank 140 difficulty modes, our cute little Hunter might have to return to camp to regroup if merely grazed by a dragon's foot, tail, or wing. How could a normal player endure that?

Taking more care of the beginner's experience, coupled with a seamless open world, a complete and vibrant ecological chain, and thrilling hunting experiences.

Made Monster Hunter: World the best-selling title in the series.

First-month sales exceeded 7.5 million.

In just one month, it broke the series' previous highest sales record.
