Chapter 259: We Are a Professional Team! (Sixth Update, Requesting Subscriptions)

After the four large characters appeared, Song Ren rode the Palico cart back to camp, then chose to abandon the hunt and withdraw.

Returning to Astera Base, he went to the storage box and restocked all the supplies he had used earlier.

He then alt-tabbed out of the game and entered the voice channel, where Song Ren unmuted his microphones.

“Folks? What are you all doing right now?”

Yes!

He was going to call for backup!

Song Ren felt he still couldn't defeat the Diablos alone.

But what did that matter?

Anjanath, Odogaron – hadn't he been unable to defeat any of them back then?

And what happened in the end?

Didn't they all die tragically at the hands of the righteous hunting squad?

Diablos, today would be no exception!

After about ten seconds, everyone started to respond.

“Doing quests? What’s up, Old Song?” Joey asked.

“I just finished Anjanath and am about to go back and craft new equipment for my Palico,” Wang Han replied.

At this moment, Zhang Yi, who knew Song Ren best, chuckled: “Old Song, did you get stuck on a quest again and die?”

How could he not understand his old friend?

The moment he spoke, he knew what might have happened.

“Ahem, how can a hunter being exhausted from not eating enough and being sent home by their Palico be described as ‘dying’?” Song Ren lightly coughed twice to cover his embarrassment, then immediately changed the subject.

“Old Zhang, I’m not just making excuses this time. The Diablos and Rathalos quests after Odogaron are definitely not ordinary in difficulty. If you don’t believe me, just try them yourself, they’re damn hard! Seriously difficult! I suspect that Diablos isn’t vegetarian; it eats poop, constantly doing Dragon Charges, and its attack power is incredibly high!” Song Ren added.

“Is it as mystical as you say?” Zhang Yi expressed doubt.

“It’s really powerful!” Song Ren said, simultaneously inviting Zhang Yi and the others.

Soon, everyone gathered at Astera Settlement.

“Let me tell you about Diablos’s attack methods. It can basically attack with its entire body, nowhere is safe to stand, and it does Dragon Charges without warning, and also burrowing attacks. The damage is very high. I think we need to make a plan,” Song Ren said to everyone.

“Hmm, indeed, we need to make a plan. After all, you’re a Longsword Hero, and we can’t take that Spirit Roundslash,” Zhang Yi agreed.

“Ahem, I’ll get my Red Blade ready with other small monsters beforehand. During the fight, unless you disengage from combat, I won’t use Spirit Roundslash,” Song Ren coughed awkwardly.

“When we fight, try to do it on a slope. That way, I can do my Dual Blades back-scrubber attacks,” Joey offered his opinion.

“Exactly, on a slope, I can also use my hammer spinning attack,” Wang Han added.

“When we knock the Diablos down, I’ll go for a True Charged Slash to sever its tail. As for the front, leave it to me. The Great Sword’s blocking is domineering, and the Tackle, although I’m not very skilled with it yet, its hyper armor and damage reduction are undeniable,” Zhang Yi assigned his tasks.

“If it’s down, I can hammer its head!” Wang Han added.

“Then I’ll target the sides of the Diablos. When everyone’s health drops to half, sheathe your weapons and heal.”

The four of them, one after another, quickly finalized the Diablos hunting plan.

Professionalism, what was professionalism?

This was professionalism!

Reasonable class divisions, a perfect battle plan.

Looking at his three teammates, Song Ren couldn't help but sigh with emotion. This time, the Diablos was surely doomed.

They chose their Felyne Canteen meals according to their different roles.

Zhang Yi, wielding a Great Sword, chose the 6-fish meal for defense.

The others opted for the more balanced Hunter's Meal.

Arriving at the Diablos’s nest, the four spread out slightly and drew their weapons.

However, Song Ren noticed that the Diablos in front of them reacted a little differently than when he faced it alone.

When he challenged the Diablos by himself before, it would basically just charge in the moment it saw him.

But now, facing four people, the Diablos in front of them was like the Great Jagras they encountered earlier; it didn't immediately attack but observed from a distance.

“This Diablos, seeing there are many of us, isn’t actively attacking? What the heck, it bullies the weak and fears the strong! You were so aggressive before!” Song Ren exclaimed, looking at the Diablos in its nest.

After Zhang Yi and the others got into position, Song Ren prepared to run over and aggro the Diablos, drawing it closer.

Because their current location had a slope, both the Dual Blades and Hammer users could better utilize their skill advantages by using the slope, whether for charged attacks, spinning attacks, or back-scrubbing.

Running to the side of the Diablos, he didn't use his Long Sword to aggro. Instead, he shot it in the face with his wrist-mounted mechanism.

Accompanied by a dragon roar, the enraged Diablos charged towards Song Ren and his team.

“Old Song, the aggro is on you, pull it a bit closer!”

As the hunt began, Zhang Yi shouted loudly, seeing the Diablos lock its aggro onto Song Ren.

“No problem!” Song Ren yelled in the voice channel, then sheathed his Long Sword and ran towards his teammates, preparing for them to deal damage more effectively.

“Watch my back-scrubber!” Joey, wielding his Dual Blades, charged forward, performing a sliding tackle jump back-scrubber.

Just like the Radobaan in the Rotten Vale, the blade flashes were dazzling, and the “ding-ding-ding” sounds were incessant, though the weapon quality was slightly low.

Upon closer inspection, -2, -4, -5, -3, all white damage numbers in single digits, occasionally interspersed with a yellow weak spot hitzone damage.

“Watch my spinning attack!” Wang Han, who had been charging, started spinning with her hammer, targeting the Diablos’s feet.

The damage was quite good: -13, -10, -11, at least breaking into double digits.

One hammer, one Dual Blades, truly the dual heroes of back-scrubbing and foot-trimming.

“Everyone move aside, at critical moments, you still need to see the power of my Great Sword!” Zhang Yi charged forward, carrying his Great Sword. He performed basic attacks, Tackles, charged attacks, then Tackles and charged attacks again, aiming to quickly build up to a True Charged Slash.

But the next moment, Zhang Yi saw his character fly through the air.

Just as he was in a charging stance, he was directly sent flying by the Diablos, and his health bar instantly dropped a large chunk.

“Holy cow, that damage!” Like Song Ren before him, Zhang Yi was stunned.

This damage was unreasonable!

He had maxed out his armor, and he had even eaten a 6-fish meal!

It dropped a quarter of his health in one hit?

While Zhang Yi was still doubting life itself because of the Diablos’s damage, he then saw Joey fly up, and with one thrust from the Diablos, his left health bar instantly lost half.

“Ah! Sister Xin, your hammer charge hit me!” Joey’s voice was slightly desperate.

“I didn’t mean to! Your Dual Blades are always flailing around!” Wang Han explained, but no sooner had she spoken than she was grazed by a flurry of blade flashes, fell into a flinch, and then was gored by the Diablos’s huge horns, instantly losing half her health.

“No, Old Song, didn’t you say you wouldn’t use Spirit Roundslash!?” Wang Han was also bewildered.

“No, I didn’t use it! The Long Sword’s attack range is just that big. I kept getting weapon bounce here, so I could only hit there!” Song Ren protested, feeling very wronged.

The scene was chaotic for a moment.

“Old Song, hold on for a bit, we two are disengaging to heal!” Wang Han and Joey declared they were going to run away for a bit.

When playing solo, there were Palicos to assist, occasionally bringing Vigorwasps.

But in a team, the Palicos weren't there.

They had to heal themselves.

“No! Old Zhang, don’t just stand there, I can’t hold on!” Song Ren’s desperate voice came through.

Accompanied by a rising dust cloud, as if the entire underground caverns of the Wildspire Waste were shaking, the Diablos in front of them charged directly.

They saw a Longsword Hero fly into the air and land on the ground, his health bar completely depleted. Two Palicos, from who knows where, carried him onto a stretcher.

“It’s okay, Old Song, it’s easier for us to fight now that you’re dead!” Seeing Old Song exhausted and collapsed, Zhang Yi ‘comforted’ him.

This was the excellent quality of a professional team captain.

When a teammate dies, you must not put pressure on them, but rather reassure them, stating that although they died, it doesn't significantly affect the battle.
