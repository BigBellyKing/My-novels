Chapter 144: Players Will Eventually Understand Their Hearts (Seventh Update—Subscribe, Monthly Pass Please)

After completing the explanation of the concept drafts for *It Takes Two*, the entire team began operating efficiently.

Elements such as characters and their associated actions—these art assets—had already been produced before the Lunar New Year.

Currently, the team's main focus was on level design and story presentation.

The family warehouse, the courtyard's Greatwood, the corrupted garden, the Snowglobe of first love, the Medieval castle built from Lego toys...

Chen Xu explained to Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue the unique characteristics of each thematic scene in the game.

These thematic scenes weren't merely standalone environments in the game—they symbolized the emotional journey and evolving relationship between the two protagonists, May and Cody.

"The Cuckoo Clock level needs a sharp, metallic feel. Additionally, the Special Items in this level are all time-based, implying that Cody and May can start over."

"The Snowglobe scene is a metaphor for Cody and May's relationship. Once, their love burned as fiercely as flames, but now, just like the scene within the Snowglobe, it's completely frozen."

"Yet, at the end of the Snowglobe level, the ice breaks apart—an allegory indicating that the frozen layer sealing Cody and May's relationship now has hope of cracking open."

"Likewise, the Magnets in this level represent how Cody and May's relationship has shifted from initial repulsion to mutual attraction, gradually drawing them closer together."

Chen Xu went into great detail for each scene, ensuring Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue fully understood the effects he was aiming for.

Once the scene requirements and the deeper meanings of the story were fully conveyed,

there was no need to overthink anything. They could simply follow the established guidelines, making minor adjustments based on Chen Xu's simple drafts.

No need for second or third revisions—no need to discard prior work and start from scratch.

Even though this wasn't the first time they'd experienced it—during *Dark Souls*' development, they'd already felt it deeply—the employees of the Art Team were still profoundly moved.

With such a work experience, it didn't matter that Nebula Games' compensation was already above average. Even if it were slightly below average, there'd still be no reason to leave.

………………

As development of *It Takes Two* progressed steadily, in the weeks following the Lunar New Year, many players across various gaming forums and communities found themselves lost, trapped in a game drought.

Although several game companies had released new titles during this period, the pre-holiday releases of *Dark Souls* and the two VR blockbusters from TengHua and NetDragon had spoiled players' expectations.

"Boring! Does anyone have any new game recommendations?"

"Nothing good lately. The few games that launched recently look pretty underwhelming."

"No choice. Even though some studios under TengHua and NetDragon have new projects, I don't think the quality is anything special."

"Yeah, at least last year we had *Overcooked*. This year, there's nothing."

"Don't even mention *Overcooked*—I've been washing dishes nonstop for a whole year because of that game!"

"By the way, it's already post-holiday. Why hasn't Chen Xu made any move?"

"Yeah, all the developers at the Game of the Year event had trailers for new games. Only Chen Xu hasn't made a peep—aside from the new mode in *Dark Souls*, not even a fart has come out."

"I bet he's saving up for a big move. Maybe the *Dark Souls* sequel is coming!"

"*Dark Souls* is too hard. I'd rather play some family-friendly games, like *Fall Guys*."

Not only were players discussing this across various communities, but on Chen Xu's official Weibo account, countless fans were @-mentioning him daily, asking about Nebula Games' next project.

Among them, a large number were eagerly anticipating the *Dark Souls* sequel.

Seeing all these @-mentions, Chen Xu thought for a moment, then decided to drop a hint.

He posted a new official Weibo message, which read:

"New game is being made—a couple's co-op game that lets you experience warmth and friendship. Latest news will drop on Valentine's Day. Stay tuned."

Alongside the text, Chen Xu attached an image: a clay doll and a wooden doll holding onto a dandelion, floating through the air.

The moment this post went live, it exploded, drawing countless replies from players who had been closely watching Chen Xu's every move.

"Damn it! Look what I just unearthed! A new game is coming!?"

"Wait! Couple's co-op? Valentine's Day!? WTF! Chen Xu, do you know I just got a girlfriend? Are you trying to make me single again!?!"

"Judging from the image, the cartoon art style looks super wholesome, but the blood and tears of *Overcooked* taught us—it's a huge trap!"

"Once a year, here you come again this Valentine's!"

"It's that time of year again to bring back the old meme. Everyone, fill in the blank: Chen Xu's nickname is ____?"

"Last year's *Overcooked* made me wash every single dish in my house. This year, are you trying to make me do all the laundry too?"

Players erupted into chaos—after all, last year at this time, a game with similar promises had left them with such a deep impression.

But jokes aside, on gaming media websites, the topic of 'Chen Xu's new game' continued to gain momentum.

Within the gaming industry, the news quickly spread.

"Heard it? Chen Xu's new game is another two-player co-op."

"Not the *Dark Souls* sequel?"

"Probably another transitional mini-game, just like last year's *Overcooked*?"

"I wonder if Chen Xu's unnamed game this year can break new ground?"

"What are you thinking? Two-player co-op—basically just last year's *Overcooked* with a new theme and mode. How much new ground could it possibly break?"

Industry insiders and players alike discussed Chen Xu's new game, but most impressions still centered around last year's *Overcooked*.

After all, the timing and the wording made it hard not to draw that connection.

But Chen Xu remained unfazed. Once the game officially launched, all misunderstandings would be cleared. At that moment, players would finally understand their hearts—and realize why he was called: Warrior of Love!

……………………

Amid intense player speculation, time quickly arrived at February 14th—Valentine's Day.

At noon, Chen Xu and Nebula Games simultaneously posted a message on their official Weibo accounts.

The message was simple: Trailer.

Three words, followed by a video.

After a brief black screen, a wooden door appeared.

As the door opened, a book with a face came into view.

At the top, it read: 'Book of Love'.

"This is a story of a magical kingdom."

The Book of Love extended its hands as if welcoming the viewers, while the camera rapidly pulled back.

Lighthouses, bell towers, cartoon art style—the entire scene looked like a dream.

"It features many wizards and warriors."

The camera moved into a room where two doll figures—one clay, one wooden—dressed in wizard robes and armor wielding a burning greatsword, battled a cartoon monster in an arena-like setting.

"This epic legend unfolds across the sea."

A small sailboat made of building blocks raced across the ocean, dodging a shark with its jaws wide open and a massive octopus monster with long tentacles.

"And it's also a journey through time."

A path made of countless gears appeared, seemingly inside a grandfather clock.

"Biubiubiu! It even includes a winter dream—building a sled and such."

On an icy and snowy track, a sled sped forward.

The next moment, countless fragmented scenes flashed by—railway tracks through tunnels, spiders in the forest, bats on platforms.

"Wait... did I mention there'll be a big explosion too?"

On a platform constructed from Brass Pipes, a rumble sounded as massive flames erupted, sending the two doll figures flying from the shockwave.

"Wait a second, look at these dolls... I almost forgot—they were once human."

The camera froze on the two flying dolls as a photo appeared.

A man and woman, dressed in wedding dress and suit, smiled brightly in front of a cake.

But the photo cracked in half, separating them.

"Alright, alright... you want to know the theme of this story?"

"It's Cody and May's story."

The camera focused on the two frightened doll figures.

"Want to turn back? Then you must first repair your relationship..."

"It's a story about passion..."

"It's a story about attraction..."

"It's a story about cooperation..."

As a rapid series of game graphics flashed by, the Nebula Games logo appeared.

The game title launched: *It Takes Two*
