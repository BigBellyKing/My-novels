Chapter 243: Preparing to Head to the New World! (Fifth update, please subscribe for monthly passes)

On Chen Xu's and Nebula Games' official Weibo accounts, a message was posted that day.

The content was very simple: 'Preparing to head to the New World!'

Countless players who had long grown impatient were already excited just by seeing this one sentence.

"It's here, it's here! It's finally here!"

"I wonder what the gameplay of this game will be like!"

"Haha, I have a feeling it's going to be a bit exciting!"

"Heading to the New World! Going to hunt Elder Dragons, I want to be the Azure Star!"

With excited hearts, countless players clicked on the video.

First, a black screen appeared, followed by Nebula Games' game LOGO, and a very prominent Nebula Games Platform logo.

Then came the main part of the video.

A gentle breeze blew, rustling the grass and trees.

In a silent ancient forest, a Hunter, carrying a Great Sword on his back, walked through vines into the tranquil depths of the forest.

It was an island, where giant arbors and vines formed an ancient jungle.

Strange creatures and lush green plants were everywhere, with dangling vines and dense, verdant grass.

Guided by Scoutflies glowing with green light.

The Hunter continued to delve deeper into the forest.

Plants, birds, beasts.

Nothing seemed connected to anything in the real world.

Clearly, this was a brand new world, where everything was unrelated to reality.

After arriving at a Great Jagras's Den.

The Hunter began to run outwards, simultaneously using an item in hand to attract the prey's attention.

As the Jagras in the den got up one after another, the Hunter quietly hid in the tall grass nearby.

Only after all the Jagras had dispersed did the Hunter continue searching for information.

Finally, after traversing the complex forest, the Hunter found his prey.

A colossal creature resembling a Tyrannosaurus Rex.

The camera gave it a close-up, and the subtitles appearing next to it also let players know its name: Anjanath.

The Hunter donned a Ghillie Mantle, resembling green leaves, and cautiously approached the Anjanath.

Finally seizing an opportunity, the Hunter attacked the Anjanath, brutally striking its head with his Great Sword.

But it didn't cause very effective damage; instead, it enraged the colossal beast.

Letting out an earth-shattering roar, the Anjanath, having located the Hunter, charged ferociously.

But all of this was already within the Hunter's calculations. The Hunter showed no panic watching the charging Anjanath, performing two rolls on the ground to get away.

The Anjanath, which had been charging, was instead caught by a Vine Trap and slammed to the ground.

The Anjanath on the ground constantly thrashed its limbs, trying to break free, while the Hunter seized this chance to relentlessly unleash damage with his Great Sword.

As the Hunter's Great Sword hacked and slashed, the Anjanath quickly became covered in wounds. However, instead of weakening, the injured Anjanath grew even more frenzied.

The Anjanath, having broken free from the vines, continuously attacked the Hunter, who for a moment found it difficult to parry.

Although the Hunter seemed to be at a disadvantage, he was as unperturbed as before. While dodging the Anjanath's attacks, he observed his surroundings.

Finally, traversing forests and canyons, the Hunter lured the Anjanath to the territory of another monster—a Rathalos.

The behemoth on the ground and the flame-spitting Rathalos in the sky immediately clashed.

The Hunter from before had by now cautiously disengaged from the battle.

He took out a Flare from his person and fired it into the sky.

The scene switched: three Wingdrakes appeared in the sky.

And flew towards the outside of the forest.

A moment later, the three Wingdrakes returned the way they came.

Below the Wingdrakes, three Hunters carrying Long Swords were clinging to claws and rushing towards them.

As the Three Longsword Heroes descended from the sky, leaving three dashing figures behind.

The camera then returned to the Rathalos's camp, where the Anjanath and Rathalos were still fighting.

The Hunter, by now hidden far away, pulled out a Folding Stool and a Portable Grill from somewhere unknown, and was seriously engaged in roasting meat.

At the same time, the game's title appeared in the center of the screen.

*Monster Hunter: World*!

Then, accompanied by a roar from the Rathalos, a burst of flames erupted from its mouth.

The next moment, a line of text appeared in the center of the screen: Demo version available on August 1st.

Then, amidst the joyful BGM, the Hunter finally cooked the meat in his hands.

The golden, crispy roasted meat was even dripping with oil.

As the Hunter heartily devoured the food.

Another line of text appeared in the center of the screen: *Monster Hunter: World* officially launches on August 7th.

………………

The newly revealed promotional trailer immediately thrilled the players.

Before this, many players had all sorts of speculations about the game.

But those were just speculations.

Now, the appearance of this promotional video made many players incredibly excited.

If it were a promotional video from another game developer, players might not be so thrilled, but this was Nebula Games!

Every promotional video they released was essentially consistent with the actual content; it could entirely be considered real actual gameplay demonstration.

That's why players were so excited.

Furthermore, this video basically showcased the gameplay and complete ecosystem of *Monster Hunter: World*.

In terms of environment, *Monster Hunter: World*'s main setting was a dense forest, with monsters primarily consisting of dragon-like creatures.

Secondly, within the game, *Monster Hunter: World* also showcased its gameplay.

Searching for prey and hunting, it could be said to be quite complete.

Another aspect was the combat system.

It mainly focused on cold weapons, but looking at the attack patterns in the game, it didn't seem like the simple Basic Attack in *Dark Souls*; there appeared to be more complex move combinations, similar to input commands in fighting and action games, and players could also use environmental traps to attack monsters.

One could even perform a "borrowed knife to kill" move, letting other monsters help deal with the prey.

Finally, the appearance of Wingdrakes carrying three Long Sword teammates represented the game's online multiplayer gameplay.

As for the roasting meat in the game, it indicated that the game also had some mini-game elements, not just hunting.

Of course, the most thrilling point for players was the direct announcement of the launch date at the end of the promotional video.

Moreover, just like with *Minecraft* before, players could also download a demo version.

However, a slight difference was that, according to the introduction, this demo version was only for players to understand the game, and anyone could download it.

It was clearly meant to let players understand more clearly what kind of game *Monster Hunter: World* truly was.

If it suited their taste, they could pre-order directly; if not, then so be it.
