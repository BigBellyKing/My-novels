Chapter 243: Preparing to Head to the New World! (Fifth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)

On that day, Nebula Games posted a simple message on its official Weibo account.

The content was extremely brief: 'Preparing to Head to the New World!'

Countless players, who had been waiting impatiently, were instantly thrilled just by reading this one sentence.

"It's here! It's finally here!"

"I wonder what the gameplay of this game will be like!"

"Haha, it feels so exciting!"

"Heading to the New World! Time to hunt Elder Dragons—I'm going to become the Azure Star!"

Amidst their excitement, countless players eagerly clicked on the video.

First came a black screen, followed by the appearance of Nebula Games' game LOGO and the unmistakable Nebula Games Platform emblem.

Then, the main video began.

A gentle breeze blew, rustling the leaves and grass.

In a tranquil ancient forest, a Hunter carrying a Great Sword walked through thick vines, advancing deep into the serene woods.

It was an island, where towering trees and tangled vines formed a primeval jungle.

Strange creatures and lush green plants surrounded the area, with hanging vines and dense grass everywhere.

Then, guided by glowing green Scoutflies, the Hunter ventured deeper into the forest.

Plants, birds, beasts—everything here bore no resemblance to the real-world.

Clearly, this was a completely new world, utterly disconnected from reality.

When the Hunter reached the nest of a Great Jagras, he began running away, using items in his hand to draw the creature's attention.

As the Jagras inside the nest rose, the Hunter quietly hid in the tall grass nearby.

Only after all the Jagras dispersed did the Hunter resume his search.

Finally, after navigating the complex forest, the Hunter found his prey.

A colossal creature resembling a Tyrannosaurus Rex.

The camera gave a close-up of the creature, while subtitles on the side revealed its name: Anjanath.

The Hunter donned a Ghillie Mantle resembling green leaves and cautiously approached the Anjanath.

Seizing the moment, the Hunter launched an attack, bringing his Great Sword down hard on the Anjanath's head.

But the damage was minimal, and instead, the massive beast was enraged.

Letting out a thunderous roar, the Anjanath spotted the Hunter and charged toward him with brutal ferocity.

Yet this was exactly what the Hunter had anticipated. He remained completely calm as the beast rushed forward. With two quick rolls backward, he evaded the charge.

The charging Anjanath was suddenly caught and tripped by a Vine Trap, crashing heavily to the ground.

Struggling furiously, the beast kicked and thrashed to free itself, while the Hunter seized the opportunity to unleash relentless damage with his Great Sword.

As the Hunter's sword struck repeatedly, the Anjanath quickly became covered in wounds. But instead of weakening, the injured beast grew even more furious.

Breaking free from the vines, the Anjanath launched relentless attacks at the Hunter, who for a moment struggled to keep up.

Though seemingly at a disadvantage, the Hunter remained as calm as before, dodging the Anjanath's attacks while carefully observing his surroundings.

Eventually, weaving through forests and canyons, the Hunter lured the Anjanath into the territory of another monster—the Rathalos.

The giant beast on the ground and the flame-spewing Rathalos in the sky immediately clashed in a fierce battle.

Meanwhile, the Hunter had already quietly retreated far from the battlefield.

He pulled out a Flare from his gear and fired it into the sky.

The scene shifted—three Wingdrakes appeared in the sky, flying away from the forest.

After a moment, the three Wingdrakes returned along the same path.

Hanging beneath them were three Hunters, each gripping a claw, all carrying Long Swords, swiftly approaching.

As the Three Longsword Heroes descended from the sky, they left behind three cool, confident silhouettes.

The camera then returned to the Rathalos' camp, where the Anjanath and Rathalos continued their fierce battle.

Meanwhile, the Hunter had retreated to a safe distance. From somewhere, he pulled out a Folding Stool and a Portable Grill, calmly beginning to prepare some roasting meat.

At that moment, the game's title appeared in the center of the screen.

'Monster Hunter: World'!

Then, accompanied by a furious roar from the Rathalos, a burst of flames erupted from its mouth.

The next moment, a line of text appeared in the center of the screen: Trial Version Available August 1st.

Then, to a cheerful BGM, the Hunter finally finished roasting the meat.

Golden and crispy, the roasted meat glistened, dripping with oil.

As the Hunter began to feast heartily,

Another line of text appeared in the center of the screen: 'Monster Hunter: World' Officially Launches August 7th.

………………

The first revealed promotional video instantly electrified the players.

Previously, players had been speculating wildly about the game.

But those were just speculations.

Now, with the release of this promotional video, many players were ecstatic.

If this were a promotional video from any other game developers, players might not have been so excited—but this was Nebula Games!

Every one of their promotional videos closely matched the actual gameplay, essentially serving as actual gameplay demonstrations.

That was why the players were so thrilled.

Moreover, judging from this video, it essentially showcased the gameplay and complete ecosystem of Monster Hunter: World.

In terms of scenes, the primary setting of Monster Hunter: World was a dense forest, with dragon species as the main monsters.

Additionally, the video demonstrated the gameplay mechanics—tracking prey and hunting. It all felt remarkably complete.

Then there was the Combat System.

The game primarily relied on melee weapons. However, judging from the attack patterns shown, it didn't seem like the simple basic attacks seen in Dark Souls. Instead, it appeared to feature more complex combinations of moves—similar to input commands in fighting and action games. Players could also use environmental traps to attack monsters.

Even better, players could employ the 'Borrowed Knife to Kill' tactic, letting other monsters fight their prey for them.

Finally, the arrival of the Wingdrakes carrying three Long Sword teammates indicated the game's online multiplayer functionality.

As for the roasting meat scene, it suggested that the game also included mini-games, offering more than just hunting.

Of course, the most exciting part for players was that the promotional video directly announced the official launch date.

And just like with Minecraft, players could download a demo version to try out.

However, there was a slight difference—according to the description, this trial version was designed purely to help players understand the game and was freely available for anyone to download.

It was clearly intended to let players better understand exactly what kind of game Monster Hunter: World truly was.

If it suited their taste, they could pre-order it immediately. If not, they could simply pass.
