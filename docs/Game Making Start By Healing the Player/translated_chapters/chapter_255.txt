Chapter 254: This Is Persecuting Long Sword Players! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)

With Monster Hunter: World officially launched, countless players were immersed in the magnificent New World.

And for many players, the first thing they did upon entering the game was naturally to invite friends and hunt together.

Regarding this, Chen Xu had made some improvements compared to the original version.

If friends were grouping up, the party leader could directly invite three other Hunters to join their Astera Settlement, then set off together.

Unlike before, where each quest had to be accepted first before inviting others.

Of course, during quests, sending a distress signal still came with the flashy appearance of the Wingdrake.

However, many players discovered while playing that this team-up mode was slightly different from what they had imagined.

"Wait! Sister Han, why did you steal the Aggro from the boss!?"

In the voice channel, Zhang Yi, who was hunting with Song Ren and the others, heard Joey's desperate cry.

Facing the Great Jagras, Joey, wielding Dual Blades, had just activated Demon Mode, red light flashing across his body, and charged forward with a Demon Dance combo.

The first Horizontal Slash landed successfully, but then Wang Han, wielding a Hammer, struck the Great Jagras' backside. Instantly, the monster turned and charged straight at Wang Han.

The group then watched as Joey's Dual Blades swung wildly at air, performing what looked like a cringey dance.

Everyone: ..........

Wang Han was speechless: "Hey, it's not my fault! I don't control who the boss attacks!"

But as soon as she finished speaking, the Great Jagras turned and rammed her Hunter, sending her flying far away.

"Let me handle it! Watch the true might of my Great Sword! Old Song, pay attention—witness who truly wields the greatest weapon in the New World!" Zhang Yi shouted, hoisting his Great Sword, taller than himself, and charging forward.

Standing before the Great Jagras, he immediately began charging up. The Great Sword was all about dominance—small blade 50, great blade 100.

Aim… close eyes… charge… end the fight!

When this slash lands, you might die!

The charged attack completed, his Great Sword, glowing with energy, crashed down onto the ground.

Dirt and puddle water splashed over a meter high, leaving a small crater in the earth.

"This is your Great Sword? Are you trying to kill me with laughter!?" Song Ren, who had stayed out of the fight until now, could finally contain himself no longer.

The voice channel filled with his loud, bell-like laughter.

"Accident! It was just an accident!" Zhang Yi was slightly embarrassed. He had just bragged, then completely missed—how awkward!

But mainly because in this multiplayer mode, Zhang Yi realized something—these monsters were genuinely harder to fight.

In Single-Player Mode, the Palico was somewhat annoying.

But the Palico mostly stayed by his side, motionless.

The monster would just stand there and take hits, sometimes stealing Aggro, sometimes acting like a wooden training dummy.

But multiplayer with real players was entirely different!

When facing monsters, players would dodge attacks with rolling.

And naturally, dodging created distance between them and the boss. The player holding Aggro would kite the monster, but the one preparing a charged attack nearby would end up hitting the ground uselessly—a truly awkward situation.

"No need to explain! Explanation is just covering up! Watch the power of a true Longsword Hero! With one Long Sword, a single man becomes a magnificent performance—just watch me shine!" Song Ren, wielding a Long Sword, sharpened his blade on the Whetstone beside them.

Even though sharpness was full, he wasn't doing it for efficiency—he sought the elegance of the Sheathing animation after sharpening.

How潇洒, how cool!

This was him—a legendary Longsword Hero of the New World!

"Your Great Sword is useless! Watch my Sledge's Spinning attack!" Wang Han, witnessing Zhang Yi's failed ground strike, burst into laughter as she slowly charged forward, dragging her Hammer toward the Great Jagras.

At that moment, Song Ren, having completed his Sheathing animation, finally unleashed his attack.

"Slash, chop, Diagonal Slash, Spirit Roundslash!" In-game, Song Ren shouted each move with intense sense of immersion.

The Long Sword Hero on screen performed a stylish slashing combo, filling the Spirit Gauge, then executed a Spirit Roundslash.

Then...

All three nearby teammates immediately fell to the ground, stunned. Wang Han, who was charging up for her Spinning attack, was also frozen in place.

The Spirit Roundslash, centered on himself, left nothing standing in its radius.

"Damn it! Old Song, your Long Sword is simply unbelievable!" Zhang Yi, who had just been hit with flinch and then rammed away by the Great Jagras, was stunned.

Joey, who had been preparing to activate Demon Mode and dance again, and Wang Han, readying her Sledge's Spinning attack, were both completely bewildered.

Only now did they realize—though Monster Hunter: World had no official Friendly fire, hitting teammates could still interrupt moves and cause flinch/stun.

"Ah, don't mind the details! Just move aside and let me handle it! One Long Sword, one man—this is the ultimate performance! Just watch me shine!" Having successfully triggered Spirit Gauge State with the Spirit Roundslash, Song Ren struck a pose, preparing to deliver burst damage with a flashy Helm Breaker.

He performed two rolling dodges to create distance from the Great Jagras, then launched a Spirit Thrust.

The Hunter in-game stepped back slightly, gripped his Long Sword with both hands, and dashed forward.

The sharp blade pierced deep into the Great Jagras' body. Then, the Hunter planted his feet on the monster's form, using the momentum to leap into the air. Gripping the sword with both hands, he swung downward like a falling meteor.

Then...

The Hunter in-game gripped his Long Sword and slammed it hard into the ground.

"This is your ultimate Long Sword performance? Oh, come on!" Seeing Song Ren miss completely, Zhang Yi couldn't help but laugh.

"Accident! Just an accident! Didn't you also whiff your charged attack!? Hey! What are you guys doing?! Stop slacking off! Help me with damage! We've been fighting forever and this dragon doesn't even have a single wound!" Song Ren turned around, only to find himself utterly dumbfounded.

Behind him, one teammate was using a Capture net to catch rabbits.

Another had pulled out a Folding Stool and grill, roasting meat.

And the third had taken out a fishing rod and was slowly walking toward the edge of the jungle, seemingly heading to the seaside to fish.

"Well then, stop using Spirit Roundslash!" Zhang Yi said, exasperated at Song Ren.

"Exactly! That spinning move locks us in place—we can't move at all!" Wang Han agreed.

"That's right!" Joey nodded.

"How can that be!? The Long Sword relies on Spirit Roundslash to trigger Spirit Gauge State! Even after a successful Foresight Slash, you're supposed to follow up with a big spin!" Song Ren protested.

The Long Sword depended on the Spirit Roundslash to activate its power—without it, he'd be dealing very low damage the entire time?

Wouldn't that make him a useless person?

"One Long Sword, one man's performance—Old Song, I'm counting on you!" Zhang Yi chuckled.

"The Long Sword—the symbol of强者. And强者 are always lonely!" Wang Han, holding her fishing rod, slowly stepped toward the jungle's edge.

"Teammates? I don't need such things. With one Long Sword, I'll conquer the entire New World!" Joey, having successfully caught a rabbit, sighed with emotion.

"Don't do this! I'll stop using Spirit Roundslash! Just come help me!" Facing the three of them and glancing at the full of vigor Great Jagras, Song Ren finally bowed to reality.

Laughing and joking, the group continued their fight against the Great Jagras.

The battle progressed smoothly. Although monster health increased in online multiplayer, with four people, anyone with low health could simply kite and drink a potion, making the overall safety much higher.

"I suddenly feel like hunting in a four-player team isn't even as efficient as when I'm solo!" Zhang Yi sighed after the fight.

"Why is efficiency so low? Don't you three have any self-awareness?! You're persecuting us Long Sword players!" Song Ren, speaking for all Long Sword players, voiced their collective outcry.
