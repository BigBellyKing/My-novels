Chapter 72: You're a Love Guru, Aren't You?

As more streamers live-streaming _Overcooked_ and content creators making videos about it emerged, more and more players were exposed to the game.

On community forums, discussions about the game were rampant. 'Breakup' and 'Friendship over' became keywords for this game.

Especially as the game's popularity soared, _Tieba_, forums, and various Q&A communities were filled with stories concocted by players.

For example, tales of 'how my girlfriend and I were deeply in love, but after playing _Overcooked_, our friendship ended, and we broke up.' Of course, some genuine cases did occur, but for couples who truly broke up because of _Overcooked_, the game was merely a lit fuse. Their relationship itself was already like gunpowder, ready to explode at a touch.

However, this did not hinder the spread of the _Overcooked_ meme. After Valentine's Day, _Overcooked_'s popularity climbed exponentially every day. Major communities were also filled with players' joyful discussions.

In addition, in various live streaming rooms, as streamers and video UP hosts got into heated arguments over certain game content, a plethora of viewers would timely send bullet comments like 'breakup' or 'going solo.' After all, watching drama is a human instinct.

--------------------

However, while these players were enjoying the meme and personally experiencing what it's like to play 'Breakup Kitchen,' a trending topic on the official Weibo account was pushed to the homepage of the PC game category.

'How to evaluate the Game Designer Chen Xu, who calls himself a 'Warrior of Love,' choosing to release _Overcooked_ on Valentine's Day and even shooting a beautiful and warm promotional video?'

Below this official Weibo post, players' various answers poured in.

'Don't even talk about 'Warrior of Love' to me! I was naive enough to actually believe Chen Xu made a warm and friendly game. My girlfriend and I broke up playing _Overcooked_! Chen Xu, give me back my girlfriend!'

'Bro upstairs, what's going on? Did you break your hand?'

'Exactly! Bro, don't give up on treatment. Medicine is so advanced now; hurry to the hospital, maybe they can reattach your girlfriend!'

'It's okay, bro. Anyway, you have two girlfriends; losing one doesn't matter.'

'You guys are a bit much; the original poster is already so miserable.'

'Ahem, a friendly reminder: click on this original poster's personal profile, and you'll find a surprise.'

'Holy crap, original poster, didn't your last post say you broke up with your boyfriend? Are you male or female?'

'Young man, your perspective is too narrow! Can't a guy have a boyfriend? Come add me as a friend, I'll show you some good stuff!'

'Don't stray from the topic! Anyway, I feel Chen Xu is full of malice! He already showed his true colors with _Outlast_!'

'It's not just _Outlast_. If you think carefully about the games Chen Xu developed before, savor them, really savor them.'

'That's right, that's right! Chen Xu is not a 'Warrior of Love' at all. Think about it carefully, all the games Chen Xu has developed so far are like knives!'

'Exactly! Seemingly heartwarming _To the Moon_ ultimately only gave Johnny false memories; its essence is still a tragedy! Even _Undertale_ has a bad Genocide Ending. As for _Mirror_? Kill the Netorare Warrior, Pure Love Warriors never retreat!'

'Exactly! Strongly suggest the Game Department take action. Chen Xu's games are really too dangerous. _Outlast_ only tried to scare us to death with a game, but with _Overcooked_, he wants us to engage in real-person PK!'

This Super Topic garnered over 20,000 comments in just one day.

Of course, there were also some dissenting voices. Many players stated that _Overcooked_ wasn't that exaggerated, and they had a lot of fun collaborating and messing with each other when playing with friends and lovers.

However, these comments were clearly somewhat isolated and unsupported. The main trend of opinion was that they would no longer believe Chen Xu was a 'Warrior of Love.'

Nebula Games Company.

At this time, after the New Year's Holiday, employees from various departments had successively returned to work. Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin were looking at Chen Xu in the company's lounge area with mischievous smiles.

'Mr. Chen, your conspiracy has been exposed!' Yang Xin showed the Super Topic to Chen Xu.

'That's right!' Ruan Ningxue echoed.

During the development of _Overcooked_ and the filming of its promotional video, they, being naive, truly believed it was a very warm, friendly, and relationship-promoting game. They thought any issues that arose internally during development were just accidents.

But with the game's release, 'Breakup Kitchen,' 'Friendship Over Kitchen,' plus this Super Topic, made them instantly realize. Beneath _Overcooked_'s seemingly warm exterior, it was simply full of malice!

'Alas, the world is degenerating, and people's hearts are not what they used to be! You are one of the game's developers; how can you harbor such thoughts?' Chen Xu looked at the two of them and explained earnestly.

'Why do so many players say they broke up? Because their relationships already had problems!'

'Why did they break up? Because they couldn't communicate in the game, couldn't reach a consensus; because, in time-sensitive situations in the game, they blamed each other when one made a mistake, adding fuel to the fire; because they showed disdain and lost patience when one reacted slowly and couldn't keep up with the rhythm.'

'Therefore, the true core of _Overcooked_ is to teach couples and friends the true meaning of getting along, the real preservative for friendship and love: communication, tolerance, and patience.'

'If these three elements are lost, then emotions will naturally develop cracks.'

As Chen Xu's words fell, Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue, sitting opposite him, fell silent. After a long moment, Yang Xin looked at Chen Xu with a very strange gaze: 'You… you are the legendary Love Guru?'

'Chen Xu, why can you always come up with such convincing words that sound so coherent?' Ruan Ningxue also looked speechless. This scene felt a little familiar!

Before, with _Outlast_, there seemed to have been a similar explanation. Is this a Matryoshka-Style Spread?

If it weren't for the previous _Outlast_ situation, they might have found his explanation quite reasonable.

'If you find it reasonable, it means that's the truth of the matter. I am a producer who wholeheartedly considers the players!' Chen Xu said with a smile.

Neither of their expressions changed. No matter how they listened, they both felt that Chen Xu was hoodwinking them.

Um… no, it should be said he was hoodwinking the players.

Watching Chen Xu take out his phone, open the official Weibo account, rephrase his words, and send them out, the two exchanged glances.

They both understood what the other wanted to convey: From now on, they must be careful; Mr. Chen's methods of bluffing are quite extraordinary!
