Chapter 391: The Painted Cake Can Actually Be Eaten! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

As Chen Xu finished speaking, he didn’t continue to leave in suspense.

Soon, the large screen began playing a series of scenes.

In a cramped kitchen, two people worked together in perfect tacit understanding, chopping vegetables, cooking, and serving dishes.

A group of tiny figures resembling candy beans pushed and shoved each other, fighting for the crown at the top.

Cody and May, transformed into puppets and dirt people.

An Undead kneeling on one knee before a bonfire.

A Hunter in Astera Settlement grabbing onto a Wingdrake's foot, heading toward the New World.

In addition, there were also works from numerous third-party game developers.

The audience below watched, thoroughly surprised.

Of course, the releases of *Dark Souls* and *Monster Hunter: World* on Switch would likely still take some time and might involve graphical downgrades.

After all, even though the hardware capabilities of the Switch developed by Chen Xu in this Parallel World were superior to those of his previous life,

the visual presentation of *Dark Souls* and *Monster Hunter: World* in this world was also stronger than in his previous life.

Watching the scenes on the big screen, many players began quietly exchanging thoughts and discussing among themselves, their faces lit up with excitement.

Games like *It Takes Two*, *Overcooked*, and *Fall Guys* had already been ported, with clear notices displayed below.

As for *Monster Hunter: World* and *Dark Souls*, many veteran players exchanged knowing smiles.

Here it comes!

The familiar part of painting the picture!

The games haven’t arrived yet, but the promotional video has.

However, what Chen Xu said next quickly surprised many players.

"On the Switch, we will gradually port some classic games. But on the Switch, there will also be brand-new exclusive titles specially adapted for the platform."

Games specifically developed for the Switch handheld console!?

The crowd wore stunned expressions.

So the so-called new games were actually being developed specifically for the Switch!?

After seeing all the animal plushies at the exhibition site, many players had already mentally prepared themselves.

Yet upon hearing Chen Xu’s words, they were still astonished—because these so-called new games would be Switch exclusives, not launching on PC or VR platforms!

Still, this sparked intense curiosity—what kind of exclusive games could they possibly be?

After all, Chen Xu’s intention was clearly evident: to attract players to buy the Switch through the attraction of exclusive titles.

"As for the genres of the new games, I'm sure you're all quite curious. First is *Animal Forest*, a game every tough guy must play." As Chen Xu spoke, the audience stirred.

As gamers, there were still many male players present at the exhibition.

And what man doesn't consider himself a tough guy?

A game every tough guy must play! Hearing Chen Xu’s words, every player in the audience became excited.

But as the video began playing, the previously excited players froze.

Mr. Chen, could you please repeat that? This is really a game every tough guy must play?

The screen displayed gameplay footage.

A clear blue sea stretched beneath a cloudless sky, with fluffy white clouds floating overhead.

Gentle waves lapped against golden sand.

Under a coconut tree, several lounge chairs sat, one occupied by a resident leisurely sunbathing.

High in a distant Greatwood, cicadas chirped incessantly.

In front of a tent, a resident happily picked up a piece of wood from the ground and carried it inside.

On a flower-filled lawn, islanders sat at a table—some reading, others sipping afternoon tea.

By the riverside, two islanders held buckets and fished quietly.

In autumn, leaves rustled to the ground as some islanders swept them up, others catching insects with nets.

In winter, some warmed themselves by fires outside their homes, while others built snowmen.

In spring, groups carefully tended gardens and fruit trees.

At night, everyone sat on benches, admiring the moonlight.

Finally, in front of a house, everyone smiled as they took a group photo.

Image after image of joyful island life flashed across the screen, radiating harmony and heartwarming charm.

But that wasn't the main issue.

The main issue was—Mr. Chen, could you please repeat what kind of game this is a must-play for?

This is supposed to be a game for tough guys!?

Many players in the audience were completely bewildered.

But soon, they snapped back to reality. Clearly, this was just a playful joke.

Just like when Mr. Chen jokingly called himself the Warrior of Love, only to be teased by them in return.

This game titled *Animal Forest* was obviously an official, unconventional meme played by Mr. Chen himself.

However, apart from the bewildered male players, some female players were extremely excited and thrilled.

Because this art style was absolutely delightful!

All those cute little animals were simply adorable!

"Next up is a uniquely designed platformer game—*Super Mario Odyssey*! Modern cities, deserts, forests, oceans... You'll explore over a dozen distinct themed scenes, and the game also supports two-player co-op mode." As the *Animal Forest* promotional video ended, a new video began playing on the large screen under Chen Xu’s introduction.

Cheerful music filled the exhibition area as a giant hat-shaped airship appeared on screen.

"Above the Peach Princess’s castle..." appeared as a subtitle.

Then, Bowser, a giant spiked turtle wearing a suit and a white top hat, appeared on screen.

Before him stood Mario, the plumber in his red cap.

The two clashed fiercely on the deck of a castle that resembled a spaceship, but Mario was clearly no match for the mighty Bowser.

"Haha! It's over now!"

Bowser hurled his white top hat, striking Mario directly.

Peach reached out in worry.

Looking down at Mario’s red cap lying by his feet, Bowser stomped on it with one foot.

"I, the great king, shall marry Princess Peach!"

"Feel bitter about it, Mario!?"

"Hahahahaha..."

With Bowser’s slightly dramatic lines, it was clearly the classic trope: a dragon kidnaps the princess, and the hero goes to rescue her.

But this hero named Mario... honestly, didn’t quite match most players’ image of a hero.

Amidst Bowser’s maniacal laughter, the screen went dark.

Then came a rapid series of cuts, revealing one exotic world after another to the players.

The Metro Kingdom, set in a modern cityscape.

The Forest Kingdom, teeming with life.

The Seaside Kingdom, with sandy beaches and oceans.

In addition, there were the Desert Kingdom, the Snow Kingdom...

"Of course, I'm sure you're all eager to personally experience these two games and the unique features of the Switch."

"On-site, we've prepared plenty of devices for everyone to try out the games firsthand."

As the video ended, Chen Xu announced another piece of news that thrilled every player.

"Damn it! There's actually a demo session!"

"Did I hear that right?! This... this isn’t just painting the picture!"

"They're back! Everything’s back! I can actually get to eat this piece of cake!"

"Stunned!"

"Don’t talk—let’s get in line now!"

Many veteran players of Nebula Games were completely stunned at this moment.

This instantly brought back memories for those who had attended the very first Nebula Games exhibition.

Back then, Nebula Games had been just as impressive!

At that time, *Sanguosha* and *Fall Guys* had completely stolen the show at the exhibition.

But that was only for that one year.

The next year, the second Nebula Games exhibition had no playable demos.

What, you say there was that one with The one with the big hammer the following year?

Could you even call that a game!?

That was a low blood pressure treatment device!

Now, after several years, the playable demo segment of Nebula Games’ exhibition was back!

Previously, some players hadn’t shown much excitement over the promotional videos for *Animal Forest* and *Super Mario Odyssey*.

Mainly because they felt the games seemed a bit too childish. Although everyone trusted Nebula Games’ reputation, and knew that a game’s quality couldn’t be judged solely by its trailer—only actual gameplay could reveal the truth—

the problem was, they might never actually get to play them.

So naturally, most players weren’t particularly interested.

But now, no one had expected that at this exhibition, they’d actually get to eat the cake.

And just like that, everyone’s excitement skyrocketed.
