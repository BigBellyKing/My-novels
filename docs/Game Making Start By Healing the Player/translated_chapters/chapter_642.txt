Chapter 641: Is This Game Still Playable? (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)

At first glance, this naked, chubby BOSS looked quite intimidating.

But in reality, this gatekeeper BOSS wasn't too difficult.

The damage output from the two Defias Sentinel sidekicks nearby wasn't particularly high either.

After pulling aggro, Song Ren checked the damage he was taking and immediately felt reassured.

Given the BOSS's attack power, it couldn't pose a life-threatening danger to him—all they needed was for the Priest to manage their mana and time their heals properly.

"Let's clear these two mobs first, then focus on the BOSS. That'll be safer."

Once the Tactics were set, Song Ren immediately used the Skill he believed best showcased the might of a warrior to pull aggro.

In the game, his warrior let out a furious roar and charged toward Lakzo. Mid-charge, Song Ren switched to defensive stance—this was the warrior's Charge.

A headlong, unstoppable advance—what a Skill that truly embodied the essence of a warrior!

Once he reached Lakzo, Song Ren continued by using Demoralizing Shout to apply an attack-reducing DEBUFF on both the BOSS and the mobs, then began maintaining Aggro on them.

Since the BOSS's two sidekicks could attack from range with their Bow and Arrows, Song Ren had to maneuver his positioning to lure them together.

"Wang Han, you and Old Zhang focus on damage output for now. Only heal me if Joey runs low on mana."

Song Ren applied Sunder Armor to the BOSS and followed up with a Heroic Strike to solidify Aggro.

"No problem!" Wang Han responded excitedly, immediately unleashing a flurry of attacks on the BOSS.

Capable of healing, dealing damage, and tanking—this was the greatness of the Alliance's Paladin Class!

Of course, while it sounded perfect on paper, their damage output couldn't match Rogues or Mages, their healing couldn't compete with Priests, and their tanking fell short of Protection Warriors.

Most players would consider the Paladin mediocre, and Wang Han had initially felt the same way—grinding levels in the wilderness was exhausting.

But now, she had come to appreciate it.

Because this was the Paladin's defining characteristic.

Whatever role the Team needed, she could fill it, ensuring the Team never had any glaring weaknesses.

When you thought about it, wasn't that the Paladin's greatest strength?

The spiritual symbol of the Alliance!

As for Wang Yifan and Zhang Yi, they had it relatively easy.

All they had to do was manage Aggro and then focus on dealing damage.

It wasn't much different from fighting regular mobs.

Aside from having slightly more health than the average elite monster, this BOSS didn't pose much of a threat.

In terms of Skills, it only had one—a Smash attack.

This could deal minor damage to enemies in melee range, and the only troublesome part was that it was a stun Skill, capable of incapacitating the tank for three seconds.

But with a healer present, as long as they kept an eye on their health, it wasn't a serious threat.

After putting in some effort, Song Ren's party slowly whittled the BOSS down.

Watching the BOSS collapse, everyone grew excited.

If there was one thing that brought the most joy in MMORPGs, it was looting a BOSS's corpse after defeating it.

"Who's going to loot the body?" Wang Han asked, staring at Lakzo's lifeless form.

"Ahem... AHEM!!!" Song Ren didn't say anything, but he planted himself firmly next to the BOSS's corpse, coughing loudly over voice chat.

"Alright, alright, stop coughing—you're going to cough out a lung. You loot it, then." Zhang Yi said, Speechless.

"Sigh, let's just go. With the infamous Unlucky King looting, we shouldn't expect anything from this BOSS." Zhang Yi feigned a sigh.

"Old Zhang, I take offense to that! I think my luck's pretty good!" Song Ren protested indignantly.

"Heh." Zhang Yi's response was dripping with sarcasm.

"If I don't get anything good this time, I won't loot any more BOSSes! I refuse to believe the first dungeon BOSS our five-man party takes down won't drop Something!" Song Ren declared confidently, stepping up to the corpse with excitement and giving it a good loot.

Then, a massive Hammer burst into a radiant glow as it materialized on the ground.

Unlike in World of Warcraft from his previous life, looted items would scatter directly from the BOSS's body, shimmering with a pickup prompt.

Once picked up, they would be distributed according to the Team's assignment mode.

However, there was one key difference: in World of Warcraft, some dungeon items were Bind on Pickup and couldn't be traded.

This was a somewhat player-unfriendly setting, as players who accidentally picked up gear meant for others sometimes had to contact customer support to transfer it—a hassle.

So Chen Xu had implemented a system allowing dungeon loot to be traded among party members within a certain timeframe.

At the same time, to prevent abuse—where familiar players might exploit this system to cheat strangers—he added a dedicated reporting channel, including a Censorship system involving high-reputation players.

"See that? This is what a Lucky King looks like! The BOSS's weapon dropped right away!"

"From now on, leave the looting to me. This is what a golden touch looks like!"

Staring at the radiant Hammer, Song Ren was ecstatic.

What did this mean?

It meant he was chosen by fate!

With trembling hands, he picked it up... and then his expression froze.

The Hammer was indeed the BOSS's weapon—Lakzo's Hammer.

But why the hell was it a white-quality item?

Even if this BOSS was weak, was a white item all it could drop?

You're a BOSS, for crying out loud! And you were wielding a white-quality weapon?

You were even worse off than his warrior!?

No wonder you got slaughtered!

"Do you have no dignity as a BOSS?! Wearing nothing but underwear—I thought you'd invested all your assets into your weapon!"

"But your Hammer is white? You're such a joke!" Song Ren was utterly broken.

After checking two or three more times, he confirmed that the only drop was this Hammer.

Was he really that unlucky?

"Ahem, Old Song, have you considered another possibility?" Joey chimed in.

"Huh?" Song Ren turned to him.

"Maybe this BOSS was a warrior too. And the reason he wasn't wearing clothes or pants—just carrying a white Hammer—wasn't because he spent all his money on his weapon, but because he was so poor that a weapon was all he had left. After all, you still need a weapon to grind levels." Joey said with a grin.

Thunk—

It felt like an arrow had pierced Song Ren's heart.

"Old Song, don't hold back. This Hammer is perfect for you."

"Sigh... Are warriors really this poor?"

"Old Song, just take the Hammer back to the capital city and sell it at the Shop. Don't end up unable to afford your Skills."

His teammates sighed with emotion, then all passed on the loot to comfort him.

"Stop. I'm exhausted." Song Ren looked utterly lifeless.

At this moment, he was seriously questioning his path as a warrior.

In a way, Warcraft was an extremely fair game—yet also an unfair one.

Because BOSS drops and loot rolls in random parties depended entirely on luck.

For an Unlucky King, the player experience would be miserable.

Warriors were already dirt-poor. If he also had the Unlucky King tag...

Was this game even playable?
