Chapter 404: Switch Game Selection (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

With the overseas version of Switch launching, a similar wave of excitement had swept across international markets as well.

Frenzied purchases, stock shortages...

The scene that had unfolded domestically two months earlier was now being perfectly replicated overseas.

At the same time, Nebula Games released Switch sales data for the first time.

From the domestic launch to the overseas release, two months had passed.

Now, Nebula Games had officially announced the sales figures for Switch.

Global shipments had reached 4.1 million units.

This number left major domestic game developers utterly stunned.

Because up to this point, Switch's sales performance remained remarkably strong.

Although on various e-commerce platforms, stock no longer vanished the moment it was released, it still only lasted a few days before selling out.

Many designers and developers within the gaming industry who had been closely observing the situation initially assumed this was due to limited supply.

But now it seemed not that supply was too low—but rather, it simply wasn't enough.

Moreover, judging from the current overseas launch performance, international markets could clearly absorb even more units.

If early success had relied heavily on Nebula Games' IPs, then the current momentum was now purely driven by the Switch handheld console's own success.

Additionally, there was the matter of game sales on the Switch platform.

"Super Mario Odyssey" unsurprisingly claimed the top sales spot.

With 2.11 million units sold.

And considering that "Super Mario Odyssey" had physical game cartridges, and that secondhand game markets also circulated copies, one had to wonder—wasn't this essentially meaning that for every two Switch consoles sold, one came with "Super Mario Odyssey"?

Of course, as Switch sales grow and more games become available, this ratio will inevitably decrease.

After all, currently, the number of games available for Switch was still limited.

Yet even so, this figure remained astonishing.

In second place was "Animal Forest," selling 2.08 million units, just behind "Super Mario Odyssey."

This game could be summed up in one poetic phrase: "Nourishing silently, without a sound."

Quietly, it had climbed to the top in popularity. Quietly, it had secured second place in sales.

Judging from both sales and popularity trends, it wouldn't be surprising at all if it surpassed "Super Mario Odyssey" to claim first place in the near future.

Beyond these titles, another point that surprised many game developers was this:

Some older games released on the Switch platform had actually achieved impressive sales.

It wasn't just Nebula Games' titles—games ported by third-party studios also performed well.

Initially, these third-party developers had simply agreed to port their games as a favor to Nebula Games.

After all, they all earned their livelihoods through the Nebula Games Platform.

But they never expected the sales to be this high—so high that they rivaled, or even matched, their performance on the PC platform.

Additionally, there were Switch's subscription members.

Although many players opted for group-purchased family memberships, as it was cheaper,

cheap or not, it still wasn't free.

In short, Switch's performance left both game industry developers and media outlets utterly speechless.

Chen Xu himself was slightly surprised by this, yet quickly accepted it.

Because the fundamental design philosophy behind Switch truly was remarkable.

In his previous life, Switch had become the fastest-selling handheld console, a feat inseparable from its excellent quality.

It wasn't simply riding on Nintendo's reputation alone.

Otherwise, the Wii U wouldn't have failed so spectacularly. And even the Wii's success was largely due to its blue-ocean strategy—its motion control features attracted many housewives. To most casual users, the Wii wasn't a game console, but a yoga mat, a dance pad.

Of course, a game console's success or failure wasn't determined by these factors alone. The mass exodus of third-party developers was also a core aspect.

Precisely because of this complex reality, Chen Xu had actually had many options when selecting launch titles for Switch.

For example, games like "Ring Fit Adventure" or "1-2-Switch," but in the end, Chen Xu chose "Super Mario Odyssey" and "Animal Forest" as the flagship launch titles.

Because Chen Xu's vision for Switch wasn't as a toy.

But as a game console—and as a platform.

………………

Inside Nebula Games' reception room, Chen Xu was also being interviewed by Game Timespace.

Well, technically an interview, though it leaned more toward promotional publicity.

After all, Switch's current sales had already shattered countless records previously set by domestic handheld consoles.

Naturally, many media outlets wanted to interview him on the topic of Switch.

To maximize publicity, Chen Xu, unlike in the past, participated in numerous interviews this time.

"Mr. Chen, aside from the launch exclusives 'Super Mario Odyssey' and 'Animal Forest,' the membership library on Switch also includes a substantial number of brand-new mini-games, and player feedback has been quite positive. Are there plans to expand this further in the future?" The reporter sitting across from Chen Xu asked.

The question wasn't sharp—it was actually promotional in nature.

"Of course. The membership game library will continue to receive new mini-games. Additionally, we have plans for ported titles such as 'Minecraft,' as well as brand-new games developed by third-party developers specifically for Switch," Chen Xu nodded and explained.

Currently, many Switch players online had indeed given extremely high reviews to these classic mini-games.

Initially, most players subscribed for online multiplayer and cloud saves.

But after subscribing, many players idly tried out the mini-games in the library—and instantly found themselves hooked.

In terms of graphics and technology, these games were worlds apart from mainstream blockbusters.

Yet players discovered they were surprisingly fun and replayable.

Take the original Super Mario Bros.—after exploring, many players actually discovered various hidden elements.

Like pipe warps and hidden blocks. Despite being 2D side-scrolling, the level design was remarkably clever.

Additionally, cooperative games like "Snow Bros." and "Metal Slug," where players could clear levels together with friends.

And shoot-'em-up games like "Mushihimesama" and "Ikaruga."

The number wasn't too few, nor too many—eight titles launched in the membership library at first.

Combined with the two exclusive games for sale, plus numerous ports from Nebula Games and third-party developers, the current number of Switch games wasn't abundant, but certainly not lacking either.

As for why players found them so replayable:

Games like "Mushihimesama" and "Metal Slug" were exactly the kinds arcade owners loved in Chen Xu's previous life.

What? You wonder why arcade owners liked them?

Because they were difficult—players kept inserting coins!

On Switch, Chen Xu didn't alter the difficulty through optimizations—instead, he simply added a new option: Challenge Mode and Easy Mode.

As the names suggest, Challenge Mode meant a one-coin clear.

Easy Mode allowed players to respawn on the spot upon death—effectively offering unlimited continues.

For players choosing Challenge Mode, the game became incredibly replayable.

"May I ask, Mr. Chen—will there be more exclusive games for Switch in the future?" The reporter asked his final question.

"Actually, we already have corresponding plans. As I've mentioned before, later this year we will release another exclusive game for Switch, and it will be an open-world game—completely different in direction from 'Red Dead Redemption,'" Chen Xu said with a smile.

The reporter across from him blinked repeatedly, completely dazzled by Chen Xu's words.
