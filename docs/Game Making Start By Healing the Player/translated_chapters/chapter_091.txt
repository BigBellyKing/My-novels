Chapter 91: The Fire is Dying, Yet the King's Seat Lies Empty

Chapter 91: The Fire is Dying, Yet the King's Seat Lies Empty

Online, players everywhere were thrilled by *Sanguosha* and *Fall Guys*.

Across the various booths at the exhibition, groups of ordinary players could be seen enjoying *Sanguosha* and *Fall Guys* together.

But on this fifth day—the final day of the exhibition—

Many players and gaming media outlets began to notice something.

In front of Nebula Games’ booth at Hall Six, crowds wore expressions of utter surprise.

"What’s going on!? Why has the style changed?"

"Damn it! Is this a teaser for Chen Xu’s new game? Not just *Fall Guys* and *Sanguosha*, but a new title too!?"

"A Medieval-style game? Those armor and two-handed greatswords look so cool!"

"Finally! Finally there are some young ladies! But why are her eyes covered?"

At the Nebula Games booth, all previous posters for *Sanguosha* and *Fall Guys* had been replaced.

A Black Knight clad entirely in black, wearing a pointed iron helm, a black leather vest over chainmail, and a scarlet cape fluttering in the wind, wielding a sword and shield.

A warrior like a king, riding atop an Elder Dragon, gripping the Dragonslayer Swordspear.

A burly knight holding a weapon resembling a Guandao.

An Onion Knight, layered in segmented armor, brandishing sword and shield.

A blind maiden in a black robe, holding flames in her hands, wearing a white crown that conceals her eyes.

Meanwhile, the colorful *Fall Guys* cosers had been replaced by a group of cosers dressed in various armors, each carrying weapons and shields.

Had this happened on the first day, it might not have drawn much attention—

After all, most exhibitors featured similar Medieval or fantasy-themed cosers.

But after four days of immersion in the playful, vibrant *Fall Guys* aesthetic, this sudden shift back to dark, armored warriors sparked intense curiosity among players.

Some who had visited the Nebula Games booth on the first day now recalled something.

On that day, Chen Xu had mentioned to them that on the final day, he would reveal a major announcement.

So—Nebula Games had brought yet another blockbuster!?

Crowds swarmed the booth, forming layers three deep both inside and out.

At last, Chen Xu stepped onto the stage, smiling at the audience. "I believe many of you have already guessed it."

"That’s right. Today, we’re announcing another piece of news—we’ve been secretly developing a major title for the PC platform."

"Constantly striving to surpass ourselves, constantly exploring the unknown mysteries; now, the fire is dying, yet the king's seat lies empty. This will be a tale of flames and Firelinkers."

"Stay Tuned!"

As Chen Xu finished speaking, the crowd erupted into thunderous applause.

Even nearby media from Hall Six looked stunned.

Is Nebula Games developing a blockbuster?

Was this the true centerpiece of Nebula Games’ exhibition?

Were *Sanguosha* and *Fall Guys* merely appetizers?

Other game designers and developers from surrounding booths wore deeply frustrated expressions.

What the hell!

This is an exhibition!

An exhibition! Do you even know what an exhibition is for!?

Why does Nebula Games—and especially you, Chen Xu—always have so many tricks up your sleeve!?

This isn’t your personal game launch event!

Watching the massive crowd gather around Nebula’s booth, everyone else could only feel utterly exasperated.

Even representatives from NetDragon and TengHua, who had been closely monitoring the situation, were left speechless.

Especially Meng Zuo, who still hadn’t recovered from the shock.

It shouldn’t have turned out like this!

It shouldn’t!

What went wrong!?

Everything was supposed to be his first!

Blockbuster titles, promotions—why did everything end up so differently!?

But for ordinary players, the past four days of *Fall Guys* and *Sanguosha* had already ignited their passion.

Had Chen Xu announced a new title on the first day, it might have been met with mere polite interest.

But now, the situation was completely different.

Amidst the mountainous waves of applause and cheers,



a pre-prepared LCD screen began playing a CG animation rushed to completion with overtime work over the past two months.

Unlike the simple cutscenes of the original *Dark Souls* from Chen Xu’s previous life, the content remained the same, but the visual presentation was in an entirely different league.

After all, Chen Xu had commissioned a top domestic CG company to produce this short animation. In terms of visual effects, it was unquestionably top-tier—using a cliché phrase, it was clearly a AAA-grade production just from looking at it.

Due to the tight schedule, the CG team had worked day and night, though they were generously compensated in return.

The cost of this single CG animation, under three minutes long, nearly matched the entire development cost of *Outlast*.

A brief black screen. An old woman’s voice echoed.

[Yes, that is Lothric,]

[The homeland of the Lords of Cinder, and the confluence of wandering souls.]

As the old woman’s weathered voice narrated, a ruined and desolate capital slowly emerged on screen. Though now in ruins, its former glory and grandeur were still faintly perceptible.

Under dim light, a biting wind swept through, carrying swirling snow.

Gray ash blanketed the massive city, and the entire world lay in dead silence.

[Thus, the pilgrims journey northward, learning the meaning of the prophecy.]

In the midst of a blizzard, a group of hunched figures trudged forward, each carrying a shell-like object wrapped in chains, leaning on staffs as they struggled through the storm.

Their thick garments concealed their bodies, but their exposed arms resembled burnt kindling—blackened and cracked, with faint orange-red speckles of light flickering within.

Finally, one pilgrim collapsed to the ground, motionless, unable to continue.

[The Fire is Dying, Yet the King's Seat Lies Empty.]

Muffled drum beats began to rise, accompanying the old woman’s solemn narration.

The countless players in attendance were instantly drawn into this mysterious world, eagerly wondering what kind of game this was, and what story it would tell.

[When the flame of传承 is near extinction, bells shall ring across the land, awakening the ancient Lords of Cinder from their slumber within the coffins.]

As deep, resonant bells tolled, a violin concerto began, merging with the mixed chanting of soprano and tenor voices.

The scene shifted instantly.

A gigantic sarcophagus cracked open, and from the dark and deep underground caverns, countless streams of black, viscous liquid surged forth, pulsing and throbbed. Within it, a crown was faintly visible.

[The Abyss Watcher—Aldrich, Devourer of Gods.]

From among the coffins and mountains of corpses, soldiers clad in armor slowly rose, wielding Farron Greatswords, their blood-soaked dark red cloaks fluttering in the wind.

[The Watchers of the Abyss—Farron Undead Legion.]

A massive greatscythe slammed into the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust. From a colossal sarcophagus, a figure like a small mountain slowly rose. Its arms, holding the greatscythe outside its armor, were cracked, and flames were visibly emanating from within.

Accompanied by an earth-shattering roar, the giant’s flames reignited.

[The lonely king of the Profaned Capital—Yhorm the Giant.]

As Yhorm the Giant roared, the mixed chanting of soprano and tenor voices reached its crescendo.

Harmonized with the violin concerto, every player felt a profound sense of ‘epicness’ surge through them.

But in the next moment, all sound abruptly ceased.

The screen plunged into darkness. Silence blanketed the world.

The old woman’s voice returned.

[In truth, the kings will ultimately abandon their thrones, and the Ashen Ones shall come forth from the ashes.]

[A nameless, incapable of becoming kindling, accursed Undead.]

A pair of fair hands appeared on screen, slowly placing a blindfold made of a dark, liquid-like substance onto a face. The camera pulled back as the figure slowly stood.

Silver-white long hair, a black robe, and a tall stature—she looked just like a Saintess.

[Perhaps that is why the Ashen One so desperately craves the fading embers.]

In the darkness, flames continued to burn. The blindfolded woman turned, gently cradling a ‘corpse’ as she walked forward.

Finally, the screen faded to black. The game’s title emerged in the center: *Dark Souls*

Beneath it, a small, unobtrusive line of text: Release Date TBA.

(PS: Will you Link the Fire? If not, hand over your recommendation votes and Monthly Pass—otherwise, the Fire Keeper young lady will drag you off to be burnt as kindling.)
