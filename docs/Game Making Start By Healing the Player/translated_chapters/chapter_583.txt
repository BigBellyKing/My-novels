Chapter 582: Never to Return? Then Never to Return! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)

Inside the underground laboratory, aside from Miranda's various experiments and records, one person was imprisoned.

That person was the missing: Mia.

According to the dialogue, after being kidnapped by Miranda, she had been locked here and subjected to experiments.

After all, Rose was born from her and Ethan. Miranda didn't kill Ethan earlier to collect information, and the same applied to Mia.

'You promised! You said you'd keep us safe! We followed every word you said. Moving here, doing everything!'

'As long as our family could stay together, I didn’t care about anything else! Now tell me, where is my husband? Where is my child?'

Mia stared intensely at Chris as she shouted.

'Ethan... he's gone.' Chris lowered his head, filled with guilt. 'I couldn't save him, but I can still save Rose.'

'Gone? What do you mean?'

'He's dead. I'm sorry, Mia, but we need to leave quickly. We must destroy this village.' Chris avoided looking at Mia's face.

But Mia simply shook her head. 'No! You're wrong... I wanted to keep it a secret, but... you don't understand how special Ethan truly is.'

Ethan? Special!?

Hearing Mia's words, Song Ren, playing the game, froze for a moment. Then, instantly, the camera switched to Ethan's perspective.

Ethan, who should have been long dead, slowly opened his eyes. He found himself in an icy and snowy wilderness.

Bone-chilling cold seeped into his body, making him trembling.

'What... what happened?' Awakening, Ethan stared at his hands in shock.

Because his left hand, which should have had two thumbs severed, had completely regenerated.

Just then, a faint laughter echoed from the mist.

Ethan, stiff and frozen, struggled to his feet and staggered forward.

'Is anyone there?'

Endless snow blanketed the ground. Nearby, a freezing river flowed. Trudging along it, Ethan rubbed his hands together, shivering uncontrollably.

'Where... is this? So cold... huff... too cold...'

The piercing cold nearly paralyzed Ethan, his entire body frozen stiff.

'Damn it... my body...'

He stumbled, collapsing to his knees, breathing heavily.

'You really are... stupid.' A little girl's voice whispered faintly in his ear.

The familiar voice jolted Ethan's memory. He snapped his head up in shock, staring at the sight before him.

'Evelyn! How are you here?'

From the mist stepped a little girl—Evelyn, the final boss from the previous game.

'You're already dead,' Evelyn said coldly.

'Dead? You mean... Miranda... was it her?' Ethan couldn’t believe it. He remembered clearly—Miranda had ripped out his heart.

Yet even so, one thought burned within him. He struggled to rise.

'No... I still have to save... Rose.'

But the next moment, Evelyn’s words froze both Ethan and Song Ren in the game.

'Wrong! It wasn’t Miranda. You... were already dead.'

What did she mean? Ethan was already dead? Not killed by Miranda?

Song Ren looked bewildered, completely unable to grasp Evelyn’s meaning.

Ethan, too, was filled with confusion. 'What are you talking about? I’m still alive...'

'Don’t you find it strange? No matter how badly you’re injured, you never fear it. Remember... ' Evelyn asked a question that puzzled both Ethan and every player.

Yes!

Why was Ethan never afraid of getting hurt?

As Evelyn spoke, memories flashed through Ethan’s mind.

Arriving in Louisiana, entering the Jack Baker farm. Meeting a crazed Mia. Encountering Jack Baker and knocking him down with a single punch.

At the same time, Evelyn’s voice rang out.

'Three years ago, at the Baker house, you were already killed. You died there—three years ago.'

Song Ren, playing the game, was completely bewildered.

What was going on?

Ethan had already died?

Then how was Rose born? And wasn’t Ethan right here, alive and well?

What in the world was happening?

Ethan seemed to realize something, yet still refused to believe it.

'That... that can’t be... no...'

'Get out of my head... stop lying.'

'Then... what am I?'

'Me... everything I’ve done... Rose... Mia... I...'

Slowly, Ethan pulled himself up from the ground—only to freeze in horror as he saw his hands turning black.

Just like the Fungal Beasts he had encountered at the Jack Baker farm.

'Now you understand? From head to toe, you’re nothing but mold! You’ll never see your family again,' Evelyn said.

'Family? Family?'

'No... Rose... I... still... need... to save... my... child.'

One memory after another flooded Ethan’s mind.

Escaping the Louisiana farm.

Relocating with Chris’s help, undergoing military training.

Having a child, Rose, with Mia.

Sharing a warm dinner at home, telling bedtime stories to lull Rose to sleep.

None of this was illusion—it had all truly happened.

Now Ethan finally understood why Mia had always seemed hesitant around him.

Mia had known all along.

Yet she had stayed by his side. She was still his wife.

And Rose was still his daughter.

Even if he had already died.
Even if he was merely a sentient Fungal Beast made of mold.

He was still a husband. A father.

'You’re dead... dead...!' Evelyn’s mocking voice echoed in Ethan’s ears.

'I... will... save... Rose!' Ethan rose to his feet through sheer willpower, each word spoken with every ounce of strength he had.

At that moment, dark mists in the distance were dispelled by blinding sunlight.

When Ethan awoke again, he was inside a moving Mario Kart.

'You’re finally awake,' a familiar voice said.

Duke, the mysterious fat merchant—apparently, he had saved Ethan.

'Ethan, you had a nightmare. Your battle with Heisenberg was intense, but who could have expected Miranda to appear...' Duke said.

'How long was I unconscious?' Ethan asked.

'Until just before dawn,' Duke replied.

Ethan took a deep breath, staring at Duke driving the cart. 'Duke, I need a favor. Please... take me to Miranda.'

Hearing Ethan’s request, Duke smiled. 'Knew you’d say that. We’re already on the way. We’ll be there soon.'

'Thank you.'

'But Ethan, are you sure you want to go? Your body is... well, breaking down.' Duke didn’t finish the sentence.

But at this moment, Song Ren, the player, already understood Duke’s meaning.

Just like in *Red Dead Redemption*, when Arthur Morgan stepped out of the clinic.

Even if the game wasn’t over yet, the ending had already been revealed to the player.

'Yes.' Ethan looked down at his hands, utterly determined.

'We’ve arrived. So, Ethan, you likely won’t be able to return to your old world ever again... Are you ready?'

'Yes, I must go.' Ethan stepped down from the Mario Kart.

'This is your final chance, Ethan.' Duke smiled kindly, opening the door to his Shop (in-game).

Sell everything that can be sold. Max out all weapons and gear.

Ethan limped forward toward the Altar of Storms.

Never to return? Then never return!
