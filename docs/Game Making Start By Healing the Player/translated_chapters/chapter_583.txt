Chapter 582: A Journey of No Return? Then Let It Be a Journey of No Return! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

In the underground laboratory, aside from Miranda's various experiments and records, one person was also held captive.

That was the missing: Mia.

According to the dialogue, after she was kidnapped by Miranda, she was held captive there, simultaneously undergoing experiments. After all, Rose was born to her and Ethan, and Miranda had not killed Ethan earlier to collect information; the same applied to Mia.

'You promised! You said you’d keep us safe! We did everything you said. Moved here, every single thing!'

'As long as the whole family can be together, I don't care about any of this! You tell me, where's my husband? Where's my child?'

Mia questioned Chris loudly.

'Ethan… he's gone.' Chris lowered his head, filled with guilt: 'I couldn't save him, but I can still save Rose.'

'Gone? What do you mean?'

'He's dead. I'm sorry, Mia, but we need to leave quickly. We must destroy this village.' Chris avoided looking at Mia's face.

But Mia just shook her head: 'No! You're wrong… I wanted to keep it a secret, but… you just don't understand how special Ethan is.'

Ethan? Special!?

Listening to Mia's words, Song Ren in the game was stunned for a moment, and then the camera instantly switched to Ethan's perspective. Ethan, who should have been dead, slowly opened his eyes, finding himself in a world of ice and snow. The biting cold gnawed at his body, making him tremble.

'What's going on?' Ethan, now awake, looked at his hands, startled himself. Because his left hand, which should have had two thumbs severed, had miraculously regenerated.

Just then, a burst of laughter echoed from the mist.

Ethan, stiff all over, stood up and stumbled forward.

'Is anyone there?'

Amidst the vast white snow, there was a freezing river nearby. Following the river upstream, Ethan rubbed his hands, shivering from the cold. 'Where is this… So cold… Huff… Too cold.'

The biting cold made it almost impossible for Ethan to move; his whole body was frozen stiff. 'Damn it… my body…'

His foot slipped, and Ethan fell to his knees, breathing heavily. 'You're truly… foolish.' In a daze, a little girl's voice whispered in his ear. The familiar voice instantly triggered memories in Ethan's heart. He shivered, suddenly looked up, and saw a shocking sight.

'Evelyn! What are you doing here?'

A little girl emerged from the mist; it was Evelyn, the final BOSS from the previous game.

'You're already dead,' Evelyn said coldly.

'Dead? Are, are you saying… Miranda… it was her?' Ethan was incredulous, and he also remembered that Miranda had clearly ripped out his heart. But even so, Ethan had a single obsession; he struggled to get up.

'No… I still have to save… Rose.'

But the next second, Evelyn's words stunned both Ethan and Song Ren in the game. 'Wrong! It wasn't Miranda. You… were already dead.'

What did that mean? Ethan was already dead? How did Rose come to be? And wasn't Ethan perfectly fine?

What was going on?

Ethan seemed to realize something but still refused to believe it. 'Th-that's impossible… No way… Don't… talk nonsense… in my head.'

'Then… what am I?'

'Me… everything I did… Rose… Mia… I…'

Ethan slowly got up from the ground, horrified to find that his hands had begun to blacken, just like the Fungal Beasts he had encountered at the Baker farm. 'Now you understand? You're Mold from head to toe! You can never see your family again,' Evelyn said. 'Family? Fa, family?'

'No… Rose… I… still… have… to… save… my… child.'

Scene after scene from the past flashed before Ethan's eyes. Escaping from the farm in Louisiana. Moving with Chris's help and undergoing military training. Having his child, Rose, with Mia. The two of them having a cozy dinner at home, telling Rose bedtime stories. All of this was not his hallucination but things that had truly happened. At this moment, Ethan also understood why Mia had seemed to hesitate to speak to him. In truth, Mia had already known. Yet, Mia remained by his side; she was still his wife. And Rose was still his child. Even if he had died long ago, even if he was merely a Fungal Beast composed of Mold with a conscious entity. But he was still a husband, a father.

'Already dead… dead…!' Evelyn's mocking words echoed in Ethan's ears. 'I… will… save… Rose!' Ethan stood up with powerful willpower, enunciating each word with all his might.

At the same time, the blinding sunlight dispelled the distant black fog. When Ethan awoke again, he was surprisingly in a moving carriage.

'You're finally awake,' a familiar voice said. The Duke, that mysterious fat merchant, seemed to have saved Ethan. 'Ethan, you had a nightmare. Your battle with Heisenberg was truly spectacular, but who would have thought Miranda would appear…' the Duke said.

'How long was I out?' Ethan asked.

'Until daybreak,' the Duke replied. Looking at the Duke driving the carriage, Ethan took a deep breath: 'Duke, I need your help. Take, take me to Miranda.' Hearing Ethan's request, the Duke said with a smile: 'I knew you'd say that. We're already on our way; we'll be there soon.'

'Thank you.'

'But Ethan, are you sure you want to go? Your body is… well, it's collapsing.' The Duke didn't finish his sentence. But at this moment, Song Ren, as a player, had already guessed the meaning of the Duke's words. It was just like Arthur Morgan emerging from the clinic in Red Dead Redemption. Even though the game wasn't over yet, the ending seemed to have already been revealed to the player.

'Yes,' Ethan said, looking down at his hands, his resolve unwavering.

'We've arrived. So, Ethan, I'm afraid you can never go back to the world you knew… Are you ready?'

'Yes, I must go.' Ethan stepped down from the carriage. 'This is your last chance, Ethan.' The Duke looked at Ethan with the same benevolent smile, opening the doors of his shop to him. Ethan sold everything he could, fully upgrading all his weapons and equipment. He trudged toward the altar. A journey of no return? Then let it be a journey of no return!
