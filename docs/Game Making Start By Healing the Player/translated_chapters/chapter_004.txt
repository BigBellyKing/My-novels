Chapter 4: Helper

Hearing Ruan Ningxue's words, Chen Xu couldn't help but blush.

However, in an instant, Chen Xu regained his composure, let out a light cough to dissolve the awkward atmosphere, and then started thinking of excuses.

“Well, there are multiple reasons for this…”

Ruan Ningxue, sitting across the table, couldn't help but curl her lips.

Men's mouths, deceitful devils!

“But I can accept all the conditions you mentioned, though I also have a requirement!”

Ruan Ningxue said, looking at Chen Xu with a beaming smile.

Hearing this, Chen Xu was taken aback.

He was still wondering how to persuade her.

When he first approached her, Chen Xu wasn't very confident; he just wanted to give it a try.

After all, he knew his own situation. Paying money?

He definitely couldn't do that now. If he did, there'd be no way to make the subsequent game.

After all, some essential resources still needed to be purchased.

Relying on their junior-senior relationship?

But she wasn't anyone related to him, nor was she obligated to help. Besides, it looked suspiciously like making grand promises.

But now, there's a chance?

“What's your requirement, Senior Sister?” Chen Xu asked Ruan Ningxue.

“One month’s time, and if your game’s sales are poor afterward, you’ll have to come work for me!”

“At least sign two contracts! Of course, in terms of compensation, I definitely won't think of freeloading your labor like you, Junior Brother.”

Ruan Ningxue said with a smile.

Hearing Ruan Ningxue’s words, Chen Xu froze for a moment, then came back to his senses.

Regarding doujinshi, Chen Xu didn't have too many thoughts. After all, in his previous life, there were quite a few female doujinshi artists.

For example, 'Yuzuki N,' 'Nishizawa 5,' ahem... actually, Chen Xu didn't know any of these artists or their works, let alone seen them; he’d only heard about them from friends.

“What kind of sales would be considered poor?” Chen Xu asked Ruan Ningxue, having regained his composure.

If she were to say several million copies, Chen Xu really wouldn't have much confidence.

After all, this was a Parallel World, vastly different from the gaming environment of his previous life.

Even without the piracy factor, the market itself was different from his previous life.

Without capital for promotion and operation, relying solely on spontaneous player recommendations would be incredibly difficult.

Even highly praised Independent Games from his previous life, which sold millions or even tens of millions of copies, upon closer inspection, many only became popular half a year or a year later.

They were obscure at first.

Even strong titles like The Binding of Isaac were largely unknown in their early stages.

After all, even good wine fears a deep alley.

So, if Ruan Ningxue were to say one million sales, Chen Xu felt he'd rather go it alone.

Because if he agreed, with the game he was currently planning to make, there was a high probability he would end up as a doujinshi artist.

“Eh… 100,000, um, 50,000 is fine!”

“If sales don't exceed 50,000 within one month after release, then you lose!”

Ruan Ningxue took out her phone, seemingly sending a message.

After about a minute, Ruan Ningxue looked up and stated a number.

Hearing Ruan Ningxue’s words, Chen Xu couldn't help but flash a confident smile.

50,000 sales in one month?

Although the game environment was slightly different from his previous life, and he didn't have much startup capital at hand.

Chen Xu could only say that this number was an absolute freebie.

“No problem.” Chen Xu agreed straightforwardly.

“Then, Senior Sister, let’s officially start tomorrow! I’ll go back to prepare first; see you tomorrow morning!”

With that, he bid Ruan Ningxue farewell, not giving her time to react.

Chen Xu turned and left the coffee shop.

Leaving Ruan Ningxue a little stunned.

Did I… say too little?

Thinking this, Ruan Ningxue quickly opened her contacts, found a phone number, and dialed it.

Two seconds later, the call connected.

“Sister Xin, you didn’t lie to me just now, did you? Are 50,000 sales in one month really high sales?” Ruan Ningxue felt a little puzzled, recalling Chen Xu's confident demeanor.

A clear female voice came from the phone: “Not high, no, but it’s relative. You asked how many sales would be considered high if someone was making a game for the first time with little money, right?”

“No money, first time making a game, and hardly any engine resources available to a Game Designer—this is literally a hell-difficulty start. 50,000 sales is an S-tier difficulty; a few thousand sales in a month would barely be a pass.”

“Really?” Ruan Ningxue was half-believing, half-doubting.

“Of course it’s true, this is the judgment of a professional Gaming Industry Professional!”

“By the way, Xiaoxue, are you planning to make a game? Have you thought it through? I told you, if you come help me with concept art design and character portraits, we can definitely achieve a great career!”

Yang Xin on the other end of the phone sounded extremely excited.

“Sister Xin, Sister Xin? What did you say? My signal is bad here; let’s talk later!”

Hearing the excited voice on the other end, Ruan Ningxue's expression subtly changed. She held the phone further away, said a couple of sentences, hung up, and then let out a long breath.

Then, thinking of what Yang Xin said on the phone, Ruan Ningxue couldn't help but smile.

First time making a game, no money, hell-tier difficulty—Chen Xu had all the labels applied.

So, her assistant problem was finally solved!

The only regret was that this assistant wouldn't officially start work for another two months.

After bidding farewell to Ruan Ningxue, Chen Xu returned to his apartment.

After briefly tidying up the room, Chen Xu sat in front of his laptop.

As a development machine, the computer's specifications were average, at least sufficient for the Mirror (Game) project.

Of course, Chen Xu couldn't develop larger games at all right now.

Because he simply had no money, and the resource permissions for the official engine were insufficient.

As for resource permissions, there were essentially two ways to increase them.

The first was to become an officially certified Game Designer and get promoted in terms of Job Title.

As for how to get promoted?

Game sales and awards received were all points that could be included in the evaluation.

The second was much simpler and more direct: just use Money Power. How many resources you could use depended on how strong your Money Power was.

However, these things were completely unimportant to Chen Xu at the moment.

And a game like Mirror (Game) wouldn't require much.

At least the resources Chen Xu could currently use were definitely sufficient.

Sitting in front of the computer, Chen Xu worked on the initial draft for Mirror (Game), which was the Game Design Document.

Although Chen Xu was the only developer, Ruan Ningxue was only doing illustrations.

But that didn't mean design concept drafts weren't needed.

Just like an outline for an essay, it could greatly improve efficiency.
