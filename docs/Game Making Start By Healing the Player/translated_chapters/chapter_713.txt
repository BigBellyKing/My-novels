### Chapter 712: What is Nebula Games doing!? (Requesting subscriptions, monthly passes)

“What’s going on? Nebula Games actually made an animation?”

“Wow! I take back what I once said about Nebula Games being an animation company delayed by games; they haven't been delayed at all!”

“By the way, they partnered with WIS? It seems WIS’s animations have been among the best in recent years, right? Why would they collaborate with Nebula Games?”

“Ahem, a friendly reminder: WIS and Nebula Games are not in the same league.”

“WIS: We didn't want to, but Nebula Games offered too much!”

Online players and casual spectators expressed various degrees of surprise.

In reality, it was just as they thought. While WIS had indeed gained significant fame in the animation industry in recent years, it still lagged considerably behind traditional animation film studios. Moreover, a high-quality animation demands substantial funding. Even with WIS’s current scale, investing heavily in a top-tier animation without commercial success wouldn't necessarily lead to bankruptcy, but it would certainly be a crippling blow. This is where Nebula Games came in, waving cash. Although it was a contract manufacturing job, the amount offered was simply too much!

As players discussed, the first season of 'Dragon's Blood' was quickly launched on major video platforms. Many players who hadn't paid attention to it beforehand were also drawn in, opening it up to watch. Upon viewing, many felt that it was actually quite good. Although the plot didn't feature the kind of mind-bending twists seen in BioShock, starting as a traditional dragon-slaying hero and princess adventure, the appearance of Selemene, the Moon Goddess, Invoker Carl, and the demon Terrorblade unfolded a meticulously planned tale of revenge. Invoker Carl's powerful magic, his towering abode, and its extensive library configuration particularly reminded many Warcraft players of an old mystic: Medivh. With the launch of the first season, numerous viewers were captivated.

This was primarily due to two points:

Firstly, compared to the 'Dragon's Blood' of the previous life, with no shortage of funds, after receiving Chen Xu's script, the content was expanded from the original 8 episodes to 10, including the past events of Luna's Plains of Disaster, making the entire animation production even more refined. At least in terms of visuals and cinematic presentation, it was definitely in the top tier.

Secondly, and crucially, as an animation produced to promote DOTA, it was available for free viewing, which implicitly boosted its ratings.

“It actually feels pretty good!”

“Indeed, I’m a little curious about what will happen next.”

“But honestly, Carl is a bit annoying. Isn't this just a bloodbath caused by a husband's revenge on his ex-wife?”

“Isn’t Selemene even more annoying? Forcing Carl and her daughter to believe in her, and even refusing to help when her daughter wouldn’t. When that old woman was beaten senseless by Terrorblade, I practically clapped and cheered!”

“No! Haven’t you noticed the core of the problem?! Why did Nebula Games, or rather Mr. Chen, make such an animation? It couldn’t possibly just be to fulfill an animation dream, right?”

“+1! This is clearly serving a new project, a new game! The background and worldview in the animation should be from the game, and characters like Invoker Carl, Davion, and Mirana are obviously the main characters of the new work!”

As the series went online, more and more players focused on the impact 'Dragon's Blood' brought. From the game’s background setting, it was clearly a fantasy blockbuster! After all, it had gods, demons, and dragons. Could it be an ARPG game? Many players, including game designers in the industry, had this speculation. This genre naturally fit, and Nebula Games had successfully tackled it before with The Witcher: Wild Hunt. As for it being an MMORPG, no one considered it. World of Warcraft’s popularity was still booming, so why would Nebula Games be so foolish as to create an MMORPG to compete against itself?

However, with more and more information surfacing, an uproar quickly erupted among players and in the industry. It was revealed that this game, named DOTA, was actually a PC platform game. What surprised players even more was the rumor that this game was derived from an RPG map on Warcraft. This instantly left many players bewildered.

“What’s the situation here? Making an RPG map into a standalone game? Is it a mini-game or a small project?”

“How could it be?! If it were a small project, would Nebula Games be so idle as to specifically produce an animation to promote it? You know, for a game to receive such treatment, this DOTA is the first of its kind!”

“Looking at the promotional content, it seems to be a multiplayer versus game, and it’s a God’s-eye view, so is it an RTS?”

“Probably not, right? And it seems this game only has one map!”

“What in the world is this Carl Xu doing?”

Players on various game forums erupted in debate, all expressing confusion. Major developers who had been following the gaming industry, especially those like Atari and FOW who were about to launch their blockbusters, were equally puzzled.

Nebula Games not releasing a new title on the VR platform was unexpected, but not truly surprising. After all, although the current industry discussion suggested that PC's popularity seemed to be waning under VR's challenge, the massive user base still represented money! So, many best-selling games available on VR platforms would also have adapted controls and trimmed visual performance (e.g., resolution) to release a PC version. What truly baffled many was that Nebula Games' new title was to adapt a Warcraft RPG map, and they spared no expense.

The idea of a standalone Warcraft RPG map wasn’t new; in fact, some Warcraft RPG maps had considerable popularity and player numbers. However, the key issue was that the content of these Warcraft RPG maps typically lasted only one or two hours, at most five or six. This was more than enough for an RPG map, but insufficient as a standalone game. Moreover, there were often copyright issues involved. Hot RPG maps adapted into standalone games usually just broke even, but were still a long, long way from becoming popular. Yet, Chen Xu was approaching it from this angle, and crucially, it wasn't based on the Warcraft ecosystem; Nebula Games was even trying hard to distance itself from Warcraft. The world background and characters had no connection to Warcraft, which made it all the more intriguing.

In FOW's Glory Warrior project team, Grayson pondered various map versions on his computer. Grayson felt quite unlucky. His first major project, 'The Lost and the Cursed,' clashed with Nebula Games’ The Witcher: Wild Hunt's Blood and Wine DLC. Later, the Wasteland series he co-developed with Alex encountered The Last of Us. Yet, in some ways, he was fortunate. Although each time he suffered miserably from blockbusters, due to scheduling, he never let his projects get ruined. Should he tempt fate this time? Grayson found himself in a dilemma. Although Nebula Games hadn’t disclosed much, as Zeus’s top underling, FOW easily obtained some information about DOTA, including maps made by employees poached from Atari and FOW. From these map versions, Grayson could only say that the ideas and creativity were indeed interesting, but the crucial question was: could players accept and popularize this gameplay style? If it were any other game developer, Grayson would bravely charge in, but with Nebula Games, he was completely unsure.

………………

Compared to Grayson’s dilemma at FOW, Chen Xu at Nebula Games was in a much better mood. DOTA's development progress was smooth, and most of the heroes were already being produced. The upcoming promotional plan had also been largely finalized. The timing was perfectly set for the eve of the Spring Festival, and a particularly crucial point was that this year was the Year of the Monkey. There was a hero in DOTA perfectly suited for promotion: the Monkey King.

Of course, besides the Monkey King, there was also another very interesting hero. In reality, green environmental protection is advocated, and fireworks and firecrackers cannot be set off, but surely they can be in a game? The Bomber Triplets would be one of the heroes Chen Xu planned to release in the initial version of DOTA. In addition, other heroes beloved by new and veteran players, such as Butcher, Sniper, Invoker, and Storm Spirit, were also on the list.
