Chapter 790: The Legendary Life of the Dovahkiin

As the sky-obscuring black dragon descended upon the watchtower, Imperial soldiers and mages in Helgen successively launched arrows and spells at the dragon in the sky.

"This dragon is so awesome! Will I get to fight dragons later? I wonder if I can ride a dragon in the game and become a Dragon Knight."

With the appearance of the giant dragon, Song Ren could now move freely. Ralof, standing nearby, yelled at him to escape quickly. However, Song Ren didn't rush to follow Ralof's steps; instead, he remained in place, fantasizing about his subsequent game experiences.

After all, the scene before him was truly magnificent. In terms of visual presentation, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, as an open-world game, certainly didn't have the same expressive power as thread-based games. However, a scene like this, with a dragon descending from the sky and various spells shimmering in interplay, was utterly captivating.

While World of Warcraft before it was equally awe-inspiring, it was an MMORPG, so the camera perspectives would have certain adaptations; the sense of shock derived from the same scene under different camera angles was naturally not the same. At least for now, Song Ren's feet were somewhat rooted to the spot. Even with the blatantly obvious mission prompt appearing directly above his game camera, Song Ren still wanted to stay and watch a bit longer.

But this prolonged gaze led to a major event. The black dragon circling in the sky opened its mouth, spewing out endless flames that instantly engulfed him. A painful sound erupted from the protagonist's mouth in the game, and the UI health bar in the bottom left rapidly depleted. The next moment, Song Ren's game screen faded to black and white, and the game loading UI interface appeared before his eyes.

"So, this dragon wasn't here to save me? Was I overthinking it?"

An indiscriminate attack instantly made Song Ren realize that the dragon had absolutely nothing to do with him; it wasn't there to save him at all. The clown was me all along?

After reloading the game and respawning, returning to the scene where the dragon descended from the sky and Helgen was plunged into disaster, Song Ren learned his lesson. The moment he could control his character's actions, he immediately ran into the nearby watchtower, then proceeded with the game according to the mission instructions.

He jumped down from the rooftop of the watchtower, dodging the dragon's flame breath midway. The entirety of Helgen had been destroyed by the dragon into crumbled ruins. As far as the eye could see, there were only burning flames and charred Imperial soldiers.

Imperial soldiers, under the guidance of General Tullius, were also fighting against the dragon in the sky and protecting the ordinary citizens within Helgen.

Seeing this, Song Ren's impression of the Empire improved slightly.

Following the NPC, he sneaked all the way until they reached a square. Song Ren soon faced the first choice in the game: whether to escape with the Imperial army or with the Stormcloaks.

"A faction choice, so here I go either the Stormcloak or Imperial route?" Looking at the choice before him, Song Ren instantly understood. Clearly, the game had two different main storylines; he could choose either the Stormcloaks or the Empire. It was probably like the Alliance and Horde in World of Warcraft.

After thinking for a couple of seconds, Song Ren decisively followed Ralof. "Although this Imperial general seems quite decent and treats the people well, that old woman, the female captain, wanted to chop off my head earlier. So don't blame me for going with the Stormcloak bro!"

Song Ren decisively followed Ralof, running towards the watchtower on the right. Although he hadn't officially entered the storyline and didn't know more about the Empire and the Stormcloaks, who told the Imperial army to try and chop off his head right off the bat? Didn't that mean he had to kill them?

In the hall, Song Ren controlled his character, engaging in dialogue with Ralof. Then, following the prompt, he stripped the armor and weapons from a dead guard nearby.

"Can all these things be interacted with?" Looking at the corpse on the ground, now clad only in underwear, Song Ren couldn't help but feel a moment of surprise. Stripping off equipment and having the NPC's corpse show corresponding feedback wasn't what was amazing. What surprised Song Ren was the interactivity within The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. For instance, keys and gold coins on NPCs could actually be taken. And things like cups, watermelons, and even alleys inside the dungeon could all be interacted with.

The content within Helgen Keep was purely a new player tutorial. After acquiring the equipment, the Imperial female captain who had wanted to chop off his head earlier, along with her subordinates, barged in. Without a word, Song Ren and Ralof immediately began to fight.

The combat methods in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim were very simple: light attacks, heavy attacks, and blocking. Beyond that, there were basically no other flashy moves.

There were no cool combos like those in God of War, nor sword dances like those in The Witcher: Wild Hunt; Song Ren didn't see a hint of them in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. If he had to say what it resembled, Song Ren felt that The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's combat style was somewhat similar to Dark Souls, like a duel between medieval knights.

Of course, the game's difficulty was much simpler than Dark Souls. And he could also feel that this was a pure RPG game, where numerical design still played a relatively significant role.

Compared to him, Ralof next to him was clearly much stronger. He quickly and easily dispatched the two Imperial soldiers.

"Good heavens, are you the Dragonborn, or am I the Dragonborn?" Looking at Ralof, who had only lost a tiny bit of health, Song Ren, standing in place and looting corpses, couldn't help but sigh with emotion.

Killing Imperial soldiers, eliminating disgusting Frostbite Spiders dropping from above the cave, and bypassing a large brown bear that was dozing off. This section of the game content had practically no difficulty whatsoever. Ralof alone could clear the entire area. Its main purpose was to guide players through some basic in-game operations, such as using medicinal items, killing enemies by attacking after blocking, or stripping loot from enemies. There were also some mini-game elements, like lockpicking, which required a bit of skill, and sneaking when facing seemingly unconquerable monsters.

However, there was also content that Song Ren found quite satisfying: the game allowed control over attack direction. If you attacked an enemy's weak spots, there was a certain chance to trigger an execution attack. Regardless of how much health the opponent's health bar seemed to have left, you could directly pierce their chest with the sharp blade in hand, or perform other execution effects. The bullet time slow motion, coupled with actions full of violence and aesthetics, was extremely cool.

Following Ralof, about five minutes later, Song Ren passed through Helgen's underground fortress. The dim cave entrance was covered with many vines. Faint light streamed in through the gaps in the vines.

Arriving at the entrance, Song Ren controlled his character to push aside the vines, and the sunlight outside was dazzling. Then, the scenery of Skyrim unfolded before Song Ren. Dense green forests, faintly visible elk in the distant woods, squirrels darting through treetops. Further away, a silver-white mountain range covered in heavy snow was dimly visible. Hazy white mist and thick clouds filled the sky, and looking down the winding mountain path, a rushing river could be seen through the white mist. This beautiful scenery utterly amazed Song Ren.

This was a tried and true method in games: exiting a cave in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, passing through narrow ruins to see the legendary Pirate's Haven in Uncharted, or Ezio and his brother climbing a cathedral's bell tower at night in Assassin's Creed...

"It seems the dragon won't be coming back now; we're safe for the moment." As the black dragon in the sky roared and left Helgen Keep, Ralof beside him let out a long breath. There were several dialogue options available: conversations related to dragons, and those concerning the Stormcloaks and Imperial soldiers. Clearly, these were all meant to help players understand the game's background content.

Besides this, Song Ren also received two quests. One was to go to Riverwood, not far outside Helgen Keep, to find Ralof's sister, Gerdur, and the other was whether to join the Stormcloaks.

"Are these two main quests? It should be like The Witcher: Wild Hunt, one being a personal main quest and the other a faction main quest." Song Ren guessed, then glanced at the markers on the map. The objective for joining the Stormcloaks was simply too far, and the rest of the map was shrouded in fog, clearly requiring him to personally explore and unlock it. So, Song Ren's primary objective was set on Riverwood.

Although the game's storyline hadn't yet mentioned an identity like "Dragonborn," Song Ren, having watched the promotional video, naturally knew that the protagonist was highly likely to be the Dragonborn.

"Riverwood, this must be the newbie village." "Alright, the Dragonborn's grand adventure is about to officially begin." "Let's start forging the legendary life of the Dovahkiin from this first stop, Riverwood!"

Brandishing the Imperial soldier's longsword in his hand, Song Ren was full of confidence.
