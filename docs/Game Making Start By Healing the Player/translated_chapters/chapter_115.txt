Chapter 115: This Damn Sense of Oppression!

Currently, Wang Han was positioned in a circular courtyard, with a cliff to the right and countless gravestones and lit candles to the left.

In the center stood Ash Judgment Gundyr, motionless like a stone statue.

But what truly attracted Wang Han wasn't any of that—it was the bloodstains on the ground.

Beside Ash Judgment Gundyr, Wang Han's view contained at least twenty or thirty bloodstains.

In Dark Souls, if players engage in online multiplayer, their data is automatically uploaded to the server.

One thing that differs from other games is that, aside from in-game messages, the scenes of a player's death are also randomly displayed in other players' worlds.

Of course, this is random—the highest priority is given to the most recently deceased player.

The reason so many bloodstains were placed near Ash Judgment Gundyr was precisely to comfort players.

To let them know that in this despair-filled world, they weren't fighting alone.

Being taught a lesson by Uncle Ashen Gundyr right after entering the game wasn't an experience unique to them.

The twenty or thirty bloodstains before Wang Han now meant that at least that many people had already fallen on this very ground.

"My god! How many people have died here?!" Wang Han's earlier sense of dread intensified.

Wang Han guided her in-game character '123' onto one of the bloodstains and pressed the interaction button.

Immediately, the bloodstain transformed into a red shadow that rolled across the ground twice before suddenly being impaled and launched into the air, then falling back down and writhing before collapsing.

She continued checking nearby bloodstains—each death scene was incredibly diverse.

Some were violently flung away, others seemed completely flattened, while some appeared to have been pierced straight through.

But one thing they all shared was that before dying, these shadows had desperately rolled around on the ground.

"Oh no… I feel like Ash Judgment Gundyr is actually really strong!"

Wang Han felt a chill creeping up her spine.

Beside her, Zhang Yi also sensed something was off, but he still spoke up analytically: "If you think that way, you've already fallen for it. Why can we only see the moment of death?"

"This is Chen Xu's scheme! He's manipulating players' perceptions, making them increasingly nervous. After all, the unknown is the most terrifying—just like in Outlast." Zhang Yi declared confidently.

Wang Han pondered: "So you're saying Ash Judgment Gundyr might actually be weak, and Chen Xu just designed it this way to create mystery?"

Zhang Yi shook his head: "No… I'm saying you should hurry up and start the BOSS fight. Once you die, switch to me."

"Get lost!" Wang Han was speechless.

With rising tension, Wang Han took a deep breath and guided her character forward to trigger the story.

On screen, her character strained her body, gripping the Coiled Sword embedded in Ash Judgment Gundyr's chest, and slowly began pulling it backward.

'Pssshhh…'

A stream of black blood gushed from Gundyr's chest as the Coiled Sword was gradually extracted.

The moment the sword was fully removed, the screen trembled. The figure that had been kneeling like a stone statue now rose, wielding his great halberd.

Wang Han had already seen Ash Judgment Gundyr during the previous online press conference video.

But watching a video and playing it yourself were two entirely different things.

The massive gray-white form stood up, towering over the in-game character '123'—three times its height combined.

Its colossal body blocked out the cold sunlight, creating an overwhelmingly震撼 effect.

As Gundyr rose, the game's grand background music swelled, accompanied by deep chanting, building an atmosphere of epicness that stirred Wang Han's emotions.

At the bottom of the screen, a long health bar appeared, along with the BOSS's name—Ash Judgment Gundyr.

This was only the first BOSS battle in the game, yet it already carried the same weight and tension usually reserved for final BOSS fights in other games.

In terms of atmosphere and rendering, Dark Souls was already nothing short of explosive!

"Now begins a life-or-death struggle! You shall not stop me from linking the fire!" Listening to the vast, grand background audio, Wang Han felt herself ignite, a sudden surge of drama filling her chest.

At that moment, the awakened Ash Judgment Gundyr launched his attack.

The massive figure took a step forward and charged.

Dust kicked up as the enormous halberd in Gundyr's hand swung effortlessly in a sweeping slash.

Instinctively, Wang Han rolled backward twice. With her small, fragile shield, she seriously doubted whether it could withstand a direct hit from Gundyr's halberd.

After seeing Zhang Yi's first death, she already understood the importance of the stamina bar.

If her stamina bar was emptied outright, her situation would become even more dangerous. Rolling seemed to offer a higher margin for error.

After his first sweeping slash, Gundyr pressed his advantage without pause, immediately following up with a jumping downward strike.

This time, Wang Han wasn't so lucky.

She was hit directly. Her health bar dropped as if a major artery had been severed—halved in an instant.

"My god! His attack power is way too high!" Wang Han was stunned.

Now she finally understood why all the previous death scenes showed frantic rolling followed by sudden death.

Was this BOSS really meant for beginners?

Rolling frantically on the ground, a question flashed through Wang Han's mind.

Earlier, when she watched Zhang Yi fight the Crystal Lizard, she could still offer commentary.

But watching and playing were two completely different things. Only now, after taking control herself, did she realize something felt off about this game.

The Crystal Lizard could be excused—after all, there was a 'Turn Back' warning right at the entrance.

But what about this Ash Judgment Gundyr?

This damn Sense of Oppression—why was it so intense?!

Yes!

It was the Sense of Oppression!

For Wang Han, who was experiencing Dark Souls for the first time, this BOSS battle delivered nothing but overwhelming pressure.

The massive, imposing figure of Gundyr, swinging his halberd with wide, sweeping motions, exuded sheer dominance in every move.

Especially when the halberd struck the ground, the accompanying sound effects and rising dust Special Effects amplified the Sense of Oppression to its peak.

Facing Ash Judgment Gundyr, Wang Han spent nearly the entire time fleeing in panic.

In a brief moment of courage, she lunged forward during Gundyr's attack gap and landed a couple of hits. But due to insufficient stamina, she failed to perform consecutive rolls to Create Distance and was grazed by the halberd.

That single graze cost her half her health.

Her Fruit Pulp Orange Juice was now completely gone.

Out of items, out of options.

Looking at Gundyr, whose health had dropped by roughly one-tenth, then at her own character, down to a sliver of health, Wang Han made a decision.

She guided her character '123' forward in a brave charge.

She delivered a perfect set of massage and manipulation techniques directly to Gundyr's legs.

Actually, it dealt quite a bit of damage.

Two solid hits later, Ash Judgment Gundyr's health bar visibly dropped by another tenth.

But the next moment, Gundyr's halberd swung upward in a rising slash.

Her character flew into the air, accompanied by a pitiful "Errgh!"

Three words appeared in the center of the screen—

YOU DIED
