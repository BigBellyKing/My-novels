## Chapter 230: A Breath of Fresh Air Among MC Players (8th Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)

With the release of Chen Xu's unique video,

it quickly became a hot topic of discussion among Minecraft players and also attracted the attention of many who had heard of the game but hadn't yet played it.

Compared to the various previous skill-showcasing videos that left players awestruck,

this video felt much more relatable to players.

After all, while those visually stunning videos were indeed awesome,

for most players, it was more about enjoying the spectacle—waiting for veteran players to upload their creations to the Workshop (modding platform), then downloading and playing with them.

But when it came to actually creating such things themselves?

Sorry, no thanks!

This time, Chen Xu's video on the historical major events of Minecraft featured things that many players had genuinely experienced.

For example, not knowing how to build a house, so they simply dug a hole, placed down torches and a bed, and made do for the night.

Or on their first night, being chased by monsters and instinctively using the "dig-three-fill-one" technique to escape.

Of course, there were also unlucky persons who unknowingly dug a pit in the wrong spot, excavating three blocks only to fall directly into a massive mine shaft, losing their first life pointlessly.

Players from various servers who had personally participated in large-scale events felt especially energized.

"Haha, I'm from Server 111. We've already started rebuilding the Sky City, planning to use Glass for the entire city's ground level! But quite a few unlucky persons, not realizing the Glass was transparent, accidentally fell through while building."

"That's nothing! Our Server 3511 is truly awesome! We were digging, and suddenly lava burst out, setting me on fire! Plus, we've made a new decision: artificially creating a lava river! Our underground city will be called Lava City!"

"Haha, I'm a player from Server 2147. Everyone was fighting with iron weapons, but then someone who was farming and raising them like livestock pulled out a gun, declaring that times have changed! Hilarious! So attention-grabbing!"

"Bro upstairs, you're too strong! Who came up with the idea for your Merchant Alliance?"

"How would I know? I wasn't even part of the group when the Merchant Alliance was formed—I was the one who got shot!"

"Actually, that's nothing. To qualify for the next episode of the major events video, the veterans from our Server 188 have signed a ceasefire agreement and unanimously decided to focus on urban development, selecting a respected leader to guide us in growing bigger and stronger, creating brilliance together!"

"Damn it, awesome! I'll mark this. Bro, remember to update us if anything new happens—I'm curious!"

"Hey, what are you marking!? Everyone wants to be the boss; the team spirit is already broken! We originally planned for a tripartite presidential system, but now it's split into tribal mode."

Besides the diverse world developments across various servers in multiplayer mode, which players found highly entertaining,

many players in the game also began exploring different Gameplay styles.

Some continued building beautiful houses in solo Creative Mode, immersed in their own worlds.

Others gathered to experience multiplayer server Gameplay.

The video's release also sparked deeper exploration of the game among players.

For instance, they began studying the game's Tech content, the Redstone mechanisms, and some players had even discovered the existence of the Nether.

Some veteran players started researching the game's complex Redstone systems, aiming to create even more awesome things.

Even more advanced players began developing various MODs.

Not just the earlier types of MODs involving Redstone mechanisms or building complexes,

but MODs with unique Gameplay.

Many other players, though not creating MODs, set up custom servers, formulating specific rules for various fun mini-games.

For example, downloading the theme scene of Along the River During the Qingming Festival, creating period-appropriate custom skins for players, and disabling player IDs in the game.

In a single round, 20 regular players are placed in a designated area within the Along the River During the Qingming Festival theme scene, with two players designated as killers equipped with attack-capable weapons.

The remaining players must blend in with NPCs or hide in corners, surviving until the time limit.

Each time a killer attacks incorrectly, they lose a health point.

Similar custom mini-game rooms began to multiply.

There were also puzzle games, where a complete structure was disassembled and split into two teams to see which could reassemble it faster.

Though no official rules existed, through player-established conventions and server-imposed rules,

unique Gameplay styles continued to emerge within Minecraft.

This perfectly aligned with the title of the game—Minecraft.

Everyone has their own world.

Everyone has their own way of playing.

Thus, the charm of Minecraft was fully showcased.

Although, inevitably with such a large player base, there were some entitled new players and veteran players who enjoyed bullying newcomers.

But compared to the overall environment, thanks to Minecraft's game rules, its slightly cartoon art style, and Nebula Games' excellent community management for the game,

Minecraft stood apart from other games, becoming a breath of fresh air in an online era filled with hostility.

This positive environment continuously solidified Minecraft's popularity, attracting more players to get into the game (colloquial for starting to play a game/join a hobby).

The sales miracle created by Minecraft left the entire gaming industry stunned.

Many game designers believed they had already given Minecraft high regard.

But as days passed, reality proved they had still underestimated this game.

By mid-March, it had been exactly one and a half months since Minecraft launched. During this period, several other games were released.

Yet they were still overshadowed by Minecraft, with no game managing to surpass its popularity.

Game designers who launched their titles during this phase were practically facing widespread despair.

Chen Xu clearly didn't pay much attention to his peers' misfortunes.

In Nebula Games' office, Chen Xu emerged from the gaming pod and took the phone handed to him by Qin Yi.

"Mr. Chen, we've tested all the major mobile platforms. Optimizations are nearly at their limit," Qin Yi explained.

The porting for the mobile and VR versions was essentially complete.

It wasn't a massive undertaking—especially for the mobile version, which mainly required optimization and some content cuts.

The VR version's main work focused on Modeling materials and related VR operation experiences.

But this wasn't Chen Xu's first time developing VR; during the development of Silent Hill PT for the Game Department, he had already gained experience with VR actions and related adaptation, so it wasn't particularly difficult.

"Alright, that should be it. Notify the Marketing and Operations Department to prepare for release," Chen Xu said with a slight nod after briefly examining the device.
