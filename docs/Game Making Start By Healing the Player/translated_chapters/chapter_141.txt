Chapter 140: New Game Idea and the Game of the Year Event (Subscription and Monthly Pass Request)

The news about Nebula Games acquiring Galaxy Smart Tech stirred little ripple in the gaming industry.

For ordinary players, it was completely uninteresting.

After all, acquiring a company wasn’t the same as releasing a new game.

Within the gaming industry, people merely sighed with emotion over Nebula Games’ bold move.

Acquiring studios or other businesses wasn’t rare.

Besides, although 'Galaxy Smart Tech' had some reputation, it remained unfamiliar to most people outside the circle of intelligent AI research.

Thus, the group most affected by this acquisition was actually Nebula Games’ internal employees.

During lunch break, employees from various departments at Nebula Games chatted with surprised expressions.

Everyone was stunned by their company’s sudden action.

They actually acquired a company?

Did the company just suddenly expand in scale!?

Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue, however, already knew about the upcoming big move, as Chen Xu had previously hinted at related information.

Still, they hadn’t expected the big move to involve spending a huge sum to acquire an entire company.

Qin Yi and many others from the development team, on the other hand, were visibly excited.

Clearly, they were already fantasizing about how AI could be implemented in future games.

For games, enhanced technical capabilities could completely elevate the player experience.

"If we introduce intelligent AI into *Dark Souls*, combined with the random mode, I wonder what kind of scenes that would create!" Qin Yi sat on the sofa, staring at the *Dark Souls* gameplay on the nearby screen, already filled with anticipation.

"Be human, please!" Ruan Ningxue, sitting nearby, grumbled inwardly upon hearing Qin Yi.

*Dark Souls* was already notoriously difficult, and after the random mode was introduced, many Unlucky King players believed the random mode was even harder than the normal version.

Because everything became uncontrollable.

Now they wanted to add intelligent AI?

Wouldn’t that just mean players would be tormented even more?

"Could it be that Mr. Chen acquired this company to prepare for the sequel to *Dark Souls*?" Yang Xin pondered, chin resting on her hand.

This wasn’t just her speculation—many *Dark Souls* players thought the same.

But the next moment, a voice answered her question: "Don’t overthink it. It’s just a strategic move for the future. Nebula Games’ projects will inevitably diversify, and we also need to accumulate technical expertise."

Chen Xu, holding a cup of coffee, found a seat and sat down.

Hearing Chen Xu, Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and the others nodded in understanding.

"But Mr. Chen, do you have any plans for the upcoming period?" Qin Yi asked.

Chen Xu shook his head upon hearing the question: "Of course, there are arrangements for new projects, but timing-wise, it’s definitely not feasible. This year’s Spring Festival comes early. Plus, in a few days, I have to attend the Game Department’s annual Game of the Year event."

Unlike in his previous life, in this Parallel World, both domestic and overseas counterparts hosted similar Game of the Year award events.

However, the one Chen Xu was invited to this time was hosted by the Game Department—carrying a somewhat official tone.

Moreover, compared to previous years, this year’s Game of the Year event was slightly different.

Although it remained an annual award ceremony, in past years, its influence was greater within the industry.

It had less impact on players compared to more commercially oriented award events.

Last year, Chen Xu’s works were also nominated.

*Undertale* won the Best Independent Game award, while *To the Moon* received the Best Music award.

But this year was different.

The Game Department reformed the award ceremony, aiming to involve more players and expand its influence—making it vastly different from previous years in terms of attention and engagement.

This shift was evident in the recent Game Design Competitions.

This was also one of the reasons why NetDragon and TengHua suddenly unveiled two VR blockbusters, directly competing with each other.

On another front, Yang Chen, the Game Department head in Modu, had privately informed Chen Xu that during the annual event, certificates would also be awarded to designers who had been promoted to senior job titles this year.

Therefore, Chen Xu absolutely couldn’t miss it.

This meant Chen Xu would be extremely busy during this period, with little time to develop new works before the year-end.

After hearing Chen Xu’s words, Qin Yi, Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, and others appeared excited.

Clearly, they understood that this year’s Game of the Year event carried significant weight.

"Mr. Chen, do we have a chance to win an award?"

"Yeah! We’ve released quite a few works this year, right? *Overcooked*, *Fall Guys*, *Sanguosha*, *Valiant Hearts: The Great War*, and *Dark Souls*!"

Everyone was filled with anticipation.

"*Valiant Hearts: The Great War* will definitely receive an award. As for the others, it’s up to fate," Chen Xu smiled and replied.

This was practically an unwritten rule. After all, *Valiant Hearts: The Great War* had won first place in this year’s anti-war Game Design Competition.

The Game Department couldn’t possibly give it zero recognition—even a consolation prize would be expected.

"Also, regarding new projects, I already have an idea. *Dark Souls* tormented players so badly that there’s massive online backlash against me. So for the next one, I’ve decided to make a much more wholesome game. I’ll discuss the details in a meeting after I attend the Game Department’s event," Chen Xu said with a smile.

Wholesome again? Hearing Chen Xu’s words, Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and Qin Yi all exchanged awkward glances.

…………………

On the day of the Game of the Year event, the weather was pleasant.

Compared to previous years, this year’s Game of the Year selection was undoubtedly the most prestigious and highly anticipated in history.

On various live streaming platforms, dedicated channels were broadcasting the entire event live.

As a result, game designers from across the gaming industry, regardless of their reasons, attended—even those who knew they were merely attending for appearances’ sake.

Partly to respect the Game Department’s authority, and partly to boost their sense of presence.

Much like the Oscars—even if you’re just a background extra, walking the red carpet was still beneficial.

The event was held at the Modu Convention Center Exhibition Hall.

The Game Department had also arranged accommodations in advance.

Compared to previous years, which included lectures and industry exchange activities, this year everything of that sort was canceled.

The main focus this year was on players.

Ordinary players cared more about which awards their favorite games received, rather than industry exchanges.

They simply didn’t care!

Moreover, what so-called ‘experience’ could those lectures truly offer?

Every game designer had their own mature philosophy and insights on game design.

Who would be foolish enough to directly reveal it to others?

Thus, previous lectures were mostly performative.

They might greatly benefit ordinary game designers.

But for those directly invited—without claiming they were all top-tier—were at least key figures in the industry. To them, such lectures offered no real value.

They were purely ceremonial.

Therefore, the Game Department decided to cut this segment entirely, keeping only the award ceremony—the part players looked forward to most.

Before the event began, Chen Xu entered through the entrance, holding his pass.

The venue was filled with numerous game designers.

But they were mostly divided into several factions.

TengHua, NetDragon… along with designers from second- and third-tier game developers, and some well-known individual designers.

Unlike the TengHua and NetDragon factions, whose designers often didn’t get along, the ordinary game designers had relatively purer relationships.

"Wonder who’ll take home the Best Game of the Year this year!"

"Feels like NetDragon’s *Star God* has the best chance."

"Not necessarily. TengHua’s *Sin City* has also performed impressively."

"Hey, has no one mentioned *Dark Souls*? I think *Dark Souls* is definitely top-tier."

"Ahem, I’m not knowledgeable enough to discuss that."

"Exactly. I haven’t even cleared the Irithyll Dungeon yet."

"It’s excellent, but the platform puts it at a disadvantage. If *Dark Souls* were on VR, I believe it’d be a top contender. But on PC platform, especially in award evaluations, it’s still too disadvantaged."

"Yeah, sigh… Isn’t that Chen Xu?"

"Looks like it! Really is!"

"Come on, let’s go say hello."

In a corner of the hall,

a group of independent game designers and those from smaller developers gathered, discussing the event.

They were several designers Chen Xu had briefly met during the Game Department’s gameplay Expo.

Later, Chen Xu had even joined their designer exchange and discussion group.

However, only a few of them were invited this time.

Chen Xu had just entered the venue and hadn’t had time to survey the scene when he heard someone calling him from behind.

Turning around, he saw familiar faces.

"Everyone’s here?" Chen Xu greeted them with a smile.

"Got lucky with the invitation—just here to see how things work," one person joked.

"Mr. Chen, your *Dark Souls* this year really taught us industry designers a lesson!"

"Listen to you—didn’t Mr. Chen teach us all a lesson last year too? Didn’t *Undertale* shock everyone?"

The group slipped into full commercial mutual praise mode.

"Alright, alright, let’s find a seat and talk. Don’t block the way," Chen Xu laughed, guiding them forward.

As they walked deeper into the venue, they continued chatting.

After finding a spot, they resumed their conversation. Midway, several other game designers noticed Chen Xu and specifically came over to exchange contacts and greetings, hoping to make a familiar impression.

Time quickly passed until evening.

This was the main highlight of the event.

Nearly all media outlets from the gaming industry had arrived, conducting live broadcasts simultaneously.

On the bullet comments of the live stream rooms, many players waiting in front of their computers were actively discussing.

‘Why hasn’t it started yet!?’

‘Feels like the Game Department has been more active these past few years!’

‘Voting for *Star God* as Game of the Year!’

‘Dream on! *Sin City* isn’t vegetarian, you know!’

‘Wonder if *Dark Souls* has any chance of winning.’

‘Enough talk—where’s Mr. Chen? Haven’t seen him!’

‘+1, I need to memorize what Mr. Chen looks like. That *Dark Souls* really suffered me miserably!’

Players in the live stream rooms bantered casually.

Meanwhile, Chen Xu and the other game designers gradually entered the venue.

"Mr. Chen, what a coincidence!"

Seating arrangements had been predetermined.

Game designers seated in the front rows were mostly those nominated.

Chen Xu found his seat, and a familiar voice came from beside him.

"Teacher Meng, we meet again," Chen Xu said upon seeing the person’s face, memories instantly surfacing.

After all, the man’s enthusiastic demeanor during the gameplay Expo was still fresh in his mind.

"Yes!" Meng Zuo smiled, though inwardly he felt a slight unease.

Every time he met Chen Xu, some minor unexpected incident always seemed to happen!

But Meng Zuo didn’t have much time to dwell on it.

As all game designers took their seats, the award ceremony officially began.

Just like yesterday, the rest of the night was made.
