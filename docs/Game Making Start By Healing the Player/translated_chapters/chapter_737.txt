Chapter 736: Is Kratos Really Dead or Not? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

In Zhang Yi’s live stream room, he was currently battling Helios, the Sun God.

‘Kratos, I haven’t forgotten the favor I owe you, spare me!’

‘Just like you saved me from Atlas before, I promise to repay you with all my might.’

Finally, Helios begged Kratos to spare him, but Kratos, having once again climbed out of Hades, had only one thought.

That was to avenge Olympus, to kill all the gods who stood in his way.

Before this, during the Great War between the Gods and Titans, Kratos, who had initially allied with the Titans, encountered Zeus.

But Zeus struck first, casting Gaia and Kratos down from Mount Olympus.

In a moment of crisis, Gaia, seeking self-preservation, directly abandoned Kratos, who she had once found useful.

‘Gaia, Gaia!’

As he fell, Kratos let out a chilling roar.

Kratos knew he had been betrayed again, used again.

Ares, Zeus, the Olympian Gods, the Ancient Titans...

Kratos’s life of tragedy was all due to those high and mighty gods.

Once again betrayed, Kratos was thrown into the River Styx by Gaia, and his divine power was nearly devoured by the monsters in the river.

But Kratos was not completely annihilated; upon reaching shore, he encountered Athena in her phantom form.

However, what surprised the players was that, unlike the Athena who had previously even sacrificed herself to protect Zeus, this phantom Athena seemed like a completely different person. She not only told Kratos how to kill Zeus but also returned his Blades of Chaos to him.

But compared to the players' confusion over Athena's 180-degree shift in attitude, Kratos didn’t care much. Titans, gods—now all were Kratos's enemies; he had only one thought: revenge.

So once again, Kratos crawled out of Hades.

The madness brought on by revenge allowed Kratos to display violence to its fullest extent.

And in terms of execution, it was exaggerated to the extreme.

It was already brutal enough before, but here, the brutality Kratos unleashed ascended to an incomparable level.

Because here, the player's perspective would transform into that of the gods brutally slain by Kratos, experiencing Kratos's savagery in a first-person victim’s view.

Facing the Sun God’s pleas for mercy, Zhang Yi watched as Kratos stomped his head into the ground, then brutally ripped it off.

“Holy cow! What the heck! This is absolutely insane!”

Feeling the first-person victim’s perspective from moments ago, Zhang Yi couldn't help but gulp.

It was simply too brutal. Before this, Kratos had also killed Poseidon, gouging out his eyes, twisting his head off, and tossing him into the sea, letting the Sea God perish in his own domain.

Now, he directly ripped off the Sun God's head to use as a flashlight.

In this journey of destroying Olympus, Kratos’s displayed madness arguably reached an extreme peak.

As for the BOSS battles, they were utterly exhilarating; the only word to describe them was 'satisfying.'

At the beginning, when facing Poseidon, Kratos climbed and moved across Gaia’s body, fighting alongside the Titans.

Then, he successively eliminated Poseidon’s Hippocampi Leviathan and his divine essence before finally pulling out his true form and successfully killing him.

The grandeur of the scene and the imposing actions were simply breathtaking.

And the battles with other BOSSes later on were no less spectacular than this one.

The fight with Cronos, Zeus's father, was equally astonishing.

As a Titan, Cronos was incredibly massive, yet Kratos was not even as big as his fingernail.

This could be said to be the most disparate battle in terms of size difference to date.

But with his Helios, the Sun God, flashlight and the Blades of Chaos, Kratos brutally ripped open Cronos’s belly and then pierced his skull.

In this bloody battle against the Greek Gods and Ancient Titans,

No matter how colossal the opponent, no matter how much they pleaded, nothing could sway Kratos’s vengeful heart.

Everything began with the gods, so all the gods would be slaughtered.

To completely destroy this world, this was Kratos’s ultimate goal.

And everything after the slaughter of gods and Titans in the game foreshadowed the destruction of the Greek world.

But what also left Zhang Yi with a lingering sense of dread was Kratos's madness in his unending vengeful fury at the very end.

It made the entire game feel somewhat deranged, even oppressive.

After killing Poseidon, floods submerged the world.

After tearing off Helios, the Sun God’s head, the world plunged into darkness.

Upon slaying Cronos, the Titan’s body transformed into sprawling mountains.

Kratos eliminated each of the Greek Gods one by one.

He personally killed the Ancient Titans, seized Hercules’s gauntlets to pulp him into oblivion, and used the Claws of Hades to tear out the Underworld ruler’s soul.

And each time these Greek Gods met their demise, the world edged closer to destruction.

Floods, darkness, withered plants, raging winds...

However, none of this could stop Kratos’s relentless advance. With an oppressive, suffocating presence, the brutally fierce Kratos completely purged Olympus.

Apart from the very congenial Aphrodite and her two little handmaidens, who brought a knowing smile to players’ faces, the entire game process was filled with savagery.

As the story progressed, one by one, the Olympian gods were eliminated by Kratos.

And the game’s plot was nearing its end.

On Olympus, Kratos once again confronted the King of the Olympian Gods: Zeus.

As the body of the Ancient Titan Gaia disintegrated, Zeus was impaled through the chest by Kratos’s Blade of Olympus.

Seeing Zeus pierced through the chest, Kratos pulled out the Blade of Olympus and turned to leave.

But just as Kratos turned to leave, Zeus, now a spirit, unleashed his last divine power, and blinding lightning struck Kratos.

With the lightning, the UI display on Zhang Yi’s screen was directly shattered, and the screen plunged into endless darkness.

In this darkness, Kratos heard the voices of his wife and daughter, whom he had killed with his own hands—an illusion stemming from dark power.

But in the end, Kratos broke free from the illusion and awoke from the darkness.

Looking at Zeus before him, following the reappearing system prompts, Zhang Yi repeatedly punched Zeus in the face.

Blood splattered, and soon Zhang Yi’s vision was covered in a crimson haze.

“Oh my god, how long do I have to hit him? Is this a bug? No, I need a break, I’m exhausted.”

After punching for about five or six minutes, seeing that the next cutscene hadn't triggered, Zhang Yi couldn't help but feel puzzled.

Pummeling Zeus initially felt incredibly satisfying, but how many punches had he thrown?

Why hadn’t the next animation triggered yet?

Even though he didn’t have to click like with a controller or keyboard and mouse,

Maintaining such intense concentration was actually more tiring.

Just as Zhang Yi stopped, the screen froze.

“So, I have to stop to trigger it? If I keep hitting him, I can hit him forever?”

Looking at the subsequent cutscene, Zhang Yi was speechless.

Who would have thought?

Seeing the prompt to hit Zeus, of course, he thought of relentlessly pummeling him, and there were no further prompts.

Had he just been stupidly hitting him for several minutes?

After successfully killing Zeus, the world was about to return to chaos, but then Athena reappeared.

Athena, in her phantom form, told Kratos that long ago, Zeus had sealed all the evils of the world into a jar, and at that time, Athena had also infused it with the power of hope.

This jar was secretly hidden in Pandora's Temple until Kratos opened it for the first time.

At that time, the evil power born from the jar infected the Olympian Gods, amplifying their inner fears and desires.

But this power of hope also transferred to Kratos, which is why Kratos was able to kill Ares and numerous Olympian Gods back then.

Now, all the Greek Gods had perished, and the world was on the brink of collapsing back into chaos.

Athena, in her phantom form, demanded the power of hope from Kratos, stating that she would become the true supreme god and reshape a truly peaceful world.

“Holy cow, what a schemer!”

Recalling Athena's wordplay that had once tricked Kratos, and then seeing her current phantom state, Zhang Yi couldn't help but curse.

Having suffered once from a lack of understanding, how could he fall for it a second time?

Just as Zhang Yi thought, Kratos, with his inherent pride, decisively rejected Athena’s scheme.

All the Greek Gods had been slaughtered by him, his family no longer existed, and though he was still the God of War,

From birth to death, his entire destiny seemed to have been guided by the gods.

Kratos now understood one thing clearly: as long as gods existed, mortals would never truly achieve peace and happiness.

He himself was the best example.

So, in the end, Kratos took the Blade of Olympus and pierced his own body.

A white light burst from Kratos’s body, soaring into the sky and then descending upon the world. It was the power of hope within him; Kratos chose to leave this power of hope for humanity.

Watching Kratos’s final choice, Zhang Yi couldn't help but sigh with emotion.

Although Kratos in the game had done many terrible things, it had to be said that he was definitely a quintessential tough guy protagonist.

The only thing that made Zhang Yi grit his teeth was that Nebula Games' list of deceased characters seemed to be gaining another protagonist.

But before Zhang Yi could think further, a sudden scene before his eyes made him pause.

Watching Kratos kneel in suicide, the phantom Athena furiously pulled the Blade of Olympus from his chest.

Then, a long shot.

But when the camera zoomed back in,

Kratos’s body had vanished, leaving only a pool of blood on the ground.

And the pattern of blood was carved into the symbol of a phoenix.

Kratos, wasn’t he dead?
