# Chapter 55: Matryoshka-Style Spread

"Is it really that exaggerated? I want to see what kind of magic this 'Outlast' has!"

In a residential complex in the Imperial Capital, a bare-chested, short-haired, muscular tough guy, standing at 1.92 meters tall, sat in front of his computer.

This tough guy, named Song Ren, was currently looking at information on a certain forum with a suspicious expression.

It was uniformly filled with comments about how terrifying 'Outlast' was.

He had always been uninterested in horror games.

However, knowing that this horror game was made by the designer of 'To the Moon' sparked some curiosity in him.

After all, despite his imposing appearance, how did that saying go? "A tiger in the heart sniffs a rose with care."

Outwardly, he was a pure tough guy, but even tough guys shed tears sometimes; he had cried a bucket of tears when he played 'To the Moon'.

So, he still paid some attention to Nebula Games and the designer Chen Xu.

Moreover, 'Outlast' seemed quite popular recently, so he decided to give it a try.

A horror game, could it really be that scary?

With curiosity, Song Ren bought and installed the game, then launched it.

"Heh... just putting on an act?"

In front of Mount Massive Asylum, Song Ren was brimming with confidence.

"Heh... is that all?!"

From climbing the shelves to the lights in the room going out, Song Ren's face showed disdain.

"Hiss... it's just a door jump scare, nothing to be afraid of."

A corpse came flying out the door, startling Song Ren slightly.

"Wait... don't come over here!!"

A patient in a wheelchair in the lobby demanded a "hug of love," turning Song Ren's face pale.

An hour later,

Song Ren leaned back in his chair, breathing heavily. At this moment, he could clearly feel his heart pounding.

Thump-thump, strong and powerful, all from being scared by the recent scenes.

Looking at the nearby curtains, he silently got up and drew them open, letting the sunlight into the room.

"Sunshine... feels good!"

Looking at the bright sun outside, and at the monitor showing the game's store interface after he had exited the game, Song Ren slowly exhaled.

He had to admit one thing: he had lost, and completely so.

Thinking back to his recent gaming experience, Song Ren, still leaning in his chair and gazing at the bright sun outside, felt his legs still a little weak.

But then, Song Ren suddenly remembered something. After recovering from his recent fear,

He silently opened his phone, found his friend's account, and sent a message.

"Old Zhang, I found a really fun game, it's so thrilling! It's incredibly satisfying to play, I highly recommend you try it too."

"It's the new work by the designer of 'To the Moon', 'Outlast'. What genre? Parkour and puzzle-solving, I have to say it's super exciting!"

After sending it, Song Ren took a deep breath, then gazed out at the scenery beyond the window.

Thankfully, thankfully he played this game in broad daylight!

Leaning back in his chair in the room, about half an hour passed.

His phone on the table rang.

A message was sent by someone named Old Zhang.

A simple sentence, and three exclamation marks expressing intense excitement—'Damn it, you old bastard!!!'

Seeing this message, Song Ren, leaning back in his chair, laughed aloud.

His earlier fear had completely faded.

Because in his mind, he had already visualized exactly how his friend had been scared out of his wits.

After laughing, he saw his bright monitor screen; his account on the game platform was still on the 'Outlast' launch interface.

After a moment of silence, Song Ren quietly closed the platform.

***

There were many, many players like Song Ren.

Initially, these players learned about 'Outlast' because of 'To the Moon'.

But more often, they discovered the game through forums in various game communities.

Like Song Ren, these players, upon seeing other players' comments, were filled with a sense of curiosity and an unwillingness to admit defeat.

How scary could a horror game be? Seriously? Is this just marketing by internet trolls?

With such thoughts, these players intended to play it themselves, then post screenshots of their completed game to boast about it.

After all, many players, especially when it came to courage, apart from those who truly had self-awareness, still had a mysterious confidence in themselves.

However, once they entered the game, they quickly realized what kind of game it truly was.

Not to mention the later content, just the early parts had already scared away a large number of players.

Some players enthusiastically entered the game, only to be deterred right at the entrance of Mount Massive Asylum.

Others were turned away during the first door jump scare or when they encountered Fat Guy.

Of course, even more were deterred in the basement, facing the pitch-black environment where they couldn't see their hand in front of their face, being chased by a madman wielding a spiked plank.

Naturally, a portion of players gritted their teeth and persevered.

But once they repaired the generator and the Priest gave them an injection, leading them into the prison stage, they realized that everything before was merely an appetizer!

Of course, within the game, they were deterred at different stages.

But after the game, they all did one thing in common.

That was to post on game forums, either recommending or warning other players.

It was like a Matryoshka doll, one nested within another.

After all, if I got scared, then tricking one more person is a win.

Everyone else should feel the same way I did!

Later players, seeing all sorts of information, were completely bewildered and couldn't figure out what kind of horror game 'Outlast' truly was.

Some people, to make their claims more believable, even specifically took screenshots of less terrifying scenes.

But others described it in great detail, declaring 'Outlast' to be extremely terrifying.

The increasing number of accounts attracted subsequent players who learned about 'Outlast', drawing them in one after another.

It was like a relay race: the person in front reached the finish line and passed the baton to the next athlete.

However, the spread among 'Outlast' players was even wider.

Because the player base was constantly expanding, this meant the spread of information was also continuously growing.

Initially, Chen Xu still needed to subtly guide the relevant directions and topics, and appropriately create memes for the players.

But as more and more players wet themselves from fright in Mount Massive Asylum,

Nebula Games no longer needed to guide them with capital.

The spontaneous discussions among players were enough to create hot topics, slowly fermenting and expanding their influence like a prairie fire.
