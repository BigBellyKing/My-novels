Chapter 483: Content of Nebula World (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

"Please Give It A Rest, you're not much better than me!" Song Ren sneered, though he opened the in-game store himself.

He could make purchases now.

However, he couldn't use them for decoration just yet.

Moreover, he noticed the store carried a surprisingly wide range of items.

It covered all games released under Nebula Games so far.

Yet, he found many items were unobtainable because he hadn't achieved the required in-game accomplishments.

Faced with such a vast selection, he quickly spent all 10,000 gold coins gifted by the system.

Then, he used some tokens to buy more. Nebula Games had returned a generous amount of tokens in the past, and Song Ren had purchased nearly every title at launch—both first-party and third-party games that interested him. He didn’t bother buying discounted titles he knew were just going to be another addition to his collection. As a result, he still had plenty of tokens left.

Now, they came in handy for buying these decorative items, especially with the available discount vouchers making it even more cost-effective.

"Huh… why is there a skill tree here too?" Suddenly, Song Ren noticed something.

Besides the store interface, there was a skill tree tab next to it.

But when he clicked into it, most of the nodes were question marks.

The only visible icon was something resembling an eye, slightly creepy in appearance—its purpose unknown.

"Not sure. Probably hasn’t been updated yet. I think Nebula World will keep evolving over time," Zhang Yi said, marveling at the surrounding scenes.

The graphics were on par with Uncharted—absolutely stunning!

"Enough talk. Let’s check out the VR theme. Wonder if there’s new content," Song Ren suggested.

When the VR theme first launched, it was completely different from other game developers’ offerings. He’d even been obsessed with raising pigs and farming for a while. But once the novelty wore off, even though he heard Nebula Games kept updating it, he rarely logged in—only occasionally returning to harvest crops.

Now, with the emergence of Nebula World and this so-called Plane Exploration, everything felt like a sci-fi movie.

Though Song Ren suspected this was essentially a trial version of a game, it didn’t stop him from being intrigued.

"Which one should we check first?" Zhang Yi had no objections.

"Warcraft. Seriously, all the other themes have actual games, but Mr. Chen hasn’t ported Warcraft to VR yet—yet they made a full VR theme for it? Total favoritism!" Song Ren grumbled inwardly.

"Well, RTS games aren’t really suited for VR," Zhang Yi replied.

"True enough," Song Ren nodded.

Soon, both stepped through the portal. Once again, the vast Starry Sky appeared. But what surprised Song Ren was that he could now see Zhang Yi’s character beside him.

Previously, being in first-person view, he couldn’t see his own appearance. But now, through Zhang Yi’s form—a figure wrapped in a glowing white aura traversing countless stars—he finally saw it. They eventually arrived at one particular planet.

Two beams of light descended at the gates of Stormwind. Immediately, a prompt appeared before both Song Ren and Zhang Yi:

【To prevent detection and expulsion by the World Consciousness, please select an identity to blend into the world】

Following the message, a series of options appeared before them.

These represented various Classes and races, though the selection was limited—only three basic Classes: Mage, Warrior, and Priest.

As for races, only Human race, Dwarf, and Night Elf were available.

"Damn it! There's actually a race system and a Class system?" Song Ren was stunned.

This was completely new. Previously, the Stormwind theme was merely a scenic tour. Now, players could choose races and Classes?

Does that mean there’s combat content too? Zhang Yi, standing nearby, was equally shocked.

As for the explanation about the World Consciousness, neither of them paid much attention—it was just part of the setting.

After all, in Nebula World, players could wear all kinds of outfits. Entering a fantasy world dressed in a suit would be too jarring. Similarly, showing up in Uncharted wearing medieval-style Armor would be just as awkward.

But if the restriction was imposed directly, players might feel annoyed—why can’t I enter like this?

Using the concept of World Consciousness provided a perfect explanation: It’s not that Nebula Games is stopping you—it’s the world’s own consciousness rejecting you. All the fault lies with the World Consciousness!

"What Class did you pick?" Song Ren curiously asked Zhang Yi, who had chosen Mage.

"Of course Mage! How cool is that!" Zhang Yi replied.

"Pfft, little Mage. If there was PvP, I’d chop you into pieces in one hit!" Song Ren scoffed.

Mage? A backline class shooting arrows from afar—how could that compare to his mighty Warrior?

Just think of Hellscream in Warcraft—how imposing he was!

Unfortunately, there seemed to be no PvP.

As Song Ren and Zhang Yi chatted, they were unaware that this Stormwind setup was actually Chen Xu’s experimental prototype, testing combat mechanics and skill systems.

As for actual content, Stormwind did offer several gameplay options—players could learn stories of Azeroth, complete a simple dungeon, fight monsters, earn gold coins, and return to Nebula World to buy decorative items.

However, there was a weekly cap—players received a generous amount at first, but couldn’t grind it endlessly.

Currently, Nebula World and its main theme areas were more like Easter eggs provided for players.

They weren’t in their complete form.

As for monetization… well, servers cost money, after all.

And even without spending real money, acquiring these items wasn’t difficult. It wasn’t a pay-to-win scenario where only paying players could obtain them.

The discount vouchers were also part of a crossover with merchandise. After all, the official store frequently discounted figurines and other collectibles.

For now, Nebula World remained in Chen Xu’s trial run phase. Current tech limitations meant this was just an early attempt. When other game developers eventually tried creating similar Metaverse experiences, Nebula Games would already hold a significant advantage.

Moreover, hidden within these areas were teasers and content related to upcoming new works.

As they wandered Stormwind, Zhang Yi and Song Ren soon discovered the designated stages for combat content.

By the canal near the Mage district stood a heavily guarded prison. Upon approaching, they could speak with the warden, Selvert, and accept a quest.

"They’ve had uprisings before, but this time something feels different. A sinister, terrifying force seems to be driving them into madness. Some have even transformed into beasts… no, creatures far more cruel and horrifying than orcs. Brave warrior, can you help me quell this uprising and uncover its cause?" As Warden Selvert spoke with deep concern, Song Ren and Zhang Yi accepted a new quest.
