Chapter 325: The Inclusion of Operation Kingfish (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Following Chen Xu's release of relevant video materials for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Howard Warsaw, the person in charge of Storm Action at Atrai and one of Atrai's top designers, also closely followed the content of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.

After all, his developed Storm Action was launched on the Zeus Platform, while Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was launched on Huanyu.

Coupled with both being FPS games, this could be said to be a direct competitive relationship.

If this Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was of the same quality as Rainbow Six Siege, then Howard Warsaw would not have the slightest worry.

Because in that case, the opponent would have no competitiveness at all.

It's not that Rainbow Six Siege is bad; rather, in some aspects, Rainbow Six Siege is too good.

Its overly hardcore gameplay destined it to be a delicacy that only a few could savor.

And for FPS games, as long as they are linked to hardcore, they will inevitably not become mainstream games.

The reason why FPS can be said to be the largest game genre globally is precisely because most FPS games are actually fast-paced experience games.

"Fast-paced" might not sound very good, feeling particularly low-brow.

But isn't the main goal of most people playing games to relax?

After work, open a game, don't think too much, and have a happy round.

And on this basis, if a game can also bring players some emotional depth in its story, or some narrative depth.

Then, without a doubt, this game can absolutely be deified.

Some overly hardcore, overly deep games might gain players' recognition and positive reviews.

But they won't achieve the majority of sales.

Howard Warsaw saw this very clearly.

And for him, Storm Action was a game developed for sales, specifically to escort the Zeus Platform.

Otherwise, why would Atrai bother buying any IP rights?

But now, the promotional video for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare instinctively made Howard Warsaw wary.

Because he also had to admit that the various grand scenes were truly spectacular.

Coupled with Nebula Games' growing reputation overseas.

Howard Warsaw naturally dared not underestimate it.

………………

Soon, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Storm Action were at loggerheads.

They each conducted a wave of promotions daily.

Today, you release news about the lead actor recording motion capture; tomorrow, I release some concept art.

Initially, both sides basically released some behind-the-scenes footage of game development.

For example, the lead actor recording motion capture, and concept art.

When they really ran out of things to promote, even as game designers, they personally stepped in for a wave of promotion.

And as time progressed, finally, with the development of game content, some actual in-game videos were also released.

Storm Action released a combat video of about fifteen seconds.

It was a segment from the previous escape from the building, which excited many players.

And immediately after, Chen Xu also released a video.

In a stormy night, on a cargo ship, a group of fully armed special forces infiltrated the deck and eliminated various enemies.

However, what attracted players was not the gameplay, because the time was too short.

From descending from the air to the deck, it was only about twenty seconds in total.

What truly shocked players was how exceptionally outstanding the graphics were.

Lighting, rain, super high-definition textures – it was practically like CGI.

Originally, many players, after watching Storm Action's demo, were amazed by the powerful capabilities of the new Zeus Platform.

But after watching this simple twenty-second demo of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.

All players were dumbfounded.

"Holy cow, these graphics completely blew Storm Action out of the water!"

"If I didn't know Chen Xu wouldn't pull a bait-and-switch with misleading trailers, I would definitely think this was CGI!"

"My goodness! This is too shocking, does this mean Huanyu's capabilities are so much stronger than Zeus's!?"

Many players exclaimed in surprise.

Including game industry designers who had been following it, they were equally startled by this scene.

After all, the difference was too obvious.

And for game designers like them, they had studied the performance of both Zeus and Huanyu.

The difference was basically not much.

So they clearly understood what the graphics of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare truly meant.

However, after a brief moment of surprise, Howard Warsaw and other industry game designers basically figured out how Nebula Games achieved this.

It was nothing more than concentrating the console's performance for the production of thread-based levels.

But then the problem arose: doing this would inevitably lead to loading screens.

Just like Storm Action actually requires loading, but it can be replaced by real-time rendered cutscenes. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, however, is different.

This level of concentrated performance, although the new VR's SSD model and specially optimized processing made the speed very impressive, a single map would still require at least 20-30 seconds of loading time. In such a situation, when switching between levels, the player's experience would be fragmented.

So, Nebula Games sacrificed player fluidity to enhance visual presentation?

Many industry designers suddenly realized.

………………

As for Chen Xu at this moment, he was conducting in-game content testing.

Chen Xu in the game was lying on the ground, frantically sweeping enemies from all directions.

Bullets struck the ground, shattering grass and kicking up splashing dirt.

Blood stained the dirt and green grass red.

A gun propped on the ground would leave a shallow indentation.

This was a level in the game, and Chen Xu was playing as Captain Price.

In the original game of his previous life, players could only play as Captain Price in two levels.

One was a flashback level, the very classic sniper mission: All Ghillied Up.

The other was the final level of the game's grand finale.

However, compared to the game, there was actually a plot hole.

In his previous life, Activision dug a hole but didn't fill it themselves.

However, fervent fan players filmed a micro-movie to complete this part of the story, and it received high official recognition, with the developers directly stating it was well-made and would be considered their official storyline.

Operation Croaker, or rather, Operation Kingfish.

Therefore, in the game, Chen Xu officially incorporated it.

As the final easter egg content of the first part.

As for why it was placed at the end of the first part.

Because chronologically, it perfectly aligns with the second part.

Secondly, the game adopted a trilogy model, where Shepherd in the second part and Makarov in the third part are actually linked, and their timelines are continuous.

Only the first part was separated; shouldn't they add some attraction anchors to hook players?
