Chapter 482: Mr. Chen Must Absolutely Love Players Like You (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Song Ren, who had just logged onto the platform, looked surprised.

Like many players, he didn't pay much attention at first, but after the entire platform finished updating and he entered, he realized it was completely different from what he had imagined. Before him lay an island, a very large island, and in its central area was a beautiful villa.

Above the villa, the two large characters 'Nebula' were displayed.

The clear blue sky, golden beaches, and endless sea, combined with the melodious sound of wind chimes, made for a beautiful sight.

Of course, this wasn't the most crucial point. What truly surprised Song Ren was that on this island, there was also a gigantic museum under construction. The main entrance had already been completed, bearing the five large characters 'Nebula Games Museum,' while most of the rest was still just a framework, far from finished.

The entire island was very large and also featured a huge gate, similar to a portal in `Minecraft`.

Just as Song Ren was still bewildered and trying to figure out what was happening, a blonde girl suddenly appeared before him.

'Welcome back, Explorer Lord. I am Chloe, your exclusive butler. Have you finished this exploration?' The blonde girl, with a gentle smile, said to Song Ren.

'Huh!?' Song Ren looked at the blonde NPC named Chloe before him, feeling a bit bewildered.

'Did the Explorer Lord suffer an injury during your journey through the planes and forget some things?' Chloe showed a surprised expression.

'So they've already come up with a reason for me? Just made me lose my memory? Isn't that Link's treatment?' Hearing Chloe's words, Song Ren instinctively snarked.

'Link? Explorer Lord, are you referring to the trauma you experienced while exploring the Hyrule plane, causing you to forget some memories?' Chloe asked with concern.

Seeing Chloe's concerned expression and her feedback to his recent complaint, Song Ren was now truly surprised. Could it be Artificial Intelligence?!

Taking a chance, Song Ren tentatively said, 'That's right, I forgot some things. Can you tell me where this is?'

'Of course! This is your private territory, Explorer Lord. In the Nebula World, planes from other worlds can appear at any time, and your goal, Explorer Lord, is to explore the essence of those worlds.'

'And during your exploration, you can take some souvenirs from those planes. However, Explorer Lord, you've brought back far too many items, and there's no more space at home, so the museum is currently under construction.'

'Also, Explorer Lord, each time you enter a plane for exploration, it's a very dangerous endeavor. So, please do not enter rashly without preparation; it's best to carefully explore beforehand.'

'Furthermore, Explorer Lord, if you feel a bit lonely on the island, you can adopt some pets. Recently, many small animals have strayed in from various planes and are now being housed in the Nebula Nursery.'

'Finally, there's one more thing I must tell you, Explorer Lord. The construction of the museum has exceeded its budget, so work has been halted. If possible, we kindly request that you venture into some planes, complete tasks, and earn gold to resume construction.'

The entire island wasn't small. With Chloe's introduction, Song Ren went from being a bit bewildered to mostly understanding the situation.

This was turning the game platform directly into a game!?

Just like `Animal Forest`, he was burdened with a housing loan right from the start, and now construction was halted because of overdue payments to the construction team?

Not only Song Ren, but all other players who owned VR headsets and updated their platforms were astonished. Many players had absolutely no idea that Chen Xu would turn the platform into a game-like community.

Here, led by Chloe, Song Ren entered the house, and then his eyes lit up. He found many, many things: the cinnamon pie Toriel made in `Undertale` (displayed as a model here, of course).

There was also the platypus toy from `To the Moon`, and even a cute Zombie Hat of Caiyun Junior Sister from `Mirror (Game)`. All those past game memories came flooding back at once.

However, the only thing that made Song Ren feel a bit uncomfortable was that while the house looked quite luxurious from the outside, its interior was honestly a bit shabby!

[Your friend, Old Zhang, invites you to his plane. Do you wish to go?]

As Song Ren was musing, a UI Pop-up Window appeared, showing that Old Zhang was inviting him. Without much thought, Song Ren directly clicked confirm.

At this point, Chloe beside him reminded, 'If the Explorer Lord wishes to visit a friend's plane, you may depart through the plane gate.'

Following the prompt, Song Ren went outside to the large portal he had seen earlier. On it, a list of his game inventory was displayed, though currently, it only included games like `Red Dead Redemption`, `Dark Souls`, `Monster Hunter: World`, and others that had been developed for or ported to the VR platform.

These games also had corresponding VR themes, but what were once VR themes here became the 'explorable worlds' in Chloe's words.

Of course, on this portal, Song Ren saw two worlds he absolutely dreaded seeing: `Resident Evil` and `Outlast`.

Damn it, he had specifically created a folder to archive them, and now they just popped out directly!

Song Ren was speechless, but he didn't dwell on it. He quickly confirmed his intention to go to Old Zhang's world. Stepping through the portal, Song Ren was met with a vast sea of stars, countless planets glittering in the boundless universe.

Then, his perspective zoomed towards a distant planet. Finally, his vision plunged into darkness before reappearing, and he saw Old Zhang's character standing before him.

'Nebula Games is playing things a bit flashy this time! This platform has actually been turned into a mini-game, that's something!' Seeing Song Ren appear on his island, Zhang Yi was also a bit excited.

However, Song Ren's attention wasn't on that. He was looking at Zhang Yi's Chloe and his house, utterly bewildered.

The Chloe standing beside Zhang Yi, smiling, wore black glasses and an OL attire, looking incredibly beautiful. And then there was Zhang Yi's grand mansion, with a red wool rug leading to the entrance, and a pet house nearby where Song Ren clearly saw a Palico from `Monster Hunter: World`.

'Holy cow, where did you get all this stuff!?' Song Ren looked at Zhang Yi's world, then thought back to his own scene, a bit stunned. Why was his place so much cooler?!

'I claimed them! If you play Nebula Games and meet certain conditions, you can claim corresponding decorations. Also, you can buy them with the gold produced in the Nebula World – didn't the system give you 10,000 gold at the start? And of course, there's spending money; you can buy them directly with Nebula game currency and tokens,' Zhang Yi explained.

In-game items were basically obtained through three channels: first, by playing games; second, by using gold from the Nebula World; and third, by directly using game currency.

'I'm telling you, if you buy with game currency, you even get a discount on official collectible figures! Look at my Palico; I bought it for 26 Yuan and even got a 52 Yuan collectible figure voucher,' Zhang Yi said enthusiastically.

'A real-world collectible figure voucher? Then you made a bit of a profit! Not only did you get a Palico for free, but you also earned 26 Yuan!' Song Ren was quite surprised.

Hearing Song Ren's words, Zhang Yi gave him a speechless look: 'With that kind of thought process, Mr. Chen must absolutely love players like you. My point is, it wasn't a loss, okay?'
