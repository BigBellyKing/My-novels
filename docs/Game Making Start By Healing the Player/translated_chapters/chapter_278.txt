Chapter 277: This game is absolutely mind-blowing! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

"The visual presentation is amazing!"

Sitting nearby, Wang Han couldn't help but praise the game graphics on the screen before her.

Even though she didn't like playing RTS games, it wasn't as if she had never played one.

She could instantly tell the quality of Warcraft's visual presentation.

"It's not just the visual presentation; the game's setting also seems to have some depth!" Although not a hardcore RTS player, Zhang Yi had played for a while and had a certain understanding of RTS games.

Following the system's prompts, Zhang Yi searched for the Far Seer.

Upon arriving at a flag in the middle, the Orc soldiers, who had previously appeared in the CG cutscene, ran out from a nearby building.

There were three of them, surrounding Thrall, whom Zhang Yi was controlling. These were clearly the unit types in the game.

Patrol, Move, Attack, Hold Position—compared to typical RTS games, Warcraft's operational functions were richer.

However, what made Zhang Yi feel different was the setting of soldiers and heroes.

Thrall in the game was a unique hero who could level up to increase corresponding attributes and had unique skills.

As for common soldiers, they only had base attack power and no special attributes.

Furthermore, there was another significant difference between heroes and common soldiers.

That was a column of item inventory next to the skill slot on the right.

Although there were no items yet, it was clear that the game supported the acquisition and use of items.

However, it seemed limited to heroes.

In the past, games like Human Wars also had some special units.

For example, Siege Behemoths, which were strategic control units capable of turning the tide of battle.

In Warcraft, it was clear that heroes were more than just that.

Being able to use skills and items could have a significant impact on the battle.

Moreover, the key point for heroes was that they could level up and possess elements like Strength, Agility, and Intelligence, which were usually only seen in RPGs and similar games.

This feeling reminded Zhang Yi of the Three Kingdoms era, with a sense of generals leading soldiers into battle.

In addition to these, the attributes of the units in the game also showed some potential.

In some previous RTS games, it was basically an all-out brawl of various unit types, although there was also a so-called counter system.

But essentially, it was about producing units and then fighting each other.

However, in Warcraft, despite just starting the game, Zhang Yi could already see the difference from the panel of these three green Orc soldiers.

The attack attributes and armor attributes of soldiers and heroes were completely different.

This meant that the damage between different unit types would also vary.

As Zhang Yi sensed the uniqueness of Warcraft's RTS from these details, Wang Han's attention was clearly not on this. As someone who rarely played RTS, she might not have noticed this aspect at all.

Wang Han was more concerned with the hero named Thrall that Zhang Yi was currently controlling.

"Your Thrall, judging by his main attributes, should be a spellcaster, right? Why are his appearance and attributes so strange?" Wang Han interjected from the side.

Hearing Wang Han's words, Zhang Yi also focused his attention on Thrall in the game.

Muscular, wielding a huge hammer, and riding a black Alpha Wolf, then looking at the attribute points.

16 Strength, 18 Agility, 19 Intelligence.

If it weren't for Intelligence taking the high ground, you wouldn't be able to tell this was a spellcaster!

"This is actually quite normal. After all, this hero named Thrall is an Orc. As an Orc, being a bit muscular, riding a wolf, and wielding a hammer, don't you think that's quite reasonable?" Zhang Yi pondered for a moment, then offered his opinion.

"Hmm... it does seem very reasonable. But a spellcaster who wields a hammer? Why does it feel so strange?" Wang Han looked at the burly Thrall in the game and gave her opinion again.

"He's not necessarily a spellcaster. It just means this Thrall has high intelligence," Zhang Yi explained.

"Oh, alright, stop dwelling on this issue and let's quickly look at the game's performance!" Seeing that Wang Han seemed about to say something else, Zhang Yi changed the subject.

After all, these details were inconsequential.

And actually, thinking about it, it was quite realistic. After all, the common perception of Orcs was that they should be burly.

If this Thrall turned into an effeminate young man, people would doubt whether he was an Orc at all.

"But compared to other RTS games, Warcraft brings so many changes and innovations!" Zhang Yi said with some emotion.

Controlling Thrall, Zhang Yi began to advance through the story quest.

As he controlled him, Thrall and the Orc soldiers in the game would also give corresponding dialogue feedback to the player's commands.

In Versus Mode, the dialogue was mostly fixed.

But in the campaign storyline, Chen Xu made some changes compared to his previous life.

That is, the feedback from various dialogue would be matched with the current plot progression, providing players with a higher sense of immersion.

Advancing bit by bit through the prologue's story, some content gradually unfolded before Zhang Yi.

For example, the impact of heroes on the battlefield.

Taking Thrall as an example, Thrall in the prologue currently only had two skills, mainly to prevent players from getting overwhelmed.

One was an area-of-effect (AOE) Chain Lightning that dealt group damage.

And a scouting skill that allowed vision through the Fog of War.

As an RTS player, Zhang Yi immediately realized the importance of Thrall's skills.

In previous RTS games, it was often more about individual skill.

Whoever had impressive micro-management was powerful.

As for unit type counters and tactics, they existed, but their weight was genuinely not significant.

But in Warcraft, he saw something different: the changes that heroes brought to the gameplay.

A well-placed skill could even determine the outcome of a skirmish.

Of course, he didn't know if this was truly the case in actual multiplayer mode.

For now, he was just methodically advancing through the game's story.

Because he was playing on easy difficulty, Zhang Yi found it quite simple; he only lost two Orc soldiers throughout.

After rescuing an Orc named Grom Hellscream, Thrall and the Orcs of the Horde set sail using human ships.

The next moment, a CG appeared on the screen, exciting Zhang Yi.

A brand new CG—how much had this game actually developed?

On a distant cliff, watching Thrall's fleet depart, the mysterious Wizard muttered: "Go forth! Young Thrall, journey to the lands of Kalimdor. There you will find your destiny."

As the mysterious Wizard's words fell, a melodious tune began, and the figure transformed into a Raven, soaring into the distance.

The screen plunged into temporary darkness. The Raven flew over the Alterac Mountains, past barren valleys, and finally arrived at a prosperous human realm: Lordaeron.

In the grand hall, countless voices were discussing animatedly.

Their topic of discussion concerned Orcs and a plague.

Meanwhile, the aging King Terenas pondered on his throne.

At this moment, the Raven flew in from nowhere and landed in the center of the great hall.

Simultaneously, the background audio turned somber.

This eerie Raven caught Terenas's attention. Suddenly, the Raven's body glowed with a strange green light, and to everyone's taken aback gazes, it transformed into a person.

The very Far Seer who had guided Thrall earlier.

His voice, however, boomed throughout the entire hall.

"Humanity is in peril! The Dark Power is about to return, and the entire world stands on the brink of war!"

"Listen to me! Your people's only hope is to go west, to the ancient lands of Kalimdor in the west!"

The ministers in the palace commanded the guards to drag out this 'madman', but the old King stood up and stopped them.

He looked at the Wizard before him, his face stern: "I do not know who you are or what you believe! But now is not the time to spread prophecies. Our realm is afflicted with conflict and troubles, but it is for us to decide how best to protect our people! Not you! Please leave!"

The Wizard slowly lowered his head, his voice turning somewhat grim: "I once failed to save humanity and abandoned my humanity, but this time, I will not do so again."

"If you cannot accept this commission, then I will find another who will."

The Wizard slowly turned and departed, leaving behind only a whisper that only he could hear.

"I have given my warning. Now their fate is in their own hands."

The screen went dark. The CG ended, transitioning to a new game chapter screen.

This CG was not very long, lasting only about 3 minutes.

But it had already revealed plenty.

For instance, the hostility between Orcs and humans, and how a mysterious plague had spread across Lordaeron.

Also, why this Far Seer, who had previously sought out Thrall, wanted all humans and Orcs to journey to the ancient western lands of Kalimdor.

Taking a deep breath, Zhang Yi didn't immediately proceed.

Instead, he felt a mix of excitement and exhilaration.

Because it was simply too well-crafted! Even though it had been less than an hour, Warcraft had completely conquered him, at least in its single-player story!

Zhang Yi turned his head, wanting to express his inner excitement to Wang Han next to him, but upon turning, he found that she was already gone.

She had clearly gone to silently download Warcraft and try it out for herself.

So Zhang Yi quietly opened his voice channel and unmuted his mic.

"Old Song, what do you think of this Warcraft!? This game is absolutely mind-blowing! I've never played an RTS game like this before! And this CG is simply phenomenal!"

After saying this, he exited the voice channel.

He had vented his excitement. As he didn't know Old Song's progress yet, leaving immediately after speaking was clearly a good choice to prevent being spoiled on later content.
