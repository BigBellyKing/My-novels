Chapter 224 Characteristics of Different Modes (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)

The group continued their visit.

After appreciating Along the River During the Qingming Festival with emotion,

they arrived at the end and were all astonished.

Because they actually discovered a waiting platform at the terminus, with railway tracks on the ground labeled "one train every 5 minutes."

Beside it was a countdown and the next destination: Forbidden City.

"This game can actually build high-speed rail!?" Wang Han asked in surprise.

"Now I wouldn't even be surprised if someone told me this game could build mechs," Zhang Yi sighed with emotion.

Building trains in a game?

How big of a deal was that?

"Now I'm a bit conflicted—I really want to try building things myself manually, but I also want to finish the tour," Song Ren said beside them, sharing his feelings.

After viewing the showcase of Along the River During the Qingming Festival, Song Ren felt an intense itch in his hands.

He was extremely eager to personally attempt some artistic creation.

While touring, he had already used his phone to capture screenshots of the in-game scenes, planning to recreate them later.

Hearing Song Ren's words, the others nodded in agreement.

As they chatted, a distant "woo-woo" whistle sound approached.

A small black dot in the distance gradually grew larger.

It was actually a real train!

And there were designated spots to board.

Full of curiosity, Zhang Yi and the others boarded the train and walked through it from front to back.

At the same time, many players activated flight mode, flying around the train trying to figure out how this thing actually moved.

But clearly, this was still beyond their current understanding.

The only thing they could truly feel was awe.

Just how far could this game go?

If previously, some players had doubts about the videos Chen Xu released on the official channels,

after seeing these creations in person, all players now shared a single thought:

Just how far could this game called Minecraft go? Or was there anything it couldn't create?

Every player was now filled with intense curiosity and the desire to explore.

"My goodness, the scenery along both sides of the road is naturally landscaped!" Wang Han exclaimed in the voice channel.

Zhang Yi and the others looked out through the train's deliberately placed windows.

The train moved forward at a steady pace, and clearly visible outside were carefully designed landscapes.

Neatly arranged trees, and even along the way, she spotted some wilderness Farms.

NPCs portraying farmers were working in the fields.

Finally, as the train entered a deep tunnel, after about ten seconds, accompanied by another "woo-woo" whistle,

after briefly passing through darkness, the game's lighting and shadows first caused the screen to whiten, then slowly the entire in-game scene gradually reappeared.

A grand city appeared before all players: the Forbidden City.

Completely different from the previous Along the River During the Qingming Festival.

The scene from Along the River During the Qingming Festival had offered a more detailed, intimate experience—

a dense, small-scale environment.

A compact scene packed with various buildings, extremely dense.

But the Forbidden City before their eyes belonged to a grand, expansive scale.

The entire structure was aligned along the central axis, arranged from south to north, majestic and imposing.

However, compared to the NPC-populated Along the River During the Qingming Festival, the Forbidden City felt more solemn, lacking in liveliness.

After fully appreciating it, Wang Han and Zhang Yi continued forward.

A piano playing 'To Liva,' and a working calculator—players could even line up to personally experience using the in-game calculator for arithmetic.

And that was just the beginning!

That was the phrase Zhang Yi and the others repeated most often throughout the tour.

Of course, the most memorable part for Zhang Yi and the group was the amusement park at the end.

There were so many mini-games to play inside.

They could clear levels like in Fall Guys, navigate mazes, or sit in track carts and shoot targets with Bow and Arrows.

"And look, it seems like this server will update new building complexes in the future!" Wang Han said with a touch of emotion.

The amusement park was the final major scene showcased on the official server.

However, they also noticed something—the railway tracks continued extending forward, leading into vast mountains, open fields, and forests, all retaining the existing appearance of Minecraft.

Yet, judging from the extending tracks, it was clear that Nebula Games had future plans.

Otherwise, there would be no need to extend the tracks further, especially through a mountain tunnel.

"I don't care about what comes next—since we still have some time, why don't we go building houses?" Zhang Yi suggested.

This proposal was immediately supported by Song Ren.

After seeing so much, he was already eager to start.

His hands were just too itchy!

"Should we play Survival or Creative?" Joey asked from within the group.

"Let's go Survival. Creative feels less rewarding, and I think we should rent a server!" Wang Han said.

"We can decide that later. Anyway, according to the introduction, self-hosted servers allow transfer of save data. For now, let's just play Survival," Zhang Yi replied.

"Fair enough, but I wonder if we can move these buildings into our own worlds," Wang Han said, eyeing the amusement park with envy.

"Don't you read the descriptions? These can all be downloaded from the Workshop (modding platform)! Only Creative Mode allows direct generation, while in Survival Mode, you need to collect certain materials according to MOD blueprints before they can be generated out of thin air," Zhang Yi explained.

This was a special setting implemented by Chen Xu.

In Creative Mode, with infinite materials, it naturally didn't matter.

But in Survival Mode, players still needed to gather specific materials to construct.

Of course, players didn't need to collect all materials before construction.

Instead, it used a zoning system.

For example, for a theme like the amusement park, assuming a footprint of 1000x1000, players would need to first select a 1000x1000 area.

Then, the amusement park's structures would be divided into different zones, such as the Ferris wheel, ground area, and roller coaster.

Each zone had specific material requirements. Once players collected enough materials, they could choose to auto-generate the construction.

Even if materials weren't fully collected, it didn't matter—whatever was gathered would be automatically built.

After all, in the real-world, building houses wasn't instantaneous either.

And if players decided not to collect more, that was fine too—the project would simply be left unfinished, becoming an abandoned building.

The same applied to private servers players set up.

Of course, Minecraft was an extremely Free (mode) game.

There was no strict enforcement on how players should play. If someone wanted to make building beautiful houses in Survival Mode easier for themselves, and they were playing solo without affecting others, was that not allowed?

Of course it was allowed! As long as, when creating the World Seed, they enabled cheat mode, then entered the appropriate command codes in-game, players could play exactly as they wished.

However, these setups were limited to players' private servers and individual host world seeds. On the official pure servers operated by Nebula Games, buildings could only be constructed by players themselves.

Whether in Survival Mode, where players freely expressed themselves, or in peaceful Creative mode,

achieving their dreams relied solely on their own hands.

Two updates for now.
