## Chapter 65: Player Discussions

The next day, an exclusive interview article featuring Chen Xu was already published on Game Timespace.

*"Love in Transmission: Every Game is Filled with My Passion for Players"*

This was the full title of the Game Timespace article.

Opening the article, the content was mostly what Chen Xu had discussed with Wu Tian.

Of course, certain parts and topics had been removed.

Meanwhile, some content had also been polished.

It mainly focused on the positive side—for example, difficulties encountered during game development, even moments when giving up seemed inevitable, but ultimately, the Team overcame the obstacles and delivered a perfect game brimming with passion to the players.

The artistic embellishment process was so convincing that, had Chen Xu not known it was mostly fabricated, he might have been moved to tears himself.

As a top-tier domestic gaming media outlet, Game Timespace held considerable influence among the player community.

At least in terms of traffic, that was certainly true.

After this exclusive interview was released, player comments flooded in almost instantly.

'No wonder Chen Xu calls himself a Warrior of Love—so that's where it comes from!'

'Wait, why do I get the feeling this is all just hype?'

'+1, I feel like the editor who conducted this interview got completely swindled by Chen Xu.'

'If I only look at *Undertale* and *To the Moon*, the title Warrior of Love fits perfectly. But *Outlast*… 233333!'

'I still think Chen Xu’s entire explanation for *Outlast* was pure nonsense meant to fool us!'

'The thing is, the nonsense actually sounds kind of reasonable!'

'Let’s not just argue whether Chen Xu is a fraud or not—aren’t you guys curious about the new game mentioned in the article?'

'Yeah, Chen Xu’s new game is called *Overcooked*. Is it actually a cooking game?'

'How would anyone know? With just a title, who can guess what it’s really about? Like *Mirror (Game)*—just from the name, could you ever imagine how explosive the content would be?'

'Let’s not even talk about it. I hereby declare it the ultimate Gentleman's Game—still unmatched to this day. Played it too much; now I’m basically broken.'

'Sigh, what can you do? Chen Xu’s path in gaming just keeps getting smoother and smoother.'

The article’s release brought more players awareness of Chen Xu, but otherwise didn’t cause much of a stir.

Although *Overcooked* was mentioned, there wasn’t much actual information beyond the game’s title.

And Chen Xu wasn’t yet a major figure—certainly not at the level where players would become desperate to play his games and uncover every last detail just from hearing his name.

With the New Year approaching, game developers of all sizes were also launching their own promotional campaigns.

Under these circumstances, aside from Chen Xu’s hardcore fans, most random players didn’t pay much attention to *Overcooked*.

Chen Xu, however, didn’t mind much.

After all, *Overcooked* hadn’t even officially started promotion yet.

In terms of production cost, *Overcooked* was only one-third the cost of the previous *Outlast*.

Of course, this excluded server and related infrastructure expenses, which weren’t solely dedicated to *Overcooked*.

They also served the Nebula Games Platform.

For Chen Xu, two months of development time—viewed from a mature perspective—meant the game’s core strengths and flaws were already crystal clear.

As a result, development progress was incredibly fast.

Compared to the earlier primitive version, which had only one or two themes and relied heavily on free engine materials, the current *Overcooked* was now extremely polished and complete.

Moreover, unlike before, this time Chen Xu had specifically shot a promotional video for *Overcooked*.

Instead of relying solely on his official Weibo account for promotion as he had previously.

After all, *Overcooked* represented the true debut of the Nebula Games Platform into the player market.

Its significance was entirely different.

……………………

Time moved forward. On Chinese New Year's Eve, across the country, the annual spectacle known as the Spring Festival travel rush began.

At Nebula Games, the annual holiday had also begun.

Still, some employees chose to stay behind.

After all, *Overcooked* was scheduled to launch on the third day of the Lunar New Year, and with the Nebula Games Platform and its community operations involved, someone needed to remain on-site to handle any potential emergencies.

Of course, Chen Xu was generous with overtime pay—showing no hesitation in rewarding those who stayed.

Meanwhile, on various gaming forums and online communities, players were discussing the new games released during the Spring Festival.

'There doesn’t seem to be any good games launching this New Year!'

'Yeah, I checked—nothing particularly interesting.'

'TengHua Games’ new work *Age of Gods* seems pretty good.'

'Yeah, and NetDragon’s blockbuster *Demon God* is highly anticipated!'

'Sure, they’re exciting, but both are VR blockbusters. In my small fourth-tier county town, the VR experience store won’t be open during the holidays.'

'Don’t entertainment venues usually stay open during the holidays?'

'Well, mine isn’t. What can I do?'

'VR blockbusters are only fun if you have plenty of time. During the holidays, I barely have time to play. I’ll just look for PC games instead.'

'There are quite a few games being released on PC too.'

'Check Chen Xu’s official Weibo! He’s got a new game, and it’s apparently a couple's game!'

'I saw it—looks so heartwarming! Perfect to play with my girlfriend. Is Chen Xu finally living up to the Warrior of Love title?'

'*Overcooked*? So it really is a cooking game? Cooking with my girlfriend?'

'A couple's game? You’re telling me about couple's games when I’m a Single person?'

'Bro upstairs, even Single people have dreams. Besides, this game doesn’t necessarily require a girlfriend—you can play it with a bro too!'

'Exactly! Plus, the Nebula Games Platform is offering a New Year special—buy one, get one free!'

During the Spring Festival, game developers launched their titles with full force.

The most eye-catching releases, naturally, were the two blockbusters from TengHua and NetDragon.

Both were domestic gaming giants and long-time rivals, competing not only in games but also in distribution platforms.

Their simultaneous releases during the holiday season naturally drew massive attention.

However, both companies had focused on VR blockbusters this year, leaving the PC market largely untouched.

On the PC front, however, the release of *Overcooked*’s promotional video—on major gaming media sites and Chen Xu’s official Weibo—began attracting significant player attention.
