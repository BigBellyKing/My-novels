Chapter 107: This is a truly satisfying game!

Hearing Qin Yi's words, Chen Xu revealed a meaningful smile.

Without speaking, he just silently added a Black Knight wielding a Greatsword into the Road of Sacrifices map.

Is the game too difficult?

Chen Xu had actually carefully considered this question, having conducted market research before development.

Why didn't they make Dark Souls 1 first, following the game's story order, but instead chose Dark Souls 3?

It was precisely because, in terms of difficulty, Dark Souls 3 could be said to be much more friendly to new players.

Moreover, Dark Souls isn't the kind of game that deliberately makes players suffer.

Only after getting the hang of Dark Souls and playing it once or twice, then overcoming enemies through one's own efforts, would one discover that this game is absolutely exhilarating, truly a satisfying game through and through.

It's just that the cost of that satisfaction is a little high.

However, Qin Yi was clearly unaware of these things.

Looking at Chen Xu's expression and actions, Qin Yi knew that Chen Xu had no intention of changing anything.

Faced with this, he could only mourn silently for the future players in his heart.

Players, I tried my best!

At worst, when designing the game over screen, he would tell the Art Team to make the "death" character look a bit nicer.

And for each monster, BOSS, and trap that kills a character, add a few more death close-ups.

Strive to make players' deaths distinctive and novel.

…………

Dark Souls, the entire game, after such a long period of development, most of its content was basically complete.

What remained was primarily the wrapping up and testing phase.

The main focus was on the various levels in the game, and the battles between player-controlled characters using different weapons and BOSSes – these were all things that needed to be tested after game development was complete.

Then, based on the test results, they would decide whether to make detailed adjustments or simply launch it as is.

During this period, besides the development of Dark Souls and Valiant Hearts: The Great War participating in the Game Design Competition, Sanguosha and Fall Guys were also constantly active.

For Fall Guys, the subsequent work mainly involved the Operations team carrying out various collaborations, such as for cosmetics and skins.

As for maps, besides the official themed maps, the Workshop could be said to have played a crucial role in maintaining Fall Guys' popularity. Furthermore, compared to its previous life, Fall Guys had also launched several new modes.

Team (mode), Individual Speedrun (mode), pure Level Entertainment Mode, and rooms correspondingly open for players to customize rules.

However, compared to its peak, Fall Guys' popularity had already declined significantly, with the highest concurrent daily online players dropping to around 150,000.

In contrast, Sanguosha maintained a remarkably high player stickiness, with its player count steadily increasing compared to its launch period data.

Besides newly released content, simultaneously, modes like the Duel Arena, 2V2 Dragon-Tiger Four-Player Arena, and activities for new skins were also launched.

Nebula Games did not engage in corresponding pay-to-win activities for revenue.

However, the expansion of the player base naturally led to an increase in revenue.

Monthly gross revenue stabilized at 11 million Yuan, making it evident that for a long time to come, Sanguosha would be a sustainable cash cow.

As for Fall Guys, if it was well-operated and the community remained vibrant, its popularity wouldn't be as high as when it first launched, but it would maintain a long lifespan.

The same went for Sanguosha; as a card board game, its lifespan would definitely remain long.

Meanwhile, at the Nebula Games Experience Store, Chen Xu and the team were also preparing for the next phase of promotional warm-up for Dark Souls.

In the project office, all employees participating in the development of Dark Souls were gathered.

Qin Yi was reporting on the game's completeness, current test pros and cons, and areas for improvement.

During the meeting, Qin Yi once again brought up the difficulty issue he had mentioned before.

With a very complex expression, he looked at Chen Xu and hesitated for a long time before finally speaking: "Mr. Chen, are the BOSS numerical designs for Dark Souls really not going to be adjusted?"

As his words fell, not only Qin Yi, but also the employees from the combat system and numerical levels departments unconsciously nodded in unison.

They truly felt it deeply.

After the numerical parameters for each BOSS in the game were completed, and various monsters and BOSSes were inserted according to Chen Xu's requirements, they also served as the first batch of game testers.

Each of them had experienced the game from the start.

Everyone was mentally prepared for the game's difficulty.

After all, the numerical values, monster layouts, and various traps and mechanisms on the maps were all set.

But when they actually started playing, they realized they were still too naive and too young.

The difficulty they imagined was completely different from what they actually experienced!

The result was that just the first BOSS, 'Gundyr the Ash', stumped most of them for a long time.

Only a few more talented individuals in the team managed to defeat 'Gundyr the Ash' after several attempts.

And this was just the beginning.

Not only BOSSes, but even small enemies like Crystal Lizard and Uchigatana Guy, most of the team died on their first encounter.

Even the Crestfallen Warrior in the Firelink Shrine, after attacking him three times in a row and triggering hostility, gave them a thorough beating.

This directly made them question their lives.

As for the Lothric Knights on the High Wall of Lothric later, whether they wielded swords or spears, or that Mimic and the plump Winged Knight, and Pus of Man, all felt like BOSSes, except for those Hollow Skeleton Soldiers!

Even those Skeleton Soldiers, unless it was a one-on-one fight, if two or three ganged up, especially with some Hollow Hounds, death was highly probable.

Hearing Qin Yi's words, Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and other employees responsible for music, scene construction, and other content, all showed surprised expressions.

Is this game's difficulty really that high?

Is everyone questioning Mr. Chen's numerical values?

After all, Mr. Chen's image in everyone's minds was quite formidable, and what was being questioned wasn't some minor detail, but the core of a game: its data.

"I'll go test it later," Chen Xu said with a smile to Qin Yi.

Hearing Chen Xu's words, Qin Yi scratched his head and then continued to report on the relevant content.

Zhang Yida from the Marketing Department recorded everything one by one in his notebook.

After about twenty minutes or so.

Chen Xu, along with Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, and Zhang Yida's group who needed to determine the promotional plan based on actual game content, arrived at Qin Yi's project team.

As soon as they arrived, they saw three large characters 'YOU DIED' displayed on a large screen mounted on the wall for demonstration.

Clearly, someone had died during testing and hadn't exited the game yet.

Looking at these familiar three characters, and the grayscale UI interface mixed with dark red, Chen Xu also smiled.

"Let me take a look."

Pulling up a chair, Chen Xu sat in front of the computer, exited the game, and then re-entered.

Qin Yi and the others beside him watched Chen Xu with expectant eyes, wanting to see the scene they hoped for.
