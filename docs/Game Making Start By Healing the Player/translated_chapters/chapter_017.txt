Chapter 17: What kind of young person isn't spirited?

"How infuriating! How can there be such a person!" Ruan Ningxue looked absolutely furious.

You know, she had also participated in the development of Mirror (Game).

"This person is sly; they just want attention, whether it's through insults or support," Yang Xin said, comforting Ruan Ningxue.

"Exactly, such people aren't uncommon; they exist in all walks of life," Chen Xu said with a smile.

"Then Chen Xu, are we just going to pretend we don't know?" Ruan Ningxue felt a little wronged.

If they didn't retaliate, others would be walking all over them.

But if they retaliated, wouldn't that be exactly what the other party wanted?

"Of course not. Doesn't he want to stir up trouble? Let's give him what he wants!" Chen Xu chuckled, then opened his official Weibo account and sent a message.

'To certain individuals who fancy themselves veterans, games are art, but they are also commodities. Just like movies have art films and commercial films, Mirror (Game) has never claimed to be art.'

'Of course, some veterans who claim their own works are art must have been attacked by young people who don't respect martial virtues. After all, for a work that can truly be called art, its ratings are quite questionable!'

After sending the official Weibo message, Chen Xu also updated Mirror (Game)'s store description.

This was mainly because his official Weibo had too few followers.

Just over a thousand scattered followers, mostly from his previous comics.

Although Mirror (Game)'s sales were decent, most Gentleman's Gamers wouldn't pay much attention to its game producer.

Seeing Chen Xu's official Weibo post, Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue were both stunned.

"Chen Xu, didn't you say the other party was doing it on purpose? Isn't this exactly what they wanted?" Ruan Ningxue said, bewildered.

"They're practically rubbing it in our faces; wouldn't it be cowardly if I didn't respond?" Chen Xu shrugged, a smile on his face.

Yang Xin's eyes, however, lit up: "Undertale isn't a massive game. We can work some overtime and get the asset production fully on schedule during this period!"

Chen Xu nodded, saying, "Exactly. Before, I was wondering how to promote it, but now... this free traffic is too good to pass up."

"But everyone will have to work hard these next few days," Chen Xu added.

Just like in the marketplace, when the boss and the second-in-command fight, it's often the third party who dies.

The gaming industry isn't much different.

The most terrifying thing isn't being criticized, but being ignored.

And Chen Xu had considerable confidence in Undertale's quality.

……………………
While Chen Xu and his two colleagues entered a workaholic frenzy.

Chen Xu's official Weibo post also slowly began to ferment.

Although Chen Xu's official Weibo didn't have many followers.

However, Mirror (Game) had a large number of players during this period, who logged on and directly drove traffic.

Furthermore, since Zhong Mei had already been targeting Mirror (Game), many people were quietly observing to see how Mirror (Game) and Chen Xu would react.

Unexpectedly, they actually caught something.

Initially, Zhong Mei's official Weibo post was regarded as a joke by many.

After all, it wasn't the first time he had done something like this.

But with Chen Xu's official Weibo post following close behind, the nature of the situation completely changed.

Anyone could tell that Chen Xu was implicitly referring to Zhong Mei.

It takes two to tango; Chen Xu's response instantly attracted countless spectators.

Various media outlets reported on the matter, and many curious players also joined in.

Discussing animatedly.

'Holy crap, what's going on?'

'They're fighting, they're fighting!'

'So Chen Xu is the developer of Mirror (Game)!'

'Bro upstairs, does this designer named Chen Xu have some background?'

'No, why?'

'If not, then what the heck are you getting emotional about?'

'Haha, Chen Xu's words are truly devastating.'

'Nothing wrong with that. Zhong 'Big Cannon' has indeed made two decent games, but they're far from being works of art.'

'I'm backing Chen Xu! What's wrong with liking Gentleman's Games? Sequels and new DLC characters, ASAP!'

'I actually feel Zhong 'Big Cannon' isn't wrong this time; Gentleman's Games indeed aren't respectable.'

'Pfft! It's easy to talk tough once you've put your pants on! Wasn't Zhong 'Big Cannon' the one who started provoking?'

Following Chen Xu's reply, the buzz surrounding the incident immediately surged, attracting a huge wave of player attention.

Among them were many players supporting Chen Xu, as Zhong Mei's reputation was not very good, both in the gaming industry and among players.

However, there were also some who disliked Chen Xu and sided with Zhong Mei, given that Mirror (Game)'s game type was indeed prone to controversy.

But one thing was certain: Chen Xu and Zhong Mei instantly became the focus of attention for many media outlets and players.

To say the entire gaming industry would be a slight exaggeration, but with various media outlets scrambling to report, most players who followed the recent independent gaming community were essentially aware of the matter.

Chen Xu's official Weibo account also gained over a hundred thousand followers overnight.

………………
Meanwhile, in the office of Hapai Culture & Sports, Zhong Mei also learned of the news through his assistant's reminder.

However, he wasn't angry; instead, his face was full of excitement.

"Excellent! As expected, one should find a fledgling young designer with a bit of fame. This is what youth is all about! Spirited! Can you even call them young if they're not spirited?" Zhong Mei said, beaming with joy.

What was the online interview for before?

Wasn't it just for attention?

Look now, hasn't the attention arrived?

How long has it been since anyone willingly cooperated?

Cooperation versus no cooperation—these are two different concepts!

Look at the media's enthusiasm now. Before, to stir up this topic, he specifically bought some traffic.

But it didn't cause much of a stir. And now?

With a response, he doesn't even need to intervene; the traffic just comes automatically!

But he still needed to fan the flames and make the buzz even stronger!

With a smile, Zhong Mei opened his official Weibo and sent a message: "Some game designers are quite adept at quoting out of context. I never said my game was art; I merely aspire to develop a game that can be called art."

"But looking at the games certain designers develop, they might never understand in this lifetime how to truly develop a real game, rather than relying on some cleverness... petty tricks."

After sending the official Weibo message, Zhong Mei even specifically @-mentioned Chen Xu.

However, to Zhong Mei's surprise, the other party replied incredibly fast; in about five minutes, he was @-mentioned back by them.

'Those are also words I should say. Our new game, Undertale, will officially launch on July 15th. Perhaps some designers can take a look and see if such a game can be considered a real game, and whether it truly has artistic merit.'

Zhong Mei's smile suddenly froze on his face.

This move, it feels so familiar!

Thanks to 'Dimension within me' for the 500 tip.
