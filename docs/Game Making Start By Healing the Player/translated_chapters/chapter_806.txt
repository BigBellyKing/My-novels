Chapter 805: You Can't Handle This Character

Chapter 805: You Can't Handle This Character

Regarding the Final Fantasy project, although its game development hasn't started yet, the corresponding art and game background aspects are already in production.

The content of the official game version won't differ too much from the CG movie version, except for some specific details in presentation.

After all, if the entire game were to be made on the scale of the CG movie, the cost would truly be a bit too high, and the current performance of VR gaming pods wouldn't be able to handle it.

In a CG movie, the audience's perspective is fixed at one point, and even if it continuously shifts with different characters' viewpoints, the accessible content is actually limited.

But a game is different. Even if Final Fantasy is an RPG, players can still freely run and walk around the map within the game, and the modeling of various different scenes needs to be produced.

Even if it's just a patch of grass a player walks past, which accounts for zero point one percent of the gameplay and content, it still needs to be made.

When producing the Final Fantasy character models and designing their related actions, everyone showed high enthusiasm, especially Meng Zuo and Qin Yi.

“Mr. Chen, please leave the character named Aerith to me!”

“Mr. Chen, Tifa in the CG movie can maintain a single outfit, but I think that in the game, when players use different skills, or wear different equipment, including various feedback for combat and injury, there needs to be subtle changes.”

Qin Yi and Meng Zuo eagerly took on tasks.

Mainly, after seeing the concept art drafts, this project named Final Fantasy truly excited them. Especially after reading the personality descriptions, they were even more thrilled. Tifa, strong and independent yet gentle, and Aerith, bold and passionate—these characters instantly resonated with them.

Listening to Qin Yi and Meng Zuo, Chen Xu, who was sitting in his chair, stood up and lightly coughed twice.

“Final Fantasy is bound to become a very important project under Nebula Games, and the character modeling and presentation for both the CG movie and the game must be meticulously crafted.”

“Furthermore, Qin Yi, your expertise lies primarily in level design and in-game numerical balancing. Therefore, I will personally design and produce the characters of Tifa and Aerith.”

Chen Xu said, looking at the two with a serious expression.

The implication of his words was probably: You two can't handle these characters, let me do it!

Is that really the reason!?

Qin Yi and Meng Zuo were stunned, then looked at Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue beside them.

They had already received the characters Cloud and Sephiroth from Chen Xu and were joyfully preparing to assemble a team to arrange character production.

“They are responsible for scripting and art, which is more professional compared to your areas,” Chen Xu said without batting an eyelid.

Qin Yi and Meng Zuo were speechless for a long time.

Does this reason make sense?

It does make sense!

But crucially, why couldn't they believe it?

However, after staying in the office for a while, to prevent the two from being too disappointed, Chen Xu finally gave them a very important character.

It could even be said that without this character, there would be no subsequent story for both the game and the CG movie.

And that character was: Professor Hojo!

Watching Qin Yi and Meng Zuo's slightly desolate figures departing from the office, Chen Xu couldn't help but sigh with emotion.

When the game project unfolds, he would give them more characters to be responsible for, to satisfy their desire to participate in character design.

Aside from Professor Hojo, the characters on the Shinra side—Don Corneo, Palmer… these were all theirs.

………………

After finalizing the Final Fantasy CG movie project, there weren't many issues regarding the production team.

The team that originally produced the Warcraft CG was used, but the cost invested in the Advent Children movie was even greater.

As for the progress, it was also quite fast. Although Chen Xu could reference various shots and storyboards from the previous life's Advent Children, allowing for many shortcuts, and the technology of this Parallel World was stronger than his previous one.

But the main reason was that the money was delivered on time.

It was the large number of staff involved in the production, coupled with continuous overtime work, that allowed Advent Children to be completed so quickly.

It even cost no less than making a large-scale game.

As for profitability, Chen Xu wasn't too worried for now.

Currently, only DVD distribution has been finalized, and negotiations for video streaming platforms are still ongoing.

However, based on the current quality of Advent Children, Nebula Games had conducted internal evaluations, concluding that recovering costs wouldn't be a major issue. However, considering its primary purpose as promotion, the recoupment period would be relatively long.

In addition, Chen Xu also made some deletions and changes to the content and dialogue of Advent Children compared to the original version.

After all, aside from its labels as a fan IP and a CG movie, the original Advent Children from his previous life was a decent popcorn commercial film on its own.

However, as a story set two years after the main game, and its release date also being later than the game's.

The movie contained many spoilers, such as Aerith, Zack, and Vincent.

For the game's content, Chen Xu planned to make Cloud's story the main feature: Cloud's mental breakdown and coma after leaving Midgar, leading to Zack's story in Crisis Core, and the grievances between Vincent and Professor Hojo when his coffin is opened, as well as Yuffie's story in Wutai.

Of course, this content would definitely be released as DLC, much like the story of Ellie and Riley in The Last of Us after Joel was injured and fell into a coma in the university town.

………………

On the Dire high ground, Song Ren was fiercely battling, feeling annoyed as he watched the Dwarf Sniper immobile at the fountain.

“Old Zhang! Why are you AFK? We can still turn this around! We're strong in the late game, even if the score is 31:6, I think our economy isn't falling behind!” As a team motivator, Song Ren encouraged his bro's morale.

“Oh, come on! Do you believe that yourself? They'll chop you down in two hits. Don't resist anymore, quickly go check Nebula Games' official Weibo account, these guys at Nebula Games actually made a movie!” Zhang Yi chuckled.

“Made a movie?!” Song Ren was taken aback.

Nebula Games, movie?

What's going on!?

Isn't Nebula Games a game company?

Feeling a bit bewildered, Song Ren pulled out his phone and quickly opened Nebula Games' official Weibo account.

On Nebula Games' official Weibo, the most recent post was published three minutes ago.

The content was very simple: 'New blockbuster Advent Children coming soon!'

Is the new game called Advent Children?

This was Song Ren's first thought, and indeed, it was many players' first thought.

But soon, many players like Song Ren understood what the movie was all about.

Because all the forwards and @-mentions on that Weibo post were video websites.

Then, opening these video websites and seeing the homepage notifications that popped up, all players were completely dumbfounded.

So Advent Children isn't a new game?

It's a CG movie?

Nebula Games and Mr. Chen went off to make movies? Oh my god!

Many players were utterly shocked, who could have expected this!

Previously, due to Nebula Games' high-quality CG graphics, and the cinematic camera work and storytelling in their games.

For example, Red Dead Redemption, Uncharted, The Last of Us, Detroit: Become Human, and World of Warcraft, especially the recent Xenoblade Chronicles.

All these led many players to jokingly comment that Nebula Games was a film company delayed by games.

But now Nebula Games is actually making movies?

And a CG blockbuster at that.

The moment this news was released, it immediately replaced the trending headlines.

Many major game developers who spent money on promotion expressed their exasperation, as if hit by a Chihuahua.

You say if Nebula Games were launching a new game project, they'd accept it.

But you guys went off to make a movie, and you're still stealing the trending headlines.

However, for ordinary players, this news was truly astonishing.

‘I'm stunned! Is Mr. Chen finally going to realize his dream of being a director?’

‘Haha, I thought of the movie theater in Red Dead Redemption, and indeed, there are quite a few movies in there.’

‘CG movies aren't live-action, so I don't think it will disappoint.’

‘Actually, I feel like if you link together the story of Red Dead Redemption, it's already a long movie!’

Innumerable players discussed animatedly.

And with the promotion from major video websites, the popularity of Advent Children continued to soar.

However, a portion of players spotted something fishy.

Why would Nebula Games suddenly make a movie?

And a completely new IP movie at that.

If they only wanted to make movies, Nebula Games had many other options under its belt.

Uncharted, The Witcher: Wild Hunt, The Last of Us, Red Dead Redemption—all were very suitable games for adaptation into movies.

But this CG movie called Advent Children, looking at the art style on the promotional poster…

Some more observant players had a bold idea in their minds.
