Chapter 511: You Won't Even Give Me 300 Bucks!? (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)

This time, Song Ren was still using the Great Sword from before.

Although he had unlocked a Bow and Arrows, after trying it out briefly, he felt it wasn't very user-friendly.

Regular attacks required charging; otherwise, they wouldn't fire. Additionally, the damage and attack range varied depending on the charging duration.

The highest damage occurred at the moment of the charging flash, delivering peak damage, but afterward, the damage dropped.

As for special attacks, they looked flashy, but the damage felt underwhelming, barely scratching the skeletons.

The only advantage he saw was the ranged capability.

But now that he had two dodging opportunities, evading monster attacks shouldn't be an issue.

Excited, Song Ren started a new game but soon noticed something different: a divine blessing was placed right before him at the start.

"Just as I thought! That earlier one must've been a story kill!" Song Ren chuckled.

The gods were still familiar—Zeus—but after their dialogue, Song Ren was stunned.

'Greetings, young nephew. Most importantly, my blessings and power will ultimately aid you in finding your true home.'

Originally, Song Ren assumed NPC blessing dialogues were identical, but they were actually different?

This time, he also noticed the Skills on the interface still followed three paths: Lightning Attack, Thunderstorm Dance, and Thunder Shot, corresponding to attack, ranged, and special attack modes.

Yet again, he chose Lightning Attack, having experienced its dazzling effects before—sparks flying with every slash, incredibly flashy.

The early rooms weren't too difficult, and by the third, he encountered another deity: Aphrodite.

After their dialogue, several options appeared: ranged, dash, and a summoning blessing named after Aphrodite.

Without much thought, Song Ren instinctively picked the last one.

Not because the description was wordy, but because it sounded awesome!

Accumulate a divine power gauge to summon Aphrodite, firing a charm arrow to turn enemies into traitors.

Moreover, consuming the entire gauge dealt a whopping 2,500 damage—wasn't that Invincible?

So awesome!

Without hesitation, Song Ren selected this aid Skill.

After choosing, he noticed a new progress bar below his health bar UI, divided into four stages.

Clearly, filling one segment allowed one use, with fuller bars enhancing the effect.

But soon, Song Ren discovered a critical issue.

"Damn it! Why does the divine power gauge reset!?" In the previous room, through attacking and taking damage, he'd filled one segment but didn't use it.

In-game, Song Ren looked Frustrated. He'd assumed the divine power could be saved for the BOSS.

Now, he learned it was room-specific and reset afterward?

Realizing this mechanic left him Speechless.

What was the point, then?

Earlier, to grab an extra key for unlocking new weapons, he'd skipped the Centaur's Heart room that increased his health ceiling.

Now, with only 50 health, relying on taking hits to fill the divine power gauge was unrealistic.

"Hey! The Shop—maybe it sells health!" Eyeing his 80 gold coins and the next Shop room, Song Ren felt a flicker of hope.

In the Shop, he knew deity blessings appeared—though pricey at 150 gold.

He couldn't afford that, but right now, he cared about health, not blessings.

Despite having Death Defiance left, he preferred saving it for the BOSS.

With some anticipation, Song Ren entered the Shop and spotted something resembling fries and coke.

He bought it immediately, restoring a large chunk of health.

But glancing at the Power Pomegranate and Zeus' blessing, he sighed wistfully.

He wanted them!

But no money.

Then, Song Ren froze in surprise.

Behind Charon, inside a metal box, was a Money Pouch.

What? He'd never seen that before!

Approaching it, he was stunned.

'Borrow 300 gold from Charon's Money Pouch.'

"Damn it! You can borrow money? Is this hidden story content? My luck's insane—am I the chosen one?" Overjoyed, Song Ren felt contentedly.

Just when he needed cash, he could borrow 300 from Charon.

He figured it was like a loan in Animal Crossing, though Hades might enforce stricter repayment terms.

For instance, borrowing 300 gold might block further earnings until the debt was cleared.

But so what?

With borrowed money, he could upgrade a Skill and buy a deity blessing right away!

Beaming, Song Ren eagerly reached for Charon's Money Pouch.

Instantly, intense background audio blared.

Charon roared furiously, and the scene shifted to a lava-surrounded platform with four gleaming money jars.

'Uh, look, Charon, I can explain. I just, uh, got used to taking things from my father's domain. I didn't mean to steal—seriously!'

The Prince of the Underworld's feeble excuses were palpable even to Song Ren outside the game.

Sure enough, Charon bellowed.

Borrow from him?

Then go home!

"Screw this! It's just 300 bucks! Are you serious? You won't even give me 300!?" Song Ren was depressed.

Charon's damage was insane—one hit nearly wiped his full health.

After Death Defiance triggered, he didn't even resist with his second life, just surrendered.

He hadn't even seen the first BOSS before being sent packing.

But what really left him Speechless was Hades' mocking dialogue afterward.

'Ah... let's confirm, brat. According to recent reports... you tried stealing under Charon's nose? And got killed? Even for you, that's disgraceful.'

'Uh... I was borrowing, not stealing, okay? And why did no one tell me Charon's such a beast? I thought ferrymen were chill!'

"This game's so hard!" Song Ren sighed with emotion.

The moment he spoke, Zhang Yi echoed, "Yeah! So hard! I haven't beaten the first BOSS yet. Hey, Old Song, did you?"

Song Ren stiffened slightly, sipping his tea.

"Nope, it's too tough. But even though I keep dying, it's still fun!" He smoothly changed the subject.

He wasn't lying—he really hadn't beaten the BOSS!

Never even saw it—how could he have won?
