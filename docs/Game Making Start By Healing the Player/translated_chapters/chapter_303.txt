Chapter 302: Some Content Changes (7th update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)

From a game mechanism perspective, the modes in Rainbow Six Siege are actually quite simple.

They are mainly divided into attackers and defenders.

Among these, there are three different modes.

Hostage Mode, Bomb Mode, and Secure Area Mode.

Hostage Mode and Bomb Mode are generally present in previous FPS games, with the main differences being some mechanism changes.

As for Secure Area Mode, it's essentially a point-capture mode, where victory is determined when players from one side occupy an area.

Besides these, there's also a rather special mode, which is Terrorist Hunt Mode.

This is mainly for new players to use for training, allowing them to solo or team up against AI terrorist personnel of different difficulty levels.

Of course, this mode was later renamed Training Grounds, and the suicide bombers inside also disappeared.

For this mode, Chen Xu decided to retain the earlier Terrorist Hunt Mode, and through the performance of AI technology, players can experience a more realistic counter-terrorism feel when facing the White Masks in PVE.

The rest concerns the recreation of maps; for Rainbow Six Siege, maps can be said to be the most crucial core.

In his previous life, many players would say '500 hours to get started,' which made many rookies tremble, but it was actually a somewhat exaggerated statement.

Because in Rainbow Six Siege, unlike other FPS games, the requirement for marksmanship is not as high as in other FPS titles.

More importantly, it's about familiarity with Operator skill mechanisms, gadget usage, and the maps themselves.

If one isn't familiar with the maps, a common situation will arise.

Who am I?

Where am I?

Who's shooting me?

And who killed me?

How did someone get behind me?

It would literally turn Rainbow Six Siege into a horror game.

This is precisely what happens due to unfamiliarity with the maps.

Because in Rainbow Six Siege, walls, wooden panels, and other elements are destructible, and once destroyed, a new attack route emerges.

Attackers can use their gadgets to forcibly destroy obstacles, launching unexpected attacks from surprising locations to catch opponents off guard.

Similarly, defenders can also utilize this feature to open up passages first, expanding their line of sight, or hide in a small room and fortify it—though this is strongly not recommended unless on specific maps.

Additionally, attackers possess two unmanned reconnaissance vehicles that can enter rooms through gaps beneath wooden panels and ventilation ducts to observe the situation and gather intelligence.

Defenders, on the other hand, can access the cameras within the building to observe information about various areas.

It can be said that from the very beginning of the game, both sides will be engaged in a phase of information gathering and psychological warfare.

Secondly, in terms of action, because it's a VR game, Chen Xu also considered making it more realistic.

Of course, there will be two versions: one for players and a military version.

However, the two versions will have some differences.

The military version, for instance, will feature more detailed operational content.

For example, allowing hostages in Hostage Mode to move.

After all, in a real counter-terrorism operation, hostages would clearly not be squatting on the ground, hands over their heads, completely motionless.

Secondly, there's the ability to step over Kapkan traps, a more realistic operation, including more destructible environments and interactive items.

And also, character jumping in the game.

In his previous life, some players also raised questions about this, and the official answer was that it was for realism; after all, how could counter-terrorism personnel jump while carrying dozens of pounds of equipment?

This answer seemed quite reasonable, but in reality, it was simply to reduce workload and bugs.

However, Chen Xu planned to add jumping to the military version.

Because compared to the standard edition, the military version could prioritize realism more than balance.

After all, wasn't the direction given by the Game Department for training purposes?

And honestly, jumping doesn't hold much significance in Rainbow Six Siege.

The imagined scenario of Fuze jumping up and deploying his cluster charge against the ceiling with a 'thump-thump-thump' is completely non-existent.

After all, carrying such heavy equipment, even if one could jump, it wouldn't be very high; at most, it would be a simple small hop.

Besides this, the version provided to players also features many detailed content changes.

For example, rope climbing; camera angle switching in VR is also a crucial core point, otherwise, Rainbow Six might very well turn into Vertigo Six.

……………………

Chen Xu was gradually refining the design concept document for Rainbow Six Siege.

He was relatively low-key, but NetDragon, which had already confirmed its cooperation with Nebula Games, became very high-profile after their discussions.

They specifically held a news conference to announce the latest news about their collaboration with Nebula Games to develop a VR blockbuster.

【The new game will be jointly developed by Nebula Games and NetDragon! The codename is temporarily set as 'R6'】

【This will be a game utilizing the latest VR technology, bringing an unprecedented new experience to all players】

【Nebula Games Platform and NetDragon Platform will engage in deep strategic cooperation】

Instantly, news was flying everywhere.

There was official news revealed by NetDragon, various unofficial news, and wild guesses from players.

As for Chen Xu, he was much more low-key, only posting an official Weibo update confirming that the game codenamed 'R6' was indeed real.

In an instant, the gaming industry experienced a major upheaval, and countless industry designers and developers were bewildered.

NetDragon is cooperating with Nebula Games!?

Didn't NetDragon seem to be making overtures to the Channel Alliance before?

How did they suddenly turn around and get involved with Nebula Games?

Even the Channel Alliance was dumbfounded.

Originally, NetDragon's attitude was rather ambiguous, not like TengHua's, but they thought NetDragon was one of their own, and with a little effort, they could make connections.

But then, in a flash, they ran off to the competitor's side?

And it even seemed like they initiated the move themselves?

However, compared to the news of NetDragon and Nebula Games entering a strategic partnership that deeply impacted the industry.

Ordinary players, on the other hand, clearly didn't care about any of that; what they truly cared about was that NetDragon and Nebula Games were actually jointly developing a VR blockbuster!?

As soon as this news was announced, players of both NetDragon and Nebula Games instantly erupted in excitement.

After all, even though NetDragon hasn't been doing so well in recent years, it's still a giant in the gaming industry.

And Nebula Games, needless to say, all of its games so far have been quality titles.

The immense popularity of the recently released Warcraft hasn't even faded yet!

The remaining question was what type and theme this game, codenamed R6, would actually be.
