Chapter 289: Bewildered Players and Pros (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Inside Shark TV, Chen Xu's live stream room's bullet comments had utterly exploded.

Even with a time limit set for comments, they were so dense they were barely legible.

All the players looked bewildered.

They had imagined many scenarios before this, but this particular one was truly unexpected.

It felt as if Chen Xu had toyed with the professional players in the palm of his hand!

Especially players who had watched Shu Ben's matches before, they simply couldn't believe it was Shu Ben playing against Chen Xu.

If it weren't for the Wolf Rider's movement still being so flashy, they would have definitely thought this was a "Warcraft" 500-point player; otherwise, how could Chen Xu have beaten him like this?

'This can't be match-fixing, right!? It feels like Shu Ben just lost mid-game!?'

'Bro, anyone with a bit of intelligence wouldn't say "match-fixing." Less conspiracy theories, if nothing else, Mr. Chen's play was actually quite masterful.'

'Seriously, I still don't get it, how did Shu Ben lose?! It felt like he was just harassed by the Beastmaster in the early game and then he was gone.'

'Yeah, Mr. Chen's money is just too much. I wasn't paying attention to the mini-map on the main stage earlier, watching Shu Ben wipe out the first batch of Huntresses, and then he just tore apart the main base, I thought he was going to win.'

'Superpower tactics! Damn it, Mr. Chen secretly opened a recharge channel for himself! No wonder I dropped from an initial score of 500 to 100; it made me buy a new account, turns out I didn't have a recharge channel!'

'Honestly, I feel this tactic has something to it. In the early game, he used the Night Elf's Ancient of War to quickly creep large neutral camps, then expanded rapidly, and Mr. Chen only used one hero from start to finish!'

'Huntresses are inherently unarmored units; only after upgrading their tech to "Green Skin" can they directly engage Wolf Riders and Orc Grunts.'

'Can Night Elves still play against Orcs like this? Does that mean the balance is truly fine?'

'Logically, shouldn't the Beastmaster be considered an Orc? So, didn't the Orcs win in the end anyway?'

'Damn, I'm speechless!'

Not only were the players discussing heatedly, but in an RTS group chat, a group of professional players participating in tournaments were also debating.

The Grandmaster: "Holy crap, Mr. Chen's got something! I thought it would be an undisputed stomp."

Satellite: "Yeah, this Night Elf strategy of expanding everywhere, combined with a distant spawn point and a relatively large map, is indeed quite challenging."

Guadi: "However, the drawbacks are also very obvious. In the early game, because you have to commit heavy forces to expanding, you need to ensure you can mass Huntresses before the Orc Wolf Riders arrive, otherwise you'll be directly run over by them."

"So, in the early game, Mr. Chen directly chose the Beastmaster as his starting neutral hero, using Quillbeasts to harass. However, this tactic also has certain skill requirements; at the very least, you need to manage both harassment and development simultaneously. The main reason was also that Shu Ben was a bit too relaxed and underestimated his opponent, not even fully scouting and directly rushing tech with a single burrow based on experience. His two unfinished burrows being harassed for half the early game was quite damaging."

As a professional player, and one who mained Orcs, he quickly discovered some characteristics of this tactic.

And found some countermeasures.

Other Night Elf players in the group chat also offered their opinions: "It mainly depends on the pressure in the early to mid-game. If the Orcs can quickly reach Tier 2, and Wolf Riders come out early and start moving, then it becomes difficult."

"But if the early game harassment is effective, once an expansion base is established, it's basically equivalent to declaring a Night Elf victory." Many Night Elf players, at this moment, felt as if a new world had opened up for them.

Before this, for players who mainly played Night Elves, the strategy was generally fast Tier 3 Bears and Dryads. Similarly, for Humans, it was almost always starting with an Archmage, then a Mountain King at Tier 2, followed by Riflemen and Priests/Sorceresses.

But the drawback is that during the Tier 2 phase, before one's own forces have fully formed, they simply cannot withstand the Orcs. Spirit Walkers with dispel and Spirit Link, combined with Wolf Riders, can completely push through before Tier 3.

As for the multi-expansion strategy, although it also involves applying early pressure and harassment to the opponent for the sake of one's own development, it directly mass-produces Huntresses through multiple Ancient of Wars.

In terms of combat power, the power spike actually comes earlier.

Because in the early game, you don't need to apply pressure for as long. As long as the two Ancient of Wars at the large neutral creep camp and the Tree of Life before the expansion are built, and you ensure that the opponent's Wolf Riders haven't fully formed due to your harassment, both sides are basically on the same starting line. The rest depends on whether the opponent's Wolf Rider mobility is stronger, or your own Huntress guerrilla warfare is more effective.

………………

After the match with Shu Ben concluded, Chen Xu exchanged a couple of polite greetings, then exited the game and chuckled as he looked at the dense bullet comments.

"This is one of the Night Elf playstyles. Why do I say that 'Warcraft's' balance is fine? Because each race has its own playstyle."

"Currently, for Orcs, everyone often starts with a Blademaster, then rushes Tier 2 tech with a single burrow to get Wolf Riders. But why don't other races have specific playstyles? For example, the Night Elf tactic just now, frankly, is about utilizing the Night Elves' unique characteristics. The Ancient of War from the neutral shop in the early game ensures that the harassing hero levels up quickly and expands, which is something other races simply cannot achieve."

Chen Xu briefly explained the characteristics of the Night Elves to everyone, but he didn't delve into more tactical aspects.

What he had just played was a classic Night Elf tactic in "Warcraft": the multi-expansion strategy.

Its main focus is on defending against harassment and counter-harassment, constantly avoiding the opponent's expansion, and even attacking the opponent's base when they attack yours, essentially forcing a trade of Town Portal scrolls.

And a characteristic of the multi-expansion strategy is that, if you want to, you can play for a very long time; never go for an all-in push.

Because as long as you drag the game out, you can achieve complete economic dominance, and your chances of winning increase.

In his previous life, players also jokingly said that SKY, who popularized the TR (Arrow Tower Defense) all-in push strategy and was eventually dubbed "SKY's All-in Push" by players, did so because his family was poor when he was a child and he could only go to internet cafes for an hour. Therefore, SKY promoted the TR tactic, aiming to finish battles within 10 minutes so he could play 6 rounds of Warcraft in an hour.

As for MOON, who popularized the multi-expansion strategy, it was because his family had strict tutors when he was a child, and he could only play one game of Warcraft a day. So he invented the multi-expansion strategy, allowing him to play for an hour in a single match.

Although it was a joke, it perfectly captured the characteristics of these two tactics.

As for Chen Xu, he wanted to showcase the racial characteristics to the players even more.

After all, there are no invincible tactics, only invincible players.

Right now, he was mainly just messing with these professional players who hadn't yet fully grasped the characteristics of these tactics; otherwise, Chen Xu felt he'd be a bit strained just relying on raw mechanics.

Meanwhile, on the main commentary stage, one commentator felt like he couldn't take it anymore.
