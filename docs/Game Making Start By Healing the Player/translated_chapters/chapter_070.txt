# Chapter 70: The Boat of Friendship Capsizes in an Instant

As the game progressed, bullet comments flooded the live stream room, but the players inside the game clearly had no time to read them—fully immersed in the gameplay.

The Da Zhou siblings, on the other hand, had tentatively reached a truce.

In reality, under the overwhelming authority of Empress Da Zhou, the rebellious King Zhuang was swiftly suppressed, further consolidating the Da Zhou Dynasty's rule.

Regardless, guided by Liuliu, their team began progressing steadily along a proper cooking workflow.

Meanwhile, Dong Zhen and A'Shu remained in a state of warlord chaos—bickering verbally while frantically scrambling in the game.

"What do we do? Think of something—we're gonna lose!"

Seeing their score drop to -140 while Liuliu and Zhuangzhuang's score climbed from -140 to -70, A'Shu started to panic.

"What the heck do you expect me to do when we're behind? We can't do real-person PK here! Just plate and serve—this dish is finally ready!" Dong Zhen snapped, combining the ingredients on a plate.

"Plates! We need plates to serve! Only you have the sink to wash them!" A'Shu ran toward the serving window holding the cooked dish, only to be prompted that it needed plating.

"What the heck is with all these rules? Can't we just eat without plates? Can't we shovel it into our mouths with our hands?" Dong Zhen looked exasperated.

"My Squad Leader Dong, stop fooling around—wash the plates quickly!" A'Shu shouted urgently.

"Wash plates? What's the point? Isn't that just wasting time?"

A sudden surge of anger sparked a devious idea. Dong Zhen flung the dirty plate aside and steered his Bearded Chef toward Liuliu and Zhuangzhuang's area.

Without hesitation, he snatched a clean plate.

"Squad Leader A'Shu! Catch the plate!" Turning, he tossed the plate into their zone.

Glancing at the menu on the screen, then at the freshly cooked dish sitting on the outer stove—just finished and not yet served—he executed a perfect sleight of hand. "Squad Leader A'Shu! Catch the dish!" Holding the stolen dish, Dong Zhen dashed toward A'Shu.

"Squad Leader Dong, you've got some skills!" Two successful servings instantly lifted their score from -140 to 0.

Meanwhile, Zhuangzhuang—still diligently chopping and washing plates—realized his hard work had been stolen.

"Sis! They stole our food and plates!" Without hesitation, Zhuangzhuang hurled his dirty plate toward Dong Zhen.

Though it had no effect.

"This is outrageous! How dare you two steal our food!" Liuliu looked utterly bewildering.

At first, when she first played this game, she thought it would be a warm, harmonious experience.

But as the actual experience unfolded, she had to admit one thing—this game was genuinely blood-pressure-raising.

Especially when teammates couldn't align their strategies, it became truly maddening.

It was easy for one's Mindset to go completely off track.

Now, she realized it wasn't just teammates who could spike her blood pressure—opponents could do it too.

They could steal her team's plates and dishes, serve them to customers, and even gain points?

Their hard-earned labor had been stolen!

"A'Shu! You handle this—you're good at it!" Seeing himself called out, Dong Zhen quickly passed the responsibility to A'Shu.

"How can you call what a scholar does 'stealing'?"

"Besides, what does 'stealing' even mean? It implies secrecy! Squad Leader Dong took it right in front of you—how is that stealing?"

"And listen up, Liuliu, Zhuangzhuang, and all the viewers in every live stream room—this game isn't just entertainment! What we stream has depth!" A'Shu's tone suddenly turned profound.

"When we stream a game, we must convey meaningful lessons. In today's world, marketing accounts flood everyone with shallow motivational鸡汤.

Squad Leader Dong's actions show how cruel society truly is! We may work honestly, but others don't! Imagine working at a company—doing all the work, yet someone else—ah—they steal the credit! They slack off all day, but the moment the boss arrives—*Click Sound*—they snatch your nearly finished work and claim it as their own!"

"We're not promoting such behavior—we're exposing the dark realities of workplace politics! Never intend to harm others, but always stay wary!"

"That's why we do this—to warn everyone! This is true BEST Live Streaming—teaching life lessons! How many bankrupt bosses watched our stream and restarted their businesses? How many divorced couples reconciled? This is what real streaming is! When you feel surrounded by darkness in society, it's because your spiritual strength is weak! You have material wealth but lack spirit!"

"So we must nurture both spirit and matter! Now someone might ask—how can we follow Brother Shu's spiritual path? It's simple—just 6 yuan! Pay 6 yuan to become a sapling, and every afternoon to evening, receive the purest spiritual cleansing in the live stream room!"

The live stream room fell into stunned silence.

"A'Shu! It's a shame you're not in sales—what a wasted talent!" Dong Zhen sighed with emotion.

He even forgot he was supposed to be the negative example.

But clearly, this speech failed to fool Liuliu and Zhuangzhuang.

As Dong Zhen attempted to steal more plates, Zhuangzhuang rushed over, ready to counterattack.

In an instant, the kitchen transformed from a cooking space into a battlefield.

Ingredients and plates flew everywhere. Pots on the stoves were abandoned.

The small sailboat of friendship—capsized in an instant.

………………

Valentine's Day, combined with the lack of particularly interesting games lately—aside from NetDragon and TengHua's two VR titles—meant little else captured attention.

And in terms of streaming effect, only a few live streaming geniuses could make those two games entertaining.

Most players just watched the graphics and story, joining the hype.

Thus, *Overcooked* entered the spotlight for most streamers.

Within just one day—bolstered by prior promotional warm-up and platform streamer promotion—

*Overcooked* rapidly spread and became wildly popular across major game live streaming platforms.

After all, a multiplayer game launching on Valentine's Day initially seemed heartwarming.

Of course, those tags were merely assumptions.

The moment players invited friends and entered the game in pairs,

the once-stable boat of friendship encountered violent storms in the sacred kitchen—capsizing instantly.

In live stream rooms everywhere, previously close streamers instantly turned against each other.
