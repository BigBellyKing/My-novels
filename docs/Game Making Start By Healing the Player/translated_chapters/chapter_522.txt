### Chapter 521: Is This A Game For A Child Like Him?! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

On June 1st.

Chen Xu immediately entered The Witcher: Wild Hunt, which he had already pre-downloaded.

To experience the game on its release day, he specifically took a day off. Of course, experiencing the game was the goal, and the excuse was that he was still a child.

Even though he was in his early thirties, he still possessed a childlike heart. And with his childlike heart still present, he was still a child. Was it too much for a child to take a break and play games on Children's Day?

Not at all!

However, the only thing that slightly surprised Chen Xu was that, for some unknown reason, Nebula Games had not released a corresponding VR theme this time. The Witcher: Wild Hunt could only be entered through the portal within Nebula World.

And another point that amazed Chen Xu was that this game actually required real-name authentication. This was quite rare.

"This game seems to have something to it, and not just a little," Chen Xu mused to himself before entering the game. After all, only a few games under Nebula Games had similar settings.

As the game unlocked, Chen Xu immediately delved in. He then became very happy, because he saw something.

It was the difficulty selection!

"Excellent! This immediately rules out Souls-like games," Chen Xu said, a happy smile spreading across his face as he looked at the difficulty prompt.

Generally, Souls-like games and other hardcore titles typically don't allow players to choose difficulty, such as Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Monster Hunter. Of course, some games with difficulty options can be extremely hardcore on their highest settings, even surpassing the Souls series in difficulty. Examples include Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Uncharted. However, on easy difficulty, they are also very simple.

So, seeing The Witcher: Wild Hunt's difficulty selection, Chen Xu decisively ignored the bottom two difficulties. But this time, he showed a slight improvement; he didn't choose the highest difficulty, opting instead for the second highest: 'I want to break a sweat'.

As the difficulty was confirmed, an orchestral BGM and narration simultaneously filled his ears.

'I see you gathered before me… hungry… panicked… clutching infants to your breasts…'

'Emperor Emhyr's army swept into our lands… attacking every stronghold from here to the Blue Mountains.'

'Swift and merciless, cities fell one after another. People of the North, you are in dire straits! Your kings have failed you, so you turn to the gods!'

'But did you not beg? Did you not kneel and pray devoutly?'

'Instead, you wailed and cried: Why have the gods abandoned us?'

'This is all the result of our failures, honed over a long time!'

'Long, long ago, our world collided with another, causing great changes. Scholars call this the Conjunction of Spheres…'

'The gods allowed evil forces to invade our world. That violent upheaval left many evil remnants, like magic…'

'But we did not forbid magic; instead, we increased our power and wealth by studying this ancient evil force!'

'And the monsters that came to our doorstep, remnants of the Conjunction of Spheres… trolls, ghouls, werewolves? Did we drive them away with swords? Or did we push the responsibility onto others?'

'We handed it all over to the Witchers… these misguided children who learned dirty sorcery and underwent blasphemous rituals that mutated their bodies.'

'Unable to distinguish good from evil, they were sent to fight monsters, their last shred of humanity long since extinguished.'

'Indeed, their numbers have dwindled in recent years, but some Witchers still roam, exchanging dirty work for money. Their existence is our humiliation!'

'The Northern lands bleed from war, scourged by war—this is the gods' punishment upon us!'

Accompanied by a series of time-frozen shots, the game presented various scenes to Chen Xu. Of course, much of the content was already known to Chen Xu, as it had been mentioned in previous crossovers, such as the Conjunction of Spheres, Witchers, and sorcerers.

As the narration ended, the in-game visuals were no longer static scenes. In the center of the battlefield ruins, Geralt and Vesemir investigated the site. Geralt squatted down, looking at the muddy ground, then the scene instantly switched.

As if time had rewound, a black-haired woman with an unclear face appeared in the middle of the battlefield, flanked by Redanian and Nilfgaardian armies. Facing an overwhelming volley of arrows, the black-haired sorceress was forced to unleash a powerful spell to escape.

Then the scene returned to Geralt. After investigating the relevant clues on the battlefield, Geralt and Vesemir rested in the mountains at night. By the campfire, Geralt drifted into sleep.

After a brief darkness.

The opening scene was an immediate shock. Foot fetish bonus? But why were they Geralt's big feet!

Watching the camera slowly pan from Geralt's two large feet propped on the wooden tub, Chen Xu felt a wave of speechlessness. He had no interest in Geralt's feet!

[Kaer Morhen: Witcher Keep, Gwelerch Coast]

As Chen Xu grumbled, a location prompt simultaneously appeared in his view. Geralt, in the bathtub, was closing his eyes, enjoying the pleasure of bathing.

But then, a scorpion-like creature silently crawled into the tub. The next second, Geralt, eyes closed, shivered. Chen Xu also shivered, as the comprehensive force feedback of the Huanyu VR gaming pod, combined with his own mental visualization, made the immersion incredibly strong.

Geralt in the game showed a helpless expression and looked to the side.

'That's not funny.'

He said, reaching into the tub to grab the magic scorpion and throwing it onto the ground. The scorpion then dissolved into energy fragments. The next moment, the camera switched to the direction Geralt was looking. Yennefer, wearing no clothes but a towel wrapped around her hair, lay gracefully on a lounge chair, her back to Geralt, quietly reading a book.

'I don't want you to laugh, I want you to hurry up; it's already noon.'

'You promised Ciri you'd practice with her.'

'Go find Ciri before Vesemir annoys her to death.'

A slightly cool voice came from Yennefer's lips. Geralt in the game emerged from the tub, his body covered in various gruesome scars, demonstrating that he was a battle-hardened Witcher.

After getting dressed, Geralt approached Yennefer and kissed her deeply. Without a word, Yennefer rose from the lounge chair, untied her headscarf, and with her back to Geralt, her dark hair falling down, slowly and unhurriedly put on her underwear.

Oh my god!

Chen Xu's eyes in the game widened. He understood now why this new game from Nebula Games was different from previous titles!

This scene, this 'bonus,' was this a game for a child like him?
