## Chapter 522: You say this RPG, is it a proper RPG? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

To be honest, this particular segment didn't contain anything overly explicit.

It was mostly just a shot from behind, offering the player a natural view, without any sense of showing off.

But the crucial point was that many players considered this a normal RPG game.

Suddenly encountering such somewhat suggestive content, even if it wasn't anything special when taken in isolation, still got players very excited.

After all, what do players love to do most?

They build grand infrastructure and explore life philosophy in Adult Games.

Conversely, in normal games, they scrutinize whether female characters wear safety shorts.

As a perfectly normal gamer, Song Ren naturally had done such things many times.

That's why he was so excited now.

Just this simple visual display completely put Song Ren's previously anxious heart at ease.

Nebula Games truly understood their players!

With this thought, Geralt in the game could now move freely.

[Use Witcher Senses to find the key]

The quest log displayed a UI prompt. Following the system's instruction, Song Ren pressed the Witcher Senses button, and instantly, the scene before him began to blur.

Interactive objects around him glowed gold, while certain examinable items appeared bright red.

"This feels similar to the Eagle Vision system in Assassin's Creed!" Song Ren realized with a sudden understanding.

Of course, it wasn't just Assassin's Creed; many games featured such functions and designs for finding interactive clues in environments, though their specific names differed.

After a brief exploration of the room, Song Ren discovered that many objects were interactive. While not necessarily related to the main storyline, they added a sense of realism. For instance, candles and the hearth fire could be extinguished and relit.

Song Ren found the quest's key next to a book on a table. However, he didn't immediately grab the key and leave the room. Instead, he continued to wander around, checking for other collectibles.

When he approached the dressing mirror, Yennefer, who was combing her hair, spoke first: "Aren't you leaving yet? Ciri is waiting for you."

"It's fine if Ciri waits a little longer," Geralt replied.

"That's very irresponsible of you, and a bit stubborn, too," Yennefer responded. Simultaneously, three dialogue options appeared before Song Ren, much like the dialogue mode demonstrated in previous easter egg content linked with Ciri.

"So the game's story and world-building are conveyed through these dialogues, and future outcomes might be influenced by these choices," Song Ren, as an experienced gamer, immediately understood the purpose of these dialogue options. The gameplay, he realized, was that of a standard RPG.

Looking at Yennefer, Song Ren chose a dialogue option based on his instincts. It wasn't highlighted in any special color, indicating these choices likely wouldn't affect the game's plot.

"What's wrong with being a little stubborn? Besides, you know I'm never a rational man," Geralt said, looking at Yennefer in the chair.

"That's truly you, but it's already noon. Go train with Ciri first, then come back. That way I'll have time to get my face in order." Yennefer didn't turn her head.

"Of all the women I've known, only you would put on makeup before..." Hearing Geralt's words, Song Ren was stunned. What kind of explicit statement was that?! If his understanding wasn't mistaken, that sentence implied *that*, didn't it?

"Have you known many women?" Yennefer turned to look at Geralt, raising an eyebrow slightly.

"It doesn't matter. You're the only one in my heart, anyway..."

Watching Geralt converse with Yennefer, Song Ren couldn't help but smack his lips. This Geralt seemed expressionless, but he also came across as a bit thick-skinned! If he had such self-awareness, wouldn't he have found a partner already?

Of course, even though Geralt in the game showed no emotional fluctuations, Song Ren understood that this wasn't Geralt's true intention. He had learned some things about Witchers from content related to The Witcher: Wild Hunt collaborations, one being that Witchers' emotional expression is suppressed after undergoing the Trial of the Grasses. Geralt was somewhat of an exception, but because of the trial, he wouldn't display many rich emotions on his face. Yet, it was this subtle expression, combined with his lines, that created an even more dramatic effect.

At least for now, Song Ren felt that this Geralt was completely different from the cold, heartless Witcher he had imagined before. Through these simple dialogues, Song Ren had gathered a fair amount of information. After confirming there wasn't much more to interact with, he followed the prompt and left the room.

Upon entering the great hall, Song Ren saw Vesemir sleeping in a chair, with many notes scattered on the floor beside him.

"Same as always. The old Witcher's asleep, and Ciri's gone," Geralt remarked, accustomed to seeing Vesemir lying in the chair.

He then walked to the balcony, and Geralt gazed into the distance. The game's camera slowly zoomed out, revealing expansive wilderness, mountains, dense forests, and the towering Blue Mountains reaching into the sky. Below lay a mist-shrouded valley, with several small streams converging into the White Stone River.

There were thick castle walls, a moat, and a drawbridge, with a narrow gate. The walls were equipped with defensive structures like ballistas, catapults, and giant cauldrons of hot oil. The strong lines and fantastical appearance of the castle contrasted with the lush green surroundings. From the outside, this castle appeared decayed, desolate, even gloomy, yet within some of its structures, one could discern its rich history. This was Kaer Morhen, the forgotten Witcher's haven.

Next, Song Ren controlled Geralt and Vesemir as they engaged in some simple dialogue. Like the previous conversation with Yennefer, there were different branching options. Seeing the book at Vesemir's feet, thicker than an English-Chinese Dictionary, Song Ren deeply understood one thing: Witchers also had to study. Knowledge truly was power!

Then came a segment of the new player tutorial. What Song Ren found quite interesting was the interaction between Geralt, Vesemir, and Ciri. The various dialogue branches made Song Ren feel like he was truly part of the conversation.

As for the game's combat system, Song Ren found it rather intriguing. There were basic combo attacks and different Signs. For instance, there were Signs for hypnotizing, unleashing fire, creating protective shields, and setting slow traps or air blasts, clearly suggesting different playstyles were possible in the future.

But in the next moment, the game's BGM suddenly turned somber. The sky was covered by dark clouds, and snow began to fall. Sensing something amiss, Geralt walked to a nearby training dummy and tore off the burlap covering its head. Inside, surprisingly, was a person.

"Vesemir!"

Geralt instantly spun around.

But the next moment, a Phantom Ship appeared above Kaer Morhen. The Wild Hunt army had arrived. Ciri, Vesemir, and the other Witcher companions were all frozen, turned into ice sculptures.

"I have waited for this moment for a long time, and you too, White Wolf!"

The leading Wild Hunt Rider headed towards Ciri, who was frozen in ice. Then, amidst the White Wolf's roar, Song Ren's vision plunged into darkness.

After a moment, the scene shifted to a desolate camp in the wilderness at night. Geralt, sleeping on the ground, suddenly woke up, and the corresponding location name appeared. It was clearly just a dream. Noticing Geralt's stirring, Vesemir, who was accompanying him, inquired about it. Just like the previous conversation with Yennefer, two different dialogue branches appeared before Song Ren.

Geralt, sitting on a rock, then recounted his nightmare to Vesemir, and at Vesemir's request, handed him Yennefer's letter, redolent with Lilac and Gooseberries. Vesemir hoped to find clues in the letter. From the text, there didn't seem to be anything particularly noteworthy. However, some strange content in the letter left Vesemir baffled, as well as Song Ren, who was playing the game.

(Note: I'm still carrying the Unicorn?)

At this point, Song Ren's eyes widened, looking at one of the selectable dialogue options.

[That's our privacy]

[Unicorn figurine, we once used it as a bed]

Unicorn figurine, used as a bed?

Though there was no animation, as soon as that line appeared, combined with the earlier conversation between Yennefer and Geralt in Kaer Morhen during the dream, an image instantly formed in Song Ren's mind.

"You call this an RPG game, is it a *proper* RPG?!" At that moment, Song Ren was completely stunned, but also filled with a sense of anticipation and excitement for the future development of games.
