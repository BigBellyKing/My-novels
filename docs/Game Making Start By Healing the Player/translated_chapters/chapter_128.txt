Chapter 128: Still Gonna Get Tormented

Chapter 128: Still Gonna Get Tormented

Designers across the online gaming industry have noticed a strange phenomenon.

That is, *Dark Souls* is becoming increasingly popular.

Discussions on player forums, countless videos on video platforms, and an ever-growing number of streamers on live streaming platforms now feature the three words—"YOU DIED"—on their covers.

Countless new players entering the Dark Souls world undergo the same mindset transformation as veteran players.

Even those who watched Chen Xu’s strategy guide videos couldn’t escape being tormented.

Originally, these players entered the game with skeptical attitudes after watching Chen Xu’s videos.

But once they actually played it, they realized—damn it!

Sure, the Shield-holding playstyle might seem a bit cowardly, but it really works!

Yet when they successfully passed through the Cemetery of Ash, Firelink Shrine, and High Wall of Lothric—areas shown in the videos—and reached the unfamiliar Undead Settlement and Road of Sacrifices, they discovered the experience was completely different!

On the High Wall of Lothric, monster density is relatively high only along that stretch beneath the Fire Dragon Bridge.

But if you lure the monsters onto the bridge, the still-living Elder Dragon will unleash flames, helping you eliminate them without distinguishing friend from foe.

The Lothric Knights before the Ice Dog’s room can also be pulled one by one and taken down individually.

Otherwise, the only other enemies are Regular Hollows.

But the Undead Settlement is another story.

New monster types appear, and although you generally only fight one or two at a time, their proximity is extremely close. If you recklessly run around, you’ll quickly feel the "passion" of the villagers.

Moreover, the Undead Settlement still hides numerous traps that leave players’ scalps tingling.

When a player sees a white-glowing item marked as collectible ahead,

They happily dash forward, eager to pick it up.

Unaware, however, that a monster wielding a massive tank has long been lying in wait on a nearby high platform.

The moment the player reaches the item, a giant water tank suddenly crashes down from above, instantly blacking out their screen.

And casually reminding them to re-learn exactly how to write the three words: "YOU DIED."

A stabber with a dagger hides atop the rafters, while shadowy corners conceal enemies throwing knives for ranged damage.

Even iron bars that appear to merely imprison corpses might actually be living monsters.

And then there’s the passionate Fat Auntie, who will leave a deep impression on any player hoping to avoid effort.

All these factors combined left players—those who had barely suffered on the High Wall of Lothric—complaining bitterly.

This treatment was completely different!

"Damn it! This map design is so malicious, just like the Mimic! There’s actually someone hiding nearby!"

"What the hell is this? Fat Auntie, get away from me! I’m still young—I need to strive!"

"Water Tank Guy, let’s talk this over! Put the tank down, okay, okay… WAIT, WHERE DID YOU PULL THAT LARGE SAW FROM!?"

"What’s up with the rats in this sewer? Am I playing Outlast or Dark Souls!? And where did all these skeletons come from!?"

"Positioning, rolling, little buddy! I’m not panicking at all… DAMN IT! What’s happening!? Where did that javelin come from!? It’s like a freaking missile!"

Countless players who relied on the Shield-holding technique to conquer the High Wall of Lothric suddenly found a new world flung wide open before them upon entering the Undead Settlement.

Unfamiliar with the attack patterns of the Undead Settlement’s monsters and ignorant of the many traps,

They instantly relived that cruel cycle of death.

Having conquered Gundyr the Ash and crushed the Ice Dog using the two ultimate skills—shield-holding and fighting from below—

These players were given a token by the old crone and guided into the Undead Settlement, only to be immediately struck by a cold, harsh reality.

A massive hammer—metal-made, covered in spikes, and scorched by flames.

The only thing comforting to players was that, finally, in the Undead Settlement, they weren’t alone.

Here, they experienced for the first time the joy of fighting alongside another.

A knight clad in round, layered armor—like an Onion Knight.

After solving the puzzle of the lift, players can speak with this adorable Onion Knight midway up the elevator and, with his help, defeat a seemingly terrifying Fire Demon.

With the Onion Knight drawing aggro, this battle felt like the easiest many players had ever experienced.

The only pity was that judging by its health bar, this was merely an elite monster, not a boss.

Upon victory, players learn the Onion Knight’s name and receive a cup of wine from him. Together, they drink to the cry of "Praise the Sun," earning a new emote.

But that’s where it ends.

The Onion Knight falls back asleep on the spot, while the player continues forward into further suffering.

And as players progress deeper into the map, they realize each area grows even more malicious than the last!

Giant Crabs lurking in the puddles of the Road of Sacrifices, and a Black Knight beneath the ruined temple—

These left countless players utterly baffled.

They originally thought this was the peak of difficulty, but after crossing the Road of Sacrifices, they arrived at the deepest malice of all:

The legendary Farron Keep. And at this point, countless players truly broke down.

How could one possibly describe it?

It was simply the most unforgettable map in players’ memories.

Poisonous pools resembling cesspits, where movement slows to a crawl, forcing players to rely solely on rolling.

Bizarre monsters everywhere—giant bruisers wielding massive clubs, Darkwraiths perched on your head as if giving you a shampoo, and Curse Frogs with wide, SAN-draining eyes—each more nauseating than the last.

The worst part? Here, players must extinguish every bonfire before they can fight the Lords of Cinder.

Countless players had endured Gundyr the Ash, survived the High Wall of Lothric, braved the Undead Settlement and Road of Sacrifices—

Yet they all fell, one by one, to the cruelty of Farron Keep.

"I can’t take it anymore! Is there any Big Bro out there who can help me? I’m about to break down!"

"+1, does anyone have a map of Farron Cesspit? I’ve circled it twice and still missing one flame to extinguish! Save me!"

"Ah! I feel like I’m done for! This cesspit is so disgusting, and the mobs are way too strong!"

"+1, the Darkwraith is just too strong! It keeps jumping on my head to give me a shampoo!"

"Don’t even talk about it! That giant on the wall wielding roots like a Great Machete Ghru just pinned me down like trash—I’m crying!"

"And the Curse Frog! It’s not strong, but that Appearance/Shape is just too disgusting!"

Players groaned in agony, though naturally, some gloated.

"Haha, you guys keep struggling! I’ve got just one flame left. Once I put it out, I can go fight the Lord of Cinder! I’m finally leaving this cesspit!"

"Reporting to all Undead: I’ve successfully met the Lord of Cinder in Farron Keep—the Undead Legion from the promotional video! Swinging his Great Sword with Pyra, he dances like street dance, so cool and graceful. I’ve been captivated by his attraction, so I’ve decided to spend more time with him."

"Damn it! If you can’t beat him, just say it! Why sugarcoat it!?"
