Chapter 175: The Qualities of a Conscientious Designer (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)

Days passed one after another, and online buzz surrounding the game 'Hammer Swing Ascension' had already died down.

Unlike previous titles such as *It Takes Two* and *Dark Souls*, this simple game simply lacked substantial depth.

The main discussion wasn't even about the game's content itself, but rather the various ways players emotionally broke down after playing it.

It was nothing more than a fleeting wave of popularity.

Yet, even as a passing trend, it attracted countless independent game designers eager to imitate its success.

After all, the game’s popularity at its peak had been truly astonishing.

Moreover, games of this type didn't require a high development cost.

But all of this was irrelevant to Chen Xu.

At this moment, Chen Xu was inside the research lab at Galaxy Smart Tech.

"Has the AI technology shown any results?" Chen Xu asked, slightly surprised as he listened to the researcher's report.

He subtly glanced at the system's UI interface.

The countdown on the progress bar from the golden item he'd previously used was still running.

Already had results?

Just like playing a game while it's being developed—was there already a partially completed version?

"Yes, Mr. Chen. Based on big data collection and targeted applications in the gaming field, we've implemented several optimizations and improvements..." Zhong Yue explained beside him.

Although Chen Xu didn't understand many of the technical terms, he grasped the general meaning.

The AI technology applied to gaming had already secured patent rights in countries worldwide—a significant breakthrough. However, it was still not perfect. More time would be needed for further testing and optimizations.

Nonetheless, they had already created an embryonic form that was ready for commercial use.

"Let me see."

Chen Xu followed Zhong Yue to the lab and began testing on the large screen.

The test subject was an internal testing DEMO of *Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame*, currently under development, primarily used for testing various numerical design elements.

Because it was a test version, many monsters were appearing in unintended locations.

For example, Gundyr the Ash had ended up inside the ancient Undead Asylum.

After adjustments by Zhong Yue and the staff nearby, Chen Xu quickly witnessed a practical demonstration.

In an open courtyard, code was input to extract Gundyr the Ash and place him in the center. Then, a regular Hollow wielding a short sword was summoned.

However, the Hollow was given new actions—rolling and running.

Gundyr the Ash retained his original AI behavior, while the Hollow used the new AI technology.

The demonstration began.

Chen Xu watched as the Hollow, now equipped with rolling and sprinting, moved like a battle-hardened Undead.

Dodging with rolls, stabbing from behind, and perfectly timing relentless sword combos during Gundyr’s attack gaps.

Gundyr’s health plummeted rapidly.

Unlike fragile Undead who could barely survive two hits, this Hollow could only take one.

Yet from start to finish, Gundyr failed to land a single blow.

The Hollow avoided every attack with robotic precision.

If only it had a shield—Chen Xu had no doubt that, with the right actions, this creature could perform a perfect Perfect Guard and then execute Gudako.

"With this AI implemented into the game, I doubt players will be able to pass the bonfire," Chen Xu said after a moment of silence, observing the AI’s performance.

The original *Dark Souls* was essentially a pattern-memorization game, as boss attacks followed predictable patterns.

But with this new AI, while monster stats remained unchanged, their behavior became far more intelligent.

Players would no longer just need to memorize skills—they’d need quick reflexes and real-time responses.

Combined with *Dark Souls*' notoriously high enemy damage and low margin for error, how could players possibly progress?

"Ahem, Mr. Chen, this is actually an advanced mode. Our primary optimization focus is on improving general AI behavior in games, and we can also lower the difficulty," Zhong Yue explained beside him.

"Hmm. Continue tuning it. Also, regarding the new AI technology, let’s first implement it into a special mode within the game for testing," Chen Xu said after some thought.

Directly integrating it into the main game wasn’t feasible.

But after the *Dark Souls* prequel finished development, they could use this AI technology to create an entirely new mode.

After all, in the previous game, Chen Xu had introduced a random mode in the late game.

This new work shouldn’t be treated unfairly.

The prequel’s random mode would definitely be included.

But later, they could also add a brand-new 'Death Mode'!

In his previous life, *Dark Souls 1* had a version called 'Prepare to Die'.

But that version was essentially just an annual edition—'Prepare to Die' was merely a name, adding some content and patch fixes.

Chen Xu, however, wanted to give players a much bigger surprise.

Gravelord Nito, cooped up for too long, had grown weak—so weak he couldn’t even summon skeletons stronger than himself.

Artorias, corrupted by the Abyss, had lost his Greatshield and had a mangled arm. How could that be acceptable?

Legendary Sun King Gwyn, having passed the First Flame once, was reduced to a hollow shell. Even when players mastered Parry, he became one of the weakest bosses—forgetting his signature Sunlight Spear. Was that really fitting?

Many bosses players fought were far weaker than their prime combat prowess.

How could that be acceptable?

If players couldn’t defeat these powerful enemies in their prime, wouldn’t that leave a lasting regret?

Even if players now held slightly biased opinions toward him, Chen Xu, as a conscientious designer who always prioritized the perfect player experience, absolutely could not tolerate such regrets.

Of course, this new mode would need to be released some time after the game’s official version launched.

………………

Returning from Galaxy Tech, Chen Xu reviewed the development progress of *Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame*.

With the combat system from the previous game already refined, the rest of the development wasn’t particularly difficult.

Most of the scenes were nearly complete.

When Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, and Yang Xin saw the map, they were all astonished.

A massive seamless map, yet the player’s journey was perfectly segmented.

Different areas were intricately connected, and players would need to explore to discover the brilliance of its design.

Players would continue playing, only to suddenly realize—"Hey, I’m back here again!"

Then they’d take another path, play for a while, and go—"Ah! I’m back here again!"

After all, as everyone knows, Undead can’t climb walls, pull doors, or jump.

The map was brilliant, no doubt.

But what chilled Qin Yi and the others the most was the monster distribution after the map was finalized.

"Mr. Chen, the Firelink Shrine leads directly into late-game areas! Shouldn't we leave an in-game message or lock it somehow?" Qin Yi asked, placing monsters as instructed by Chen Xu, visibly shaken.

It wasn’t just the advanced areas near Firelink Shrine—the newbie village, Undead Burg Outskirts, was already a nightmare!

"No need. It's not like players would listen even if we left a message. And lock it? How could we possibly lock it?"

"Not only is the story designed this way, but locking it would imply what? Teaching players how to play? Depriving them of their freedom to choose?"

"As a highly conscientious and responsible game designer, how could I possibly do something like that?"

Chen Xu spoke righteously indignant, sipping tea as he sat in his chair.

Qin Yi silently stared at the development content on the monitor, holding back for a long time before uttering not a single word.

Because… it really made perfect sense!

Two updates for now, two more before evening, and the rest tonight.
