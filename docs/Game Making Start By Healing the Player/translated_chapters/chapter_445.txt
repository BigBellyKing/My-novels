## Chapter 444: A World Where Only Zeus Gets Hurt (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)

In Atari's office, Antorini held an evaluation report in his hand, feeling utterly content.

This time, although he felt the launch of 'Element World' was somewhat rushed, everything that needed to be done had been completed. Additionally, the pre-release media reviews were quite favorable.

While there was a slight gap compared to 'Uncharted,' it was only by 0.1 to 0.2 points. From this perspective, the two games were practically neck and neck.

This evaluation report also boosted the confidence of both Atari and Zeus. Promotions were in full swing across the board.

On major streaming and video platforms, many streamers had already started live broadcasts of 'Element World.' After all, 'Uncharted' was a linear game, and after this long, most players had already experienced it.

Though there was the more challenging 'Tragic' difficulty and the achievement of collecting all treasures on the map, aside from trophy and achievement hunters, most players wouldn't replay it since the main content remained the same.

Moreover, this time 'Element World' had launched a 'sword-hunting' event, which captivated many players. Although there were only four slots available, the hype it generated was substantial.

As the saying goes, 'What if I’m the one who solves the puzzle?' With the launch of 'Element World,' online players were eagerly discussing it.

………………

At Nebula Games, Chen Xu was reviewing the footage provided by Ruan Ningxue—a classic 'Drake Deception' scene featuring the plane sequence, which was just as iconic as the chase and train sequences in the series.

Even the plane scene in 'Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation' from his previous life had drawn inspiration from this moment in 'Uncharted.'

"This looks good," Chen Xu nodded, approving it.

Currently, the team was primarily focused on two tasks: the development of the three DLCs for 'Uncharted' and the construction of the Nebula Games Platform on VR.

Previously, due to the limited number of games, this hadn’t been a priority. But now, with classic games being ported to the Huanyu VR Platform, they needed to speed up the process.

Earlier, themed VR experiences in Nebula Games had interconnected transitions with custom animations. For example, in the 'Monster Hunter: World' VR theme, players would ride a cart before the screen faded to black.

The 'Dark Souls' transition was simpler—sitting by a bonfire before teleporting.

Meanwhile, 'Outlast’s' VR theme was the most emotionally intense and immersive of all. Imagine walking through a dark catacomb only for a large man to grab and throw you to the ground.

Not just that, 'Outlast’s' VR theme was also the most varied, featuring characters like the finger-cutting Doc, the agile-tongued Andrew, and chainsaw-wielding Frank.

It had everything, truly showcasing Nebula Games' conscientiousness. And even more generously, 'Outlast’s' theme was given away for free during holidays, ensuring every Nebula Games player with Huanyu VR could 'return' to Mount Massive Asylum like it was home.

All these VR themes would eventually converge, allowing players to access various games from a single theme without needing to switch environments.

This wasn’t overly complicated but did require some time to implement.

"By the way, Mr. Chen, what do you think of 'Element World'? The online media reviews seem very high!" Yang Xin asked during lunch break.

'Element World' had been generating significant buzz these past two days, almost rivaling the hype of 'Uncharted.'

"It’s a great game. The subsequent media and player reviews will likely stay high, but I doubt Zeus will be satisfied," Chen Xu mused after some thought.

He had already tried the game via Zeus’ gaming pod. Though marketed as open-world, Chen Xu felt it leaned more toward the 'Shenmue'-style sandbox gameplay, with most content confined to various ruins, focusing heavily on Puzzle Solving and exploration.

"Huh?" Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, Qin Yi, and others looked at Chen Xu, puzzled.

No one quite understood what he meant by players and media giving high scores while Zeus remained unsatisfied.

Chen Xu didn’t elaborate further, simply smiling and changing the subject.

"With 'Uncharted’s' trilogy DLCs and the Nebula Games Platform nearly wrapped up, everyone should prepare themselves—we might be going on a business trip soon," Chen Xu announced cheerfully.

At this, the team temporarily forgot about his earlier cryptic remark, collectively stunned.

A... business trip? Weren’t they a game company? What kind of business trip?

Chen Xu grinned as he shared the materials assistant Lin Rou had compiled, sending them to everyone’s phones. Opening them, the team was floored—this was a month-long tour of Italy!

Florence, Monteriggioni, San Gimignano, Venice, Rome—not a single iconic location was missed.

"This is mainly to prepare for the development of future games," Chen Xu explained, stretching lazily.

Alas, since Nebula Games had no branch in Italy, the headquarters team had to take matters into their own hands.

………………

While Chen Xu and the team prepared for their 'grueling' art reference trip—having already contacted a major travel agency to streamline logistics—'Element World’s' online buzz continued to grow.

Players never failed to surprise. Just like in 'The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,' where players still managed to speedrun defeating Ganon in 40 minutes despite bug fixes, 'Element World' saw two players complete the 'sword-hunting' Trial on the first day, leaving regular players in awe.

While most were still scratching their heads over ruins, some had already cleared the event. Within two days, the 'sword-hunting' activity concluded, but the hype and positive player feedback remained strong.

"Atari really nailed it this time!"

"The ruin designs are so intricate!"

"Some feel on par with 'Zelda’s' shrines!"

Puzzle enthusiasts showered the game with praise. However, Atari and Zeus soon noticed something odd—the sales figures weren’t matching expectations.

The first-day sales, fueled by promotions and hype, were impressive. But afterward, the growth slowed to a crawl, leaving Zeus and Atari baffled.

Objectively, 'Element World’s' sales were high, but with 'Uncharted' setting the bar, Zeus had expected more. So why weren’t sales climbing?

The answer was simple: the puzzles were too intricate and difficult. While the ruins showcased brilliant Level Design, their brain-burning complexity deterred many players.

Having to rely on guides to progress was a dealbreaker, especially on VR, where checking guides was less convenient than on PC.

Additionally, while marketed as open-world, the areas outside ruins offered little exploration—unlike 'Zelda,' where players could freely enjoy the overworld even without touching shrines.

Need more health? Hearty Durians had you covered. Stamina issues? Try a Stamina Elixir.

'Element World,' however, centered almost entirely on ruin exploration. While puzzle enthusiasts adored it, many others simply didn’t find it fun, no matter how well-crafted it was.

Even Souls-like games had appeal for casual players—whether through veteran assistance, careful first playthroughs, or guides. And since combat relied on player skill, following guides still felt engaging.

But puzzle games? They often felt like puppetry. Following guides here couldn’t replicate the thrill of overcoming challenges oneself, leading to 'Element World’s' sales falling short of Zeus’ hopes.

The gaming industry could be brutally unfair. Critical and player acclaim didn’t always translate to sales, much like how 'The Shawshank Redemption' was a masterpiece yet underperformed at the box office.

Similarly, 'Element World' found itself in this predicament.

Frustrating as it was, Atari and Antorini adjusted well. They hadn’t lost money, and their reputations had soared. For Atari, long criticized in the industry, this was their first taste of universal praise. For Antorini, the high ratings were a personal triumph.

The only one left disgruntled was Zeus.

What good was acclaim if it didn’t boost sales and platform growth? While some puzzle fans might buy Zeus for 'Element World,' it paled in comparison to 'Uncharted’s' impact.

Recalling their investment in 'Element World,' Zeus felt a pang of regret. In this scenario, only Zeus emerged wounded.

A world where only Zeus gets hurt—achieved!
