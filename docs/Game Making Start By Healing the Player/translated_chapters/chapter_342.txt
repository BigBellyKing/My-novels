Chapter 341: Shepherd Must Die! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Countless players were as enraged as Zhang Yi.

Compared to other games, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare perfectly integrated its story, levels, and FPS gameplay, maintaining an impeccable rhythm. Coupled with the game's highly intelligent AI performance, players were subtly drawn into the role of the protagonist.

When the protagonist was surrounded, they would feel worried and tense for them. And at that moment, when in-game teammates offered a helping hand, it deepened the players' impression of these NPCs.

It could be said that from the very beginning of the game, various psychological suggestions were constantly being applied to the players. For example, in the initial teamwork segment of the game, players controlled Joseph Allen, who only survived for three episodes. They would personally experience missions with Shepherd. Moreover, on the battlefield, Shepherd acted with great decisiveness, even saving Joseph Allen's life. In such circumstances, players would subconsciously perceive Shepherd as a very reliable officer.

Subsequently, vivid characters like Soap and Ghost gradually fostered empathy with players, becoming more than just flat NPCs in the game. Instead, they were real flesh-and-blood comrades who could stir their emotions. Although in the interim, Shepherd had done some things that seemed somewhat inappropriate, but thanks to Joseph Allen's level, all players had never doubted this character.

Until that revolver fired a shot into Ghost's and Roach's chests. Unwillingness, anger, despair, and pain filled the hearts of every player. Especially before this, the deeper the players' feelings for Ghost and Roach, the more painful and angry they felt now. Finally, Roach reached out and grabbed Shepherd, that unspoken 'why' also being an element of the players' unwillingness.

On the other hand, Captain Price, who escaped from the abandoned site in Afghanistan, provided answers to all players. It turned out that Shepherd had long since colluded with Makarov. Joseph Allen, the Task Force 141 agent who never understood how his undercover identity was exposed until his death, was betrayed by Shepherd. Shepherd, a Lieutenant General in Task Force 141, Shadow Company, and the Marines, was the mastermind behind it all. Joseph Allen was merely a sacrifice he used to cooperate with Makarov in instigating the war. Including Ghost and Roach, all were his sacrifices. Whether it was Task Force 141 or Makarov, all were his tools.

And this time, it was a plan to kill two birds with one stone. It could both eliminate Task Force 141 and simultaneously provide him with evidence of his collusion with Makarov. This way, no one would know that the war was actually instigated by Shepherd. When it was all over, and he had quelled the war, he would be a true hero. Coupled with his current status, he could become the most powerful person, achieving true widespread support.

A game must have a villain. But Zhang Yi swore he had never been this angry before. Even including the deaths of Gaz and Griggs previously, his sadness outweighed his anger. But now it was completely different. Griggs and Gaz, those bros, died heroically. Because they sacrificed themselves in battle. But Ghost and Roach were different; one was a protagonist controlled by the player, and the other was a trusted comrade. Yet their ultimate fate was betrayal by their own. Undoubtedly, such an ending directly pushed players' rage levels to their peak.

The major game forums were already filled with players' fury. Especially Shepherd's past words were now full of irony. 'We' wouldn't harm civilians? The culprit behind the Russian airport massacre, it could be said, was not just Makarov, but also you, Shepherd! Almost every word he had ever spoken was now so full of irony.

...............

And it wasn't just the players who were angry; Soap and Captain Price in the game were equally furious. However, they weren't having an easy time either. The entire Task Force 141 now existed in name only; without support, battered and bruised, and even framed, Captain Price and Soap had both become wanted criminals.

It was then that Captain Price made a desperate decision: to assassinate Shepherd. Although they didn't know how to turn the tide, nor were they sure if they could survive ignominiously, they still resolved to launch an assassination attempt on Shepherd. Not just for themselves, but also to avenge their fallen comrades. And just as Shepherd himself had once said, since history is written by the victorious survivors, the defeated side naturally leaves nothing behind.

So Captain Price made a bold decision. Adhering to the principle that the enemy of my enemy is my friend, he sought out Makarov to inquire about Shepherd's whereabouts. Captain Price believed the other party would tell him. Because at this very moment, Makarov's situation was also not good.

'Makarov, I know you can hear me. Tell me Shepherd's location, and we'll clean up this mess. Otherwise, you won't last a week.' Captain Price contacted Makarov through one of Makarov's men's walkie-talkie.

Makarov: 'Same goes for you, doesn't it?'

Captain Price: 'You ever heard that old saying? The enemy of my enemy is my friend.'

Makarov: 'Price, that saying cuts both ways. Shepherd is at the H-B base. You know where that is. See you in hell.'

Captain Price: 'I look forward to it. If you get to hell first, say hello to Zakhaev for me.'

Both Makarov and Captain Price understood that their so-called cooperation was only effective at this moment. Subsequently, with Nikolai's help, Captain Price and Soap both escaped. And now, they were going to eliminate the culprit: Shepherd!

No matter what, Shepherd must die!

'We only have one UMP, and they have a vast army. We don't even know if Makarov's intel is accurate.' On Captain Price's plane, Soap said to Captain Price.

'Price? Price?' Soap said, looking at Captain Price sitting at the table.

'A normal man doesn't wake up in the morning and think this will be his last day.'

'But I think it's not a curse, but a luxury. Knowing your time is short is a kind of freedom.'

'Insufficient firepower, not enough men, no other options. It seems we can only go down with him.'

'But this war-torn land will remember us for this battle, because even knowing there's no escape, we still firmly walk this path of no return.'

'We are like a bullet fired, charging forward fearlessly.'

'We are filled with righteous indignation, and we have only one goal... We... must... kill him!' Captain Price said expressionlessly, the past scenes of Roach and Ghost appearing in his memory. Shepherd must die!

'I'll meet you at the extraction point in three hours.' Nikolai said, dropping Captain Price and Soap off at the H-B base in Afghanistan.

But Captain Price cleanly and decisively refused: 'No need, brother. This is a one-way trip.'

Nikolai: 'Then good luck, brothers.'
