Chapter 229: Episode One: Major Events in Minecraft History (Seventh Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)

It wasn't just game industry designers online who were stunned by the sales figures of Minecraft.

Players were equally surprised.

Unbelievably, tens of millions of people worldwide had already played Minecraft?

But soon, surprise gave way to a sense of pride.

The game you love being enjoyed by so many others—how wonderful is that!

Though, of course, this feeling only lasted a moment.

After all, for most players, the number of people playing doesn't really matter. A brief moment of excitement and pride is enough—what more could you possibly expect?

Compared to sales numbers, players were far more interested in the actual content of the game.

Initially, the most-liked videos online were mostly incredible structures built by Master Builders.

While these were impressive at first, with viewers constantly exclaiming 'Others' World,' repeated exposure eventually numbed players to the spectacle.

They'd just watch, shrug, download one from the Workshop, and enjoy it themselves for a quick thrill.

But soon, works from Redstone Masters began to baffle many players.

All sorts of Redstone music and complex Redstone mechanisms.

Some veteran even used sticky pistons and other mechanism components to build a fully functional, moving mech.

Instantly, countless players were left dumbfounded.

At least buildings were comprehensible, but this Redstone stuff—nobody could understand it!

And that was exactly the point. If it were easy to understand, would it still feel awesome?

Then, one day, as many players were casually browsing the official Weibo account or video websites for new content,

a post from the official account quickly went viral, and simultaneously, a video shot to the top of every major video platform's trending chart.

The video's title was simple: 'Episode One: Major Events in Minecraft History'.

Seeing this, many players were taken aback. But the moment they noticed it was published by Nebula Games' official Weibo account, their interest immediately spiked.

Opening the video, they found a progress bar stretching nearly an hour long.

The graphics weren't anything special—just raw in-game footage of Minecraft, without any post-rendering enhancements.

Yet what truly captivated players were the revelations within the game footage.

"January 3rd: Minecraft launched in early access. On that day, 969,231 players entered the peculiar block world."

"Among them, the player with ID 【ewwqr】 became the first to destroy a block!"

"Night fell. Dangerous creatures like zombies and skeletons began to appear. How would the defenseless Steve survive this crisis? The player with ID 【Master Builder】 became the first to implement the 'dig-three-fill-one' tactic."

"Spending the night in a warm bed—player ID 【Nǐ Shuō Má Ne】 became the first to survive the night in a bed rather than hiding in a cave."

………………

"February 1st: Minecraft officially launched. On that day, player count surpassed 3 million. To date, over 37 million players have entered the world of Minecraft."

"On average, each player has destroyed 418,941 blocks and built 231,236 blocks. The player who destroyed the most blocks is 【Explosion Is Art】, totaling 2,820,910. The player who built the most blocks is 【Sandwich Candy】, with a total of 892,031."

"Redstone technology—a unique system in Minecraft—possesses a mysterious power. Player ID 【Dad, I Want To Be A Scientist】 became the first to use Redstone technology to create a minecart with rails. He also became the first to compose Redstone music using a music box."

"February 5th: The first player-made MOD, 【Duplex Villa】, was published on the Workshop. Its creator, player ID 【Construction Master】, made gaming history."

"February 19th: The first player-created mini-game MOD, 【Tank Battle Against Evil Monsters】, launched on the Workshop and achieved 2 million downloads on its release day. Its creator, player ID 【Do You Believe In Light?】, sparked a new era of community content."

………………

"Next: Memorable moments from various servers."

"War has never ceased, from ancient times to the Contemporary Era. Where there are people, there is a community. The first PVP war erupted on Server No. 17."

"To date, over 6 million players have participated in combat, with over 31 million structures destroyed in-game."

"Players on Server No. 1611 are the most fervent warmongers. With an average of 121 deaths per player, they currently hold the highest mortality rate. The server's factions are now locked in a three-way power struggle."

"Players on Server No. 1211 are also highly combative. Since launch, countless players have engaged in chaotic battles. Unlike Server 1611, Server 1211 is currently in a 'Warring States' era, with every guild fighting independently."

"Server No. 2147 also hosts conflicts, but a group of players have remained neutral. They formed the 【Merchant Alliance】, farming, raising them like livestock, and constructing buildings to trade for gold, redstone, diamonds, and coal."

"Meanwhile, on Server No. 2147, the warring guilds remained completely unaware. Thanks to their resource supply, the 【Merchant Alliance】 rapidly advanced in Tech. While rival guilds were still fighting with iron swords, armor, and Bow and Arrows, the Merchant Alliance had already developed the game's first firearm weapon. As the guilds continued their chaotic battles, the Merchant Alliance fired the first shot in network mode—announcing to all other factions on Server 2147: 'Times Have Changed!'"

"Players on Server No. 111, while not on a peaceful server, deeply value peace. This server has the lowest average player death count, with each player dying only 7 times on average. Reports suggest they aim to build the game's first city in the sky. We sincerely wish them success in this pioneering feat."

"Players on Server No. 3511 are also peace-loving. The largest guild there, 【Cave Dwellers】, differs from Server 111's players—they appear to be attempting to construct an underground city deep beneath the surface. To date, over 3,000 players on this server have become victims, burned to death by lava."

………………

For a full hour, the video detailed various pioneering feats in Minecraft, revealing a fundamental truth to countless players: You never know how players will choose to play the game.

Take a female character, for example. Many might wonder if she's attractive.

But who could have predicted that some players would specifically adjust their camera angle, hoping to catch a glimpse of something special?

Minecraft is no different.

Despite numerous videos already showcasing the game's unique Gameplay,

Chen Xu's video still left countless players dumbfounded.
