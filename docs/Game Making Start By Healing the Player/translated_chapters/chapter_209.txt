Chapter 208: The Game Is a Test Version, So of Course the House I Built Is Too! (Seventh Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)


Inside the office, only Chen Xu and Qin Yi remained. Chen Xu closed the initial DEMO of Minecraft, then opened the previously prepared Design concept document.

This section covered the Crafting and tech system in Minecraft.

Thanks to the technology from the Parallel World, content that had been difficult to implement in his previous life could now be resolved.

These features were directly integrated into the base game rather than being added through MODs as a shortcut.

For example, just like Redstone technology, various materials and tools could be combined into components and control units, paired with corresponding model shells, allowing them to function within the game.

The most intuitive manifestation in the game was the ability to truly build vehicles—not just using redstone to power Minecart tracks.

"But Mr. Chen, isn't this too complicated? Can players actually handle this part?"

"And even just the basic components and control units seem limited. This redstone tech system feels way too complex," Qin Yi said, scratching his head.

Just looking at it made him feel to the point of numbness.

"Don't underestimate players. Their capabilities are far greater than you imagine," Chen Xu said with a slight smile.

"Besides, I'm not planning to dump everything on players all at once. We're developing this setting in advance, but the first version released to players won't include it yet," Chen Xu explained.

Rich content was one thing, but you couldn't throw it all at players at once, as if desperate to show them how rich the content was.

It was like playing a game where, right from the start, you wanted to complete all the side quests, but when you opened the map, the developers showed you countless question marks—so many they were impossible to count.

This created an odd form of discouragement—trying to tell players "our game is full of content," only to scare them away.

Moreover, for Minecraft, the game's success didn't rely solely on official content updates. It was the countless passionate players who collectively shaped the community environment, creating its unique miracle and glory.

So for Chen Xu, future promotion and content reveals would serve more as inspiration—showing players what was possible, encouraging them to experiment.

Prepare the raw materials—Sand, cement, rebar.

As for what kind of Structure they could ultimately build?

That depended entirely on the players themselves.

Whether it was mod systems extending these functions, or the existing game content.

After all, 'Creative (mode)' was the core of Minecraft.

………………


The development of Minecraft was progressing very smoothly. The game's content posed no real challenges—after all, in his previous life, it had been independently developed by a single person, so production was effortless.

For Chen Xu, the main difficulty lay in how to make it easier and more open for players to create MODs.

Through continuous testing, even this hurdle was gradually being overcome.

By late November, the core content of Minecraft was mostly complete—though it was still far from a finished product.

Chen Xu was now discussing with Zhang Yida's Operations team what promotional strategy should be used for Minecraft's release.

Unlike Don't Starve, Minecraft held a strategic position on par with Dark Souls.

However, this was still in the discussion phase. It would be some time before final decisions were made and promotion began.

In the office, Chen Xu checked the time, shut down his computer, and walked out.

He arrived at the rest area, where a group of people had gathered around, experiencing Minecraft.

Currently in development, the company's employees were serving as testers.


"Haha, Sister Xin, is this your house? Haha!"

Ruan Ningxue burst into laughter from within the crowd.

Qin Yi, Lin Tao, and others joined in with hearty laughter. The atmosphere was lively and cheerful.

"Haha, Sister Xin, you're incredible!"

"I don't respect walls, but I respect you, Sister Xin!"

Hearing the commotion, Chen Xu walked over for a look.

On Yang Xin's computer screen was a wooden house—a massive cube from a distance. Most strikingly, it was airtight, with only a single wooden door at the entrance, flanked by torches for lighting.

Stepping inside revealed a rustic log-decorated interior, harmonizing well with nature.

The interior layout clearly followed a minimalist style.

A crafting table, a storage chest, and a bed placed in the corner—nothing else.

Well, not quite. On both side walls, four torches were mounted, fully embracing the energy-saving and emission-reducing initiative.

Yang Xin, who had initially felt quite satisfied with her house, stepped out upon hearing everyone's comments.

She circled it twice, scrutinizing it carefully. Suddenly, she felt a bit uneasy.

The more she looked, the more it resembled a matchbox house.

Paired with the torches, it even evoked the atmosphere of a prison darkroom.

The appearance was indeed rather awkward.

Although she felt this way inside, on the surface, she remained calm.

"It's a house under construction—how good could it possibly look? It's just like when we make games. The version I'm playing right now is still an unfinished test build. Naturally, my house is a test version too!" Yang Xin declared, forcing a logical argument under everyone's gaze.

Then, sensing her reasoning might lack credibility, she continued: "Honestly, my house isn't that bad. It doesn't leak in the rain, doesn't let wind in during winter. It might look a bit shabby, but it's sturdy and durable."

Watching Yang Xin still defending herself, Chen Xu, who had stayed silent, finally couldn't hold back: "To be fair, the test version of the game shouldn't have to take the blame for this! This blame is way too dark."

"Originally, I planned for all of us to build some structures later to showcase unique game features and guide players. But looking at this, I think you'll have a hard time carrying that task."

Chen Xu's original plan had been for team members to collaboratively build classic structures and character sculptures.

For instance, iconic buildings from Dark Souls, like the Firelink Shrine—distinctive landmarks.

Although Chen Xu could later create a special building tool to automate most of the work, many details would still require manual adjustments.

These builds would then serve as promotional material for the game.

But now, seeing Yang Xin's prison-like Conduit, Chen Xu felt they could probably minus one from the list of employees participating in the construction project.

"Ahem, so Mr. Chen, when are we launching the game?" 

Hearing Chen Xu's comment, Yang Xin swiftly closed the game on her screen, clicked 'Don't Save,' and quickly changed the subject, her eyes still lingering on the dark room displayed moments ago.

"There's still some content to add, but we're almost there. Unlike previous releases, we'll conduct a small-scale test after New Year's Day, mainly to gather player feedback and identify any flaws affecting gameplay that need rectification," Chen Xu replied after some thought.
