Chapter 165: It's Not Impossible... But At Least It Shouldn't Be (Seventh Update, Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)

After passing through the basement door that represented a new cycle of reincarnation, Li Yue fell silent, looking at the scene before him.

The corridor was still the same corridor, but one thing had changed.

Originally, although the corridor lights were dim, one could at least see some things.

But now, except for a single light at the entrance, all the lights further down had been extinguished.

"Is this the price I pay for taking the flashlight?"

Li Yue looked down at the flashlight in his hand, then at the dark corridor ahead, and discreetly swallowed a mouthful of saliva.

The radio, which had been silent until now, once again emitted sounds, broadcasting the news of the initial family massacre.

The sound was intermittent, accompanied by static, and together with the dark scene, it became even more eerie.

"It's nothing, just the scene got a bit darker." Moving forward cautiously, Li Yue softly comforted himself.

Moving inch by inch, there seemed to be nothing else besides the noisy static from the radio.

Except that the sound of his footsteps seemed a little different.

But Li Yue didn't think too much at this moment; instead, he softly recited the core socialist values, hoping to dispel the fear in his heart.

Reaching the corner of the corridor, Li Yue breathed a slight sigh of relief, his taut nerves relaxing a little.

Because there was still light next to the radio ahead.

Though it was a bit dim.

He glanced at the bathroom door; it was tightly shut.

Li Yue tried to twist the handle but couldn't open it.

And there were no more sounds of a baby crying or a female ghost whimpering.

Approaching the radio, he noticed something different on the table. On what was originally the homeowner's wedding photo, a large 'X' was marked over the woman's figure.

A line of text was written above it: Dig it out!

Seeing this, Li Yue reached out and touched the wedding photo on the table. When his finger touched the woman's right eye in the photo, that part of the picture was directly dug out.

Looking at the photo, which now lacked an eye, leaving a black hole, and was still smiling, Li Yue discreetly swallowed a mouthful of saliva. The scene was simply too eerie.

Just as he was about to continue forward, the radio, which had been playing static, suddenly became clear.

'Don't touch that phone dial, we're about to begin!'

'Also, you cannot trust the tap water.'

After these two sentences, the radio's content reverted to static.

Don't touch the phone dial, can't trust the tap water!?

Speaking of the phone, wasn't there one on that cabinet in the corner earlier?

Why can't I touch it?

Hearing that sentence from the radio, Li Yue instinctively turned his head to glance at the phone behind him.

But with that turn, he understood why he couldn't touch it.

The moment he turned his head, a pale shadow instantly pressed close to him.

At the same time, the game camera shook violently, and then a bloodless face 'stuck' itself to his. This time, he finally saw the true appearance of the female ghost he had 'longed for.'

With a ghastly pale complexion, her right eye was an empty socket, clearly, the eyeball had been cruelly gouged out. Her left eye was almost three-quarters covered by the whites, suggesting she had suffered inhumane abuse similar to suffocation during her life. Pus-like liquid oozed from her mouth full of yellow teeth.

The two were almost face-to-face, and this sudden impact, combined with the accumulated tension and suppressed fear, erupted all at once.

"Aaaaaaaah——!!!!"

In that instant, Li Yue's vocal cords endured too much.

At the same time, the screen before Li Yue instantly plunged into darkness.

He knew that the gaming pod had cut him off from the game's visuals.

As for whether it was the staff who cut him off or if the gaming pod's self-protection was triggered, it no longer mattered.

What mattered was that he was finally free!

As the gaming pod was immediately opened, Li Yue emerged, stumbling slightly the moment he stepped out.

The nearby staff quickly helped steady him.

"I'm fine, my legs are just a bit wobbly," Li Yue panted.

"Take a moment, it's just a game, relax your breathing," the staff member soothed Li Yue.

Meanwhile, Tao Fa and Ye Xun, who had no idea what Li Yue had just experienced in the test, exchanged glances, both feeling a little intimidated.

They were well aware of Li Yue's capabilities.

What on earth could have scared him like this!?

"Let me just recover for a bit, I really can't take much more," Li Yue said, looking at the surrounding crowd and the spacious room, even feeling an urge to cry.

Heaven knew how much psychological pressure that cramped environment in the game had put on him.

Then he glanced at the time on the wall-mounted clock and was utterly stunned.

20 minutes!?

That experience, which felt like years in the game, had only lasted twenty minutes!?

"Li Yue, what aspects and factors in this DEMO test made you feel uncomfortable?"

At this point, a staff member walked over and asked routinely, as usual.

Listening to the staff member, Li Yue, who was still adjusting his mindset, involuntarily recalled his recent experience in the game. After a moment of hesitation, he said, "I... I felt uncomfortable everywhere."

Staff member: ????????

Looking at the bewildered expression on the staff member's face, Li Yue, sitting in the chair, felt a little helpless.

Because this was his genuine experience.

The realistic visual feedback, combined with the detailed audio and scene lighting, along with the oppressive rhythm of the game, made him feel truly uncomfortable in every way.

Listening to Li Yue, the staff member wrote "Pending" in a small notebook, then turned to Tao Fa and Ye Xun, saying, "Next, who wants to test first?"

Hearing the staff member, Tao Fa and Ye Xun exchanged glances. With the tacit understanding of colleagues, they both raised their hands simultaneously.

Rock, paper, scissors!

..................

As they used the most traditional method to decide who would be the second to test `Silent Hill PT`.

In the brightly lit hall, a group of industry game designers sat, the large screen now turned off.

Many designers didn't look well; some were even a little pale.

Everyone cast strange glances at Chen Xu, who sat calmly beside them.

Heaven knew what they had experienced in those twenty minutes!

They had originally thought themselves well-informed, having seen every kind of horror game imaginable.

But `Silent Hill PT`, this simple DEMO, had undeniably stunned them.

So many people, and they were only watching, not even playing. More importantly, it wasn't 3D or VR, just a simple big screen.

Yet, even so, the atmosphere in the game still startled some people.

"Mr. Chen, how long is this DEMO's flow, and how much was just shown? What's the proportion of horror content?" Meng Zuo asked a question that concerned many designers present.

"About one-third of the content, I suppose. Although it's a DEMO, the gameplay and content are actually quite complete. The puzzle elements are a bit whimsical; it's hard to get through without playing it several times and studying it carefully."

"As for the horror content, that 'turn-around jump scare' is just an appetizer. I didn't insert many jump scare elements into this DEMO, and the 'turn-around jump scare' isn't the core. It really focuses on building atmosphere around the story and game environment. There are still several key points later on, as this is mainly to provide the Game Department with a test of VR equipment functionality for future improvements," Chen Xu explained with a smile.

Hearing Chen Xu's words and recalling the scene just witnessed, everyone fell silent.

And this was just an appetizer?

After holding it in for a long time, Meng Zuo finally took a deep breath and earnestly told Chen Xu, "Mr. Chen, as game developers, it's not that we can't be down-to-earth, but being down-to-earth shouldn't extend all the way to the Underworld!"
