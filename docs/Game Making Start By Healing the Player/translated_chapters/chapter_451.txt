Chapter 450: The Second Promotional Video (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Compared to Zeus's exasperated state, Chen Xu was relatively relaxed.

Of course, this referred to his mood, as he still had a lot of work on his hands.

Aside from the Uncharted trilogy team and the team responsible for routine game maintenance, all the remaining personnel had been reassigned by Chen Xu to the development of Assassin's Creed.

Compared to the Assassin's Creed 2 of his previous life, Chen Xu was determined to make the entire world in the VR version even more immersive.

In the original version, the NPC pedestrians in the game were truly just spectators. As an Assassin, you might dispatch a Templar Knight on the street, piercing their kidney with a sword. Yet, the surrounding passersby would continue with their own affairs, serving merely as atmosphere setters, failing to make players feel like they were in a lifelike world.

So, it was natural to incorporate some new dynamic reactions.

As for actions like those in Red Dead Redemption, where players could shoot anyone they disliked on the road or tie them up and throw them onto a horse – such 'Western outlaw' moves could not be implemented in Assassin's Creed.

This was perfectly resolved by the Animus setting. Players didn't truly travel to the past; they merely recalled the memories of their ancestors. Therefore, players couldn't commit actions that contradicted their ancestors' memories. Randomly killing people on the streets would clearly be inconsistent with memory, and doing so would lead to desynchronization, or even complete loss of synchronization.

Introducing the Animus setting, along with such rules in the game and the immersive VR experience, would instead enhance players' sense of immersion.

The remaining tasks included implementing more refined guidance settings, such as fast travel. Many Assassin's Creed 2 players in his previous life were completely unaware of the fast travel feature in the game, and spent their days running back and forth between Florence and the large manor.

More vibrant city presentations and an improved action system were also among the planned changes.

………………

After releasing information about the Animus and a simple background introduction, Nebula Games went silent regarding development updates.

However, on the Huanyu VR Platform, the Animus received one or two minor updates later on. These weren't major content releases, but rather enhancements to enrich some of the spatial elements, as this would serve as the VR theme entrance for Assassin's Creed in the future.

After the initial period of excitement, many players came back to their senses. They realized that their current understanding of Chen Xu's new game was still largely limited to its background.

Apart from Animus-related information, they only knew that players might embody an Assassin fighting an organization called the Templar Knights. Everything else, such as the game's name, gameplay type, etc., remained completely unknown. Even the historical era was unclear, and the various rumors circulating online were merely player speculations.

After all, Nebula Games had yet to make any official announcements.

Many players were curious about what type of game Chen Xu intended to create this time. Moreover, Assassins and Templar Knights had never been heard of in history, suggesting it might be an alternate history. But the crucial point was, wasn't the essence of historical themes to immerse players? If it were alternate history, there would be no need to make a history-themed game, nor would it be necessary to include an Animus setting.

Many players were very curious about how Nebula Games would proceed. However, after the Animus and its promotional video, Nebula Games once again entered a motionless state.

Many players left messages on Chen Xu's official Weibo account, hoping to 'bomb' him into revealing more news. But their efforts sank like a stone into the sea.

There was nothing Chen Xu could do. Looking at the players' various requests in Nebula Games, he sighed helplessly. It wasn't that he didn't want to give the players more news; it was primarily because there wasn't any.

The second promotional video was still in production. The art assets from the entire team were piecemeal, though the action system was progressing relatively quickly. For instance, the climbing and parkour aspects could largely adapt Uncharted's system, requiring only more optimization and the addition of cool moves. As for combat, while it wasn't an issue for Nebula Games, the framework was still being set up and tested.

In such circumstances, the only message Chen Xu could convey to players was: 'Don't worry, everyone, the game is being made. When has Brother Xu ever lied to you?'

But if he were to respond that way, Chen Xu would be worried about the players' health, as excessive excitement isn't good for the body.

So, for now, playing dead regarding player inquiries was the best option. Besides, the animation department was nearing completion of the second CG.

By then, players would have all the answers they sought.

………………

Unlike Chen Xu, who was playing dead, Zeus, feeling indignant about having its popularity stolen, made continuous small moves.

Various pieces of information, related concept art, the first announcement of the game project's name, and several promotional videos revealing game content and gameplay all attracted considerable player attention, simultaneously overshadowing some of Assassin's Creed's popularity.

While Zeus might be playing around, it wasn't a traditional game developer; it actually had close ties and significant shares in most European and American industry game developers. Its recent acquisition, FOW, as a first-party studio, already had a large following, and the graphics issues many players had criticized seemed to have been resolved after Zeus's acquisition.

This new FOW game was called Medieval: Deliverance, but it wasn't a war simulation or management game. According to FOW's promotional trailer, it was a role-playing game where players would take on the role of a peasant's son, persecuted by war. Having lost his home and family, he fights for his future and participates in the historical Crusades. FOW also stated that Medieval: Deliverance would be a highly detailed game, covering combat, daily life, and a faithful recreation of medieval history. For example, they claimed to have meticulously collected data for in-game castles, incorporating historical and academic verification.

It could be said that Medieval: Deliverance boasts a very high level of historical accuracy. The combat system, in-game daily details, and more were gradually revealed by FOW, making many players eager. It genuinely looked promising, especially the combat system, which seemed highly realistic, allowing attacks from various directions – truly cool.

However, just as FOW and Zeus were celebrating, news arrived.

Nebula Games had released its second promotional trailer.

“The second promotional video is here!”

“Holy cow, awesome! Finally, actual game footage!”

“It really is the Renaissance era!”

“Assassin's Creed is the game's name?”
