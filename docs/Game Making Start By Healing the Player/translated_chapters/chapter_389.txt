Chapter 388: Not Making Money When You Can Is a Crime! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

While Chen Xu and his team were developing Super Mario Odyssey and Animal Forest, and porting older games, some major movements in the gaming industry diverted the popularity that Nebula Games had gained in handheld consoles.

After the New Year, a host of game developers, led by TengHua, NetDragon, and atrai from abroad, all began promoting their new games. Both domestic and international developers tacitly adopted one phrase for their game promotions: open world.

Sci-Fi, Urban, Fantasy; FPS, ARPG, ACT; no matter the theme, no matter the type. Everyone's external promotion started with 'open world.' And the focus of the promotion was basically divided into two points: large maps and many quests.

Clearly, these game developers had observed the performance of Red Dead Redemption, which truly achieved both fame and fortune. Similarly, all the game developers were fiercely competing in their promotions, practically splattering their brains out. There was no other way, as players were indeed enthusiastic about open-world games. But the key was that so many blockbusters suddenly appeared at once. This situation was becoming somewhat unfavorable.

Especially with domestic NetDragon and TengHua, who already had a reputation, and were also launching new titles on the Huanyu VR Platform. It could be said that these two companies went all out on their promotion. NetDragon was developing an FPS open-world game, where players act as an elite special forces team fighting drug cartels in a vast, foreign land. TengHua, on the other hand, was developing a veteran ACT game. This was an old series that had been on the decline, with its main gameplay being hack-and-slash. This time, they also wanted to innovate by leveraging the open-world gimmick. Whether it would be fun was still unknown, but at least in terms of promotional hype, NetDragon and TengHua had gone all out.

While these two companies fought tooth and nail, Chen Xu remained leisurely. 'Let them fight,' he thought. Nebula Games had no immediate VR plans anyway. Moreover, the first version of the Switch prototype was already out. Compared to his previous life, most of the technology in this Parallel World was readily available. Especially the HD rumble, Chen Xu simply tested it with a DEMO. For instance, when falling from a height onto surfaces like water, gravel, dirt, metal, or concrete, the vibration from the voice coil motor provided excellent feedback. It felt similar to the DualSense controller from his previous life. Besides this, Chen Xu also had Yan Xiong keep a close eye on the details. At the very least, he wanted to avoid the infamous Switch drift issue from his previous life, where joysticks started drifting within two months of players getting their hands on them, forcing them to pour WD-40 inside. Controllers are consumables; they can't last forever without wear, but the critical point was the excessively high damage rate of the Joy-Cons in his previous life. Of course, this was also related to Nintendo's usual cost-saving on materials, as Nintendo's quality control has always been a meme, leading to jokes like, 'If quality control improves, how will they make money from hardware?'

The prototype in front of him was entirely black, including both the controllers and the console body. This was different from the classic red and blue colors of his previous life. Of course, the color wasn't an issue; they could even make a rainbow color scheme if they wanted. The overall design was not much different from his previous life, but the details had undergone multiple revisions during this period, as the technology in the Parallel World differed from his previous life. The most intuitive point was that it was more robust, and the previously criticized large black bezels of the Switch had also been improved. In addition, the Bluetooth adaptation that was added to the Switch system later in his previous life was now directly integrated, along with a built-in voice system. Players could directly use voice commands in tablet mode.

Next were the game cartridges. Before this, Chen Xu had considered whether to still include the cartridge setting. After all, in the Parallel World, digital games were mainstream, and physical games were primarily for collection. However, during discussions with Yan Xiong, Chen Xu discovered that the cost of cartridges in the Parallel World was not high, which led him to decide to retain the cartridge setting. Of course, just like in his previous life, cartridges would still include a bittering agent, partly for safety and partly as a promotional gimmick. He detached the Switch controllers from the console, then placed them back into the dock to switch to console mode. Although there were no compatible games yet, some test function DEMOs had been specifically created. It could be said that it was already very refined.

“Mr. Chen, how is it?”

“Some minor details can be adjusted further, but overall, there are no major issues,” Chen Xu nodded and said.

“Also, Mr. Chen, the cartridge samples have also been produced,” Yan Xiong said to Chen Xu. The cartridges were not produced by them but were outsourced, with iQue responsible for quality control verification. Relevant patents and branding had already been applied for. All that remained was to finalize the specifications and begin production.

“Furthermore, it’s not just the Switch and cartridges; don't forget that we can also make screen protectors, protective cases, and subsequent controllers, including docks and other merchandise,” Chen Xu told Yan Xiong.

“Ah!?” Yan Xiong paused, surprised by Chen Xu’s words.

“The Switch screen is touch-sensitive, so wouldn’t players buy a screen protector?”

“And protective cases, just like phone cases. As a portable handheld console, wouldn’t the Switch need a case?”

“Also, while the Joy-Con controllers are excellent, that doesn’t mean players don’t need a standard controller.”

“And there are carrying cases for the Switch. Just because the console isn't profitable doesn't mean other areas can’t generate income.”

“Of course, set the prices well, don’t make them too expensive. Don’t end up just having an official name with no cost-effectiveness,” Chen Xu instructed Yan Xiong.

Once the Switch handheld console was released, most of these accessories would be needed by players. If players needed them, they certainly had to make them. Not making money when you can, that’s a crime!

..................

Days progressed, nearing May. The main topic online remained the two new titles from NetDragon and TengHua. There were no other new releases during this period.

However, the version updates for Red Dead Redemption and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare managed to make their presence felt during this time. For many players, the event they anticipated was the annual gameplay Expo at the end of May.

It could be said that this year's expo was quite anticipated by many players. The recent promotional war between NetDragon and TengHua guaranteed a fierce competition between the two companies at the expo. However, at this very moment, a piece of unofficial news began to circulate: Nebula Games would also participate in this expo. And at the expo, they would announce news about a new handheld console and new games.

This immediately captured the attention of all players, industry designers, and developers.
