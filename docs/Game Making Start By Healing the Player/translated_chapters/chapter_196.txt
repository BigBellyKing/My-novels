Chapter 195: Sandbox Games and Core Points (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

The content development for Don't Starve wasn't particularly difficult.

After all, it's a small-scale game.

The art and music aspects were being produced in an orderly fashion.

The more tedious aspect, surprisingly, was creating better MOD development tools for players.

For a game to have a large number of MODs, besides the game itself being fun,

the game's own support for MODs is also a very crucial factor.

During Don't Starve's development, the popularity of Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame in the outside world was still steadily climbing.

After achieving nearly 5.5 million global sales in its first month, Dark Souls' performance in the second month remained very strong, with domestic sales dropping to 1.1 million copies and overseas sales to 1.3 million copies, but still cumulatively adding 2.4 million copies.

Meanwhile, during this period, the 'Death Mode' finally saw its first BOSS defeated by players.

It wasn't a BOSS from Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame, but rather 'Yhorm the Giant' from the previous game.

It retained the characteristic where the Storm Ruler could inflict significant damage upon it.

Most veteran Dark Souls players successively teamed up to defeat it.

Finally, 19 days after the new mode launched, three relatively well-known Dark Souls masters from overseas teamed up to achieve the first kill. Interestingly, less than 10 minutes after the first kill, the speedrun record for Yhorm the Giant was broken by a domestic Dark Souls strategy group, improving the time by about 15 seconds.

This became a popular topic among many Dark Souls players, inevitably leading to a debate: was the team that achieved the first kill stronger, or was the strategy group that broke the speedrun record, even if they were a step behind, more impressive?

However, it was clear that both strategy teams were somewhat unconvinced by the other, each believing themselves to be the strongest.

The next day, the overseas team that achieved the first kill once again broke their original time.

And the domestic strategy group, after two days of attempts, also managed to overtake them.

No other BOSSes died; only Yhorm the Giant suffered.

Regarding games like Dark Souls, although there was no need to modify the game's numerical design and content, the remaining task was for Lin Tao's independently established project team to slowly produce DLC content. However, it also involved online multiplayer and the feature allowing players to leave in-game messages.

Therefore, just like games such as Fall Guys, Overcooked, and Sanguosha, there was a dedicated operations team continuously managing it.

Of course, as the player count gradually decreased, it would merge with other games, allowing a single team to handle its operation and maintenance.

But Chen Xu's focus had clearly shifted away from Dark Souls.

Inside the project room, Chen Xu was discussing some content for Don't Starve with Ruan Ningxue and Qin Yi.

“The entire game revolves around survival; that's the big core. But through this big core, it can be divided into different small demands.”

“For example, the protagonist in the game has settings for hunger value, health value, and sanity value. Combined with the surrounding environment and encounters, these values will decrease. Any value reaching zero will cause the player to die, which means failing the survival requirement.”

“So, under the larger survival requirement, players will then begin to have more goals stemming from these branching settings.”

Chen Xu explained Don't Starve's core settings to everyone.

These settings were all the reasons why Chen Xu chose Don't Starve as a trial run for sandbox games.

As for Don't Starve's story itself, let's not mention it for now.

All of its settings had very clear goals.

Even for players completely unfamiliar with sandbox-type games, they wouldn't be bewildered after entering the game.

At the very least, they would understand one thing: the game's character must survive; survival is the only core.

Keep them well-fed and warmly clothed, and perhaps add some recreational activities to improve the character's morale.

And centered around these, players would then actively explore, thus understanding what kind of gameplay sandbox-type games offered.

“It sounds really interesting!” Yang Xin said, nodding as she listened to Chen Xu dissect the game's core points.

“Although it's just a small-scale game, it feels like there's a very high degree of freedom within it!” Qin Yi, who specialized in Numerical Design and Level Design, had the most direct feeling.

“Indeed, I feel like playing online with friends would be a lot of fun,” Ruan Ningxue echoed.

“But the game is about letting players survive day by day. What if one day, the home base that players painstakingly built is suddenly burned to ashes by a big fire, or they just die? Then hours, dozens of hours, even hundreds of hours of effort...” At this point, Yang Xin thought of a possibility.

Hearing Yang Xin's words, everyone subconsciously looked at Chen Xu, who was sitting there.

Let alone experiencing it personally, just thinking about it sends shivers down one's spine!

This feeling is like grinding in Dark Souls for countless hours without using a Trainer, genuinely building a super well-rounded character with all your items collected, but then a sudden misfortune strikes: your save file is gone!

How desperate, how broken, how heartbroken would that player be then?

“Cough, cough... don't look at me like that. I already said this isn't a suffering game. It's not like 'Getting Over It,' where there's no save feature; players can save the game and back up their save files at any time,” Chen Xu said, lightly coughing as he saw everyone's expressions.

“Also, I have to criticize you all. It's one thing if players don't understand my original intention, but how can you think I make games just to watch players suffer?” Chen Xu said speechlessly.

“Alright, next, according to my plan, after Don't Starve is completed, we still have another game to produce and launch before the new year. Don't Starve is more of a market probe, and after its completion, we'll also implement new content updates, and open up and guide players in creating Workshop content.”

“So, around mid-September, try to complete Don't Starve, and then launch it on the platform.”

“Understood.” Qin Yi nodded.

“A little over a month should be enough time to develop Don't Starve, but quality still comes first,” Chen Xu said, looking at Qin Yi.

...................

After chatting with Qin Yi and his team for a while about the development approach for Don't Starve,

Chen Xu also called Zhang Yida into his office.

It was different from previous games like Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame and It Takes Two.

The launch and operation of Don't Starve would be different from before.

Although it was a small game, Chen Xu was prepared to invest some promotional resources. For this, he needed Zhang Yida to create a plan according to his requirements.
