Chapter 847: Luckily, Mr. Chen, you became a Game Designer; otherwise, society would be so much more dangerous

Online, there's been an endless stream of plot analysis posts for "Elden Ring." Regarding the storyline, while it's as obscure as ever, it's also relatively clear.

It doesn't have the Riddler-like characteristic of "Dark Souls" and "Bloodborne," where everything seems to make sense no matter how you explain it.

The main reason for this is that "Elden Ring," as an open-world game, contains too much content.

If it were to maintain that fully Riddler-like characteristic, players would probably be completely bewildered after one playthrough.

Aside from knowing they like Ranni, they would know virtually nothing. Of course, it's not much better now, either.

After all, for many players of Souls-like games, sometimes they don't even care about the story; they don't read the text or listen to dialogue. They just grab a sword and hack away. As long as there's a health bar above their head and the name is red, 'damn it, I'll smash you to bits!'

If one path doesn't work, they note down what crucial items are needed, then turn to another path to hack. If they find it, they come back and continue; if not, they look up a guide.

However, this is also a joy of playing games. After all, games are meant to bring joy to players, and no one says that playing without following the story isn't fun.

But for players encountering a Souls game for the first time, who don't look at guides or the story, experiencing "Elden Ring" still means enduring the purest suffering.

In Nebula Games' office, Chen Xu chuckled as he looked at the compiled data.

"The Tree Sentinel and Margit the Fell Omen are just too much! More players died to these two BOSSes than to Malenia and the Elden Beast combined!"

Looking at the BOSS kill list in the data, Chen Xu couldn't help but sigh with emotion.

"After all, they are the first open-world BOSS and the first main story BOSS that players encounter, right?" Yang Xin said from beside him.

Although, in terms of the game's difficulty curve, Malenia and the Elden Beast are arguably the hardest BOSSes in the game, by the later stages, players have generally adapted to the combat system, leveled up, and brought powerful Spirit Ashes, such as Black Knife Tiche and the Mimic Tear Mimic Tear.

Coupled with the emergence of various guides and combinations of weapon arts and equipment builds, the game's difficulty was significantly reduced.

Meanwhile, Margit the Fell Omen and the Tree Sentinel, although both appear as elite mobs in the late game, were still very challenging for the naive Tarnished who had just entered the Lands Between.

Of course, another reason for fewer player deaths to the Elden Beast and Malenia is that Malenia is not a mandatory story BOSS, and while the Elden Beast is the final BOSS, many Tarnished might have already perished midway through.

Much like "Silent Hill," "Outlast," and "Resident Evil," players might have been discouraged in a bathroom, at the gates of Mount Massive Asylum, or on the road outside a farm.

"Mr. Chen, you're still talking!" Yang Xin looked speechless.

Why did this situation occur? Mr. Chen, don't you have even a little bit of self-awareness?

"Isn't it all to make players feel happy? Look how happy the Tarnished in 'Elden Ring' are?" Chen Xu said with a laugh.

Listening to Chen Xu, Yang Xin smacked her lips.

Whether the players were happy or not, she didn't know.

But judging by the past two days' events, Mr. Chen, you certainly seemed very happy.

"By the way, how are the subsequent random mode and arena mode coming along?" Chen Xu turned his gaze towards Qin Yi.

Setting aside players who particularly love Souls-like games, "Elden Ring," like previous Souls games, doesn't really necessitate multiple playthroughs (NG+2, NG+3) beyond seeing different endings.

Because in terms of difficulty, NG+2 and NG+3 often feel like a true hack-and-slash experience early on, due to retained levels and equipment, and the monster stat increases not keeping pace with the player's inherited power. High NG+ playthroughs, however, are another story.

Similar to previous "Dark Souls" titles, Chen Xu also planned to add content to "Elden Ring" to enrich the player experience, such as a BOSS rush arena similar to "Sekiro" and a more entertainment-focused random mode.

As an open-world game, this type of mode can be quite compatible, offering enough room for error and expansion.

"No big problem, it's already in testing," Qin Yi nodded.

This part wasn't difficult to implement, as all assets were already finished. The only things to watch out for were potential bugs and ensuring important story items were properly placed.

After all, to reach certain areas in "Elden Ring," if one doesn't consider unconventional 'cheese' routes, specific items are required.

Similarly, various side quests in the game also require particular items.

If this part were truly randomized, players would probably be completely broken.

"Also, Meng Zuo, you're to establish a new department to negotiate with major domestic and international game developers about licensing their well-known IP characters," Chen Xu instructed Meng Zuo.

"IP character licensing?" Meng Zuo looked bewildered.

Even Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and Qin Yi beside him were equally puzzled.

Unlike other game developers who latch onto a single IP and milk it dry, Nebula Games, while having its own series and crossovers, primarily focused on internal collaborations.

It could be said that unlike other game companies that *need* IPs, Nebula Games didn't require external IPs at all. So why were they discussing this now?

Besides, who doesn't guard their famous IPs fiercely?

Only some second or third-tier game companies might license out their IPs.

"No rush, this is a long-term plan. I'll personally talk with top-tier game developers like FOW and Atari when the time comes. For now, it's just about making initial contact and expressing interest," Chen Xu explained with a smile.

"Does it relate to the next game?" Ruan Ningxue asked curiously.

After all, it couldn't be just to buy licenses for fun, could it?

"I have an idea, but the time isn't right yet, and I haven't thought it through deeply. Anyway, if we can buy them, let's buy them first," Chen Xu nodded.

"Ah, this..."

Qin Yi and Meng Zuo exchanged subtle glances, thinking how incredibly whimsical this was.

Perhaps no game designer at any company would say, 'I haven't decided what to make, and I don't have a detailed plan, but let's buy what we might need first.'

But on second thought, Nebula Games currently had no shortage of cash reserves. If they really wanted to buy something, why not? As long as those game developers were selling, couldn't Nebula Games afford it?

In the office, Chen Xu chatted with a few people about some non-work matters. Suddenly, Yang Xin's phone on the desk vibrated. She picked it up and let out a surprised sound.

An international news alert was displayed on the screen:

[Lloyds Bank in London's Marylebone District was robbed. Five armed assailants, using firearms and grenades, held bank employees hostage and completed the heist in just 10 minutes. The bank's losses are currently unknown, no personnel were injured or killed, and local police are in hot pursuit.]

"My goodness!" Yang Xin exclaimed after reading the news.

After all, this wasn't just any place that was robbed; it was a bank! And not just a small local bank, either.

"A rather professional group of robbers!" Chen Xu, also reading the news, couldn't help but sigh.

"Mr. Chen, how do you know they're professional?" Ruan Ningxue asked with some curiosity.

"Yeah! Mr. Chen, how can you tell?" Yang Xin was equally curious.

It was the same news, so how could he discern their professionalism?

"Does that even need to be said? First, there's the time. If the news report hasn't exaggerated or concealed any information, 10 minutes from entering the bank to robbing and leaving with the stolen money means this group of robbers is very organized. Either they've scouted the bank's layout beforehand, or they have accurate intelligence on when the bank holds money."

"They have a complete plan for how to rob, and how to escape."

"Also, keep an eye on the follow-up. I estimate it won't be long before these criminals are apprehended," Chen Xu said with a smile.

"Huh... Mr. Chen, didn't you say they were professional?" Yang Xin was a bit confused.

"This professionalism is relative. If it were twenty years ago, or even earlier, it would indeed be very professional. But you have to remember that society is advancing, technology is advancing, yet these robbers' criminal methods haven't. "

"I'm sure the bank's surveillance won't yield much information, but the key lies with their loot."

"You should know that most banks put measures on their banknotes. Dyed banknotes are the most basic. Furthermore, some banknotes will have tracking chips embedded. The best method would be to fold each wad of cash. If it feels as hard as an envelope, discard it immediately."

"But obviously, ten minutes from robbery to escape isn't enough time for them to do that."

"Secondly, banks of Lloyds Bank's caliber will add trackers to the magnetic codes of banknotes, which can be activated or deactivated at any time. Even the cable ties that secure each wad of cash have a purpose; they are fireproof and very difficult to cut, so even if they are flushed down the toilet, they will become crucial clues for solving the case."

"Besides these, there are many more details. I don't believe these robbers could have been seamless in 10 minutes, with every defensive measure and tool so perfectly prepared."

"So, do you understand? Times are advancing, and being a robber isn't as easy as it used to be."

Chen Xu smiled, taking a sip of tea from his cup.

Looking at the smile on Chen Xu's face, Ruan Ning and the others on the sofa couldn't utter a word for a long time.

"Mr. Chen, luckily you became a globally renowned Game Designer, otherwise, how dangerous would society be..." Yang Xin smacked her lips and joked.

"So, perfect crimes are almost impossible now," Meng Zuo also remarked with emotion.

"Well, not necessarily. If the robbers had a four-dimensional pocket and could pull out detectors, thermite probes, and so on from their butts like magic, then it could still be done." Chen Xu shrugged and smiled, a flash of inspiration hitting his mind.
