As the new escort titles were being developed, the new generation VR gaming pods had also been delivered internally to Nebula Games.

Chen Xu wasn't overly concerned about the development of the new games.

For the current team members, none of the three games would pose much of a problem.

Compared to his previous life, besides adapting to the VR gaming pod, the main points were to implement some minor optimizations and enrich their content.

For instance, with a game like Fate Seeker, if it were to be a VR open world, the map would certainly need to be greatly expanded.

Furthermore, the content and events within it would also need to be much richer, in addition to various seemingly everyday tasks.

Almost every village and small town had a plethora of quests, and they were all of the hidden quest type, requiring players to use their brains to complete them.

From the perspective of background and theme, such a design didn't actually pose a big problem, as wuxia, besides fighting and killing, also involved many such seemingly trivial matters in daily life.

However, for players, it might seem interesting at first, but after doing it a few times, unless they were quest fanatics or achievement fanatics, most would find it boring.

The main reason was that the rewards for these quests were too much of a chicken rib. Spending a lot of effort to complete a quest only to receive a trash reward was incredibly annoying.

Therefore, for Chen Xu, the new games were more about adapting to the new generation VR gaming pod and constructing the game scenes.

As for actions, the game Persona was considered the simplest.

Because apart from conventional actions like grappling hooks, running, and climbing, the rest didn't require specialized adaptation; only animation processing was needed, as it was a turn-based game after all.

Thus, Persona was also considered the game with the fastest development progress in the team.

Next was the wuxia game Fate Seeker. Compared to his previous life, to enrich the open world content, Chen Xu also had the team add many collectible elements. At the same time, including the original real estate development gameplay, Chen Xu also had the team turn it into an industry management mini-game.

Players could acquire businesses in rural towns and start making money. Of course, along the way, there would definitely be competitors causing sabotage, leading to a management-oriented quest gameplay line. Deductive reasoning and solving cases, along with the jianghu fighting and killing, would essentially form the core framework of this game.

...

On March 1st, a brand new VR gaming pod was delivered to Nebula Games' headquarters.

Inside the project office, a group of people gathered around the gaming pod with curious expressions.

Everyone had essentially played with the development prototype for a while.

But no one had yet seen the gaming pod as a genuine product.

Compared to the original gaming pod, this new generation gaming pod was larger in volume and also included a brand new feature: smell simulation.

It comprised three parts: a smell simulator, a smell module, and smell simulation software. It could simulate the scent of a virtual environment by releasing odor molecules, with the fastest release at 0.05 milliseconds and scent switching within 5 milliseconds.

For different VR games, to simulate various scents, one only needed to embed them into the corresponding geometric bodies.

For example, if the smell of fire was a dispersing particle state, then these would be embedded into the in-game fire, and the scent concentration increased.

However, currently, there weren't many supported types of scents, and it didn't support complex scents, only some more distinctive ones.

For example, garbage, gunpowder, rotting, blood, and so on. Of course, these would definitely differ from real-life, and the concentration would surely just be a token gesture. After all, you can't have players suddenly dry heaving and vomiting in the middle of a game, right?

However, this feature was quite a good match for Fate Seeker, and there could be many more potential applications in scene investigation.

Because the original version was a God's-eye view mode, making it into a VR version would definitely require it to become first-person and third-person, so clue gathering would need to be re-planned.

When a realistic mode is added, players will also have a greater sense of immersion.

In normal mode, the protagonist's dialogue and system markers within the game would directly serve as guidance.

However, in realistic mode, this scent would become the best guidance.

Many games could also leverage the smell feature effectively.

Chen Xu explained each of the various features of the new generation gaming pod to everyone.

But everyone's expressions were very subtle.

“Mr. Chen, what you’re saying makes a lot of sense, and it really does provide a strong sense of immersion, but I don’t think players will like it very much.” Qin Yi held back for a long time before finally unable to resist speaking.

Just think about it, what kind of games does Nebula Games develop?!

All sorts of Maggot-ridden Wretches and Curse Frogs in Elden Ring!

Wretches and snake bundles in Bloodborne!

And Hollows and rotting corpses in Dark Souls!

The VR visual impact alone was already intense enough; now introducing a sense of smell? Are they trying to kill the players?

“Ahem… isn't this just an analogy? And why can't you think of the good aspects? The intimate interactions between Rex and Pyra and Mythra in Xenoblade Chronicles, between Cloud and Tifa in Final Fantasy, and between Yennefer and the White Wolf in The Witcher: Wild Hunt.”

“Just imagine, if Yennefer’s scent of lilac and gooseberries could be experienced in the game, how thrilled would players be? And then, ghoul and rotting smells wouldn’t be unbearable, right?”

Listening to Chen Xu’s words, everyone’s expressions subtly shifted again.

It seemed… as if… it wasn't impossible!

“Alright, who wants to try it out? It’s a good chance to test the content of the new games and their compatibility with the new generation gaming pod, to see if there are any areas that need improvement,” Chen Xu said to the group.

He himself had already experienced it in the Game Department, so he had a rough idea in mind.

However, for Yang Xin, Qin Yi, and the others, the new generation was still completely unfamiliar; they could only infer from the performance and data of the development prototype.

Their understanding of the new games’ interactive experience was not deep enough.

For a game, not just the content but also the player’s actual operational experience is very important.

“I will! I will!” Yang Xin quickly raised her hand, wanting to be the first person within Nebula Games to try something new.

“Alright, I choose you!” Chen Xu smiled, then had Qin Yi and the others write the new game’s data into the gaming pod.

Filled with novelty, Yang Xin lay down in the gaming pod. The dedicated privacy shield closed, and simultaneously, the large screen connected to the gaming pod displayed the scene Yang Xin was seeing.

It was a glittering casino, bustling with activity. Countless well-dressed men and women at slot machines, Texas Hold'em, and dice tables were squandering their chips in high-stakes gambling. At the entrances to some passageways, security guards in suits and sunglasses maintained the casino's order.

However, it wasn't a realistic scene, but rather a style akin to Xenoblade Chronicles.
