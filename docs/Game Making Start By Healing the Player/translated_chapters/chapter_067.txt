## Chapter 67: First Impressions

The third day of the Lunar New Year, inside a gaming enthusiasts' group chat.

"Any good game recommendations, everyone?"

"*Overcooked*! It launched today! I've been eyeing it for a while—Nebula Games Platform has a buy-one-get-one-free deal. I'm looking for someone to play with. I'll buy the game, you bring yourself!"

"Isn't that a couple's game?"

"Who says couple's games are only for couples? Can't two real men play it too?"

"Fair point."

"How much is this game anyway?"

"55 yuan—it's not expensive, and if you buy it on Chen Xu's Nebula Games Platform, it's buy one, get one free."

"By the way, where's Old Zhang? Want to join us!"

The group, full of gaming enthusiasts, was buzzing with chatter about what games to play recently.

At that moment, the person called Old Zhang replied in the chat: "Hmm... I'd love to play with you all, but... sorry, I'm in a relationship now."

A wave of dot-dot-dot ellipses flooded the chat, followed by a barrage of memes.

Ignoring the group's chatter, Old Zhang got up from the sofa, stretched his limbs, and sat down in front of his computer.

Old Zhang's real name was Zhang Yi. Although his gaming buddies called him Old Zhang, he wasn't actually old—only twenty-five years old.

Watching the group discuss *Overcooked*, Zhang Yi felt a flicker of curiosity.

"Let me see... this game actually looks pretty decent! Wait... it's made by the designer of *Outlast*? That's quite a shift from the grim to the cheerful!"

Seeing *Overcooked*'s extremely Q-style cute store interface, Zhang Yi couldn't help but look surprised.

A massive poster displayed the game's title, *Overcooked*, spelled out with various ingredients.

Below it stood a giant food truck.

Atop the truck stood a group of cartoon characters wearing chef hats—
a little crocodile, a little squirrel, a Doggo, and cartoon versions of a boy and a girl.

These tiny chefs held kitchen tools—knives, rolling pins, frying pans—looking incredibly adorable.

Seeing the *Overcooked* promotional poster, Zhang Yi couldn't help but sigh with emotion.

The cartoon art style made every character in *Overcooked* extremely, incredibly cute.

"What game is this? So cute!" Wang Han, Zhang Yi's girlfriend, had just stepped out of the bedroom and noticed what he was looking at. She asked curiously.

She played games from time to time, though not as passionately as hardcore gamers.

But the art style of this game on the screen did catch her attention.

The Q-style cute characters looked like something out of a fairy tale, giving off a warm, cozy feeling.

"*Overcooked*—it's the new game by the same designer who made *Outlast*, and it was specifically released on Valentine's Day," Zhang Yi explained.

They had both played *Outlast* together before.

Like most ordinary players, they hadn't paid much attention to the game's designer back then.

Only now, seeing *Overcooked*, did Zhang Yi realize that this designer, Chen Xu, had actually developed several games—all of which he had played.

"This was made by the *Outlast* designer?" Just like Zhang Yi earlier, Wang Han was surprised.

"Yep, and this same designer also made *To the Moon* and *Undertale*. Quite different vibes, right?" Zhang Yi chuckled.

"*To the Moon* and *Undertale* were also made by him?" Wang Han exclaimed in shock.

"Then let's buy it and try it? This game seems pretty interesting," she suggested.

"Heh heh, that's exactly what I was thinking," Zhang Yi grinned. He searched for Nebula Games Platform in his browser, downloaded it, registered two accounts, added each other as friends, scanned the QR code to pay, and then sent the gifted copy to the other account.

Unlike some players, he didn't care much about which platform.

As long as the game content wasn't censored or cut,

for him, the rule was simple—buy it on whichever platform offers the better price.

He had bought *Outlast* on Nebula Games Platform before.

Now with a buy-one-get-one-free deal, there was no reason not to go with Nebula Games Platform again.

Although the game supported split-screen co-op on a single PC,

since they lived together and both loved gaming, they each had their own computer.

After downloading and logging in, the game installed quickly—it wasn't large.

Launching the game, they skipped the Nebula Games company Logo, and a line of text appeared on the black screen: *The following content is based on real events—only names, locations, and vegetables have been altered...*

Then came a cutscene: a stormy night over a castle, thunder rumbling, large raindrops pouring from the sky.

【After Tea Time...】

'Finally, the moment I've been waiting for! After overcoming countless challenges for the Gourmet Grand Prize!'

'Behold, Kevin! The legendary Delicious Necronomicon!'

As the Onion King muttered to himself, he began his necro-culinary art experiment.

Terrifying cooking spells created hordes of zombie bread, flooding toward the castle!

To defend against the zombie bread, players must cook enough dishes to satisfy these monsters.

"As expected, story isn't the focus in this kind of game!" Zhang Yi sighed with emotion.

"The Onion King perfectly embodies the saying: if you don't do stupid things, you won't die stupidly!" Wang Han chimed in beside him.

They exchanged a playful grumble, then shared a laugh.

Following the simple intro, the game entered the Tutorial Level.

It was very straightforward—WASD to move, Space to interact, Ctrl to chop.

Standard control schemes found in most games. Though neither Zhang Yi nor Wang Han were gaming experts,

they had played enough games to pick it up immediately.

They quickly understood the gameplay.

In short: cook meals—select ingredients, chop them, some may need frying or boiling, then plate and serve.

Certain dishes required combining different ingredients.

The victory conditions were simple too.

In Campaign Mode, the highest perfect score was three stars.

Within a time limit, each dish served earned a tip. Once the total income reached a target, the corresponding star rating was awarded.

The rules were incredibly easy to grasp.

And if all levels were completed with a three-star rating, the game would unlock a hidden four-star rating—though that was far beyond the reach of ordinary players.

"Got it! So easy!"

"This actually feels really fun!"

"If cooking in real life were this convenient, that'd be amazing."

"Feels like it'd be even more fun with multiplayer. Let's clear the campaign first, then try online matches against other players!"

Zhang Yi and Wang Han divided roles—one handling plating and serving, the other chopping ingredients—and breezed through the first tutorial level.

Seeing the three-star perfect score screen, both wore wide, joyful smiles.

Before playing, because of *Outlast* and the initial zombie bread plot—which did have a somewhat grim vibe—they'd been a bit wary.

But after just a quick try, it turned out to be genuinely fun!

Especially cooking together, serving dishes side by side.

It brought back childhood memories of playing house.

That nostalgic warmth, paired with the gameplay, made the entire experience even cozier and more delightful!

Looking at the post-level score screen, Zhang Yi and Wang Han both wore bright, happy grins.
