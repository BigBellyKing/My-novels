Chapter 313: Give Them a Huge Surprise! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Valkyrie, the defender who continuously observes information via cameras, excitedly called out the position as she saw Song Ren and his team approaching the door: "They're here, they're here! Same team composition as the previous round—still all five of them staying at the back side!"

Song Ren, who had only destroyed the camera on the streetlight, completely failed to notice a pitch-black prototype object tucked away in the corner of the staircase.

This spot was extremely inconspicuous—easily missed if not paying close attention.

And because the defenders knew that scanning enemies would reveal their presence, Valkyrie didn’t activate her scanning ability this time. She didn’t even use a normal ping—instead, she verbally described their positions.

Valkyrie felt like she was about to make a huge contribution this round!

Valkyrie’s Skill allows her to throw cameras that can freely rotate. Earlier, she had placed one near the staircase in the Central Kitchen.

Now, she focused on the staircase behind the warehouse.

She had the sudden idea to remove the door, but at first, a red invisible wall appeared, preventing her from throwing the camera—wasting one, which she had to destroy herself.

But when the match officially began, she discovered she could now throw the camera out—after which she re-barricaded the door.

She felt this was absolutely seamless. And judging from the attackers’ reactions, they indeed hadn’t noticed anything suspicious!

Meanwhile, Song Ren’s team remained extremely cautious, as they had no idea whether the breaching had been heard by the defenders.

IQ had already retracted his scanner, since using it restricted him to only a pistol.

Among the entire team, only Sledge and Song Ren had long-range weapons—making the two of them critical firepower output points in the game.

"The door’s barricaded? Joey, it’s up to you now! Get ready at your positions—once Sledge breaches, Greatshield and Flash Shield charge out instantly, and then Flash Shield deploys the flash!"

"Swift and fast! Show off the professionalism of our Rainbow Counter-Terrorism Squad!" Song Ren emphasized briefly, before Sledge breached the door.

With a *click sound*, the wooden barricade shattered instantly—just as planned.

Greatshield charged out first. But at that very moment, a black object dropped right at their doorway.

Remote bomb!

With a thunderous crash!

Wang Yifan, holding the Greatshield, was unharmed—after all, the shield was incredibly sturdy.

But Wang Han, who emerged second with the Flash Shield, was blown straight back.

Before Song Ren and the others behind could react to what had happened, two more dark remote bombs flew in.

Then—*boom*!

Although one of them accidentally caused only a single explosion instead of two due to a defender’s mistake—and even killed a teammate by accident—the confined space, combined with Zhang Yi’s team charging recklessly forward, meant they had no time to stop once they realized what was happening.

Amidst the explosions,

Zhang Yi, Song Ren, and Joey—following behind—were all blasted into the air.

Only Wang Yifan remained, still holding his shield in stunned disbelief, retreating into a corner trembling.

At that moment, the opposing Recruit chuckled and pulled out a dark block seemingly from nowhere, tossing it right above his head.

The remote bomb landed perfectly on the ground—followed by a button detonation.

Another thunderous crash.

The shield remained strong—but the person behind it was far more fragile.

"What the hell?! Why so many bombs?!" Song Ren was completely numb.

"Damn it! Is this counter-terrorism game seriously this realistic!?" Zhang Yi was stunned.

"This train formation tactic… is underperforming!" Wang Han said, slightly depressed.

Outside the internet cafe, the ordinary players watching were all thoroughly amused.

They found it even more entertaining than watching streamers play live.

The entertainment value was simply off the charts.

"Hahaha, I'm impressed! Can this game really be played like this? Five operators all carrying remote bombs!?"

"Let’s be honest—this is what a real counter-terrorism game should be like, right? Terrorist personnel are a bunch of insane and depraved individuals. Isn’t it logical in real-world terms for each of them to have a remote bomb?"

"But I feel like information and map understanding are incredibly important in this game. The train formation guys could’ve easily sent a remote-controlled drone behind the door first to scout, and only advanced once they confirmed it was safe."

"Exactly! The defenders used Valkyrie to spot their position and set up a trap in advance, just waiting for them to walk right into it."

"This game feels like instant death on sight. Marksmanship might help, but compared to other FPS games where gunplay is king, here you can lock down a position purely through information gathering and map knowledge."

"Right! Operator skills also matter a lot. Without Valkyrie’s camera spotting their early集结, they might’ve ambushed one, but once the attackers pushed into the larger Training Room, the outcome would’ve been uncertain."

Compared to Song Ren’s team who were actively playing, the spectators at the internet cafe—unable to play themselves and only able to observe—gained a deeper appreciation for the unique core of *Rainbow Six Siege* through the God’s-eye view.

"Ahem, it was just a fluke," Song Ren coughed. "Next round is a defense map. I think defending should be a bit easier."

Although they had already lost two rounds and were now at match point,

It wasn’t over yet—there was still hope.

"Strongly expressing doubt!" Zhang Yi voiced his skepticism.

"Seconded!" Wang Han quickly followed, aligning with Zhang Yi.

"Let’s switch positions this round!" Song Ren quickly changed the subject.

The map remained the Chicago Mansion. Previously, the area had been around the underground Garage.

Now, the bomb sites were on the second floor—Kids' Bedroom and the Workshop across from it.

"Which operators?" Zhang Yi sighed, asking.

After all, they were already two points behind. The only kills they’d gotten were from Zhang Yi’s early *thump-thump-thump*, followed by Song Ren finishing off another.

In the previous round, the enemy had died, but it was their own teammate who got the kill.

And now that red triangle was still glowing.

"Everyone play to their strengths!" After two consecutive failures with the train formation tactic, Song Ren was starting to feel lost.

Entering the game, the team began to feel the difference between defending and attacking.

Many corridors could be boarded up with planks, and certain plaster walls could be reinforced with armor plates.

"This feels kind of like renovating! We defenders are the industrious renovators, and the attackers are the demolition team," Joey chuckled, struck by the thought.

"Don’t talk—just keep renovating! Though honestly, the enemy seems lost too. They haven’t found the bomb after all this time," Zhang Yi said, covering every wall in the Kids' Bedroom with steel plates.

He even replaced all three wooden windows with Castle’s reinforced panels.

"Damn, this Kids' Bedroom feels practically invincible now!"

Only then did Song Ren notice what made the Kids' Bedroom so special.

Every wall was armored with steel plates, and the windows were covered with bulletproof reinforced panels—truly an ironclad fortress.

Not even a fly could get through.

"Of course! My barricades aren’t supposed to be weak, right?" Zhang Yi grinned.

"I’ve got a bold idea! What if all five of us stay in here?" Song Ren proposed suddenly.

"All crouch inside? Not defend the other site at all?" Zhang Yi questioned.

"Let’s just abandon it this round. Let’s take the wind out of their sails—last round pissed me off too much!" Wang Han chimed in, still furious from the previous loss.

"Give them a surprise—five guns aimed right at them as soon as they open the door!" Wang Yifan chuckled.

"I’ve already set up cameras in the room. And Sister Han… look what I’ve got in my hand!" Joey, who had picked Valkyrie this round, pulled out a dark remote bomb from his pocket.

"It’s settled then! Stay professional—Wang Han, Joey, you two crawl to the front. The three of us will crouch behind. Strike a pose and give them a huge surprise!"
