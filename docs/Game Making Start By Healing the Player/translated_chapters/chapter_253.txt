Chapter 252: The Players' Strong Demand (Sixth update, please subscribe)

Staring at the prompt in front of him, Zhang Yi then watched as the game automatically exited and returned to the initial UI interface.

Zhang Yi was completely bewildered.

Just when the game was getting exciting, it ended?

Although it was just a demo version, it was way too short!

Zhang Yi was utterly speechless. This abrupt ending was way too much!

The story wasn't such a big deal.

Honestly, so far, Zhang Yi hadn't paid much attention to the story of Monster Hunter: World.

So far, he only knew a few things: Elder Dragons were migrating, the Hunter's Guild had come to investigate the secrets behind it, and while a research team arrived every ten years, it had already been fifty years since the protagonist's team arrived.

The Research Team Leader was the grandson of the Commander-in-Chief, who remained in the New World.

As for anything else?

He had no idea.

But the key point was that the first half of the trial content was mostly about teaching players the game mechanics and systems.

Such as combat, collecting materials, hunting methods, and weapon introductions.

After players understood these, they naturally wanted to go out and hunt themselves.

And that's exactly what the game allowed.

Small Jagras, Crown-crested Dragon, and Great Jagras—three different battles in a row, even including a BOSS battle.

In fact, this trial version offered a very complete experience.

But the problem was—it was just too fun!

Especially in combat, the game wasn't very difficult, making it easy for every player to get the hang of things.

At the same time, since players had just started, they weren't yet familiar with weapon skills or combo attacks.

After battling the Great Jagras, many players felt they had gained a deeper understanding of their chosen weapon.

They were eager to challenge a new monster and test their abilities.

But now!?

The key point was gone!?

Before long, voices from Song Ren, Wang Han, and others began appearing in the voice channel.

"Man, it's already over? I haven't had enough yet! I've only used Helm Breaker a few times with my Long Sword!" Song Ren said, clearly depressed.

"Yeah! It's way too short. I haven't even figured out my Hammer yet!" Wang Han added, equally frustrated.

"Yeah, yeah!" Wang Yifan and Joey echoed in agreement.

They all shared the same feeling: just as the fun was starting, it suddenly ended.

………………

While Zhang Yi and the others were discussing,

the community forum for Monster Hunter: World was already swarmed by frustrated players.

There was no helping it—it was just too painful.

The game got cut off right at the most exciting moment.

Who could possibly handle that!?

Countless players were @-mentioning Chen Xu's official Weibo account and Nebula Games' community, all expressing the same message.

They hoped Monster Hunter: World could launch early. After all, judging from the demo version, the content was already quite complete.

And if the game weren't finished, could such a big title really undergo any transformative changes in just one week between the demo and the official launch?

So the answer was simple: Monster Hunter: World had already been completed.

Although players kept sending petitions, many of them were well aware the launch date definitely wouldn't change.

They were just venting their frustration.

Thus, the wave of excitement caused by the demo ending quickly flared up—and quickly died down.

What remained, however, was the discussion about the quality of the Monster Hunter: World demo.

Throughout the hunting process, many players said it was extremely fun and offered a strong sense of immersion.

For example, after getting injured, the Great Jagras wouldn't foolishly continue fighting the player.

Instead, it would flee.

If you weren't careful and let it escape, and hadn't collected enough information before, you'd need to continue investigating the clues it left behind to successfully track it down.

Also, throughout the game, there were many interactive environmental traps.

 

 For instance, in the cave during the first hunt for Small Jagras, there were many Flashfly bugs that looked like fireflies.

As long as you triggered these Flashflies, any monster that directly looked at them would fall into a dazed state.

There were also many plants in the game.

Vines, for example, could entangle monsters, giving players a few seconds of free damage output.

In Monster Hunter: World, every creature had a unique trait.

Just like the game's subtitle "World" suggested,

it gave players a very strong sense of realism.

As if in some universe of a Parallel World, such a real world truly existed.

After killing a monster, its corpse wouldn't disappear instantly but remain in place.

There was also a creature called the Hatebird that would come and eat the corpses.

Of course, players could also capture them.

The New World was filled with various harvestable plants and mineable ores.

The novel worldview, strange creatures, and rich combat system made the game feel incredibly fresh to many players.

The only thing that some players were dissatisfied with was the difficulty.

Each quest had an extremely generous time limit of 50 minutes and allowed three Carting chances due to exhaustion.

But in practice, none of that seemed necessary at all.

As for time, the Great Jagras could generally be taken down within 30 minutes.

As for Carting?

Many players felt it was almost impossible.

With Palico drawing Aggro, carrying so many Potions, and the game offering unique environmental supplies—

like harvesting honey to make Mega Potions, honey fruits growing on vines, and Palico summoning honey bugs to deliver honey fruits—

it felt like dying was an incredibly difficult task.

Many players were left with the feeling: "I hadn't even started taking this seriously, and it's already over."

Because of this, many players left suggestions under Chen Xu's official Weibo account.

"We strongly suggest Mr. Chen increase the difficulty of Monster Hunter: World in the subsequent work."

"Yes! The current difficulty is way too easy!"

"Mr. Chen, don't underestimate us! We've been tempered by Dark Souls—we're fully capable!"

"Exactly right!"

Some casual players also voiced agreement.

Even they felt the game's difficulty was perhaps a bit too low.

In response to these player suggestions, Chen Xu didn't remain silent as he had when players earlier petitioned for an earlier release.

This time, he gave a clear reply.

"Everyone, please rest assured. The difficulty balance in Monster Hunter: World has been strictly controlled by me and the development team. The difficulty will progress gradually, and as the game content advances, players will unlock new difficulties, including Tempered monsters [beings that have endured countless battles] powered by Nebula Games' latest AI technology. So whether you're a regular player or someone seeking hardcore challenges, we believe you'll find satisfaction in the New World."

After Chen Xu's post, many players were very satisfied.

But within Nebula Games, Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, and others looked at Chen Xu with slightly different expressions.

Technically, his statement contained no lies.

But the Tempered monsters and the so-called gradual progression probably had a slight deviation from what the players imagined.

Watching the joyful players online, Qin Yi and the others couldn't help but sigh with emotion.
