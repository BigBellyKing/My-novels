Chapter 49: I'm a Tough Guy! What Do I Have to Fear!

Listening to the rustling wind sound in his headphones, Sun Yixie glanced at the asylum in the distance on the screen.

Sun Yixie fell silent for a moment.

‘Before I start playing this game, I wanna ask everyone—if… I mean, *if*—I say I'm having second thoughts, can I just not play?’

‘Alright then… can I just turn on the lights first? Don’t rush me.’

With that, Sun Yixie stood up, leaned forward, and with a soft *click*, pressed the light switch.

In the next moment, the camera revealed a cluttered little room now illuminated by the sudden light.

Immediately, bullet comments flooded the live stream room.

‘????????? Cowardly, perverted Sun Yixie!’

‘Wasn’t it supposed to be as easy as breathing to play a horror game?’

‘He’s already turning on the lights? Already scared?’

‘23333333, Brother Sun, if you really can’t handle it, let’s wait for Brother Huang to come back and play together. At least you’ll have company.’

‘233333, “as easy as breathing”—then why did Brother Sun turn on the lights?’

‘Turn off the lights! Turn off the lights!’

‘Turn off the lights! Turn off the lights!’

‘Turn off the lights! Turn off the lights!’

Following Sun Yixie’s action of turning on the lights, the entire screen filled with bullet comments, eventually converging into a single, unified chant:

‘Turn off the lights! Turn off the lights!’

‘The hell with turning off the lights! Why the hell would I turn them off?! Shut up!’

‘I’ll say it one more damn time—horror games are like breathing to me, completely stress-free. Sure, I might get startled once in a while.’

“But it’s only just a tiny bit of tension.”

Seeing the flood of bullet comments, Sun Yixie tried to use off-game banter to ease his own nervousness.

He sat back down, put on his headphones, and officially began the game.

From the game’s earlier instructions, he had already grasped some basic information.

In *Outlast*, he played the role of a defenseless reporter.

Generally speaking, horror games fall into two categories.

The first has a Combat System—players can use firearms or other weapons to kill monsters or bosses.

The second type lacks any combat system at all—players must solve puzzles and flee, avoiding monsters instead.

Currently, the market is dominated by the first type, while the second, though present, is far from mainstream.

At least, there aren’t many Major Productions in that category. The game before him, *Outlast*, clearly qualified as a Major Production within the horror game theme.

Just from the scenes and Atmosphere, Sun Yixie could feel it.

The graphics were certainly not on par with 3A titles—there was a noticeable gap.

But still, they felt remarkably realistic.

And for a horror game, such strong immersion easily made one feel uneasy.

“Damn it, I’m not scared! How could I possibly be scared? Just let me check the operations first, don’t rush me.”

Sun Yixie looked at the secondary monitor, trying to exchange banter with the bullet comments to relieve some pressure.

Inside an unoccupied security booth by the gate, he found a battery.

After searching around the main entrance, Sun Yixie gathered a few items:

A DV camera, one battery, and a blue folder.

“This must be our replacement for a flashlight, right?”

Sun Yixie pulled out the DV camera, inserted the battery, and turned it on.

Seeing the ghastly green的画面, Sun Yixie—being an experienced game streamer who had played many games—immediately grasped the implication of the DV camera’s setting.

He could already guess that later on, there would be dark environments where he’d need to rely on this DV camera to navigate.

Though his words were bold, his heart had already begun to race.

After confirming there was nothing more to explore, Sun Yixie pushed open the heavy iron gate and stepped into the courtyard.

The asylum featured a European-style Structure, utterly silent. Through the windows, he could see lights flickering on and off inside various rooms.

It felt as if a pair of eyes were watching him from one of those lit rooms.

Controlling the protagonist forward along the path, Sun Yixie suddenly stopped.

Because inside Mount Massive Asylum, the lights on one floor suddenly turned on—and a dark figure appeared in the window.

His eyes, previously narrowed to slits, suddenly widened.

Sun Yixie activated the camera’s zoom function, trying to get a closer look at what the figure was.

But as if sensing someone was watching, the figure instantly darted away.

From his perspective, he only caught a blurry shadow.

Then, the room’s lights turned off again.

A chill surged from Sun Yixie’s feet straight up to the top of his head.

Nothing had even happened—no terrifying monsters had appeared.

Yet, his heart was already pounding.

The Mount Massive Asylum before him felt like a monstrous beast with its jaws wide open, waiting for him to step inside.

Moreover, the surrounding layout felt deeply unsettling—especially those security vehicles parked at the entrance, which struck him as particularly odd.

Why would there be security vehicles at the entrance of an asylum?

Approaching the main gate of the asylum, he found it locked and impossible to open.

After wandering around, Sun Yixie finally discovered a small hole in the iron gate to the left, and crawled through.

Next came a series of gameplay tutorials:

Running, jumping, climbing, and crouching—basic actions.

The game’s camera work and attention to detail were extremely precise—something Sun Yixie had never experienced in previous horror games.

Through the headphones, he could clearly hear the protagonist’s breathing heavily.

Following the tutorial prompts, he approached a window, climbed in—and suddenly, all the lights in the room went out.

The room plunged into complete darkness.

At the same time, Sun Yixie, deep in gameplay, was startled by the sudden blackout and flinched.

‘233333, what did I just see?’

‘Haha, Brother Sun actually has eyes!’

‘I’m dying of laughter—Brother Sun totally flinched just now, right?’

‘Brother Sun, if you’re scared, just admit it!’

Seeing Sun Yixie’s reaction, the bullet comments exploded once more.

Compared to regular streams, today’s live stream room had far more comments—clearly, many viewers were also feeling scared, using bullet comments to relieve their own fear.

“D-D-Damn it! What’s there to be scared of?! I’m a tough guy! What do I have to fear?! Nothing at all!”

After activating the DV camera’s night vision mode, the惨绿色 color tone of the画面 made the game’s Atmosphere even more eerie.

Shouting loudly to boost his own courage, Sun Yixie began exploring with the camera in hand.

He pushed open an ajar door and stepped forward.

Suddenly, a TV set that had been turned off powered on by itself, emitting a sharp, piercing noise.

“AAAAAHHH!”

The screech sent Sun Yixie flying.

On camera, Sun Yixie jerked violently in fright. Accompanied by a world-class tenor scream, he kicked the desk, sending his wheeled chair rolling backward, while his hands covered his eyes and his entire body slumped into the chair.

After a few seconds, realizing no further sounds came through the headphones, he slowly parted his hands just enough to peek through a tiny gap, glancing sideways at the computer screen.

The game’s room was pitch black—only the static snow of a TV screen flickered in the darkness.

Once he confirmed there was no further danger, Sun Yixie finally lowered his hands, shifting from covering his face to clutching his chest, breathing a deep sigh of relief.
