## Chapter 87 Who the hell is this pink idiot?

As the game officially began, 60 sugar-bean little figures crazily charged forward.

Because each level had a time limit and a qualification threshold.

Once the number of players or time limit was met, those who hadn't reached the finish line would be eliminated.

So everyone wanted to reach the goal as quickly as possible.

At the same time, this level called 'Door Dash' had a characteristic where a row of doors lined the path forward, and these doors were a mixture of truth and falsehood.

So this was quite a test of luck.

Some players slammed directly into a door, while others successfully found the correct one.

With someone leading the way, players following naturally swarmed like a pack into the already-opened door.

Combined with the game's grabbing function, the scene descended into utter Chaos.

Outside the exhibition, a group of players holding their phones couldn't help but shout out.

'Which Bro, stop pulling me! Stop pulling me!'

'Which Big Bro is this Pineapple Head? You're about to pull my pants off!'

'With so many doors, why are you all rushing into the same spot?'

'Let me pass quickly! Don't block me!'

Countless sugar beans of various colors squeezed together on the field, pushing into one door, terrified of falling behind.

This reminded many players of their own university days.

When they first entered as freshmen, not yet knowing where to order takeout from back entrances or such places, they obediently went to the cafeteria.

Every time the last class ended, students from various buildings swarmed toward the cafeteria like a tidal wave.

The current scene really did seem a bit similar!

Viewers who hadn't been matched into the game or were still standing in front of Nebula Games' Booth were filled with joy.

'Haha, I'm dying of laughter! Just now, a Hot Dog Head Bro was directly squeezed and flew away!'

'Feels so fun!'

'The physics engine makes these sugar beans feel just like springy rubber!'

'Yeah, and that climbing-the-wall action is absolutely hilarious.'

'No more, I want to play myself too.'

'Let's Team Up and play!'

'Feels like Team Up might not be very useful in this game; everyone's relying on their own skills anyway.'

'It's still a bit useful. Later there's a Team mode. Players who survive until then will be grouped together on one side.'

'Really? That's actually pretty good.'

Players at the Nebula Games Booth, watching the Fall Guys graphics on the big screen, couldn't help but feel the urge to open their phones and join a matchmaking game themselves. The sight was simply too tempting!

Meanwhile, at the Booths of surrounding Game developers, many players were drawn by the commotion here and turned their heads to look.

Some even directly found an empty spot at another developer's Booth, then lounged on it and pulled out their phones to start playing Fall Guys, since the Nebula Games Booth was simply too crowded.

This caused the staff members of other game companies to turn dark-faced.

At this moment, the first level of Fall Guys at the Nebula Games area had also entered a white-hot stage.

With fewer than ten slots remaining, the淘汰ation of players was about to be finalized.

"Old Zhang! You rush ahead, I'll hold the others back!" Song Ren, who had successfully matched into this round at the Nebula Games Booth, looked at two Hamburger Head sugar beans beside him and the number representing the final qualifying slot, finally making a decision.

"Let go! Let go! Old Song, you're grabbing me!" When the evil little hand grabbed one of the sugar beans, Zhang Yi, holding his phone beside him, wore a face of utter despair, causing surrounding players to cast curious glances.

Instantly, someone recognized Zhang Yi and Song Ren, since just earlier at the Sanguosha area, the scene of Zhuge Guanxing using 'Create Something from Nothing' was truly unforgettable.

Meanwhile, Chen Xu, who was paying attention to the game, had his camera capture this moment and displayed it perfectly on the big screen.

"Clearly, this was a moment filled with brotherly affection. When there was only one slot left, the teammate wanted to eliminate competitors to help his friend reach the finish line."

"He said with determination: Live on for both of us!"

"Unfortunately, he grabbed his own teammate."

After the level ended and the Score Screen for淘汰ation appeared, the Team Up indicator finally showed up. Chen Xu, noticing that the two were teammates, summarized.

The onlookers burst into laughter as well.

This truly confirmed a saying: It's not scary to have god-like opponents, it's terrifying to have pig teammates!

But many players currently in the game had their eyes suddenly light up.

That move just now seemed to have opened a new door for them!

This sugar bean character might allow a shift in operational thinking!

Beside Song Ren and Zhang Yi, Wang Han stared at the two, completely Speechless.

"You two are really something," Wang Han said, utterly at a loss for words.

Zhang Yi didn't speak, only giving Song Ren a resentful look from the side.

"Bro, my bad!" Song Ren, slightly awkward, took responsibility for the mistake.

As the game progressed.

The现场 at the Nebula Games Booth was filled with various sounds of despair.

Including players who hadn't successfully matched in, they too let go of their inhibitions due to this Atmosphere.

If it were only oneself, in such a crowded setting, it would naturally be very embarrassing to shout out loud.

But when everyone was doing it, the experience became completely different.

Especially when players in the game reached the two special levels, 'Jump Club' and 'Block Party'.

The noise became even louder.

Because in these two levels, players needed to jump to dodge obstacles and a wheel that spun faster and faster, while the available space for movement also shrank continuously.

This gave birth to countless Victims.

Players who discovered unique small tricks would often, when they themselves couldn't avoid falling, extend their evil little hand to grab other players.

Instantly, the sugar beans transformed into Grabbers.

"Awesome!"

"Awesome!"

Beside Wang Han, Song Ren and Zhang Yi had transformed into cheerleaders.

At this moment, Wang Han had narrowly advanced to the final level, a stage called 'Hex-A-Gone'.

To be honest, she was now genuinely a bit nervous.

This level, according to the introduction, wasn't hard to understand.

The floor the player stepped on would disappear, causing them to fall to the next layer.

Excluding the starting position, there were a total of eight layers of floor.

Falling through on the eighth layer would drop the player into the slime below.

Players who fell into the slime would be eliminated.

So the goal was to stay on the floor as long as possible.

Once all other players were eliminated, victory in the game could be obtained.

Simply put, outlast everyone else, and you win.

"I can't stay with other players, otherwise they'll step on my tiles!" Wang Han concluded.

After all, this level fully confirmed a saying: Walk on others' paths and leave them nowhere to go.

But soon, Wang Han discovered a small trick: walking made the path disappear too quickly.

But if she jumped, adding a moment of hang time, couldn't one jump effectively count as two steps?

At this moment, Chen Xu, who was commentating, also noticed this detail.

"This Hot Dog Head sugar bean seems up to no good! Indeed! He's approaching the Pineapple Head sugar bean! The evil little hand is reaching out."

"The two are locked in place, now starting to fall! Oh no, both are eliminated!"

"Now let's look at the other contestants, hmm, this pink sugar bean has some interesting ideas!"

"By using jumps to slow down her falling speed, because there's a moment of hang time during the jump, theoretically she should be much slower than other contestants who are walking."

"It's just that this pink contestant's operations don't seem very familiar, she made a mistake! Took a huge fall and dropped straight to the last layer!"

Chen Xu was commentating.

Over there, Joey, who was beside Wang Han wearing headphones and had just exited the game, happened to hear Chen Xu's commentary.

Combined with the image on the LCD screen of a pink figure jumping and missing, then falling three layers straight into the honey at the bottom, it immediately amused him.

"Haha, this guy in pink is so stupid! Jumping like that! Hey, what are you guys looking at?" Joey was stunned, looking at Song Ren, who was staring up at the exhibition hall ceiling, and Zhang Yi, who was looking down at the floor.

"The stupid guy in pink you're talking about is me!" Wang Han said, expressionless.

Joey: ..........

On stage, Chen Xu didn't plan to keep doing commentary. For the first day of the exhibition, hosting the first two matches to warm up the crowd and maximize the game's popularity was sufficient.

Handing the microphone over to the originally designated host, Chen Xu looked at the players beneath the Booth, beaming with excitement, and smiled contentedly.

The players' reactions to Fall Guys and Sanguosha left him very satisfied.

Clearly, these two games, while not necessarily divine,

had at least, for now, attracted the attention of countless players.

And this was only the beginning of the exhibition!
