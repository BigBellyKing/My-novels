Chapter 8: The Philosophical Mode, Activated (Requesting Recommendations)

“Hmm, this UI interface seems quite pretty!”

After first entering the game, Jiang Ping's eyes lit up when he saw the game's UI interface. Although not a very mature Lewd Person, Jiang Ping hadn't played many Gentleman's Games. However, he still had some superficial experience with this type of game. While all made using the Official Game Engine, most of the ones he had played before had disorganized UI content. But this Mirror (Game), at least regarding its UI, was actually quite good.

“Can I only choose one character?”

After clicking to enter the game, Jiang Ping looked at a rhombus in the center. Inside were various characters, but only a Dark Elf was selectable. The rest were locked.

“So many characters to choose from? It seems... a bit rich!”

An astonished expression appeared on Jiang Ping's face. At the same time, he felt a little excited inside. Subconsciously, Jiang Ping glanced at the dorm room door. The dorm room door was still closed; his roommates had all gone out today for various reasons. Walking to the door, Jiang Ping closed it and locked it from the inside. Sitting back in front of his computer, looking at the game screen he had entered, he couldn't help but take a deep breath, and his expression became solemn and sacred. Of course, in his mind, he had a completely different idea.

Starting right off with a Dark Elf character? This is too exciting!

With a tiny bit of excitement, Jiang Ping followed the tutorial, clicking on a battle-like icon.

‘On this deep night, a secluded Blackwater Castle unexpectedly welcomed an uninvited guest.’

‘That almost invisible shadow gradually emerged.’

Looking at the game screen and the subsequent options, Jiang Ping was taken aback. Wasn't this a Gentleman's Game? This... why does it look like a visual novel? There's even a story? Jiang Ping scratched his head, but didn't think too much about it, just clicking a few times casually. Seeing the game enter combat, Jiang Ping was once again taken aback. So this game really is a Match-3 game? He had seen some people on the forum say it was the most fun Match-3 game, and Jiang Ping thought it was a joke. But now, the game's actual gameplay really was Match-3?

“Hmm, orange orbs increase physical attack, sword icons are for physical, stars for magic, potions for health recovery.”

“Connecting four grants an enhanced orb, and five creates a magic diamond that deals massive damage.”

“And there are items and special skills to use, though currently there's only one item for health recovery.”

Following the new player tutorial, Jiang Ping quickly understood the game's combat mechanics. Then he was a little surprised. Was he playing a Gentleman's Game, or a regular Match-3 game? Why were there so many variations? Jiang Ping was astonished; the Gentleman's Games he used to play didn't even have this many variations. Some were basically just 'click, click, click,' and then the character portraits would pop up. And some of the poor-quality ones were especially perfunctory. But this Mirror (Game) was a bit unusual! This combat system was excessively rich! Well, for a Gentleman's Game. Besides that, there was even a story! And these Lewd Person elements... they had some 'stuff,' and a lot of 'stuff' at that!

Jiang Ping pursed his lips, narrowed his eyes, and leaned slightly forward, temporarily turning off the small speaker on his desk. He took out an earbud-style earphone from the drawer, plugged it into the computer, and put it in one ear. After successfully matching, when he launched an attack, this Dark Elf even had sound effects when being hit. Also, when her health was depleted to a certain extent, her clothes...

Ah! That's right! According to the earlier storyline, this setting should be the Middle Ages, right? No wonder the clothes were so low quality! The living conditions of the people back then must have been truly harsh; look at how ragged these clothes are, and how dark her skin is from the sun.

Connecting five identical tiles even created a diamond, and the damage was so high! He could also use unique skills and purchase corresponding items to assist in attacks. There was even a turn limit, only 13 turns left, how did this elf still have so much health? After a brief trial, Jiang Ping's attention quickly shifted from the elf's clothes to the Match-3 game. He had to admit, this Match-3 game actually seemed quite fun!

“The quality is absolutely explosive!”

After two consecutive battles, he entered PLAY mode. Jiang Ping felt as if all the Gentleman's Games he had played before were a waste. What is a Gentleman's Game? This is what a Gentleman's Game should be! What were all those other games he played before? They only had the 'gentlemanly' content, but no actual gameplay. Of course, if that were all, it would be acceptable, as strong 'utility' without gameplay is still practical. But there were also those that were crudely made; did they really think the money of gentlemen wasn't real money? Look at this Mirror (Game); not only is its 'utility' strong, but the game content is also so rich. This is the quality a Gentleman's Game should possess, this is the content a true Gentleman's Game should have! And it even had Galgame elements? And it even had two endings?

Jiang Ping, who had gotten the Pure Love Ending on his first playthrough, thought about the different options he had taken. And seeing that the Dark Elf character only showed 50% unlocked progress, he was utterly thrilled. He never expected that he wouldn't find the doujinshi he wanted. Instead, he found such a divine game!

“Hmm, I won't play a new character yet; I'll check out the other storyline first.”

“Following normal game logic, this second ending should be the one where the Dark Elf turns bad, right?”

With curiosity, and a tiny bit of excitement and nervousness, Jiang Ping clicked in again.

Ten minutes later—

“Why is it like this?”

In front of his computer, Jiang Ping felt both excited and moved. She was born into nobility, yet her heart was with the impoverished commoners; she even personally stole to help them. However, the commoners she had helped were ugly, shameless, and repaid her kindness with malice. Facing the Dark Elf captured by the devil, these commoners harbored only evil thoughts in their minds. Although the in-game character portraits were still 'explosive' (alluring), and compared to other Gentleman's Games, the voice acting in this game was absolutely 'exploding' (phenomenal). Yet, Jiang Ping still felt a mix of emotions in his heart.

Especially later, when he saw a Young Guard come in who, though having good intentions, still failed to uphold his moral bottom line and extended a hand of sin towards her. This was like the last straw that broke the camel's back. Combined with the final scene of the devil secretly laughing outside the wall, it moved Jiang Ping deeply. He could perhaps understand why the renowned gentlemen on those forums reacted to this game so unusually.

This wasn't just a simple Gentleman's Game. It also contained a profound questioning of human nature and a discussion of good and evil. This instantly sparked some philosophical questions and thoughts in Jiang Ping. Is human nature fundamentally good, as Mencius said; or is it fundamentally evil, as Xunzi claimed? Facing the elf who helped them, why were these people able to repay kindness with malice? Why, in the end, despite having good intentions, did evil still take precedence?

Jiang Ping, immersed in philosophical mode, was seriously contemplating. However, this was only the beginning.
