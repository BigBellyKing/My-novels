"Huh, this UI interface actually looks pretty nice!"

Upon launching the game, Jiang Ping couldn't help but feel pleasantly surprised by the game's UI interface.

Although he wasn't a particularly seasoned Lewd Person, Jiang Ping hadn't played many gentleman's games.

Still, he did have some basic experience with this genre.

While most of the games he'd played before were made using the Official Game Engine, their UI content was usually crude and chaotic.

But this game, *Mirror (Game)*, was genuinely impressive—at least in terms of its UI design.

"Can I only choose one character?"

After clicking into the game, Jiang Ping looked at the diamond-shaped selection in the center.

It displayed various different characters, yet only the Dark Elf was available.

The rest were locked.

"So many playable characters? This seems... surprisingly rich!"

Jiang Ping's face lit up with surprise.

At the same time, he felt a small surge of excitement.

Instinctively, he glanced toward the dormitory door.

The door was still closed—his roommates had all gone out for various reasons today.

He walked over and closed the dorm door, then locked it from the inside.

Returning to his computer, he stared at the game screen and took a deep breath, his expression turning solemn and sacred.

Well, at least on the outside.

Inside, his thoughts were quite different.

They start me off with a Dark Elf character?

How thrilling!

With a heart pounding with excitement, Jiang Ping followed the tutorial and clicked on an icon resembling combat.

'On this deep, quiet night, the secluded Blackwater Castle unexpectedly receives an uninvited guest.'

'The nearly invisible shadow gradually emerges.'

Reading the game's narrative and viewing the following choices, Jiang Ping was momentarily taken aback.

Wasn't this supposed to be a gentleman's game?

Why does this feel more like a text-based drama?

There's actual story content?

Jiang Ping scratched his head, but didn't dwell on it, casually clicking through.

When the game transitioned into battle, he was stunned again.

Wait—is this game actually a Match-3 game?

Earlier on the forum, someone claimed it was the best Match-3 game ever. Jiang Ping thought it was a joke.

But now, the actual gameplay really *is* a Match-3?

"Hmm, orange orbs boost physical attack, sword icons represent physical damage, stars are magic, and potions provide healing."

"Matching four in a row creates a boosted orb; matching five creates a Magic diamond that deals massive damage."

"There are also items and special Skills available, though right now only one healing item is accessible."

Following the新手 tutorial, Jiang Ping quickly grasped the mechanics of the game's Combat System.

Then he was stunned.

Was he playing a gentleman's game or a standard Match-3 game?

Why so many mechanics?

Jiang Ping looked utterly surprised. The gentleman's games he'd played before didn't have nearly this level of complexity.

Some were basically just click-click-click, then character portraits popped up.

And worse, some were so crude and shoddy they felt like an insult.

But *Mirror (Game)* was different!

This Combat System was excessively rich!

Well, at least for a gentleman's game.

On top of that, there's actual story content!

And the Lewd Person elements... they're substantial—and plentiful!

He pursed his lips, narrowed his eyes slightly, leaned forward, and turned off the small speaker on his desk.

From his drawer, he pulled out an earbud headset, plugged it into his computer, and placed it over one ear.

After successfully clearing a Match-3 combo and launching an attack, he heard the Dark Elf's voice reacting to damage.

And when her health dropped, her clothes...

Ah! That's right!

According to the previous story, this should be set in the Medieval era?

No wonder the clothing quality is so poor!

People's living conditions back then were extremely harsh. Look at how torn her clothes are. Look at how dark her skin is from the sun.

Matching five identical tiles creates a diamond with massive damage!

You can also use unique Skills and purchase supporting items to assist attacks.

There's even a turn limit—only 13 turns left—and this elf still has so much health?

After a brief trial, Jiang Ping's attention quickly shifted from the elf's clothing to the Match-3 gameplay.

He had to admit, this Match-3 mechanic was actually pretty fun!

………………

"The quality of this game is absolutely explode (colloquial for emotions exploding)!

After two consecutive battles, Jiang Ping entered the PLAY mode.

He felt like all the gentleman's games he'd played before were a complete waste.

What is a gentleman's game?

*This* is a gentleman's game!

What were all those previous ones even?

They had lewd content but no actual gameplay.

Well, if that were all, it might still be acceptable—after all, strong practicality could compensate.

But then there were those that were just crude and shoddy. Did they really think a gentleman's money wasn't money?

Look at *Mirror (Game)*—not only is it highly practical, but the gameplay content is incredibly rich. This is what a true gentleman's game should be. This is what a real gentleman's game ought to offer!

And it even includes Galgame elements?

It even has dual endings?

Jiang Ping, having just completed a Pure Love Ending, stared at the screen, contemplating the different choices.

Seeing that the Dark Elf character only showed 50% progress unlocked, he was visibly trembling with excitement.

Never in his wildest dreams did he expect that instead of finding the doujinshi he was looking for, he'd stumble upon a divine game like this!

"Hmm, I won't play a new character yet. Let me explore the other storyline first."

"Following standard game logic, the second ending should be the Dark Elf turning evil, right?"

Filled with curiosity, and a bit of excitement and tension, Jiang Ping clicked in once more.

………………

Ten minutes later—

"Why did it end like this?"

Sitting before his computer, Jiang Ping's heart was filled with both excitement and deep emotion.

She was born into nobility, yet cared deeply for the poor and suffering, even stealing personally to help them.

Yet the impoverished people she aided were ugly, shameless, and repaid kindness with betrayal.

When the Dark Elf was captured by the devil, these people harbored only their own dark desires.

Though the character portraits remained as sensational as other gentleman's games, the voice acting in this game was absolutely explode (colloquial for emotions exploding) compared to the rest.

Still, Jiang Ping felt a complex mix of emotions.

Especially when he saw the Young Guard who entered later—though he still held a trace of kindness in his heart,

he ultimately failed to uphold his moral boundaries and reached out with evil intent.

That moment was like the final straw breaking the camel's back.

Coupled with the final image of the devil quietly laughing from beyond the wall, Jiang Ping was deeply moved.

Now he could understand why those renowned gentlemen on the forum spoke of this game with such reverence.

This wasn't just another simple gentleman's game.

It posed profound questions about humanity, explored the nature of good and evil.

In an instant, Jiang Ping found himself pondering philosophical questions.

Is human nature inherently good, as Mencius claimed?

Or is it inherently evil, as Xunzi argued?

Why did those people repay the elf who helped them with hatred?

Why, in the end, even with a spark of goodness remaining, did evil still triumph?

Engulfed in Philosophy Mode, Jiang Ping was thinking deeply.

But this was only the beginning.
