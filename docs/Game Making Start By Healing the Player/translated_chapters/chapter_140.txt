Chapter 139: Lottery (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

As time progressed day by day, the popularity of `Dark Souls`'s random mode remained very high.

After all, this randomized gameplay felt very fresh to players.

However, for the gaming industry, the most anticipated news was naturally the consecutive launch of TengHua's and NetDragon's two VR blockbusters.

NetDragon's 'Star God', previously showcased at the gameplay Expo, fired the first shot.

In terms of story and setting, it was very traditional.

The world once had gods, but for unknown reasons, one day the gods suddenly vanished, and countless demons were born into the world. Humanity lived in great suffering, and a young man with an unusual bloodline emerged from a large mountain, embarking on an adventure to find his origins.

From the story description, there was nothing particularly unique; its template could be perfectly applied to any ARPG.

It was probably NetDragon's consideration for risk aversion; while it wouldn't make players feel impressed, it wouldn't cause any major problems either.

Coupled with the inherent advantages of a VR blockbuster and NetDragon's promotion of this major title, its popularity exploded.

However, Chen Xu didn't care at all about the fierce competition between TengHua and NetDragon in the gaming industry. After all, `Dark Souls` had been online for almost two months, and its overseas sales were no worse than its domestic ones.

No matter what TengHua and NetDragon did, it wouldn't affect Nebula Games.

Currently, Chen Xu was in a company in Modu dedicated to AI research.

Of course, this company, named 'Galaxy Smart Tech', had already been wholly acquired by Chen Xu.

The negotiations weren't too complex; he simply sent the company's professionals to handle them.

After the negotiations concluded, with an offer of 110 million Yuan, Chen Xu acquired the company.

“Mr. Chen, this is our current progress in various directions, and our big data database,” Zhong Yue, who was responsible for the entire project research, said to Chen Xu somewhat apprehensively in the research lab.

It wasn't just Zhong Yue; some other employees in the company were also a little anxious.

After all, with the company acquired, no one could say for sure what would happen next.

“For now, I understand. Also, I believe Dr. Zhong and everyone else are aware of Nebula Games’ main business direction. Therefore, the company’s internal research focus will change, primarily concentrating on the interaction between AI intelligence and game applications,” Chen Xu said, making a long story short.

“Additionally, we will continue to inject another 20 million Yuan into the company in installments for research in this area,” Chen Xu told them.

Hearing Chen Xu’s words, everyone’s hanging hearts immediately settled.

As for what direction the change would be, that had nothing to do with them.

They knew the company wouldn't collapse, and there was new research funding; that was enough for them to know.

After touring the company's interior, reviewing its current patent documents and corresponding achievements, and with the Legal Department confirming that all new employees' non-disclosure and non-compete agreements were in order, Chen Xu left first.

Back in the Nebula Games office, Chen Xu opened the system's inventory interface.

At this moment, the item card he had originally drawn could now be used.

“That's it?”

Watching the scene where it shattered into a flurry of golden dust and then dissipated into the air after use, Chen Xu muttered to himself.

At this point, Chen Xu noticed a small progress bar beneath the original system lottery interface.

And on the progress bar, a line of numbers was constantly changing.

31536000, 31535999...

Countdown?

31536000 seconds?

Chen Xu paused, instantly understanding what the progress bar and numbers meant.

Just like in a management simulation game where you click on the tech tree and build houses, there needed to be a waiting period.

After researching for a while and finding nothing special, Chen Xu temporarily set it aside.

What exactly it was, he would only know after the countdown ended, and that day was still far off.

Temporarily putting aside the effect of this golden item, Chen Xu turned his attention back to his current points.

Following the launch of `Dark Souls`'s overseas version and new mode.

His points had soared like a rocket, accumulating enough for 200 draws by now.

Previously, Chen Xu had restrained his impulse to do a gacha pull, planning to save up more.

Now, with this number, he felt he could go on a spending spree in the in-game store.

Having made up his mind, he immediately started drawing.

He didn't perform any rituals like playing music or washing his hands, as he had before.

Because his previous unlucky streak told him that all of it was meaningless!

【Common Professional Skill Book】, 【Common Professional Skill Book】, 【Common Professional Skill Book】... 【Rare Professional Skill Book】, 【Memory Capsule】...

He went straight for a 30-pull of consecutive draws, and looking at the items that popped up, Chen Xu couldn't help but feel a pang of pained expressions.

The golden special effects were quite pretty, but after the boxes opened, they were all common items, with a rare item only appearing occasionally. Was this gacha experience really too realistic?

It would be good to get more Memory Capsules; he had used most of them when developing `Dark Souls`.

While lamenting, Chen Xu continued to draw.

【Professional Skill Book: Psychology Knowledge (Beginner)】

【Professional Skill Book: Film Cinematography Knowledge (Beginner)】

“Something dropped? New skill books?”

Looking at the two new skill books in front of him, Chen Xu felt a surge of excitement, but then seeing 'Beginner' appended, he felt a little disappointed again.

After all, even though it was a purple item, just like the Fear Converter from `Outlast`'s development, having 'Beginner' in the title somehow didn't feel like a good item.

After using it, Chen Xu understood. The main reason was that the content covered was simply too vast, so the current item was only at the Beginner level.

Moreover, for game development, knowledge in these two areas could be said to be closely related.

For instance, the manifestation of psychology in games isn't just about various malicious designs, such as the trap placements in `Dark Souls`.

It also includes positive reward mechanisms, such as how to arrange and set rewards after defeating a BOSS, and how the game's pacing can make players more excited—all of these are closely related to psychology.

As for film cinematography, that was even more important. In his previous life, games like `New God of War`, `The Last of Us`, and `Metal Gear` all heavily utilized elements of film cinematography.

For example, the one-shot camera work in `New God of War`, the cinematic language in `The Last of Us`, and the famous long takes in `Metal Gear`.

Out of 200 consecutive pulls, most were common skill books, with a few rare skill books, but they significantly replenished his Memory Capsules.

As for Professional Skill Books, Chen Xu drew a total of 4 Psychology Knowledge (Beginner) books, 6 Film Cinematography Knowledge (Beginner) books, 3 Architecture Knowledge (Beginner) books, and 5 Martial Arts Movements (Beginner) books.

Although he didn't draw any gold-tier items like before.

At the very least, all these items were very useful to the current Chen Xu.

So, Chen Xu was generally quite satisfied.
