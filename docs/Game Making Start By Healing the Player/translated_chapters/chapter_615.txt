Chapter 614: Housekeeping Nanny Simulator (Please Subscribe and Vote for Monthly Passes)

The moving pickup truck finally stopped in front of a very dilapidated house.

Compared to the previously bustling downtown Detroit, this was definitely a slum.

Entering the house, Todd, a burly middle-aged man with a gruff face, introduced Kara to her tasks.

Cleaning the room, washing clothes, cooking, and taking care of his daughter, Alice.

After assigning a long list of tasks, Song Ren mentally summarized them.

"Hmm, housework!"

Looking at Todd, who had finished speaking and was now lying on the sofa watching TV.

Song Ren, controlling Kara who stood rooted to the spot, was still a little dazed.

Until her gaze fell upon the current mission prompts: "Clean the room, wash the dishes, tidy up clothes."

"So, where's the promised negotiation expert, Conner?"

"Why was I a cold and ruthless android negotiation expert one second, and the next I've become a domestic service worker?!"

Song Ren was speechless; the contrast was too huge.

Although there weren't any explosive grand scenes in the demo, the cold, ruthless, and dashing Conner left a very deep impression on him.

Even the negotiation segments were intense and exciting, a battle of wits and courage.

Finally, under his clever negotiations, he eliminated the threat and rescued the little girl hostage.

He turned and left expressionlessly, under the unspeakable gaze of Captain Allen and his team, an act that truly exuded coolness.

But why was the full version experience so frustrating?

A story about a male nanny and a female nanny?

And this house, is it even fit for humans to live in?

"This room! Damn it! Even pigs live in cleaner places than this!"

Holding the broom, Song Ren began to clean the room. Under the immersive visual presentation, Song Ren was completely speechless.

This room was so damn dirty!

Of course, it was dirty, but Todd, with his gruff, fleshy face, made Song Ren want to punch him. Even when the protagonist, Markus, was beaten to the ground earlier, it hadn't felt this frustrating.

When cleaning the table near the TV, Todd, sitting on the sofa, would yell at him dismissively: "Idiot, you're blocking the screen!"

Why are you yelling so loudly? Do you have to shout?!

Song Ren wished he could kick Todd in front of him to death.

However, the game didn't allow her to do that; instead, she had to bow her head and apologize to Todd.

Sweeping the trash on the floor into the bin, then starting to wash the dishes, Song Ren was initially amazed by how many interactive details the game had.

But now, there were an awful lot of housework details too!

"So, this really isn't a Housekeeping Nanny Simulator?!"

Song Ren was completely speechless.

This life—oh no, this android life was too difficult!

Not only did she have to take care of the child, but she also experienced all sorts of housework inside and out, and was constantly bossed around by Todd.

For example, while she was controlling Kara to wash dishes, Todd, sitting there watching an ice hockey game, would shout for her to get him a can of iced beer.

And while she was doing laundry, she accidentally discovered the Red Ice Todd had hidden in the washing powder, and then he grabbed her by the neck and gave her a severe lecture.

Although Todd was an old scoundrel, his daughter Alice was very cute.

The only thing that made Song Ren a bit depressed was that Alice seemed very afraid of Kara and was also quiet.

This piqued Song Ren's curiosity.

The overall gameplay was relatively free.

The player, controlling Kara, could still walk around the house and collect clues.

Only when encountering content that didn't align with the plot would it be forcibly corrected.

As Song Ren searched for clues, he also basically figured out some fundamental circumstances.

Like the vagrants he had seen on the street earlier, Todd had also lost his original job because of androids.

Furthermore, as a foreigner with no savings who enjoyed overspending by maxing out credit cards, this could be described as a common social phenomenon.

So, after losing his job, Todd had no source of income and could only rely on social welfare benefits, causing his quality of life to plummet. His wife even ran off with "Old Wang."

He then became addicted to drugs to escape reality, but this also made Todd's temper very volatile, often getting angry at Alice.

At the same time, through Alice's small box, he also learned that:

The reason Kara was sent back for repairs wasn't because of a car accident, as Todd had claimed in the store.

Instead, in a fit of rage, Todd had tried to harm Alice, and Kara was damaged by Todd while protecting Alice.

And this wasn't the first time; every time she was sent back for repairs, Kara's memory would be reset.

This was also why Alice was a little afraid of Kara.

Because Kara had clearly known her before, but every time she returned after leaving the house, she would act like a stranger.

After understanding this information, Song Ren couldn't help but feel a wave of irony.

Todd hated androids because he lost his job due to them.

Yet, on the other hand, his daily life couldn't function without androids.

This was simply the greatest irony.

Including those who beat Markus in the plaza earlier, did they also act like Todd when they returned home?

"However, I now understand why Mr. Chen only included Conner in the prologue!"

As Kara's storyline concluded, Song Ren couldn't help but sigh with emotion.

Because only Conner's storyline in the demo version made players feel cool and stylish.

As for Kara and Markus's game experience so far, it could only be described as suffering.

Being beaten up for no reason on the street, or slaving away at housework for others.

Could it get any worse?

Forget about enjoyment; it was nothing but constant frustration.

However, besides these, the three protagonists and their different experiences also made Song Ren curious about the subsequent plot.

Each android protagonist was actually being discriminated against, clearly highlighting the conflict between humans and androids.

Markus allowed players to understand the larger societal environment between androids and humans.

Kara showed players what a family that hated androids was like.

And Conner, in turn, let players know why deviant androids appeared.

So, under these circumstances, what direction would the game's subsequent plot take?

Could androids and humans finally coexist peacefully?

What direction would this future Detroit ultimately develop towards?

Moreover, since it featured three protagonists, Song Ren also believed that in the later stages, the three protagonists would meet due to certain events.

But what kind of events would bring them together?

It must be said that these points were quite appealing to Song Ren.
