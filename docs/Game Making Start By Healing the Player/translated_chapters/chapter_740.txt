Chapter 739: In Norse Lands, Chopping Until Lost Contact

Chen Xu was utterly bewildered.

Compared to Kratos growing old, the fact that Kratos now had a son was even more startling.

The bald, tough Kratos, who tore apart the Sun God and kicked Poseidon, actually had a child... No, he had *another* child. After all, the previous Kratos had a wife and daughter, and their demise was the direct fuse that led Kratos to tear apart the Olympian gods.

But where did this son of Kratos come from now? Zhang Yi was full of questions, and beyond this suddenly appearing troublemaking kid, the more crucial point lay in the game's pacing.

It was completely different from the previous three *God of War* titles. In the original trilogy, Kratos would typically start by furiously slaying the Hydra, smashing the Colossus of Rhodes, or tearing apart Poseidon; a BOSS would be sacrificed at the very beginning. But now, just like the aged Kratos, Zhang Yi felt the pace had suddenly slowed down, giving it the feel of a slow-paced game like *Red Dead Redemption*.

Especially Kratos and his son, they exuded a rustic farmer vibe. Chopping trees, rowing a boat, splitting firewood, and having simple emotional exchanges with his child, all while burning the boy's mother wrapped in burlap – even causing the little troublemaking kid to accidentally scald his hand with a dagger.

If there was one thing that struck Zhang Yi as strange, it was why Kratos went so far to chop that one big tree when there were so many other trees around. Also, the golden handprint feature at the beginning, he felt it was some kind of foreshadowing in the game.

Regardless, Kratos's transformation was evident. Compared to the previously volatile Kratos, who couldn't control his emotions and would tear apart gods at the slightest provocation, the current Kratos had become mature and restrained.

All these elements indicated that this *God of War* was different from its predecessors.

“It has a storytelling feel, a bit like playing *Red Dead Redemption* or *The Last of Us*. So, is this *God of War* primarily narrative-driven?” Zhang Yi mused, as a player could immediately sense changes in game style upon starting. The previous Greek trilogy was the epitome of violent aesthetics, keeping players focused on how to control Kratos to eliminate famous mythological monsters and the Greek gods.

Although the game provided a complete introduction to the relevant plot, such as why Kratos hated the Olympian gods and how they orchestrated his misfortunes, it wasn't primarily narrative-driven; it was action-gameplay focused. Players' attention was mostly on how to control Kratos to slaughter all the legendary Greek gods, monsters, and heroes.

But what about this latest installment? Watching the cutscene where Kratos takes his son hunting after burning the child's mother, Zhang Yi clearly felt the difference, not just in game style but also in Kratos's character.

In the forest, Kratos and Atreus searched for prey. Following some tracks, they soon encountered a beautiful Elk. However, upon seeing the Elk, the troublemaking kid Atreus eagerly drew his bow and shot, not only failing to hunt the prey but also scaring it away. This immediately angered Kratos, who swiftly strode forward, snatched the bow from Atreus's hand, and spoke with fury:

'What are you doing! You alerted it! To shoot…'

Though he had aged, Zhang Yi could still faintly perceive Kratos's past temperament. But just as Zhang Yi worried that Atreus's head might be smacked, Kratos surprisingly took a deep breath, forcibly suppressing his surging anger.

“To shoot, you must wait for the right moment to shoot! Learn from this, find it first!”

Are you truly Kratos!? You're not just wearing Kratos's skin, are you!? Is this truly the Kratos who single-handedly slaughtered all the Olympian gods? Zhang Yi, playing the game, was stunned to see Kratos actually suppress his anger.

One must remember, in the trilogy, wherever Kratos went, blood flowed. No matter who, no matter if they were good or evil, if they stood in his way, he would kill them all. But now, facing his son Atreus, Kratos was clearly no longer the mad God of War he once was. He was more like a strict old father; when dealing with his child, Kratos could even control his rage.

The only problem was this troublemaking kid, which left Zhang Yi a little unsatisfied.

“So, is this really Kratos's kid? He doesn't seem like it at all!”

Zhang Yi looked at Atreus, who was timid and submissive under Kratos's scolding, feeling very displeased. As the saying goes, a tiger father has no dog son. Who was Kratos? The one who single-handedly broke through Olympus, eliminated the Greek gods, and destroyed Greek mythology—the renowned God of War. From a personal image perspective, Kratos was also a top-tier tough guy. His very 'social' tattoos aside (lest they corrupt young minds), his rugged bald head, simple attire for easy movement, and muscular physique perfectly embodied the demeanor of the God of War.

Now, look at Atreus: a slender body, a timid and submissive demeanor, wearing a fur coat as if afraid of the cold, hunting with a bow and arrow, and a clumsy personality. He was an absolute disgrace to the God of War!

No wonder Kratos used to call Atreus "BOY." It was no surprise there was a slight issue in their father-son relationship. After all, how could a tough father not be angry seeing his son so timid and hesitant?

Zhang Yi sighed with emotion.

Tracking the startled prey with Atreus, Zhang Yi soon encountered the first battle in the game. A group of Undead Soldiers appeared out of nowhere, and Zhang Yi discovered that the troublemaking kid Atreus wasn't entirely useless. He could assist Kratos by shooting arrows from the side, while Kratos fought in melee with his war axe, though he could also perform ranged attacks.

“This axe feels a bit unfamiliar!” Zhang Yi muttered, chopping the Undead Soldiers one by one.

The combat system had clear differences from before. For example, Kratos's Blades of Chaos were gone, replaced by a war axe. The moves were also more deliberate, making Zhang Yi, accustomed to the previous attack style, feel a bit unaccustomed. Mowing down enemies on easy difficulty lacked some of its previous satisfaction!

However, the ability to throw the axe and have it fly back was something Zhang Yi found very interesting. Throw it, it flies back; throw it, it flies back. Hey! That's really fun! And many in-game mechanisms also required utilizing this unique characteristic of the war axe.

Furthermore, the game's execution animations, though not as exaggerated as in previous titles, were still quite satisfying. The only thing was Atreus, the troublemaking kid, felt like a burden and kept shouting during combat.

“He's just a troublemaking kid, how can the mighty Kratos's son be like this?”

“So, in the later story, perhaps the troublemaking kid angers the Norse gods, and Kratos is forced to kill all the major deities of Norse mythology?” Combining previous information, Zhang Yi already knew that this *God of War* game was set in Norse mythology. He was now making bold guesses about the future plot. "In Norse lands, chopping until lost contact" – he figured this *God of War* would likely have this theme.
