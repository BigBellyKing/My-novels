## Chapter 789: This Dragon is One of Us! He's Cool!

As time progressed day by day, the launch date for *The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim* finally arrived.

Related topics on major websites and live-streaming platforms maintained high popularity.

On forums, Tieba, and video websites, dedicated players had already meticulously edited the Dragon Language data and the Dragonborn song from the video, frame by frame, to provide explanations.

The original video, less than 2 minutes long, was turned into programs lasting tens of hours.

'Dragon Language Level 8 Specialization: Learn Dragon Language Hand-in-Hand,' 'Skyrim Dragon Language Master Helps You Uncover Treasures' – countless posts like these proliferated.

Clearly, the Dragon Language questline in *The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim* attracted many players, streamers, and video creators.

Firstly, the 300,000 USD prize money was substantial.

More importantly, if one could truly be the first to decipher the Dragon Language quest, they would become famous.

Of course, many other players, while interested, weren't as diligent in their studies. They figured they could just copy others' strategies once a guide was cracked, and experience the game's Dragon Language side quests for themselves.

In truth, Chen Xu hadn't even thought about this Dragon Language event initially. It was only after seeing players' attention focused on this area and spotting Atari's name that he considered it.

To leave some easter eggs in the game for players to explore, which wouldn't affect the main story experience.

As for whether players could discover these easter eggs and experience all their content, that was entirely up to the players themselves.

In the private space of Nebula World, Song Ren and Zhang Yi were chatting, waiting for the game to unlock.

"Old Song, are you planning to challenge this Dragon Language decryption quest?" Zhang Yi asked Song Ren.

Song Ren chuckled, "No interest. My goal is to be a great Dragon Slayer. As a professional Dragon Slayer, the Savior of Skyrim, such scholarly matters are not for me."

"Oh, please! 'No interest,' why don't you just say your IQ isn't high enough to complete it? Whether the full score is 120 or 150, your English scores are always remarkably consistent, never exceeding 30 points," Zhang Yi mercilessly exposed him.

"Why didn't it exceed 30 points? Didn't you ever think about that, Old Zhang? Because every single time, I copied your test!" Song Ren retorted.

"Tsk, what did you score that one time you didn't copy me? Out of a 150-point paper, subtracting the essay and reading comprehension, the multiple-choice alone was 100 points, right? You only guessed 6 points correctly in the end. You've been an Unlucky King since you were a kid!" Zhang Yi dug up his dark past.

"Don't talk about me! Is bad luck something I can control? You used to pick 'D' for every short listening question!" Song Ren played his trump card.

"Ahem... enough talk, time's up! It's unlocked, it's unlocked! I'm going into the game, goodbye!" A somewhat embarrassed Zhang Yi glanced at the time, quickly changed the subject, and headed towards the giant portal not far away.

Watching Zhang Yi flee in disarray, Song Ren couldn't help but let out a snicker, adding another glorious victory to his mental notebook before unhurriedly walking through the portal.

Activating the game through the Nebula World's VR portal scene, after a brief moment of darkness, Song Ren heard the sounds of battle.

Then the screen gradually appeared, and Song Ren was surprised: "Is this starting with a war? Which side am I on?"

Looking at the two different factions of soldiers fiercely fighting in the wilderness in the distance, it was clearly the game's prologue.

But before Song Ren could figure out the situation, such as who the warring factions were, or who he was, an arrow suddenly shot out and landed squarely on his knee.

What the heck!?

How did an arrow suddenly hit my knee!?!?

A bewildered Song Ren watched himself, shot in the knee, being captured by two soldiers, and then falling unconscious.

The screen plunged into darkness again the next second.

"What is this! I'm supposed to be Dragonborn!" Song Ren felt a bit numb.

They said he was the Savior of Skyrim, but he got taken down by two soldiers as soon as he showed up? That's too embarrassing for a Dragonborn, isn't it?

Song Ren grumbled inwardly, but soon his attention was drawn back to the game as the screen reappeared.

An ancient scroll materialized before Song Ren's eyes.

Under the dim candlelight, the scroll slowly unfurled.

At the same time, a deep, ancient narration echoed in his ears.

'Scrolls foretell of a black wing in the winter.'

'When brothers clash, the land will fall into chaos.'

'Alduin!'

'Bane of Kings, devourer of all things.'

'The shadow of darkness and its world-devouring ambition shall be set free!'

Song Ren knew that this cryptic prophecy was likely crucial information about the game's world background or main story.

And this 'Alduin' character was definitely a BOSS he'd have to fight.

As for more details, he would clearly only get them through the actual gameplay experience.

As the scroll closed and the candlelight extinguished, the game screen appeared, starting from the highest point, the Throat of the World.

Song Ren's perspective traversed the entire Skyrim province.

Simultaneously, the Dragonborn song played.

The familiar melody, and the incomprehensible Dragon Language.

The camera swept across Skyrim, finally settling on a cart emerging from the forest.

A vast white fog, ancient trees covered in silver snow, strangely shaped rocks lining the road, and a contingent of armored cavalry.

The world of *The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim* was unveiled before Song Ren for the first time.

At this moment, Song Ren saw a man named Ralof speak, "Hey, you're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? But you ran into an Imperial ambush, just like us, and this little thief here."

A thin thief named Lokir next to him was filled with rage: "You damn Stormcloaks! Everything was fine in Skyrim without you. High heaven and distant emperor, wasn't that great? If they weren't always searching for rebels, I'd have stolen a horse and been off to Hammerfell already!"

On the cart, Song Ren's attention was drawn by the conversation of the people next to him.

"Ulfric, Jarl of Windhelm, leader of the Stormcloaks."

"Oh, crap! Am I really going to get beheaded right at the start!?"

Seeing Lokir's panicked expression and Ralof's look of impending sacrifice, Song Ren lowered his head to see his hands tied with rope, feeling a pang of discomfort.

Good heavens!

Starting as a prisoner, and one slated for immediate execution!

Through the conversation of these people in the prisoner cart, Song Ren also got a rough idea of the protagonist's predicament and the relevant background.

Clearly, the Stormcloaks were akin to rebel armies, rising up due to dissatisfaction with the Empire or other reasons.

And the Empire was the original ruling power.

So the two factions were clearly hostile, thoroughly beating each other's brains out.

His character, based on the dialogue and the brief opening cutscene, was likely an innocent bystander, just like the thief, caught in the crossfire.

"So, based on common game experience, the Stormcloaks should come to rescue their leader from the execution grounds next."

Song Ren speculated.

As for factions, Song Ren thought it was highly probable he would get to choose later.

Join the Stormcloaks, or join the Empire.

Just like in *The Witcher: Wild Hunt*, where you could help the Emperor or Dijkstra.

The prisoner cart slowly approached Helgen Keep.

At this stage, players had no control and could only rotate the camera to observe their surroundings.

Along the way, Song Ren looked at the scenery around him, while Ralof on the cart spoke to himself.

The conversation touched upon Nord customs and traditions.

Arriving inside Helgen Keep, soldiers led the prisoners off the cart, calling out names one by one.

"These are all execution lists, damn it!"

Watching people being called out and led forward, Song Ren couldn't help but smack his lips.

However, he felt no tension, as Song Ren knew very well it was just a game.

But what surprised Song Ren was the behavior of the other NPCs.

They weren't just static background characters.

The villagers watching from a distance all showed corresponding reactions.

Some curiously gazed towards them.

Others shielded their children and retreated into their houses.

Of course, there was also the horse thief whose name was called out right in front of him.

'No... I'm not a rebel, you can't do this!'

The thief whose name was called out trembled all over, then suddenly broke free from the guards and tried to escape.

'Archers!'

With the archers in the Keep firing, the thief, who hadn't even run two steps – perished.

"Why don't you dodge a bit when you run? You're running in a straight line like an idiot, don't you know about 'snake movement'?"

Watching the thief riddled with arrows in the distance, Song Ren couldn't help but grumble.

As the execution list continued, and with the soldiers' questions, the screen transitioned to the character creation phase.

Body, head, face, eyes, eyebrows, mouth, hair – several main categories.

And within each option, there were various minute sub-categories.

It was incredibly rich.

In addition, each race had different talents and specialties, dazzling Song Ren's eyes.

Ultimately, Song Ren chose the Nord race. As for the appearance, he changed the gender to female but kept everything else default.

With his character creation skills, it was better to stick to default; at least it wouldn't turn into an Eldritch face.

After character creation, he conversed with the soldiers. Although innocent, the female captain decided to execute him anyway.

"Damn it! Better to kill the wrong person than let one go, huh? What makes you so annoying!?"

"You little jerk! No, 'little missy,' if I ever get the chance, I'll stab you to death!"

Watching the cold female captain's decision, Song Ren gritted his teeth.

She was hateful, so hateful!

After a cutscene, Song Ren walked to the execution block.

But just as he lay down,

Suddenly, a dragon's roar echoed in the sky. A huge black dragon flew from the distant horizon and landed on the watchtower.

A single dragon shout instantly changed the weather; the previously clear blue sky was suddenly engulfed in dark clouds.

At the same time, lightning and fireballs rained down from the sky, like the end of the world.

"This dragon is here to save me!?"

Song Ren's eyes widened, looking at the huge black dragon perched on the watchtower.

In the trailer, weren't Dragonborn and dragons supposed to be opposing forces? How come this dragon saved him?

Perhaps he misunderstood?

Yes, if there are bad dragons, there must be good dragons.

Dragonborn, Dragonborn – it refers to the offspring of dragons.

So, this makes sense!

This dragon is one of us! He's cool!

In an instant, Song Ren's mind concocted what he believed to be the truth.
