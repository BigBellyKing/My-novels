Chapter 506: Relaxing and Healthy Yet Very Satisfying? Has Mr. Chen Changed!? (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)

At Nebula Games, Chen Xu leaned back in the massage chair in the break room, watching the heated debates among players online, and couldn't help but smile happily.

Especially when he saw posts from new players who had been recently drawn into the game, expressing their near-breakdown states, as well as videos on major video websites showcasing players' 100 ways to die as Hunters, Chen Xu's smile grew even wider.

"Mr. Chen, the players online are practically at each other's throats, and you're laughing so happily?" Ruan Ningxue, standing nearby, said speechlessly.

"Isn't this normal? Seeing players so joyful because of my game, as the designer, of course I'm happy," Chen Xu replied, clearing his throat lightly.

Without a word, Ruan Ningxue, along with Yang Xin and others who had just arrived, looked at Chen Xu with expressions that clearly said, 'Yeah, right.'

"But aside from the game's story and high difficulty, these players are really impressive. They've already started speedrunning! Excluding bosses like the Orphan of Kos, the fastest time to clear the game is actually just an hour and a half!" Qin Yi exclaimed with admiration.

As the person responsible for the game's Numerical Design and Level Design, Qin Yi had naturally played Bloodborne during this period.

Well... of course, it was the PC version, so he knew exactly what that data represented.

"Theoretically, the time could be compressed to under 40 minutes. Don't underestimate the players," Chen Xu said with a smile.

"Mr. Chen! Please stop! That's just a small fraction of players. Please consider clumsy players like us! Don't use your 'great love' to heal us anymore!" Ruan Ningxue raised her hand and interjected.

"Exactly! I'm still stuck on the Yharnam Three Stooges!" Yang Xin chimed in, grumbling inwardly. As members of the clumsy players' club, they were really struggling.

"If you really can't get past it, you can search online for some heavily modded Chalice Dungeons created by players. Grind a bit to level up your stats—that should make it easier. Of course, if you do that, your current save file won't be able to connect with regular players in online multiplayer," Chen Xu suggested with a smile.

For Bloodborne, Chen Xu had adopted the same approach as with the previous Dark Souls.

That is, separating regular players from special players.

By grinding Chalice Dungeons, whether preset or randomly generated, players could engage in normal PVP and PVE.

Of course, players could also use special tools to modify the monsters and loot in the dungeons—these were the so-called heavily modded dungeons.

For example, after defeating the Blood-starved Beast and obtaining the first Pthumeru Chalice, players could search for heavily modded dungeons, grind millions of souls, and turn their first playthrough into a mowing-grass power fantasy.

Naturally, doing so would cut them off from regular players, matching them only with others who had entered modded dungeons.

In reality, many players, after being tormented in their first playthrough, resorted to modded dungeons. But after clearing the game's ending, if they were truly captivated by the charm of souls-like games, many would create a new, unmodded character and challenge the game again through sheer effort.

"But the setting of the Chalice Dungeons really adds a lot of replay value to the game!" Meng Zuo, sitting beside Chen Xu, remarked.

When Nebula Games was developing the two Dark Souls titles, Meng Zuo had still been at NetDragon, though he'd kept up with the games through various channels.

At the time, Dark Souls had been fairly popular, but aside from the hardcore players, many casual players lost interest in a second playthrough after clearing the first.

Bloodborne, however, was different. With various Runes and Blood Gem combinations, players could experiment with different playstyles.

And with the Chalice Dungeons, the game practically became a grindfest.

Many players jokingly called themselves Gem Hunters, their greatest wish being to obtain a high-tier Blood Gem with good characteristics.

Of course, while grinding, these players also harbored deep resentment.

Because once the dungeon depth increased, the monsters inside became downright inhuman!

Bell-ringing Maidens hiding who-knows-where, endlessly summoning all sorts of creatures; sneaky Broodmothers; fast-moving, long-haired "Head & Shoulders" enemies; and chubby, hammer-wielding foes with bare bottoms.

It was safe to say many players suffered severe psychological trauma.

"But for Unlucky Kings, it's downright unfriendly!" Ruan Ningxue added.

"Exactly! Some players grind for a hundred hours without getting what they want, while others get their ideal Blood Gem effortlessly!" Yang Xin sighed with deep emotion.

"You sound so passionate about this. Could it be that you..." Chen Xu grinned as he looked at Yang Xin.

"Not me, no way, Mr. Chen don't spout nonsense, my luck is great!" Yang Xin immediately delivered a triple denial.

Unlucky King? She refused to believe she was one!

"But recently, players have really been through a lot of suffering," Chen Xu mused, observing online posts from players lamenting their inability to clear the game since launch.

Hearing Chen Xu's reflection, those around him could only stare in speechless silence.

And whose fault was it that they'd suffered so much?

None other than Mr. Chen himself!

Just look at the recent game releases—after Assassin's Creed, he'd completely let loose.

Resident Evil, Bloodborne—horror, masochism, and the pain of being an Unlucky King—it was all there!

How could players not suffer?

"Hmm... maybe it's time to develop a game that brings players joy. And it'd be perfect for the Switch, a nice opening act for the new year," Chen Xu said, smiling as an idea came to him.

"Mr. Chen, is this 'joy' the same kind of joy we're thinking of?" Yang Xin asked uncertainly.

"What's with you all? Have some faith in me! Am I the kind of designer who would deceive players?" Chen Xu sighed.

He certainly wouldn't deceive players—everything he said was technically true. The problem was that his idea of "joy" and the players' were completely different!

"Don't worry, this time it'll genuinely be a benefit for players. Though it's an action game, it won't demand much from their skills. It'll be a very satisfying experience. The setting will be Greek mythology, with players taking on the role of Zagreus, son of Hades, fighting his way out of the underworld," Chen Xu explained with feeling.

"And it'll be a relatively relaxing game—each run lasting about half an hour, quite healthy for you," Chen Xu added with another smile.

Hearing this, everyone looked astonished.

Relaxing, healthy, and mowing-grass satisfying!? Had Mr. Chen changed? Was he being too kind to players?

It was almost hard to get used to!

Simultaneously, they all felt a twinge of emotion at the thought.

Seeing their shocked expressions, Chen Xu simply chuckled.

Of course, there were some things he kept to himself.

Like the fact that while Lucky Kings would find the game satisfying and mowing-grass easy, Unlucky Kings... well, 23333, good luck to them.

As for relaxing and healthy? That would depend entirely on how the players chose to play!
