Chapter 524: So I've become the strongest Gwent player in White Orchard? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Looking at the NPC before him, Song Ren hesitated slightly.

The game's immersive storyline made him wonder, how could Geralt of Rivia, the Witcher, learn to play cards at a time like this?

Think of your old flame, Yennefer; her safety is still unknown!

And Ciri—though the game hadn't revealed much about her yet, there was only that brief training scene in Kaer Morhen.

Even old man Vesemir was waiting for you, White Wolf, to gather information before setting off to find Yennefer's traces!

But, to be fair, Yennefer, as a powerful sorceress, should have some self-preservation abilities. Ciri had been missing for so long, a little while longer probably wouldn't hurt. And the villagers of White Orchard being threatened by a Griffin wasn't a huge problem either. His Princess Zelda on the continent of Hyrule hadn't even been rescued from Ganon yet.

Yet, the War Scholar's description of Gwent truly piqued Song Ren's curiosity. According to the scholar, it was an incredibly popular game in The Witcher world. Not just in Nilfgaard, but also in Redania, which was at war with Nilfgaard in the Northern Kingdoms, the relatively neutral Novigrad, and even the defunct Temeria—this card game was extremely popular, with some cards fetching very high prices. It was played by everyone from nobles and officials to common folk, across all social strata.

Such a description made Song Ren quite curious. What kind of magic did this small card game possess?

So, he decided to give it a try.

As the game began, after a simple descriptive introduction, Song Ren quickly grasped the rules of this card game. It wasn't difficult, at least much simpler than Dou Dizhu. Simply put, it was about comparing card power and points, a best-of-three match, like Tian Ji's Horse Racing strategy. Before the game, players could build their decks and choose their respective leader commanders, with each commander from a different faction having unique special effects, such as changing weather or redrawing cards.

And before the match started, players would draw 10 cards from their deck, which would be all the cards they could use for the entire game. Soldier cards were divided into soldiers, archers, and siege weapons—basically, front row, middle row, and back row. In addition, there were weather cards, which could reduce the attack values of different attribute cards. For example, snowy weather would affect soldiers, and heavy rain would affect siege weapons. Some soldier cards might also have special abilities.

“A bit interesting!” The rules of Gwent weren't complicated; Song Ren understood them with a quick look. Following the Tian Ji's Horse Racing strategy, the scholar before him didn't pose much of a threat. Song Ren secured a clean 2-0 victory, winning one of the opponent's cards and a Gwent collection handbook that listed the number of collectible Gwent cards in various maps. He also received a quest to find people to play cards with.

Now he understood why the shopkeeper sold Gwent cards.

“I wonder if the innkeeper can play cards. How about we play a match? If I win, you sell me all the cards in your shop.” Song Ren didn't rush to find old man Vesemir to trigger the main quest. Instead, he approached the innkeeper.

However, to Song Ren's disappointment, the innkeeper didn't have a card-playing option. Clearly, she wasn't an NPC for players to engage in mini-games with. “Forget it, I’ll do the quest first.” With a sigh, Song Ren felt a little disappointed. He had just learned to play cards and was eager to try it out with others. Besides, the introduction suggested he could win gold or items, which seemed like a good way to make money!

He sold off some items he deemed useless to the innkeeper, practically emptying his pockets, then bought all the Gwent cards he could afford from her shop. To win against others, his hand of cards needed to be strong!

After circling the inn, Song Ren unfortunately found no other opponents. He had no choice but to resume the main quest. After dealing with three drunken troublemakers, Song Ren prepared to guide Geralt to the Nilfgaardian garrison to inquire about Yennefer.

However, along the way, Song Ren also took on some side quests. He had to admit, the game's map offered an incredible amount of explorable content. White Orchard was clearly a starting area, yet opening the map revealed numerous explorable question mark icons. Of course, if it were just many question marks, that wouldn't necessarily be a good thing, but the key was that Song Ren found these side quests marked by question marks to be incredibly rich and well-executed.

First, there was a quest about a Dwarf blacksmith whose house was burned down, and he asked the Witcher to investigate. The quest's progression felt like a detective mode: activating Geralt's Witcher Senses to find clues invisible to ordinary people and ultimately identifying the culprit. The process wasn't particularly noteworthy, but what caught Song Ren's attention was the moral choice. After finding the culprit, it turned out to be an ordinary farmer driven by jealousy of the blacksmith's talent and resentment that the blacksmith sold weapons to Nilfgaardian invaders. The farmer's mother had recently passed away, leaving him some inheritance, which he offered to Geralt as a bribe.

At this point, the player had two choices: hand him over or conceal the investigation results. If Geralt handed him over, the farmer would be executed immediately. Additionally, some side quests were surprisingly linked to the main storyline, creating interconnected narratives.

In pursuit of Yennefer, Geralt visited the Nilfgaardian garrison. However, the officer there demanded Geralt eliminate a dangerous Griffin before he would disclose any information about Yennefer. During this mission, Geralt encountered a hunter who had been banished by a lord. Through dialogue, the hunter revealed he had been in love with the lord's son. But the affair was exposed, and the lord's son, unable to bear the gossip, hanged himself, leading to the hunter's banishment by the lord.

This story didn't particularly concern Song Ren at the time, but soon after, in a burnt-down village south of White Orchard, while completing a quest called “Devil by the Well,” he uncovered more details. This scorched village had been founded by a couple who previously lived under White Orchard's former lord. They had a dispute with the lord and subsequently moved their family into the White Orchard forest to establish a new settlement. This move was approved by the Lower Vizima Court in Temeria at the time, attracting many former White Orchard residents.

The Lord of White Orchard felt the situation was escalating, so he sent his retainers to persuade them to return to White Orchard. Initially, they intended a peaceful resolution, without violence or bloodshed. However, the villagers brought up the lord's deceased son, enraging the lord, who then ordered the slaughter of everyone in the village. The woman was hanged in the well, becoming a Daywraith.

This immediately made Song Ren feel the realism of this world. These NPCs lived in the same area; they weren't strangers to each other, and they had close interactions.

Of course, what left a deep impression on Song Ren was that when he first encountered the Daywraith, he was brutally beaten. It wasn't until he discovered the monster bestiary in the game, which mentioned how to deal with Daywraiths—by using Specter Oil or casting the Yrden Sign—that he successfully defeated it. The same applied later when hunting the Griffin.

But what moved Song Ren the most was the sense that in The Witcher: Wild Hunt, it was difficult to say who was good and who was bad. For instance, the Nilfgaardian officer who tasked Geralt with hunting the Griffin initially collected grain from local villagers. After asking how much food they could provide, he voluntarily reduced the amount by a quarter. However, the villagers ultimately provided rotten grain, for which they were disciplined according to military regulations. From this perspective, it seemed the villagers took the officer's kindness for granted.

Yet, looking at it from another angle, this land once belonged to Temeria, and Nilfgaard was an invading force. The villagers' actions, then, seemed perfectly understandable.

Aside from these thought-provoking storylines, one other thing bugged Song Ren: after playing the Gwent mini-game, he had talked to every NPC in White Orchard, but aside from the scholar, he couldn't find anyone else who played cards. Did that mean he had inadvertently become the strongest Gwent player in White Orchard? But he hadn't even played a single match!

The game showed him a tutorial, piquing his curiosity, but then didn't give him anyone to play with. How frustrating was that!
