Chapter 48 Horror Games Are as Simple as Breathing for Me

Chapter 48 Horror Games Are as Simple as Breathing for Me

By mid-November, about seventy percent of the content for *Outlast* had been completed.

The remaining thirty percent mainly involved voice acting, scene construction, and cinematic sequences.

For Chen Xu, the biggest takeaway during *Outlast*'s development was a deeper understanding of the editor's capabilities.

Meanwhile, the game content for *Outlast* fit comfortably within the monthly resource quota allowed by his current 2048M resource permissions.

Aside from game development, the Nebula Games Platform had quietly launched during this time.

Chen Xu promoted it with a post on his official Weibo account.

But it barely caused a ripple.

No industry giants took notice, no media outlets reported on it—nothing like that happened at all.

Only a few media outlets, desperate for content, placed the news in a minor sub-section.

Unless you specifically went looking, you wouldn’t even notice it.

At launch, only two games were available on the platform: *To the Moon* and *Undertale*.

As for sales, the two titles combined had sold 172 copies.

Total playtime across all players didn’t even reach 50 hours in a single day.

Clearly, those who bought the games were likely Chen Xu’s fans, purchasing them simply to support their favorite designer and game company.

Chen Xu wasn’t discouraged by this. He knew platform growth wouldn’t happen overnight.

As time progressed day by day, early December arrived.

Development on *Outlast* had finally wrapped up.

Promotion began rolling out accordingly.

One day, Chen Xu suddenly published a post on his official Weibo.

The message was simple: a short statement and a game poster.

‘Only by escaping can you survive!’

‘Outlast launches December 15!’

Below the text was the poster for *Outlast*.

The background depicted a hospital room, with medical equipment scattered across the floor and tables.

On the wall were two large words: ESCAPE.

Rendered in night vision mode, the color appeared black, immediately evoking images of bloodstains.

Under a bed in the corner, a person crouched with a terrified expression, right index finger pressed to their lips—an eerily unsettling sight.

Following Chen Xu’s post, various media outlets began reporting on *Outlast*.

Meanwhile, the game had already been released early on the Official Game Platform.

Though currently still in pre-sale mode.

Priced at 65 Yuan, it wasn’t particularly expensive.

After all, the Game Scale of *Outlast* wasn’t very large.

At the same time, gaming communities and forums buzzed with discussions about *Outlast*.

Of course, this wasn’t organic player-driven interest. Despite *Undertale* gaining some renown and *To the Moon* winning first place in a sci-fi game contest, Chen Xu’s reputation alone wasn’t enough to generate such widespread attention.

The driving force behind this buzz? None other than Money Power.

………………

As time progressed day by day, the launch day of *Outlast* finally arrived.

 

 On Shark TV’s gaming section, in a live stream room titled Commentator Old Boy:

"Why am I the only one here? Brother Huang went for a medical check-up and probably won’t be back for a while."

"Stop spamming about horror games. I’ve told you before—horror games are no pressure for me at all. They’re as simple as breathing."

"You want me to stream horror games because you’re hoping to see me get scared out of my mind. But when you see me completely expressionless, you’ll realize it’s just like breathing. You’ll be extremely disappointed, right? Disappointed one will be your reaction."

"Alright, fine. Here’s the plan—everyone knows I don’t feel any pressure with horror games. I’ve played so many before. So let’s try this one first. If it’s not scary, we’ll wait for Huang to return and play something else."

"Fine, fine, I’ll turn on the camera. But honestly, you’re really going to be disappointed. The reactions you’re expecting? I won’t show any of them."

"Because I’m an extremely calm person. Horror games are as simple as breathing for me."

Sun Yixie, currently commentating on a game replay, remained composed and unfazed by the bullet comments flooding his live stream room.

He emphasized three times: as simple as breathing.

He was quite confident in his courage.

Opening the Official Game Platform, ignoring the stream comment saying, "Big Bro can’t even independently launch the game," Sun Yixie, after some effort, installed the game, turned on his camera, and entered the game.

A brief sizzling sound played, then the game interface appeared.

The entire game graphics were tinged with blue-green, resembling the color tone of old Hong Kong films and ghost films.

The background showed a structure similar to a hospital, with sparse lighting and dynamic clouds overhead—visually creepy.

"I’m getting a slight feeling, just a slight one. Still, like I said—horror games are as simple as breathing for me," Sun Yixie said, glancing at the bullet comments.

He still appeared highly confident.

"For difficulty, I’ll start with Regular on my first try."

Upon entering the game, darkness filled the screen. A low narration began, accompanied by eerie BGM and a crackling car radio.

‘My name is Miles Upshur, a regular reporter. Deep in the remote Colorado Mountains, an abandoned asylum has reopened—Mount Massive Asylum.’

‘But one day, a mysterious person sent me a letter, claiming there’s a huge secret hidden within this asylum. To investigate, I came here.’

Through the car radio’s narration, the game’s background world was briefly introduced.

Sun Yixie showed no emotional fluctuations—just as he had claimed, remaining completely calm.

Most horror games, or horror films, started this way anyway.

After the narration, the game画面 appeared.

However, it was still in an uncontrollable mode.

The protagonist drove toward Mount Massive Asylum.

The dim color tone, combined with the static-filled car radio, instantly built a tense atmosphere.

Soon, the car reached its destination, stopping at an entrance to Mount Massive Asylum.

The game’s tutorial appeared—pick up the camera from the passenger seat, along with a letter.

The letter contained the same text as the earlier narration. As a reporter, the protagonist had come to Mount Massive Asylum to uncover a big news story.

After picking up the letter, a mission prompt appeared on the game screen: Enter Mount Massive Asylum.

From this point, players could begin free movement.

Stepping out of the car, the night, wind sound, rustling of leaves, and the inherently unfriendly reputation of an asylum caused Sun Yixie’s heartbeat to quicken—just slightly.
