Chapter 261: Ten Thousand People's Blood Petition to Buff the Long Sword! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Of course, countless players, besides complaining about the "water temperature" in *Monster Hunter: World* suddenly rising,

many other player groups were complaining about something else.

This particular group of players were those who wielded the Long Sword.

Long Sword players, one could say, constituted the largest proportion of weapon users in *Monster Hunter: World*.

As for the reason?

Naturally, it's because it's cool!

However, the situation for Longsword Heroes has actually always been rather grim.

Because the Long Sword's output isn't actually low; after achieving Red Blade, while the damage might not surpass that of the Great Sword or Charge Blade, it's still quite respectable.

Moreover, the Long Sword can deliver effective strikes against a monster's hitzone.

Especially the damage from Helm Breaker; as long as it hits a BOSS's hitzone that is susceptible to cutting damage, its output is no less than the Great Sword's charged attacks or the Charge Blade's discharges.

But similarly, compared to the Charge Blade and Great Sword, the biggest difference is that the Long Sword's prerequisite is to enter the Spirit Gauge State.

And to enter the Spirit Gauge State, you have to use that Spirit Roundslash, which clears everything within a five-meter radius.

The Charge Blade and Great Sword users charge their own phials and power up their own attacks; who's like you, Long Sword?

So, before, the Longsword Heroes' situation was a bit lonely.

As for why it's called 'a bit lonely'?

Because some players would occasionally bring along Longsword Heroes.

After all, the earlier monsters weren't too threatening; even if a Longsword Hero hit a teammate, it would just cause a flinch.

Everyone would just laugh it off, because in the end, didn't they still succeed in the hunt?

And for the Longsword Heroes, even if you don't bring me along, so what?

The strong don't need companions; I alone am an army!

Traversing the Ancient Forest, roaming the Wildspire Waste, from the Coral Highlands' elevated platforms to the Rotten Vale's depths, where can't I, the Longsword Hero, go?

But when facing Diablos and Rathalos, the world in the Longsword Heroes' hearts suddenly changed.

Because Diablos and Rathalos were simply too brutal, truly deserving the title of 'newbie killer'.

So many players chose to team up to hunt, as it was more efficient.

And so, the Longsword Hero was now completely embarrassed.

Solo, they couldn't win.

In a team, nobody wanted them anymore.

After all, with some of the previous monsters, even if a teammate was accidentally hit, it would at most lead to some rather comical scenes.

But facing Diablos' burrowing, Dragon Charge, and two consecutive head thrusts, accidentally hitting a teammate could be fatal.

And the Longsword Hero was precisely the most prone to hitting teammates.

Whether using Foresight Slash to enter Spirit Gauge State or anything else, it always ended with a Spirit Roundslash.

To maintain output, one had to constantly stay in the Spirit Gauge State.

After all, Helm Breaker directly consumes one level of Spirit Gauge State.

So in team mode, Longsword Heroes, to ensure their teammates' safety and damage output, generally wouldn't use Spirit Roundslash.

But how do you enter Spirit Gauge State then?

With such low output and easily obstructing teammates, what use are you!?

I'll team up with a Greatsword bro, help him draw aggro, and then he'll unleash explosive damage with his three-charge attacks.

Or a Light Bowgun bro, who can plant three landmines on the monster's head.

Or team up with a Hammer bro, bash the monster's head after stunning it—wouldn't that be wonderful?

If all else fails, a Hunting Horn user, a man with his own BGM, could at least buff the entire team.

Even an Insect Glaive user could at least perform some acrobatics.

Although in the game, you can't actually see the exact damage output of other characters.

After all, this is a cooperative hunting game, and there's no so-called damage ranking in the game.

But even if you can't see the final statistics, you can still guess.

You say you're a Long Sword user who never enters Spirit Gauge State, with your only attacks being overhead slashes and thrusts—how much damage can you possibly do?

What? You say your damage is high, either first or second?

Pfft!

Go take a piss and look at yourself in the reflection!

How big is your heart!?

Even bringing a Palico is more useful than you!

Under these circumstances, facing increasingly powerful BOSSes,

Long Sword players further became 'empty nest elders'.

On the empty continent, wanting to find someone to hunt a dragon with—making such a decision meant loneliness was my neighbor.

It's clearly a four-player game, yet I (Long Sword) can never truly have a name.

..................

On Chen Xu's official Weibo account and in the community forums,

there were all sorts of messages from players.

They were basically all complaints.

If all complaints were one stone, Long Sword players would claim eight dou of it.

Of the remaining two dou, one dou was complaining about the game's 'water temperature' suddenly rising.

After all, veteran Dark Souls players were already used to it, and even felt a little secretly pleased.

The other dou came from players of other weapons, who felt their weapons were still a bit weak. Of course, the reason there were so few was mainly because the Long Sword was there to 'bottom out' for them.

Thus, a spectacle appeared on the forum community.

That was: 'Ten Thousand People's Blood Petition to Buff the Long Sword!'

“Mr. Chen, aren't you going to respond? Many players are talking about weapon imbalance.”

In Nebula Games' office, Qin Yi looked at Chen Xu with a hint of anticipation.

As for why he had an anticipatory look, it was naturally because he himself was a Long Sword player.

He also clearly understood the suffering of those Longsword Heroes online.

If it weren't for everyone being colleagues, absolutely no one would take him to hunt dragons.

Chen Xu chuckled, “It's fine. Players just haven't figured out the Long Sword's gameplay yet.”

Qin Yi was speechless. “So, Mr. Chen, the Long Sword really doesn't need to be changed? Its damage is too low!”

“Compared to the base damage of the Great Sword and Charge Blade, it is indeed lower, but I'm not the one who entered the numerical data!” Chen Xu said with a smile.

Qin Yi was immediately speechless. “Mr. Chen, I entered the data, but you were the one who approved it!”

Listening to Qin Yi's complaint, Chen Xu picked up a bottle of soda nearby, opened it, took a sip, and said with a smile.

“Low base damage doesn't mean low overall damage.”

“Moreover, after entering Spirit Gauge State, the Long Sword's damage instantly ramps up. With Foresight Slash for quick Spirit Gauge activation, plus the burst of Helm Breaker, do you dare say the Long Sword's output is low?”

“Besides, the Long Sword itself is a very cool weapon.”

“If you want to maximize damage, you definitely need skill. Otherwise, if it's powerful but mindless, what's the point of other weapons?”

“So, skilled Longsword Heroes are a symbol of mastery and glory!”

Chen Xu said, as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

Listening to Chen Xu's explanation,

Qin Yi fell silent.

It seemed... what he said actually made a lot of sense!

Alright, at least he was convinced.

Watching Qin Yi sheepishly return to his workstation, Chen Xu also smiled.

Game balance issues?

Hmm, there were indeed some minor issues.

But they were actually harmless.

After all, no game can achieve perfect balance.

And *Monster Hunter: World* itself isn't primarily a competitive game.

The game's main focus is a PVE cooperative hunting mode.

However, this controversy still needed to be addressed!

This perfectly good *Monster Hunter* game was being talked about by players as if it had become *Monster Abuse Humans*.
