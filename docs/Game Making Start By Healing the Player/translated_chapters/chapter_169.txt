Chapter 168: Demanding Completion Conditions (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

As a simple DEMO, many players initially thought it was nothing much and would be easy to clear.

However, the reality exceeded everyone's expectations.

Before the Gameplay Expo, there wasn't much major news in the gaming industry, as many developers were holding back their announcements for the expo itself.

And *Silent Hill PT*, the DEMO used for the new version VR testing, became the focus of much media attention.

'Test Version DEMO *Silent Hill PT* Launched for One Day, Completion Rate is 1.76%'

However, when many media outlets compiled statistics based on Nebula Games Platform's trophy records and released the news, they themselves were stunned.

It had already been online for a day!

And judging from the discussions among players online, quite a few people must have played it!

Not even 2% completion rate achieved?

Was it too difficult?

Or too scary?

Many media outlets developed a certain curiosity about it.

Wu Tian from Game Timespace was also surprised after seeing this data.

Because it was just a test DEMO, not many media outlets had reviewed it.

But now, seeing this completion data, he was genuinely curious.

So, driven by curiosity, he opened the Nebula Games Platform, downloaded the DEMO, and entered the game.

Ten minutes later, Wu Tian, holding his heart, stood up from his chair, took a few deep breaths, pulled open the curtains with a slightly trembling hand, and basked in the outdoor sun.

Now he understood why the game's completion rate was so low!

Damn it, which average player could withstand that?!

Of course, while it was scary, there were still quite a few players who could clear it.

After all, this wasn't the highly immersive VR version; PC players had many tricks up their sleeves to reduce their fear.

Replacing the character models of the female ghost, for example, goes without saying.

After all, if not handled well, a horror game could easily turn into a 'shooting' game.

But what about adjusting the brightness, turning off the sound and playing crosstalk or cheerful songs, or having three to five guys sitting in a row, holding hands and playing the game together? Aren't these all methods?

A more crucial point was that *Silent Hill PT*'s completion conditions were quite demanding.

It wasn't until the next day that some hardcore players, through various research into the game and discussions on forums, finally figured out the completion conditions for *Silent Hill PT*.

What surprised many players was that *Silent Hill PT*, despite being just a test DEMO, actually told a simple story.

In the game's infinitely looping corridor, there were a total of fourteen loops, each triggering new plot content.

In the second loop of the corridor, players would be guided back to see a photo of the wife on the ground. After approaching and picking it up, three lines of text would appear: 'Can you hear my voice? Can you decipher this message? If you come looking for me, I'll wait for you forever.'

This was the game's first hint.

In various corners of the room, there would be photo fragments, a total of 8, but containing ten sentences. Each time one was collected, a sentence written in a different language would randomly appear, and these ten sentences were crucial clues for completing the game.

Pieced together, they were:

'I stood still while waiting, I whispered his name, his fingertips brushed my hand, the hand was cold, my body was trembling, waiting for it all to end, I didn't move an inch, his outstretched hand gradually disappeared into the mist, I believe I heard a phone call.'

Each time the player was killed by the female ghost Lisa, it meant game over, causing the game to crash and exit. However, this screen revealed a key piece of information: the protagonist's name in the game was J.

The further into the game, the more oppressive and eerie the atmosphere became.

And as the story unfolded, players could learn how Lisa died.

In yet another loop, players could hear sounds from the toilet through a peephole in the corridor.

Based on the sound effects, it could be deduced that Lisa had her eyes gouged out, her throat cut, and finally, her abdomen ripped open to remove the fetus, leading to her death.

Lisa's previous gurgling sounds were also due to choking on blood foam in her throat.

The reason Lisa was killed was also revealed through a mysterious, low narration: 'You were fired, so you drowned your sorrows in alcohol. She had to find a part-time job as a cashier in a convenience store. The only reason she earned money there was because the manager liked her. You haven't forgotten, have you? Just ten months ago.'

From this, it could also be inferred why the protagonist killed Lisa: he believed Lisa had cheated and that the child in her belly was not his.

After all information was collected, up to the final loop, completing three steps would lead to successful completion of the game.

The first step was to do nothing and wait for one minute in front of the digital clock for the time to reach midnight.

This confirmed a sentence collected earlier from the photos: 'I stood still while waiting.'

Then, walking ten steps forward, the first laugh of a baby would be heard.

At this point, the sound of Lisa's high heels would appear. Following the sound to find Lisa, maintaining a certain distance, and then speaking the protagonist's name 'J' (collected earlier) into the microphone.

This confirmed the sentence from the photos: 'I whispered his name.'

Afterward, Lisa would pounce towards the player, directly possessing them.

At the same time, the screen would gently shake. In the VR experience, players could feel the motor vibrations transmitted from the gaming pod.

For the PC version, controller users would feel vibrations, while mouse and keyboard users would instead experience screen vibrations.

This confirmed a passage from the collected photos: 'His fingertips brushed my hand, the hand was cold, my body was trembling.'

Then eerie music would play, but one must still remain motionless, confirming the later words: 'I didn't move an inch, his outstretched hand gradually disappeared into the mist.'

Once the music completely faded, the baby's second laugh would appear, and the phone in the corridor ringing also confirmed the last sentence: 'I believe I heard a phone call.'

Walking to the phone, a voice from it said: 'You have been chosen.'

The next moment, the door lock opened, and the completion achievement trophy immediately popped up.

After reading the guides summarized by the masters, countless players were all shocked.

Because this was simply too demanding!

Especially the final completion conditions; without any single clue, there was no way to deduce these steps.

As the high-level players created the completion guide, countless players online began discussing it.

“I'm utterly convinced! With these demanding completion conditions, if I played it, I couldn't clear it even in a year!”

“Brother upstairs, be more confident. You couldn't clear it in a lifetime. Your damn time record is 0.1 hours; how the hell could you clear it?!”

“Heh heh, 0.1 hours? You think too highly of him. That's Nebula Games Platform's default minimum record time. He definitely went in, took two glances, and exited! What, you ask me how I know? Because that's exactly what I did!”

“I strongly suggest a certain company sponsor this game; I think it could totally rival extreme sports!”

“The way you'll die is beyond your imagination!”

Although the DEMO guide had been released, players' discussions about *Silent Hill PT* did not cease.

And on live streaming platforms, even with a guide, some streamers still got scared just as expected.

A simple DEMO brought indescribable psychological trauma to countless players.

Some players even jokingly claimed they had developed PTSD symptoms, not daring to walk alone down the corridor to the toilet at night, afraid that opening the toilet door would reveal just another corridor in their own home.

If there was any news that could help players relax and turn their mood happy, it would be this.

That would probably be the fact that this year's Gameplay Expo was finally about to begin.

They could finally get more news about the eagerly awaited *Dark Souls* Prequel!
