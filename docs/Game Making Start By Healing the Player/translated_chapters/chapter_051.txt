Chapter 51 Damn it, shut up!

Looking at the brightly lit corridor, Sun Yixie let out a long breath.

Surely there wouldn’t be any danger in such a well-lit place?

Compared to dark scenes, a bright environment like this was much more comfortable.

Thinking this, Sun Yixie guided the protagonist forward. Just as the character was about to pass through a narrow gap, a low, deep voice suddenly boomed from the headphones: "Piglets!"

The game’s perspective violently shook. Just like before, Sun Yixie, sitting in his chair, screamed in panic in perfect synchronization with the in-game protagonist.

Accompanied by the familiar gesture of covering his face.

Through the gaps between his fingers, Sun Yixie saw on the screen a massive, blood-stained, hideous Strongman appear behind the protagonist.

Then, with brutal force, the monster hurled the protagonist down from the second floor.

The protagonist crashed from the second floor to the ground level. The screen gradually shifted from darkness to clarity, reflecting the impact.

At that moment, an NPC resembling a Priest approached him, speaking cryptic words.

"Who are you?"

"I understand. Merciful God, you have sent a messenger to find me, to protect your life... Child, you have been summoned."

Completely baffled by the dialogue, after a moment the protagonist struggled to his feet, and a new mission prompt appeared: *Escape the asylum, enter the security room and open the main gate.*

"Damn it, pulling such a sudden attack!"

Seeing the new quest, Sun Yixie glanced at his camera, which still had one battery left. He felt a wave of unease.

There was absolutely no sense of safety.

What if he ran into that fat monster again?

Fortunately, the scare had only lasted a moment. Sun Yixie actually felt that encountering the fat monster wasn’t the worst thing.

Unlike the traditional ghastly female ghost faces, this fat monster still looked somewhat human—just grotesquely fierce.

"What are these people doing?"

"Don’t tell me they’re all gonna turn into monsters later?"

In the hall, he finally saw other people, but they all sat with blank, expressionless faces.

Sun Yixie carefully guided the protagonist closer, but the patients sitting in wheelchairs and others ignored him completely.

As if they didn’t even see him.

He searched every corner and found a few batteries.

"These kinds of horror games… they’re just about building a scary atmosphere. In reality, there’s nothing!"

Sun Yixie tried to use words to ease his psychological stress.

But just as he passed by the patient in the wheelchair, the music in his headphones suddenly became intense and creepy. At the same time, the protagonist screamed loudly again.

Because the patient in the wheelchair lunged straight at him, his hideous face filling the entire computer screen.

In reality, Sun Yixie was so frightened he flung his mouse across the room.

"Damn it! Damn it!"

Slumped in his chair, Sun Yixie covered his face with both hands, mumbling his catchphrase under his breath.

At that very moment, a creaking sound rang out—the door to the room slowly opened.

"Damn it! Who—who is it?!" Like a startled bird, Sun Yixie’s body jolted as he turned toward the door.

"Who else? Me! Brother Sun, what the hell are you doing? Why’s the air conditioner set so low? Hey… what’s wrong with you?" Behind the door stood a middle-aged man, broad-shouldered and overweight, with a round face full of flesh, a short neck, and black-rimmed glasses. He looked at Sun Yixie, who was pale and wearing a down jacket, with obvious surprise.

"Brother Huang! You’re finally back!" Seeing the familiar face, Sun Yixie let out a long sigh of relief.

Huang Donglai glanced at the secondary monitor showing the live stream, then at the main game screen, quickly understanding what had happened.

"Brother Sun, you’re playing a horror game? Judging by your state, you’ve really been through trouble!" Huang Donglai clicked his tongue.

"Don’t talk about it, Brother Huang. You’re back now, that’s all that matters." Sun Yixie, feeling like he’d found backup, relaxed slightly. He picked up the thrown mouse and adjusted the camera. "Guys, just a small incident earlier. Let’s continue, okay?"

After saying that, he put his headphones back on.

With his good friend sitting beside him, Sun Yixie felt a sense of confidence slowly growing inside.

Back in the game.

Now he was completely empty-handed, with nothing but a broken camera.

Sun Yixie couldn’t help but nostalgically recall the horror games he’d played before—ones where you fought Zombies with firearms.

At least give him a weapon! With something in hand, he wouldn’t be this panicked.

"Finally found it."

Now that he wasn’t alone in reality, Sun Yixie felt his courage return.

Stumbling and dodging the mentally ill patients along the way, he safely reached the security room.

Entering the security room triggered a story segment. Sun Yixie glanced at the nearby monitor, then pulled his hat back on.

"Why are you wearing a hat, Brother Sun?" Huang Donglai asked curiously.

"The bullet comments said high energy ahead," Sun Yixie replied, glancing at the stream.

"Ah, come on, horror games don’t have that much high energy. And in such a bright place, what the hell are you afraid of?" Huang Donglai said.

The moment the words left his mouth, the lower-right corner of the surveillance monitor showed the Priest from earlier. After glancing at the camera, the Priest pulled the switch—immediately, the entire screen went pitch black. Power cut!

"Damn it!" Startled by the sudden blackout, Sun Yixie gasped.

"Ah, Brother Sun, calm down! The monster hasn’t even shown up—what are you scared of?" Huang Donglai continued.

At the same time, the security room door began to suffer violent impacts!

‘Bang!’ ‘Bang!’ ‘Bang!’

Each crashing sound felt like it was pounding directly into Sun Yixie’s heart.

"Damn it! Huang Donglai, shut up!" Sun Yixie shouted with a trembling voice. He glanced at the bullet comments in the live stream room and noticed a new prompt in the game.

"The cabinet! Yes! Yes! I can hide in the cabinet!"

Muttering, he frantically rushed to the cabinet and pressed the interaction key.

‘Bang!’

The moment he hid inside, another crashing sound echoed—the terrifying fat man had breached the door and entered.

He scanned the room.

The protagonist, hidden in the cabinet, could only hear his own rapid heartbeat.

Through the narrow gaps of the cabinet, lit by faint light, Sun Yixie stared at the fat man’s horrifying face. He pulled his body further back and squeezed his eyes shut.

One minute. Two minutes. Three minutes…

"Brother Sun, Brother Sun, why are you still hiding in the cabinet? The monster’s gone, probably won’t come back," Huang Donglai said, reading the stream’s bullet comments and looking curiously at Sun Yixie, who remained motionless like a turtle still crouched in the cabinet.

"Damn it, you shut up! I have my own strategy!"

Sun Yixie said, taking a deep breath before finally stepping out of the cabinet.

"Ah, Brother Sun, don’t get so worked up. I’m telling you, horror games follow a cycle. After a scary scene, the next part will be easier," Huang Donglai explained.

"Don’t lie to me, Brother Huang," Sun Yixie replied, skeptical.

"Ah, why would I lie to you? Trust me! The upcoming content definitely won’t be that scary!" Huang Donglai wore a face full of sincerity.
