Chapter 202: Hugely Popular (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)

At Nebula Games, Chen Xu was closely monitoring the performance of Don't Starve.

Compared to his previous releases, Don't Starve's performance didn't seem particularly impressive.

A first-day sales figure of 230,000 units wasn't eye-catching—especially considering that Don't Starve's price point was relatively low, that some marketing efforts had been made, and that Chen Xu was no longer the nameless newcomer he once was. By these standards, the sales numbers were far from astonishing.

Yet Chen Xu himself wasn't particularly dejected. Unlike previous releases, this time Don't Starve had launched exclusively on the Nebula Games Platform, with no simultaneous release on other game platforms.

Moreover, Nebula Games had described it as a sandbox game—a genre unfamiliar to many players. These factors led many gamers to adopt a wait-and-see attitude.

There was, however, one crucial point: Don't Starve currently held an exceptionally high player rating of 9.6 out of 10—an incredibly exaggerated score.

Of course, this was partly because the early buyers were mostly loyal fans of Nebula Games. As more mainstream players joined, the average score would inevitably drop.

But as word-of-mouth from the first wave of players began to spread, increasing numbers of gamers grew curious about Don't Starve and decided to purchase it.

Once these players bought and entered the game, after just a short play session to understand its gameplay, they were instantly captivated by this strange and immersive game world.

"This is the survival game I've always wanted—truly a classic!"

"Exactly! This might be the most deeply designed mini-game Chen Xu has created in the past two years, gameplay-wise."

"Agreed!"

"At the very least, this game is a massive surprise. Never expected it to be this engaging!"

Fans of Don't Starve lavished praise on the game.

And indeed, Don't Starve's various mechanics were exceptionally effective at retaining players.

First and foremost, the game established a clear objective right from the start.

When players haven't yet grasped the deeper core or gameplay mode of a title, they need a clearly defined goal.

In PVP games, the goal is straightforward: defeat your opponent to win.

In PVE games, it's about defeating the final boss to clear the game.

Don't Starve, as a sandbox game, directly gave players a concrete objective—even before they fully understood what a sandbox game actually was: survive, and stay alive as long as possible.

With this clear goal established, the game then expanded into richer, more layered gameplay.

Centered around the core theme of survival, the game introduced various physiological needs.

"If you get killed, you die"—a statement that sounds trivial, but in Don't Starve, this concept was taken to the extreme.

Without food, you'll starve to death.

If the weather is too cold, you'll freeze to death.

If your Sanity drops too low, you'll suffer mental breakdowns, hallucinate, and be hunted down by shadowy phantoms.

To avoid starvation, players must search for food; to avoid freezing, they must build houses and craft Warming Stones.

Additionally, the game features numerous dangerous monsters, and during specific periods, monster raids occur.

This forces players to craft weapons for self-defense.

All of these elements form stage-by-stage objectives that revolve around the central theme of survival.

Once players become familiar with these mechanics,

and are able to survive in this perilous world—even if just in a small corner—

that's when the real game begins.

Because once players realize they won't die as long as they don't take risks, the desire to explore the vast world becomes their new driving force.

To experience this living world.

This world operates by its own rules—large-scale seasonal cycles, and smaller-scale day-night transitions, with each season possessing unique characteristics.

For example, spring is frequently rainy. Without umbrellas or Rain Hats, players quickly suffer from high humidity, lowering both body temperature and Sanity, potentially leading to sudden death.

And if you're especially unlucky and take shelter under a tree during a thunderstorm, you'll need to watch out for lightning strikes.

Summer brings scorching heat. While it's efficient for drying meat, prolonged exposure to high temperatures can lead to heatstroke.

Trees in the forest or equipment at your base may even spontaneously combust due to extreme heat.

If you're particularly unfortunate and built your base too densely, one summer fire could quickly teach you the meaning of despair.

As for the most terrifying season—winter—it's even harsher. Beyond the deadly cold,

nearly all crops stop growing except for trees, meaning inadequate preparation could leave you without grass, Twigs, or food.

The simple desire to be full becomes intensely powerful in winter, letting players truly feel the significance behind the title Don't Starve.

But seasons aren't just superficial changes—they also affect creature behaviors.

For instance, it's best to avoid Beefalo in spring, as it's mating season.

Food items have expiration dates. Over time, they spoil and eventually rot into useless, rotten food if left unchecked.

Combat in Don't Starve also differs greatly from traditional games. Normally, defeating monsters relies on superior gear and skill.

But in Don't Starve, there are countless ways to deal with monsters.

You can craft the best equipment, brew powerful potions, and fight monsters head-on.

Or you can become a Trap Master, setting up elaborate trap fields in open areas, then using skillful positioning to watch monsters flail helplessly while you casually snack on desserts.

You could even employ tactics like "using a tiger to devour a wolf," letting monsters fight each other while you reap the benefits.

Items placed too close to a fire may catch fire themselves; if not extinguished quickly, even the most precious items will turn into nothing but Ashen One.

The randomized map generation further ensures that every survival attempt is a unique journey.

Of course, there's another crucial aspect: like most sandbox games, even without official DLC content,

player-created mods add immense enjoyment to the game.

The Workshop (modding platform) functionality had already become a defining feature of the Nebula Games Platform.

Don't Starve naturally embraced this as well. Chen Xu planned to officially release certain popular mods—such as those displaying Numerical Design or enabling Structure Geometry—that didn't disrupt game balance. This would serve as a starting point to inspire even more players to create their own mods.

After all, sandbox games thrive on player participation. Only when players actively contribute can a sandbox game sustain its vitality and spawn diverse, entertaining gameplay modes.

………………

However, while regular players were immersed in Don't Starve's rich gameplay, game designers in the industry who had been closely watching Chen Xu's work reacted far more strongly.

No designer would dare underestimate Chen Xu.

After all, up to this point, Chen Xu's track record was nothing short of legendary.

Setting aside other achievements, the Dark Souls series released last year and this year alone was enough to silence any doubters.

Yet the unique characteristic of Dark Souls made it extremely difficult to imitate. Its global popularity stemmed from the game's overall quality, not just one standout feature.

For example, the map design of its levels was nothing short of masterful.

But exceptional level design alone wasn't enough.

The game's difficulty curve was meticulously balanced, allowing players to gradually overcome powerful enemies through persistent effort.

But would Dark Souls have succeeded with just a well-crafted difficulty curve?

The answer is no.

It might have achieved moderate success, but certainly not the explosive popularity it currently enjoys.

It was the combination of intricate map design, balanced difficulty curve, and a grand, epic story and worldview setting

that collectively led to Dark Souls' current achievements.

Many players from Chen Xu's previous life mistakenly equated "Souls-like games" solely with high difficulty—a completely flawed understanding.

Because "Souls" isn't defined by a single element, but by the holistic integration of multiple aspects.

Thus, even today, despite numerous game designers enviously attempting to replicate Dark Souls, none have made a significant impact, let alone reached its towering heights.

But Don't Starve was entirely different.

Its arrival made many industry designers feel the same shock they'd felt when Chen Xu, after releasing a simple 18R adult game, suddenly dropped Undertale on the world.
