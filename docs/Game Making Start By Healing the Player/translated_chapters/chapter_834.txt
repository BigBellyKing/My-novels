### Chapter 833: A New Wife Appears!

As a Souls-like game, players could write ‘in-game messages’. Chen Xu had always been very strict, adopting a precise and official style for his messages. But thinking about it, countless players must have done the same. How then would later players find his messages among so many others?

Moreover, if players saw too many of these official messages, they would grow tired of liking or commenting on them. In contrast, after seeing Old Zhang's message, he felt like parting the clouds to see a clear sky. So, in-game messages could be this dirty! And this heavy-handed!

Especially looking at the 'buttocks are very useful' message, coupled with the corresponding gesture, he immediately couldn't hold back his laughter. Honestly asking himself, could he resist liking such a message? He asked himself three times, and the answer was always the same: he definitely couldn't resist!

However, after his moment of realization, Song Ren didn't mimic Zhang Yi by leaving a similar message. After all, judging from Zhang Yi's situation, a too-popular message wasn't always good. Besides, compared to the offline mode, the online mode was still a bit more interesting, allowing him to see messages left by others. He could see other players' White summon signs, feeling that he wasn't alone in this world.

Of course, more importantly, he could see the bloodstains on the ground. Why could he challenge Tree Sentinel for two consecutive hours? On one hand, as a veteran Souls player, he was accustomed to constantly learning from death and the satisfaction of finally defeating the BOSS. On the other hand, the countless red bloodstains on the ground gave him confidence. Just looking at the hundreds of blood-stained marks on the ground, Song Ren felt an indescribable mixture of exhilaration and discomfort. He wasn't fighting alone! How many Tarnished had died under this Tree Sentinel? He was definitely not the weakest!

Gradually familiarizing himself with the BOSS's moves, Song Ren also grew smarter through continuous combat. The Knight class initially had three weapons: a sword, a halberd, and a medium shield. If he equipped the halberd, his weight would inevitably become heavy, making his rolls slow and clumsy. The Tree Knight's attacks could empty a full stamina bar in basically two hits, and at close range, there was a chance to get hit by an Iron Mountain Tackle, which could instantly deplete his shield's stamina bar. As for Perfect Guarding, so far, Song Ren could only succeed two or three times out of ten.

So, after summarizing, Song Ren started using the halberd two-handed, transforming into a disciple of the poking faction. After hitting the Tree Sentinel, he would poke once, create distance, and wait for an opening in the opponent's moves. He had to admit, this tactic was incredibly effective. Being careful not to get greedy with attacks, combined with the Knight's starting armor and high health bar, even the second phase's shield slam wouldn't instantly kill him as long as he wasn't hit directly in the center. Including the starting Golden Seed, the total of five Flasks of Crimson Tears provided a very high margin of error.

After dancing around with the Tree Sentinel in the open field for about ten minutes, the BOSS's health was almost depleted. “Die!” Song Ren plunged his halberd into the Tree Sentinel’s body, taking away its last sliver of health. Looking at the new weapon he had acquired in his inventory: the Golden Halberd, Song Ren was filled with a sense of accomplishment. This was the greatest joy of Souls-like games: the satisfaction of finally conquering a formidable BOSS after countless deaths.

He decisively took a screenshot and silently sent it to Old Zhang. Although Zhang Yi had already defeated it in their previous conversation, it wasn't by his true skill. So, Song Ren felt he could definitely show off a bit.

“Hehe, not saying anything, are we?” Although Zhang Yi didn't reply in the friend list, Song Ren knew clearly that Zhang Yi must have seen the message he sent. So he silently opened his item inventory interface and sent the Golden Halberd's stats, which the BOSS dropped. Although from the stats, Song Ren felt this item would most likely be a toy-like weapon, he could still show it off now, as it was his honor for defeating the Tree Sentinel.

After sending two screenshots, Song Ren didn't bother the feigning-death Zhang Yi anymore but continued exploring. After all, judging from the still-locked map, this Souls game's map was simply too vast. As for the Dragon-Burnt Ruins Zhang Yi mentioned earlier, he didn't know where it was now. However, he didn't plan to wander aimlessly. Instead, he decided to push the main storyline first, at least to find the Fire Keeper. Otherwise, he couldn't level up, and losing all his Runes after a death later on would be too much of a loss. In Souls games, the most tragic thing wasn't being mercilessly beaten by a BOSS. It was dying without spending your money. While later on, players might not feel bad about losing hundreds of thousands or even millions of Runes after a death, losing a few thousand or ten thousand Runes in the early game would definitely make players feel distraught.

“But, in this installment, you can also collect materials to craft items?” At the Site of Grace at the Church of Elleh, after defeating the Tree Sentinel, Song Ren felt a sense of novelty upon seeing the newly unlocked function after talking to the merchant. This feature wasn't uncommon in traditional ARPGs, but it was quite new in a Souls-like game.

However, he didn't dwell on it too much. He continued to advance the game's progress, following the light transmitted by the Site of Grace. Soon, Song Ren arrived at the second Site of Grace, located beside the ruins before Gatefront. Each ruin was surrounded by a Site of Grace, and these so-called ruins were roughly equivalent to strongholds in most open-world games. Each ruin also contained a catacomb, which held a BOSS or a treasure chest, yielding special rewards upon defeat or opening.

“This part isn’t much different from most ARPG open-world games, but the lineup….” Song Ren felt frustrated recalling the scene just now. As soon as he entered the ruins, the guarding sentinels spotted him. Regular guards would just hack at him, but some torch-wielding guards, upon seeing him, pulled out a large horn from their backs. Blowing it into the sky, enemies around the ruins immediately rushed towards him as if they'd seen some great treasure. Wolves, regular soldiers, and elite shield-wielding soldiers—everything was there. He scurried away with his head in his hands. Fortunately, this game was an open-world, allowing him to run freely across the map. After running far to disengage, the enemies didn't pursue him relentlessly.

“What the heck, this Souls game feels like Assassin's Creed!?” Stealthily assassinating each mob, Song Ren quickly found the ruin's catacomb and obtained the ‘Storm Stomp’ Ash of War from a treasure chest. “Besides the exclusive Weapon Arts for special weapons, you can also replace weapon arts using Ashes of War!?” Seeing the newly unlocked function, Song Ren was surprised.

As a veteran Souls player who had played through the Dark Souls series, his impression of Weapon Arts was generally: flashy and gaudy. Even in Dark Souls, weapons were mostly just for slashing, and virtually no one used Weapon Arts. But from this Ashes of War system in Elden Ring, Song Ren caught a glimpse of something. Would Weapon Arts play a more significant role in this game?

However, this thought didn't last long, as something even more exciting in the game shifted his attention. After activating the Site of Grace before Gatefront, the thing Song Ren had been anticipating finally appeared. In the darkness, a mysterious woman in a black cloak emerged.

‘Tarnished, thou’rt of the mist.’

‘My name is Melina…’

‘I would like to make you a bargain.’

She slowly approached Song Ren, and her face-concealing black hood fell away. The moment he saw her face beneath the hood, Song Ren understood one thing: A new wife had appeared! The pink hair was a bonus point, the single closed left eye with its petal-like pattern added a mysterious bonus, her gentle voice was a bonus, and her attractive looks were an even bigger bonus. “It’s a pity, though. I still prefer white hair over pink hair,” Song Ren sighed.
