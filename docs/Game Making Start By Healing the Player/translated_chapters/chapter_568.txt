## Chapter 567: Is This the Treatment a Protagonist Deserves? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

This instantly reminded Song Ren of the changes Chen Xu had mentioned during the Nebula Games Carnival Direct.

Does this mean that the new work *Resident Evil: Village* has added a currency and store system?

Though surprised, Song Ren was overjoyed.

Because this might mean he could buy bullets with money later on.

After all, fear often stems from insufficient firepower.

In the previous *Resident Evil*, he had been terrified at first, but by the end, his greatest fear wasn’t encountering monsters—it was running out of inventory space.

Now, with the addition of an economic system in this installment, did it mean he could do whatever he wanted?

From a conventional perspective, Ethan should be cautious at this point, wary of attracting the werewolves' attention. But Song Ren had no such concerns.

Seeing the open door, he barged right in to loot everything. He also noticed the in-game map was incredibly convenient.

The map displayed three colors: black for unexplored areas, red for areas with uncollected resources, and blue for fully looted zones.

This completely changed the game's pace for Song Ren.

Screw the werewolves—his small pistol would take care of them all!

Houses? If he could enter, not a single item would be left behind!

*Resident Evil: Village*?

Ethan was here to plunder the Village!

In one room, he even found the shotgun he’d been dreaming of.

Though its Appearance/Shape clearly matched the unlucky old man’s from before, it was incredibly effective.

Two bullets per werewolf.

Moreover, Song Ren discovered numerous flour sacks and barrels of explosives scattered across the map, which could help Ethan deal with the monsters.

Killing monsters not only earned money but also had a chance to drop materials like gunpowder and parts.

These materials could be used to craft bullets, and nearly every accessible house in the village contained some ammunition.

While resources were still tight, not every monster needed to be fought.

Additionally, the game wasn’t pitch-black—just dim, like an overcast or rainy day.

This made the experience far more enjoyable for Song Ren.

Even with the snow-covered scenes, cramped environments, and occasional jumpscare werewolves, the new *Resident Evil: Village* was a massive improvement over its predecessor.

"This experience is absolutely peak!" Song Ren chuckled as he picked off the werewolf villagers one by one.

They were all resources—it almost felt like a grind game.

But soon, his contentment faded as something felt off.

The number of mobs in the Village seemed to be increasing—and so were their varieties.

Werewolves with Bows and Arrows firing flaming arrows from the rafters.

Werewolves with Hammers and cleavers.

*Whoosh… whoosh…*

The sound of flaming arrows cutting through the air filled the room. Though their accuracy was poor, Song Ren realized that if this continued, he’d eventually run out of ammo.

And then, death would be inevitable.

"Farewell! Time to bail!"

Dodging the surrounding werewolves with serpentine positioning, Song Ren bolted in the opposite direction.

He stumbled and rolled his way through, barely surviving thanks to the lowest difficulty setting.

"Damn it! What the hell is that? The White-Haired Lion King?!" At a blocked path marked by wooden stakes, Song Ren froze at the sight of a massive figure approaching.

The towering brute, covered in white hair, wielded a giant spiked hammer—exuding overwhelming pressure.

"No way… Is this a BOSS battle already? How am I supposed to fight this?!" Song Ren had no intention of engaging the Sledge-wielding White-Haired Lion King and immediately turned to flee.

"No, no, no… Stop chasing me! That’s enough already!"

"Big Bro, I’m calling you Big Bro—can you stop chasing me?!"

Despite his running, Song Ren took a few hits from the werewolves, and the screen turned blood-red, signaling Ethan’s impending demise.

But Ethan—and by extension, Song Ren—refused to give up. He fully immersed himself in the protagonist’s role.

His daughter Rose was still missing, waiting for him!

How could he fall here?

This thought grew stronger—until an arrow struck Ethan’s thigh.

Amid his sprint, the sound of an arrow whistled through the air.

*Thud!*

The arrow embedded itself in Ethan’s leg.

With a cry of pain, Ethan collapsed to the ground.

The surrounding werewolves closed in, but a deafening roar interrupted them.

The White-Haired Lion King leaped down from the Rooftops, and the Regular werewolves immediately cleared a path—clearly, this was their leader.

The giant, lion-like figure loomed over Ethan, blocking out the light.

Just as the White-Haired Lion King reached Ethan, the distant sound of galloping hooves announced the arrival of two werewolves on horseback.

As Song Ren worried about Ethan’s fate, a bell tolled in the distance.

The White-Haired Lion King and the other werewolves turned toward the sound—then, without a second glance at Ethan, they sprinted toward the bell as if summoned.

At the very least, Ethan was spared.

He pulled the arrow from his thigh and bandaged the wound with a cloth.

As he staggered to his feet, he spotted a limping figure in the distance.

A person?!

In this cursed Village, there was still someone alive?!

And this wasn’t the location from the radio either!

Ethan hurriedly limped toward the figure.

"This is too brutal!"

"They’re not even treating Ethan like a human!"

"Is this the treatment a protagonist deserves? Which protagonist suffers as much as Ethan?!"

Song Ren couldn’t help but feel indignant on Ethan’s behalf.

Compared to other Nebula Games characters—even those who died—none had it as bad as Ethan.

And it hadn’t even been an hour yet!

His wife was dead, his child was missing, he’d lost two Fingers, and now he’d taken an arrow to the thigh. Who knew what horrors awaited him next?
