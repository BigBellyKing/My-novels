Chapter 380: VR Scene Experience (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Compared to the messy events of other game developers, Nebula Games Platform's events are always so simple and unpretentious.

In the store interface, all participating games uniformly displayed a green '%' discount symbol. Although games released this year, such as *Red Dead Redemption*, *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*, and *Rainbow Six Siege*, wouldn't be included in the discount section—after all, they still needed a period of exclusivity—some older games, like *Monster Hunter: World* and *Dark Souls*, were regular fixtures in the sales.

Seeing those green discount symbols, players' hands seemed to move uncontrollably, clicking the mouse to add items to their shopping carts, pulling out their phones, and scanning QR codes to pay.

And it wasn't just domestically; it also included overseas. After acquiring Target Software, many of Overseas Nebula Games' titles began self-operation. Furthermore, the relevant contracts signed in earlier years didn't stipulate any exclusive content. Thus, Overseas Nebula Games also had its own platform. It just didn't have as many players as domestically. However, thanks to games like *Warcraft*, *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*, and *Red Dead Redemption*, the Overseas Nebula Games platform also attracted a considerable audience. Many overseas game developers also brought their games to the Nebula Games platform, including excellent independent games and mid-to-small scale productions.

Although overseas players didn't have the custom of celebrating Spring Festival like those domestically, and Christmas had long passed, as a Game Designer, how could one not treat everyone equally? So, corresponding discounts were also launched overseas. VR themes? Given away just the same!

Moreover, Chen Xu thoughtfully enabled the pop-up window mode on the Nebula Games platform. This was to remind players not to forget to claim the *Outlast* VR game theme that everyone received; it was all his heartfelt gesture!

“Old Zhang, how many games did you buy?” Song Ren sounded very excited in the voice channel. He made a huge profit this time! He directly bought five games he wanted, though none were from Nebula Games.

Because he always bought Nebula Games' titles on release.

“I only bought two, nothing too interesting. But I did open quite a few *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare* crates. I got the bright pink M13 after just 20 crates.” Zhang Yi also sounded quite happy in the voice channel.

“Then you made a profit!” Song Ren said.

“Exactly. Oh, by the way, did you claim this VR theme?” Zhang Yi smiled, remembering something as he asked.

“Of course I did! And this theme seems a bit different from before; you can even invite others to join online, up to 5 people!” Song Ren said to Zhang Yi, recalling something.

“It’s just a VR theme, isn’t it just for sightseeing? At most, they’ll add a little extra content, it’s not a real game.” Zhang Yi didn't pay much attention. This time, besides releasing a few pre-made VR themes to players, the newly added online multiplayer feature was also a point of interest. It was mainly for testing purposes. After all, both *Dark Souls* and *Monster Hunter: World* have a multiplayer mode. As for the number, setting it to five players primarily utilized an architectural system from *Rainbow Six Siege*; it wasn't a formal game anyway, just a VR theme.

“I wonder how stunning the VR scenes for these games are! Old Zhang, I’ve invited you, come take a look!” Old Song sent the invitation.

“You should at least visit a spectacular VR theme! What the heck, your first stop is Mount Massive Asylum.” Zhang Yi was speechless looking at the invitation link Song Ren sent.

“Ahem, we must conquer our unknown fears and prevent *Outlast* from becoming our inner demon!” Song Ren said with a light cough.

“Oh, come on! *Outlast* is your inner demon, not mine.” Zhang Yi retorted with a pout.

“You’re still talking! Wasn’t it you who recommended *Outlast* to me in the first place?!” Song Ren’s eyes widened.

Although his actions couldn't be directly rendered in the VR theme, he still had to project his aura.

“Good things, of course, should be shared with brothers.” Zhang Yi replied, a little awkwardly.

“Taking advantage of this special opportunity, let’s experience Mount Massive Asylum from *Outlast*. I haven’t explored it yet. Let’s bolster our courage and then clear it. After all, among all games produced by Nebula Games, *Outlast* is the only one we haven’t finished! Wouldn’t it be great to play this VR theme, get familiar with it, and then clear *Outlast*?” Song Ren outlined his beautiful vision.

As they spoke, the two entered the VR game theme.

“Holy cow! This really is Mount Massive Asylum!” Song Ren was utterly shocked by the scene before him.

Because it was completely different from what he remembered. First, the time had turned to day. The originally dilapidated Mount Massive Asylum was now very clean and tidy, without the bloodstains from the game. Although it was a Western-style building, it was filled with a strong festive atmosphere of the New Year. The entire Mount Massive Asylum was decorated with lanterns and streamers, with two large red lanterns hanging at the entrance, and couplets pasted on the main door. Pushing open the door and walking in, the first person they saw was a Priest, who very kindly offered New Year's greetings. Then, the Fat Security Guard Uncle and the nail-clipping doctor were making dumplings, and even offering a very fitting nail-clipping service. The Haier Brothers were leading a group of patients in rehearsing a show, and as for Jeremy, the head of the Walrider Project in the final DLC, he was happily celebrating the Spring Festival with Rudolf, Waylon Park, and others.

The originally grotesque appearances were directly covered by more festive clothing, completely removing any sense of fear.

“Suddenly, I feel like *Outlast* isn’t scary anymore,” Song Ren remarked, looking at everything before him.

“Why don’t you try to clear it?” Zhang Yi interjected.

Hearing Zhang Yi’s words, images of playing *Outlast* a few years ago flashed through Song Ren’s mind, still vivid. After a moment of silence, he said, “Let’s move on to the next segment.”

“Hey, Old Song, did you notice? This transition doesn’t require exiting; you can switch directly within the theme.” At this moment, Zhang Yi noticed a small detail.

“It’s true!” Song Ren was also a little surprised, looking at the system prompts.

Typically, when switching VR themes, you would have to exit the current one before moving to the next. But now, Song Ren discovered that all of Nebula Games' VR themes were interconnected.

For example, from the *Outlast* scene, they chose to go to the *Monster Hunter: World* scene. They just needed to get into the car parked at the entrance of Mount Massive Asylum to drive to the next scene.

After about 20 seconds of driving animation, which was clearly an in-between loading screen, they passed through a dark tunnel, and what appeared before Song Ren and Zhang Yi was Astera Settlement from *Monster Hunter: World*.

Just like the previous *Outlast* theme scene, the *Monster Hunter: World* theme scene was also very festive.

However, Song Ren and Zhang Yi felt a bit disappointed that, unlike the previous *Red Dead Redemption* theme scene, this was also just a sightseeing scene. They wondered if there would be any future updates.

The transition animation, however, was quite interesting. Instead of the imagined Wingdrake flight, it featured a very distinctive Palico pushing a cart.

They also visited the Firelink Shrine from *Dark Souls*, though the transition animation for leaving Firelink Shrine was still very traditional: sitting before a bonfire to teleport, then a black screen.

But upon reaching the final *Warcraft* scene, Song Ren and Zhang Yi couldn't help but exclaim in admiration.

Because compared to Mount Massive Asylum, Firelink Shrine, and Astera Settlement, this human capital city named Stormwind was clearly on a different level.

One could only say it truly lived up to its status as the highest-tier freebie!
