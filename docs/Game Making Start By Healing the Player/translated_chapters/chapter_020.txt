Chapter 20: The Astonishing Fourth Wall Break

What did this mean?

It knew he had loaded a save file?

It was talking to him, not to the character in the game?

Everything he had done was being counted?

Wu Tian suddenly felt a chill run down his spine, instinctively glancing back at the empty office.

Clearly, Flowey in the game wasn't talking to the game's protagonist.

It was talking directly to him, the player sitting in front of the computer.

It knew what he had done, it even knew he had loaded a save file and restarted.

Even though Wu Tian knew it was just part of the game's design.

He was still shocked.

And what did Flowey's words mean?

Did it also possess this power?

What was 'Resolve'?

While exploring the castle, he had encountered some star-like shimmering symbols.

After investigating, he would usually get a message: "It fills you with determination."

In that instant, he felt countless questions arise in his mind.

But more than that, there was a sense of astonishment.

After all, he had initially thought this was just an ordinary RPG game.

But with Flowey's appearance, it was as if the Fourth wall had been broken.

What other content awaited him?

With this thought, Wu Tian continued to progress.

One unique character after another appeared in the game.

Sans, who offered him a whoopee cushion handshake, and Papyrus, who was keen on stopping him with puzzles—this pair of The two skeleton brothers left a deep impression on him.

Sans, appearing quite lazy, loved to tell skeleton-related puns to tease his brother Papyrus.

His brother, on the other hand, was enthusiastic about using puzzle mechanisms to block the protagonist.

However, the funny thing was that if he got stuck on a puzzle, the skeleton would actually reveal the answer to the puzzle on its own.

Then there was Undyne, a somewhat chuuni fish-person, who relentlessly hunted him down. After reaching the lava map, she would collapse on the ground due to dehydration. Conveniently, there was a water cooler nearby. At this point, he could choose to save her or not.

Dr. Alphys in the lab seemed a bit dull and shy, a quintessential Otaku.

Later, during the quiz battle against the robot she created, Dr. Alphys would even use her hands to show the player the correct answers.

And based on the robot's answer to the final question, he could tell that she still had feelings for Undyne, the fish-person who had been chasing the protagonist.

And the performance before the duel with the robot, it was simply jaw-dropping.

However, what truly shocked Wu Tian was the conversation he had with Sans in the golden, magnificent corridor just before facing the final BOSS of the game.

From the very beginning, Wu Tian simply assumed that *Undertale*'s setting borrowed from typical RPG games.

Even though Flowey's earlier appearance had given him a first taste of shock and astonishment.

Yet, he had played the entire game following the rules of an RPG.

An RPG game, isn't it normal to fight monsters and level up?

Miss Spider, and some other monsters he encountered along the way—the ones he didn't like, he spared; the ones that were troublesome and he found unpleasant, he cut down.

But now, Sans's words made Wu Tian realize he had completely misunderstood.

EXP was not
