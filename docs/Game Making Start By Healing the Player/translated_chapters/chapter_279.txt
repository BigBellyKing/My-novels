Chapter 278: Arthas (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Chapter 278: Arthas (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Meanwhile, Song Ren, who had just finished watching the same CGI and was equally thrilled yet unable to vent his excitement, heard Zhang Yi's voice from the voice channel. He quickly switched out to unmute his mic, ready to dive into an enthusiastic conversation and release his pent-up emotions—only to hear a 'ding dong' sound from the channel.

It was the sound indicating someone had left the voice channel. Looking at the channel now containing only himself,

Song Ren thought back to the game's CGI he had just seen, and his entire body went numb.

Who was that!

This is so damn rude!

You unmuted your mic just to say something and then immediately left!?

Staring at the game screen, Song Ren felt utterly憋闷, so he decided to take a screenshot and post it on WeChat Moments.

'This RTS is absolutely awesome!'

After sending it, Song Ren finally felt slightly better and turned back to continue playing.

In fact, it wasn't just Song Ren and Zhang Yi who were incredibly excited.

Countless players following Warcraft were equally thrilled.

Since Warcraft had launched with a free demo version, players of all opinions had downloaded it almost immediately to try it out.

And upon playing, both fans of RTS and those who rarely touched the genre were instantly captivated.

For RTS enthusiasts, the various settings and innovations in Warcraft felt like hooks tugging directly at their hearts.

Attack types, defense types, the structures, unit types, tech trees, and hero mechanics in the story campaign—

It completely revolutionized traditional RTS gameplay. For many hardcore RTS gamers, these unique systems promised an entirely fresh experience in multiplayer matches.

As for casual players, they didn’t particularly care about RTS mechanics.

They had no idea about hero settings or unit attributes.

But the game's story and the exquisitely crafted CGI completely won them over.

RTS games are notoriously bad at storytelling—this is an industry consensus.

Due to the lack of sense of immersion and the typically rough modeling, RTS games struggle to deliver dramatic storytelling that draws players in.

But Warcraft was completely different.

Not only was the story tightly paced and gripping, but it was also ridiculously lavish!

Every other level featured a full CGI animation to introduce the game's plot and background world.

For an RTS game to have such refined modeling, combined with character dialogue and close-up shots, was unprecedented. While it couldn't match RPGs in cinematic quality, among RTS titles, there was simply no competition.

This instantly made even those who typically disliked RTS games fall in love with Warcraft's story.

What amazed players even more was how substantial the demo content actually was.

Previously, the demo for Monster Hunter: World, covering everything from Small Jagras to Jagras, lasted only about two hours.

But Warcraft's demo was so rich that many players forgot they were only playing a demo.

The demo alone revealed just a glimpse of the game's vast worldview.

The conflict between the Orcs and the Human race, along with the mysterious plague—these elements in the first chapter's story deeply immersed the players.

…………………

"I really feel like Prince Arthas has changed," Zhang Yi couldn't help but sigh with emotion.

The plague had swept across all of Stratholme, turning every citizen into soldiers of the Scourge. In response, Arthas made a decision—to personally kill these civilians before they could become the Scourge's pawns.

But Uther refused this order, and Jaina, shocked and disappointed, abandoned Arthas.

What Zhang Yi remembered most vividly was the scene in the rain where Arthas quietly tried to stop Jaina from leaving.

Facing Arthas’s plea, Jaina simply said, "I'm sorry, Arthas... I can't watch you do this."

This was the content Zhang Yi had experienced so far, and it made him feel that Arthas, once a proud prince, had become terrifyingly obsessed.

Then came a royal decree from the capital: Arthas's mentor, Uther, had returned to Lordaeron and convinced King Terenas to order Arthas and his Expeditionary Force to return home.

But hatred had consumed Arthas’s heart. He swore vengeance against the Dreadlord and the unseen hand spreading the plague, even resorting to actions that violated the Paladin's code of ethics.

Arthas pursued the Dreadlord all the way to Northrend, where he secretly hired local native mercenaries to destroy the expedition’s ships, cutting off their only route home—a true Warcraft version of burning the boats.

It was at this moment that Zhang Yi finally realized the former Prince Arthas had slowly lost his sanity to hatred.

Upon arriving in Northrend, this continent covered in glaciers, Arthas and his Expeditionary Force had no way to retreat.

Snowflakes drifted endlessly from the sky, and the game’s BGM suddenly grew oppressive.

At this point, Arthas still held the warhammer of a Paladin.

But his eyes burned only with flames of vengeance.

Although his companion Muradin sensed that Arthas had changed and loudly questioned him,

as a friend, he still chose to follow Arthas on the quest to find the legendary artifact, Frostmourne.

Finally, deep within Northrend’s glaciers, they discovered the ice-locked resting place of Frostmourne.

Entering the cave, Muradin realized Frostmourne bore a powerful evil curse. But Arthas, blinded by his thirst for revenge, ignored his friend’s warnings and grasped the blade.

As the ice shattered, Muradin was knocked unconscious by flying enchanted ice shards, while Arthas, gripping Frostmourne tightly, coldly ignored his friend’s fate.

Expressionless, he carried Frostmourne out of the cave. In the frozen wastelands of Northrend, the last shred of Arthas’s humanity was crushed.

After successfully slaying the Dreadlord Mal'Ganis,

the screen cut to black for a brief moment, followed by another CG animation, making Zhang Yi’s heart race with anticipation.

First came the distant tolling of bells.

Amid a sacred melody, the camera swept over the skies of Lordaeron City-state, showing Arthas’s return.

Countless citizens of Lordaeron erupted in cheers and celebration.

Pink flower petals fell from the sky, swirling through the air and surrounding the royal city, welcoming Arthas back as a hero.

Yet, at the very moment Arthas entered the city, the black-robed figure reached out and caught a falling petal. The grand, celebratory music instantly shifted into a haunting, cold background audio.

Holding the petal, Arthas gently rubbed it between his thumb before coldly discarding it. He raised his head, glancing at the sky and the cheering crowd on the city walls.

No one noticed that Arthas’s once-golden hair had turned deathly pale.

The warhammer symbolizing the Knights of the Silver Hand was now Frostmourne.

The silver-blue Paladin armor he once wore had transformed into undead armor adorned with skeletons.

In the magnificent and resplendent throne room, King Terenas sat on the throne, waiting for his son.

The next moment, the doors were violently thrown open. Arthas entered the hall, followed by his entourage.

Drawing his sword, he knelt before his father.

Terenas rose, a mix of joy and confusion on his face.

"Oh, my child!"

Yet the kneeling Arthas gave no response.

For in Arthas’s mind, only one voice remained.

And before him, Frostmourne glowed with an eerie, ghostly blue light.

‘You no longer need to sacrifice yourself for your people.’

‘You no longer need to bear the heavy burden of the crown.’

‘I have arranged everything.’

As the voice echoed in his mind, Arthas abruptly rose and marched straight toward his bewildered father, sword in hand.

The camera shifted, showing the reflection on the wall behind the throne—Arthas now stood before Terenas.

‘What is this? My child, what are you doing?’

In the reflection, Arthas raised Frostmourne high and said without emotion, "Claiming your throne, my father..."

With a blood-curdling scream, Frostmourne pierced through the king’s chest.

In the reflection, the elderly king slumped lifelessly in his seat. The blood-stained crown rolled from the steps onto the floor.

The bells continued to toll, but now they carried Arthas’s cold, emotionless words.

‘This kingdom shall be destroyed...’

‘From the ruins, a new order shall rise...’

‘It will shake the very foundation of this world...’

The CGI ended, and Zhang Yi remained stunned, unable to snap out of the shock.

But the next moment, a pop-up message on the screen left him utterly speechless.

[Demo Experience Ended. Official Version Launches on November 15]

Staring at the notification, Zhang Yi was completely speechless.

Again!?

Just when it was getting exciting, and he was dying to know what would happen to Arthas next—

Why the hell did it end so suddenly!?
