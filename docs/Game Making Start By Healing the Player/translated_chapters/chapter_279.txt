Chapter 278: Arthas (Requesting subscriptions, monthly passes)

Song Ren, who had just finished watching this CG and was brimming with unvented excitement, heard Zhang Yi's voice in the voice channel. He had just switched over and unmuted his microphone, preparing for a lively chat to release his inner thrill, when he heard a 'ding-dong' sound from the voice channel.

It was the sound of a user leaving the channel. He stared at the voice channel, now with only himself left.

Thinking about the game's CG footage he had just seen, Song Ren felt completely numb.

"What kind of person is this!"

"This is too much!"

"You unmuted just to say something to me, then ran off!?"

Looking at the game screen, Song Ren felt truly stifled, so he chose to take a photo and post it on his WeChat Moments.

"'This RTS is absolutely mind-blowing!'"

After sending it, Song Ren felt a little better and turned back to the game in front of him.

In reality, it wasn't just Song Ren and Zhang Yi who were incredibly excited.

Countless players following Warcraft were equally excited.

Because Warcraft adopted a free trial version upon launch, players, regardless of their initial opinions, basically downloaded it immediately to give it a try.

And with this trial, both RTS enthusiasts and those who didn't usually play RTS games were instantly won over by the game.

For RTS fans, the various settings and innovations in Warcraft felt like a hook lodged in their hearts.

Attack types, defense types, as well as the buildings, various unit types, technology, and hero settings in the campaign storyline.

It could be said that it completely overturned previous RTS gameplay. Many dedicated RTS players could already feel that these unique settings would offer an incredibly novel experience for multiplayer competitive play.

As for ordinary players, they weren't particularly concerned about RTS gameplay.

They had no idea about hero settings or unit attribute settings.

However, the game's story and its meticulously produced CGs completely captivated them.

Creating compelling stories in RTS games was generally acknowledged in the industry as difficult.

This was due to a lack of immersion, and most RTS games had relatively rough models, making it hard to create a sense of immersion for players through story presentation.

But Warcraft was completely different.

Not only was the storyline tight and captivating, but more importantly, it was so lavish!

Every two levels featured a CG animation, used to introduce players to the game's story and background.

As an RTS game, it managed to create such exquisite models, combined with dialogue and close-ups. While it couldn't compare to RPGs in this regard, among RTS games, none could rival it.

This instantly made even some players who disliked RTS games fall in love with Warcraft's story.

What surprised many players even more was how rich the content of this trial version truly was.

Previously, the demo content for Monster Hunter: World, from Small Jagras to Great Jagras, was only about two hours long.

However, Warcraft's trial content made many players almost forget that they were just playing a demo.

The demo content alone had already revealed the tip of the iceberg of the game's vast background world.

The conflict between Orcs and Humans, along with the eerie plague, made players deeply immersed in the first chapter's story content within this trial version.

……………………

"Prince Arthas truly seems to have changed," Zhang Yi couldn't help but exclaim.

A plague swept through Stratholme, threatening to turn everyone into Scourge soldiers. In response, Arthas made a decision: to personally kill these ordinary citizens to prevent them from becoming minions of the Scourge.

But Uther refused this order, and Jaina, expressing shock and disappointment, abandoned Arthas and left.

What lingered most vividly in Zhang Yi's memory was the scene where Arthas quietly tried to keep Jaina in the rain.

Faced with Arthas's plea, Jaina simply uttered: "I'm sorry, Arthas... I can't watch you do this."

This was the content Zhang Yi had experienced so far, and it made him feel that Arthas, the once proud prince, had become incredibly paranoid.

Afterwards, a decree arrived from the royal capital stating that Arthas's teacher, Uther, had persuaded the King upon his return to Lordaeron to order Arthas and the Expeditionary Force back home.

But hatred consumed Arthas's heart. He swore to make the Dreadlord and the dark hand that spread the plague pay in blood, even committing acts that violated the Paladin's code of ethics.

Arthas pursued the Dreadlord all the way to Northrend. There, he hired local indigenous mercenaries, secretly destroying the Expeditionary Force's ships, cutting off their only path back home, executing a Warcraft version of "burning one's bridges."

It was at this point that Zhang Yi finally realized that Prince Arthas had slowly lost his sanity consumed by hatred.

Upon arriving in Northrend, on this glacier-covered continent, Arthas and his Expeditionary Force had no room for retreat.

Snowflakes continuously fell from the sky, and the game's BGM suddenly became quite oppressive.

At this time, Arthas still held his Paladin's warhammer.

But in his eyes, there was only the fire of hatred.

Even though his companion Muradin already felt Arthas had changed and loudly questioned him.

Yet, as a friend, he still decided to follow Arthas to search for the legendary artifact, Frostmourne.

Finally, deep within Northrend's glaciers, they found the location where Frostmourne was encased in ice.

Upon entering the cave, Muradin also discovered that Frostmourne was imbued with a powerful evil curse, but Arthas, whose eyes were blinded by the fire of vengeance, disregarded his old friend's warning and picked up Frostmourne.

As the ice broke apart, Muradin was knocked unconscious by flying, magical ice shards, while Arthas, gripping Frostmourne with both hands, completely disregarded his old friend's fate.

Expressionless, he left the cave with Frostmourne. Deep within Northrend's frozen wasteland, Arthas's last shred of humanity was crushed.

With the successful slaying of the Dreadlord Mal'Ganis.

The next moment, the screen went black briefly, then another CG animation began, making Zhang Yi's anticipation rise involuntarily.

First, a distant bell chime resonated.

Amidst the sacred melody, the camera swept over the Lordaeron City-state from above, looking down on the returning Arthas.

Countless citizens of Lordaeron erupted in shouts of joy and celebration.

Pink petals fell from the sky, swirling to envelop the royal capital, welcoming Arthas as he returned to Lordaeron in a heroic fashion.

However, the moment Arthas entered the city, the black-robed Arthas stretched out his right hand and caught a petal from the air. The grand and festive ceremonial music instantly changed its tune, becoming a background of resentment and cold silence.

Holding the fallen petal, Arthas's thumb gently rubbed it, then he coldly discarded it, looking up at the sky and the cheering crowds on the city walls.

No one noticed that Arthas's golden hair had now turned a lifeless, pale white.

The warhammer in his hand, which once represented the Knights of the Silver Hand, had also transformed into Frostmourne.

His Paladin's silver-blue armor was now a Necrotic battle-plate adorned with skulls.

In the resplendent Throne Room, King Terenas sat on his throne, awaiting his son.

The next moment, the grand doors were roughly shoved open, and Arthas entered the hall, followed by his retinue.

Drawing his sword and kneeling, Arthas bowed to his father, the King.

With surprise and some trepidation, Terenas rose to greet his son.

"Oh, my son!"

However, Arthas, still kneeling, offered no response.

Because at this moment, in Arthas's mind, only one voice remained.

Simultaneously, Frostmourne before him emitted an eerie, ghostly blue light.

"'You no longer need to sacrifice yourself for your people.'"

"'You no longer need to bear the heavy burden of the crown.'"

"'I have seen to everything.'"

As this voice echoed in his mind, Arthas abruptly rose and, sword in hand, walked directly towards his bewildered father.

The camera shifted. In the reflection on the wall behind the throne, Arthas had already reached Terenas.

"'What is this? My son, what are you doing?'"

In the reflection, Arthas raised Frostmourne high and said emotionlessly: "Succeeding you, Father..."

With a pained cry, Frostmourne pierced the King's chest.

In the reflection, the elderly King's body slumped in his seat, his blood-stained crown rolling down the steps onto the floor.

The bell chimes still echoed, but with them, Arthas's cold and merciless words also resonated.

"'This kingdom shall fall...'"

"'From the ashes, a new order shall rise...'"

"'And it shall shake the very foundations of this world...'"

The CG ended, and Zhang Yi had not yet recovered from the shock.

But the next moment, a pop-up window appeared on the screen, making Zhang Yi's face darken.

[Trial experience has ended. The official version will be launched on November 15th]

Looking at the pop-up, Zhang Yi was speechless.

"It cut off again!"

He was just getting into it, still curious about what kind of story Arthas would have next.

"What the heck, why did it suddenly end!?"
