Chapter 92: Done, Already Being Made

Chapter 92: Done, Already Being Made

The promotional video wasn't long.

It was just a simple CG cutscene.

It didn't mention even a bit about the gameplay content of the entire game.

Yet it still excited all the players.

One reason was the sudden surprise; the other was that this promotional video was simply too exquisite.

Just watching it was enough for players to feel that Nebula Games had clearly spared no expense.

With this trailer, combined with Chen Xu's mention of a PC blockbuster, it was clearly convincing.

If it weren't a major production, could the trailer be this awesome?

As the promotional video ended, the audience erupted into cheers and applause.

'Awesome! I didn't expect this year's exhibition to have such an unexpected delight!'

'Never thought Chen Xu was waiting for us here—this should be Chen Xu's first major production!'

'Incredible! When that god-devouring Aldrich appeared, and then the Farron Undead Legion and Yhorm the Giant showed up, paired with the background music, it was just unbelievably intense!'

'It shocked my mom for the entire year!'

'I'm already eagerly wanting to play this game!'

'+1! The announcement was made at the exhibition, and the trailer has already come out—surely the game is almost finished, right?'

'Absolutely! Probably won't be long before we can finally play it!'

'Those Farron Undead Legion and Yhorm the Giant must be the game's bosses, right? Just imagining fighting them for three hundred rounds—pure delight!'

The entire audience was boiling with excitement. At the same time, the commotion attracted players from other booths.

After learning that Nebula Games had announced such a bombshell news, these players also became restless.

They shouted from below the stage, demanding Chen Xu to replay the trailer.

Meanwhile, Nebula Games' booth became completely packed. The venue's security staff were even beginning to feel overwhelmed.

Qin Yi and other male employees from the company attending the exhibition joined in to help maintain order.

There was no choice—just like watching a street spectacle, once it started, it attracted even more people.

This was a kind of herd mentality, especially at such an exhibition.

At the same time, many players shouted questions to Chen Xu, who had just stepped off the stage.

'Chen Xu, when will *Dark Souls* be released?'

'What genre is the new game? Could you introduce it?'

'Is the new game related to the Warrior of Love?'

The players were extremely passionate. Of course, some were also pulling a prank.

Ask about the new game if you want, but why bring up the Warrior of Love?

Yet once someone started, others followed, and the topic gained quite a bit of volume.

Chen Xu couldn't just feign death. He had to respond one by one.

Smiling at the crowd, Chen Xu nodded gently. 'When will it be released? That depends on the team's development progress. Since this is Nebula Games' first time developing a large-scale game, apart from technical issues, there are many difficulties to overcome.'

'But what I can reveal is that the game is already being made.'

'We hope to create a perfect game for players. So I can't clearly state the launch date here, because no one remembers those trash games that were released on time.'

Hearing this, the players wore satisfied smiles.

Behind the booth, team members Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and others silently lowered their heads.

Yes, the development progress was very promising.

The game was already being made—when had Brother Xu ever lied to you? The folder had already been created two months ago.

Meanwhile, Chen Xu continued answering questions on stage.

'As for what genre *Dark Souls* is, broadly speaking, it's an ARPG. But compared to all existing ARPGs on the market, its style is completely different. It will be a brand-new type of ARPG.'

'Finally, regarding whether this game has anything to do with love—well, I've explained this more than once. Every game is filled with my love for the players. As for whether the game itself has a so-called attribute of love, yes, it does. Many players should have already sensed it from the trailer.'

'The setting of *Dark Souls* is just like its name—the entire world has a despairing atmosphere. And within this atmosphere of despair, players must take on the role of a Firelinker, passing on the flame in this world.'

'This is a grand form of love, just like Shennong tasted all herbs, or Yu the Great tamed the floods, passing his home three times without entering.'

The audience was extremely excited.

Yet this gameplay Expo, with the fun *Fall Guys* and highly replayable *Sanguosha*, had already made a strong impression.

At the same time, many players in attendance already mentally prepared themselves.

They realized *Dark Souls* might have a rather tormented story.

After all, a world steeped in despair, carrying the flame of hope—combined with the previous *Outlast* and *Overcooked*—had already stunned them.

Although *Sanguosha* and *Fall Guys* seemed to bring Chen Xu back to the warm persona of the Warrior of Love,

it was clear this game called Dark Souls wasn't going to be a happy story.

The trailer alone exuded a desolate, decaying atmosphere.

So many of Chen Xu's loyal fans were already bracing themselves.

So what if it's a bit tormented? What's the big deal?

They'd already been tormented before while playing *To the Moon*.

……………………………

Just as during the first four days of the gameplay Expo, most players were drawn to *Fall Guys* and *Sanguosha*,

on this final day, every player was captivated by Nebula Games' *Dark Souls*.

Everyone was discussing this game. Two hours after the trailer premiered at the exhibition, it was uploaded to both Chen Xu's and Nebula Games' official Weibo accounts, instantly sparking endless discussions among players.

It could be said that for this gameplay Expo, the biggest winner was undoubtedly Nebula Games.

Although their booth wasn't the largest, nor was their game the biggest in scale, they successfully captured all the attention.

As for other game developers and designers, Chen Xu wasn't sure.

But at least for Nebula Games, this exhibition had been a tremendous success.

The next day, inside Nebula Games' company.

The employees who attended the exhibition hadn't calmed down yet, still excitedly discussing the fun moments from the event.

'This exhibition was really interesting!' Ruan Ningxue said, still not over the excitement.

Yang Xin nodded. 'Yeah, and just imagine—TengHua and NetDragon actually brought out their VR games, yet in the end, we stole the spotlight. It makes me want to laugh.'

'But Mr. Chen, our game hasn't even been officially greenlit yet!' Qin Yi scratched his head, looking at Chen Xu.

Ever since returning from the exhibition, he'd been worrying about this.

Although the trailer was out, it had been handled by just a few of them, and the trailer itself was outsourced.

As for the game, they'd only produced some concept drafts.

Hearing this, core development members like Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin all turned to look at Chen Xu.

Seeing the online discussions, many optimistic and naive players even believed that *Dark Souls* might release actual gameplay footage within just over a month.

But they could only say those players were dreaming.

Insiders knew the truth.

The game really only had a folder created so far!

'Don't rush. Besides, at the exhibition, I didn't give a specific release date—I only said it's being made. When players ask about progress, we just say it's being made.'

'And a game, especially a major production—even if it's for PC platform, not VR—has a long development cycle. Not to mention we lack experience in this area. Once I finalize the complete concept and design plan, I'll explain it in detail to all of you.'

'For now, follow the two directions I mentioned earlier: start designing the art resources and practicing the various actions in the game. Even though it's an ARPG, action elements are extremely important in this game.'

'Also, the operations team needs to keep pushing *Sanguosha* and *Fall Guys*. For the Nebula Games Platform, these two games are currently very important,' Chen Xu said, looking at everyone.
