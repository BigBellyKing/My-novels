Chapter 78 This Sounds Familiar

Chapter 78 This Sounds Familiar

The rest area of Nebula Games.

During lunch break, Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin were lounging on massage chairs, while others like Qin Yi were challenging the claw crane machines.

"The company's benefits are getting better and better!" Holding a cup of milk tea, Sister Xin said contentedly.

"Mainly because the company's capital is growing stronger, and there are more and more new employees. It's a bit hard to adapt to. We're already considered a big team now, right?" Ruan Ningxue sighed with emotion.

Thinking back now, she still felt somewhat unreal.

At this time last year, she was still drawing doujinshi at home.

"We're not quite a large team yet—still more of a Medium team," Sister Xin said.

"By the way, Sister Xin, I heard we're going to participate in the gameplay Expo soon?" Ruan Ningxue asked.

"Mm, Sister Lin mentioned it. Didn't Mr. Chen go check out the exhibition site recently?" Sister Xin replied.

"I've been there before, but only as a spectator. Now we can actually be the hosts!" Ruan Ningxue said, her face beaming with excitement.

At that moment, Qin Yi and others, who had finally given up battling the claw machine, walked over.

"We're going to exhibit too, but we only have about two months. I wonder if Mr. Chen will launch a new project?" Qin Yi said, full of anticipation.

A new project—this was something every employee at Nebula Games looked forward to.

On a psychological and emotional level, creating a new game and seeing players' varied reactions brought immense satisfaction.

And materially speaking, every successful new project meant substantial bonuses.

After *Outlast* before the Lunar New Year, and *Overcooked* after, Chen Xu had awarded them generous bonuses.

"Time-wise, it feels a bit tight, doesn't it?" a new employee spoke up.

"Yeah, two months seems a bit rushed. But then again, it's just an exhibition, not an official release," another new employee chimed in.

"You're too young. Once the project starts, you'll understand why Mr. Chen has been so successful!" Qin Yi said with a knowing smile.

"Exactly!" The veteran employees nodded with admiration.

Back-to-back hits with *Outlast* and *Overcooked*, an unconventional game development journey, development efficiency and team management as flawless as a bug-free program.

The veterans who had experienced all this were practically turning into die-hard fans of Chen Xu.

Everyone was still chatting when suddenly Sister Xin's surprised voice rang out.

"Quick, check the work group chat! There's going to be a meeting this afternoon about the new project!" Sister Xin waved her phone.

"Must be related to the upcoming gameplay Expo, right?"

"Wonder what kind of game it'll be?"

"Probably multiplayer? Didn't we discuss the company's direction in the last meeting?"

"Who knows? We just follow Mr. Chen. We'll find out this afternoon."

Opening the work group chat and seeing the announcement from Chen Xu, everyone instantly became excited.

They began speculating wildly about what kind of project they would develop next.

………………

In the afternoon, employees clocked in one by one.

Chen Xu arrived with his laptop and gathered everyone in the meeting room.

"I believe many of you have already heard something. This time, we'll be participating in the May gameplay Expo, and we're actually the headlining act for Booth Six."

With around 500 square meters of exhibition space, it wasn't as large as the big studios,

but it was already on par with some Medium game developers.

This was mainly thanks to *To the Moon* winning the official Game Design Competition, followed by two consecutive highly popular game releases.

Hearing Chen Xu, everyone nodded, their faces lit with excitement.

Chen Xu smiled, and then three folders appeared on the big screen,

labeled with the numbers 1, 2, and 3.

"For this expo, we're bringing something new to meet the players, but the task might be tight," Chen Xu said, looking at the team. "This time, we're developing two games simultaneously, and during this period, we also need to rush out a promotional animation for a true blockbuster game."

"Huh!?"

Sister Xin, Ruan Ningxue, Qin Yi, and other veteran employees of Nebula Games all looked bewildered.

As for the new employees who had joined Nebula Games shortly after the Lunar New Year, they wore expressions that screamed, "Are you kidding us?"

Two months to make two games, plus a promotional animation for a blockbuster?

Granted, everyone understood that a promotional animation for a blockbuster wasn't the same as full development. It wouldn't count as core work—mostly just designing simple scenes, then outsourcing to an animation company for production.

But the real issue was two full games in two months. How was that even possible?

Even a Donkey in the Production Team couldn't produce that much!

Even veteran employees like Ruan Ningxue, Sister Xin, and Qin Yi, who were well aware of Chen Xu's efficiency, were full of doubt.

If it were just a playable demo for the exhibition, that might be doable.

But from Chen Xu's tone, it sounded like he intended to fully develop both games.

Was that even possible?

Everyone listened with deep skepticism as Chen Xu began explaining the two new games they were about to develop.

"First, we have *Sanguosha*. This is a strategy card battle game. I've already completed the core rules and gameplay. You can take a quick look first."

As Chen Xu spoke, the rules of *Sanguosha* appeared on the big screen via projector,

together with simple drafts of generals and cards.

"The game features four different factions: Lord, Rebel, Loyalist, and Spy. Players can freely choose from various Three Kingdoms generals, each with unique Skills."

"The game includes three types of cards: Basic cards, Equipment cards, and Stratagem cards."

Chen Xu gave a brief overview of *Sanguosha*'s basic rules and content to help everyone better understand the game.

Due to time constraints, he didn't go into deep interpretation.

But the people present weren't clueless newcomers.

Even Ruan Ningxue, who had participated in multiple projects since last year and had spent time leveling up her skills, could grasp it fairly well with the help of the design documents.

Everyone quickly mentally pictured the gameplay. Though they weren't sure what the actual player experience would feel like,

one thing was clear—this game wouldn't require much effort to develop.

The main time-consuming aspects would be voice acting and the output of art assets,

both of which could be outsourced.

If one outsourcing team couldn't handle it, hire two.

The development difficulty of *Sanguosha* was nearly zero. The real challenge lay in the second game—and the so-called "blockbuster" mentioned earlier.

The team stared at Chen Xu, waiting for him to reveal the next project.

Chen Xu smiled at them. "The next game will be one that gives players immense stress relief and unparalleled joy—a truly harmonious and heartwarming experience."

If this world were a comic, then right now, Ruan Ningxue, Sister Xin, Qin Yi, and others would have a row of black question marks floating above their heads.

Why did that sentence sound so familiar?
