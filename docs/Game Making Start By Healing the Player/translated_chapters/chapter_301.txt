Chapter 300: Counter-Terrorism Game (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Two days later, in the reception room of Nebula Games.

Chen Xu looked at Meng Zuo and sighed with emotion: "I thought you NetDragon and the Channel Alliance, along with TengHua, were all in the same faction."

"Please exclude me from that. I'm just an employee, acting as a lubricant, building a bridge between Mr. Chen and NetDragon for communication," said Meng Zuo, sitting in the chair.

"But Teacher Meng, this will be our first cooperation," Chen Xu said with a smile.

NetDragon reaching out had indeed caught Chen Xu off guard.

According to NetDragon's proposal, Nebula Games and NetDragon could reach a strategic cooperation agreement.

Some of NetDragon's third-party, as well as first-party games, could be launched on the Nebula Games Platform.

Likewise, Nebula Games Platform's first-party and third-party games would also need to be launched on platforms under NetDragon.

Chen Xu didn't have any major objections to this.

After all, these games, upon launch, would still require installation of the Nebula Games Platform, and the same applied to NetDragon's side.

In terms of user numbers, there wasn't really a case of one side gaining an unfair advantage over the other.

The reason NetDragon approached Nebula Games was primarily because, in the VR field, NetDragon had been overshadowed by TengHua in recent years.

Starting from two years ago with *Star God (Game Title)*, they had only slightly trailed behind in awards, while sales were still considerable. But over the past two years, as Nebula Games made a Sudden Rise in the PC domain, and TengHua relentlessly advanced in VR, even a company as large as NetDragon began to feel a sense of crisis.

Meanwhile, the rise of the Nebula Games Platform had caused the Channel Alliance to unite, and TengHua was now tightly aligned with them, essentially "wearing the same pants."

For this VR Game Design Competition, NetDragon wanted to make a move—grasping Nebula Games' hand to firmly establish roots in the VR space.

Each party acted in their own interest, but NetDragon's terms were indeed quite sincere.

Chen Xu had no reason to refuse.

The new project would be co-funded, revenue sharing had been agreed upon, but copyright would belong to Nebula Games.

This was Chen Xu's bottom line.

Money could be shared, but copyright was non-negotiable.

"But regarding the new game, Mr. Chen, what are your thoughts?" Meng Zuo stopped discussing that topic and shifted the conversation toward the game itself.

Specific interests and strategic goals held little appeal for him.

What he truly wanted to know was how Chen Xu planned to approach the new VR game.

In the past, he had considered challenging Chen Xu, but now that thought had completely vanished, replaced by curiosity about what Chen Xu would do.

"FPS and First-person—these two entry points are the best," said Chen Xu.

Meng Zuo, seated across, nodded.

In fact, this was likely the direction other participants interested in the VR Game Design Competition were also preparing to take.

After all, with the stated connection to military training, no matter what the actual purpose was, as long as the Game Department had announced it, they would naturally head in that direction.

"However, the theme shouldn't be the same as traditional ones—just a Cops and Robbers Battle, purchasing weapons and firearms, centered around defusing a bomb gameplay. That isn't problematic per se, but the key lies in the game's content presentation," Chen Xu said, looking at Meng Zuo.

Similar to CSGO-type games from Chen Xu's previous life, the Embryonic Form of such games in this Parallel World had long existed.

They mostly revolved around planting a bomb and defusing a bomb, though there were also Hostage Rescue scenarios.

But the Gameplay closely resembled that of the previous life's Counter-Strike.

"If real anti-terror operations were like these games—rushing in with guns and Flashbangs, or charging in blindly to kill Terrorists, defuse the bomb, or rescue hostages—soldiers from any country would suffer Heavy Casualties."

"Unlike traditional Field Battle or Jungle Warfare, with the progress of the era and the ever-spreading threats of terrorism, crime, and Special Operations environments have shifted into confined spaces like buildings, Residential Houses, and Alleys—giving rise to tactics known as Indoor Close-Quarters Combat, or CQB. Of course, not every indoor fight qualifies as CQB."

"Nowadays, typical counter-terrorism units organize personnel into specialized teams based on mission characteristics—such as Attack, Support, Sniper, Destroy, and Containment units."

"Moreover, with technological advancement, anti-terror equipment is no longer limited to just a single firearm, but rather involves High-Tech Combat considering overall tactics."

"Flash Shield, Unmanned Reconnaissance Vehicle, Heartbeat Scanner, Concussion Grenade, Breaching Ram, Cluster Charge, Breaching Charge..."

A stream of professional terms poured from Chen Xu's mouth.

Sitting opposite, Meng Zuo was utterly bewildered by this Combination Punch.

Some terms he recognized; others were completely unfamiliar.

Yet, even though he didn't understand, he was Greatly Shocked!

Chen Xu's explanation didn't stop—he became More Enthusiastic the More One Speaks.

"Imagine an unfamiliar Structure containing hostages you need to rescue or explosives to defuse, while also housing Heinous Terrorist Personnel inside. In such a situation, do you think a normal counter-terrorism operation would just involve charging in with guns and shooting 'Bang Bang Bang'?"

"Of course not! Deciding to enter a building occupied by terrorists means negotiations have already failed. Executing a mission within a Complex building, you never know where the enemy might be hiding or when they might suddenly appear and open fire. In such cases, every effective tool must be utilized."

"Use an Unmanned Reconnaissance Vehicle to collect information about the interior environment and the general location of enemies. Use a Breaching Ram and Breaching Charge to blow open doors, windows, or walls, creating a new attack route."

"Infiltrate and Rescue via Ropes from second or third-floor windows."

"True counter-terrorism isn't about marksmanship—it's about Tactics, information collecting, and psychological warfare!"

"And this is exactly the content we will showcase in our new game."

"As for the game's background, it's not particularly important, but we can set it with a Grander Scope/Setting."

"As terrorist attacks increase worldwide and international-scale attacks emerge, the World United Nations decides to assemble Elite Special Forces Personnel from various nations to form an anti-terrorism special unit called 'Rainbow,' dedicated to combating the global threat of Terrorism."

"Similar to the Hero (attack type) units in Warcraft, each Operator in the game will possess unique abilities, combined with diverse Nationality backgrounds, allowing the game to sell better across different countries."
