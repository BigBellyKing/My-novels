Chapter 164: Every Debt Has Its Creditor, Your Husband Isn't Me! (Sixth update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Whether others were scared, Li Yue didn't know.

At this moment, he himself had frozen completely.

Just moments ago, he had once again entered a new cycle.

In the room behind the locked door at the corner, the baby's crying grew louder and louder.

'Waa... waa...'

But when he arrived once more at the Wooden Door at the end of the corridor, the door—which had previously been open—was suddenly shut and bolted by an invisible force.

At that very moment, the baby's crying abruptly ceased.

The only sound in his ears now was the creaking of the chandelier swaying overhead, a grating noise that made his skin crawl.

Then, from behind, came another creak.

The door from which the baby's cries had previously emerged—was it opening?

Staring at the wooden door ahead, Li Yue didn't dare to turn around.

Based on certain elements of the game, combined with the radio broadcast he had triggered during his First walk down this corridor, he had already begun speculating wildly.

That baby's cry in the game was most likely the sound of a murdered child.

And now, could the sound of the door opening be the pregnant wife who had been killed by her husband?

Was she now standing right behind him?

What did she even look like?

At the thought, Li Yue felt a chill run through his entire body.

He stood still for about ten seconds, took two deep breaths, and abruptly turned around.

Yet everything was deathly quiet, with not a single movement.

Seeing this, Li Yue relaxed slightly.

“So the next stage is about to begin. Can I now enter this room?”

Looking at the slightly ajar door, Li Yue slowly stepped forward, his mind full of speculation.

The instant his hand touched the doorknob,

a white figure suddenly appeared from the crack in the door. A ghastly face stared at him with dead eyes and slammed the door shut with a loud 'bang!'

“Damn it!”

Just like Lord Ye's love of dragons, earlier the exceptional horror atmosphere of Silent Hill PT had left Li Yue on edge, to the point where he'd thought, *If only I could actually see the ghost, then at least I'd know what I was facing and could die in peace.*

But now that he'd actually seen it, he couldn't handle it at all. And neither could his poor, innocent vocal cords, which had just endured a pressure no human should ever face.

“Does this mean I can still play this game? Are my psychological resilience and courage really that strong?” Li Yue swallowed hard, staring at the still-advancing game graphics.

During previous testing, some players had their sessions interrupted due to certain elements, forcing them to take breaks.

Back then, Li Yue had thought that was a sign of weakness.

But now, he had to admit—he'd never wanted so badly to be weak.

Because the pressure this game had inflicted on him so far was simply overwhelming.

Whether it was the visual presentation, the sound effects, or the lighting and shadows, Chen Xu had pushed the game's Atmosphere of horror to its absolute limit.

Li Yue just couldn't understand—how could such a grim game exist in the world of the living?

Was this even something a normal person could create?

Staring at the tightly closed bathroom door, Li Yue took a deep breath. Meanwhile, the door at the end of the corridor—previously locked—had now reopened, its meaning obvious.

It meant he could proceed into the next cycle of the corridor.

But there was one small piece of good news: Li Yue could now confirm that the female ghost in the game was indeed the Victim mentioned in the radio broadcast.

Crossing once more through the Conduit to the catacomb, the scene behind the door remained identical.

Yet Li Yue, ever observant, noticed something: the number of cockroaches inside the house had increased.

And even more unsettling, the baby's crying had been replaced by a woman's voice.

'Heh... urgh... ah... waaah... mmm... ah...'

An incredibly eerie sound—was it laughter or crying? It carried a thick, bubbly tremolo, as if someone's throat was being choked, saliva caught in their windpipe, groaning in agony.

As he advanced, the lights grew dimmer, and the woman's voice grew louder.

At the corner, Li Yue's body trembled.

Because in the distant light stood a tall female ghost, her face indistinct.

In that instant, Li Yue felt as if a giant hand had gripped his heart.

Taking a deep breath, he gritted his teeth and charged forward.

The unknown was the greatest fear. Why had he been so afraid before?

Wasn't it because he didn't know the ghost existed? Wasn't it because he didn't know when or how she would appear?

Now that she stood before him, what was there to fear!?

But the moment Li Yue took a step forward, his heart turned as cold as the lights suddenly cutting out ahead.

Go all out in one go, weaken on the second, and collapse on the third.

The female ghost vanished once more into the darkness. The courage he'd just summoned hadn't even been unleashed before it drained away, and that old fear of the unknown returned—stronger than before.

Even more intense, because now he *knew* there was a ghost in the room, yet had no idea where she lurked, watching him from the shadows.

Behind him. Above. Behind again. Inside the cabinet. In the bathroom stall... Anywhere seemed possible.

Moving like helping Grandma cross the street, Li Yue inched forward. The ghost's bubbly, gurgling voice continued, sending chills down his spine, until he reached the spot where she had stood. Only then did the lights return.

The moment the light flared, countless cockroaches scattered in all directions, making Li Yue's scalp crawl to the point of numbness.

He swallowed hard and stepped once more through the Conduit into the catacomb.

Now, he finally began piecing together some truths about Silent Hill PT, this Test DEMO.

Each cycle, it seemed, brought strange changes to the corridor.

So what would change in this cycle?

The first half of the corridor remained unchanged, but after the turn, Li Yue noticed the bathroom door—previously always locked—was now wide open.

Taking a deep breath, Li Yue entered the dark bathroom and found a flashlight on the floor, flickering on and off.

Clearly, in this pitch-black bathroom, the only way to see what was around him was with this flashlight.

Swallowing hard, Li Yue controlled his character to slowly crouch and pick up the flashlight.

The instant he picked it up, a loud 'bang' echoed behind him.

The bathroom door had slammed shut. At the same time, the baby's mournful, whimpering cries began again.

Following the sound, Li Yue shone the flashlight—and there, in the bathroom sink, lay a malformed, underdeveloped fetus.

The moment the flashlight beam hit it, the soft whimpering exploded into a deafening wail.

'Thump-thump-thump...'

At the same instant the crying began, Li Yue clearly heard the sound of high heels outside the door.

There wasn't even time for him to react.

'Clang! Clang! Clang!'

The doorknob was being yanked violently. With each pull from the ghost outside, the bathroom door was forced open a little more, revealing glimpses of a pale, ghastly figure beyond the widening gap.

The dark environment, the flashlight—once steady—now flickering wildly again.

The clang of the doorknob being wrenched, the baby's wailing cries—everything shattered Li Yue's psychological defenses in an instant.

“Stop pulling! It's not me! Please, let me go!”

“Every Debt Has Its Creditor, Your Husband Isn't Me!”

“I didn't kill you, and I didn't harm your child—stop pulling!”

In the game, Li Yue controlled his character to crouch in the corner of the bathroom, shouting incoherently, releasing his terror through screams that even carried a faint sob.

At this moment, he swore—since the day he could remember, he had never been this afraid.

Why hadn't the game forcibly disconnected him from the gaming pod?

Was that safety feature broken?

Li Yue began spiraling into wild thoughts. But just as he felt himself on the verge of broken, everything finally stopped.

The baby's crying ceased. The ghost outside seemed to vanish. The bathroom door, previously locked from the outside, now opened just a crack.

Taking a deep breath, Li Yue cautiously poked his head out. Everything seemed to return to normal.

He waited in place for a while. Nothing happened. The only constant was the door leading to the next cycle.

An ordinary-looking door, yet to Li Yue, it felt like the gaping maw of a ravenous beast.

“Prosperity, democracy, Civilization, harmony, Free...” Hesitating for a moment, Li Yue muttered the core values under his breath and stepped forward.

One more update, hopefully before 1 a.m.
