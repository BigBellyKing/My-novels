Chapter 86: What the Hell Is 'Cafeteria Lunchtime'?

While they were playing *Sanguosha*, at the neighboring booth, *Fall Guys* also attracted quite a number of players who sat down at the exhibition's demo stations to try out the game.

Although each match of *Fall Guys* required gathering 60 players, Chen Xu had specially prepared QR codes allowing players to directly download the game onto their phones. In terms of controls, operating by touching glass screens wasn't quite the same as using a keyboard and mouse.

But in terms of current entertainment value, it was definitely good enough.

And once the official version launched later, it would include a cross-platform feature.

Players could choose whether to enable it for either the PC platform or mobile platforms.

If disabled, players could only match with others on the same platform.

Besides that, *Fall Guys* was inherently a pick-up-and-leave game.

As soon as a player got eliminated and didn't want to spectate, they could instantly exit and jump straight into another round.

This looping mode ensured that even during the exhibition, every player could start a new match after only a short wait.

There was never a shortage of players.

Moreover, compared to the *Sanguosha* booth, the *Fall Guys* area clearly drew more attention and was livelier.

It wasn't just because there were more female players enjoying *Fall Guys*.

Rather, from a spectator's standpoint, *Fall Guys* was far more broadly appealing than *Sanguosha*.

After all, *Sanguosha* required some time to grasp the basics—like the Skills of the generals and the abilities of the cards.

Although *Sanguosha* was very straightforward in gameplay—after playing or watching just one or two rounds, anyone could understand it—it still couldn't compare to *Fall Guys*.

This kind of obstacle-course variety show was something many people had either watched or at least heard of.

Plus, the game didn't involve complicated operations—just navigating through various traps and racing against other players and the clock to reach the finish line.

A bunch of brightly colored little bean-shaped characters scrambling together was simply hilarious and absurd.

Of course, besides these reasons, there was another critical one.

Chen Xu himself had stepped in as a live commentator, narrating the on-site *Fall Guys* matches.

This naturally drew significant attention from many players, including those from other booths within the same exhibition hall, who were all drawn over.

This made other game developers and designers furious.

Was there no rule of law? Was there no justice!?

You made your Cosers and Showgirls so unique—while everyone else had plain long legs, yours looked like a cartoon animal party!

Your games were special too—while everyone else prepared equipment and demos for players to try, you simply put up two QR codes and let players download and play on their own!

And judging from the game's completeness, this was already a product ready to be launched—why bring it to an exhibition like this?

Are you turning this exhibition into your personal game launch event!?

And what's even more outrageous—you're a Game Designer, yet you personally jumped into the fray, using your status to hype up the atmosphere and even becoming a commentator!

Are you just showing off!?

Many game designers and developers in the same hall, seeing fewer and fewer players at their own booths, wore deeply depressed expressions.

What kind of situation was this!?

Their booths were deserted, while yours was packed with people!

However, neither Chen Xu nor the players cared about the frustration of these other developers and designers.

*Sanguosha*, *Fall Guys*, and Chen Xu personally stepping in had already attracted a great deal of attention.

"Bro, why is everyone gathering over at that booth?" Some players who had just arrived from other areas approached curiously.

"It's Nebula Games' new work—the designer and company behind *Outlast* and *Overcooked*. Their games don't require queuing; just scan the QR code and play," explained a helpful player in the crowd.

"Damn it! That's awesome? What kind of game is it?" A random player, who had just endured an hour-long queue only to get five minutes of gameplay, widened their eyes in shock.

"Look, two games—*Sanguosha* and *Fall Guys*. The big screen is showing it—just watch for yourself."

"Hurry up and queue for matchmaking! Chen Xu is about to commentate the next match—hope I get in!"

On the big screen, a little green Fall Guy successfully grabbed a crown.

Chen Xu interacted with the on-site audience, preparing for the next round.

"Haha, I matched in!"

"Me too!"

"Haha, that Hamburger Head is me!"

"I'm Pineapple Head!"

As the new matchmaking began, many successfully matched players were thrilled.

Song Ren's group also successfully matched in—Song Ren, Zhang Yi, and Wang Han, exactly three of them.

"Old Song, don't screw me over this time!" Zhang Yi glanced at Song Ren beside him.

Clearly, he hadn't recovered from the previous round's *Observe Stars* and *Lightning* combo with Zhuge Liang and Liu Bei.

"That was just a fluke—don't worry about it. Rest assured—I'll carry you straight into the finals this time!" Song Ren patted his chest. At 1.92 meters tall, he looked extremely convincing.

Meanwhile, Wang Han was busy customizing her *Fall Guys* character, trying to make it look cuter.

Joey didn't team up with Zhang Yi and the others. He decided to play solo for now, exploring a custom room mode to get a feel for the game.

As for Wang Yifan, he was still playing *Sanguosha* against random players at the exhibition.

He simply couldn't accept it—dying without even playing a single card? This was pure humiliation!

"But the controls in this game feel kinda weird!" During the pre-match waiting time, Zhang Yi discussed his thoughts on the game with Song Ren.

They had both tried the demo briefly.

The basic controls were extremely simple—using a joystick to move, plus buttons for jumping and grabbing. Nothing complicated.

But the game's physics engine and control feel? Simply unbelievable.

The little characters wobbled as they walked, making players worry they might trip and fall flat on their faces at any moment.

And jumping, running—everything felt like it was made of clay and springs.

"Stop talking, the game's about to start. This round will eliminate over twenty players—you two better not get knocked out in the first level," Wang Han rolled her eyes.

The first level was called *Door Dash*. There were seven rows of doors, each containing a mixture of truth and falsehood.

Players had to pass through before the required number was reached.

Sixty Fall Guys stood side by side at the start, a truly spectacular sight.

"Alright, the next match is about to begin. The first level has randomly selected the map 'Cafeteria Lunchtime'. As you can see, all the competitors are ready for battle."

On stage, Chen Xu, wearing a microphone, solemnly delivered his commentary.

Players in matchmaking, as well as those watching, immediately burst into laughter upon hearing Chen Xu's words.

Everything was normal at first—but what the hell was 'Cafeteria Lunchtime'?

Wasn't this level supposed to be called *Door Dash*?

All the players wore bewildering expressions.

But soon, they understood why Chen Xu had named it that.
