### Chapter 473: Scared Stiff Players (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Song Ren let out a long breath after exiting the game and leaving his gaming pod, then switched on all the lights in his bedroom.

Song Ren had always thought of himself as a Tough Guy. But he had to admit, today he was defeated again in front of *Resident Evil*. Even with Awakening Mode on, the game still made his heart pound, hands and feet turn cold, and sweat profusely. If he were to truly say, he actually felt that the previous *Silent Hill PT* was probably even scarier. Because, in reality, he also felt that *Resident Evil* had quite a few restrained elements. But knowing that was useless; he was still scared where he was supposed to be scared. Especially Huanyu VR's immersive experience, coupled with graphics that were almost photo-realistic, Song Ren could only say he truly couldn't take it anymore. Moreover, in just this short half-hour, almost all the elements a horror game should have were covered. Jump scares that suddenly startled you, fear induced by psychological suggestion to build atmosphere, and visual fear that inflicted damage. He simply couldn't guess which method the game would use to scare him next. The sense of oppression it brought was simply too strong.

Leaning back in his chair to relax for a bit, Song Ren returned to his gaming pod and opened the Nebula Games Platform. He purchased four copies of *Resident Evil* in a row, opened his Friends list, and sent them as gifts to Zhang Yi, Wang Han, Joey, and Wang Yifan. Such a good game, he couldn't possibly enjoy it all by himself. After sending out the gifts one by one, Song Ren chuckled, then opened *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*, ready to go in and shoot things up a bit to alleviate his inner fear and calm his mind.

*****

Song Ren was far from the only player who specifically waited until midnight to buy *Resident Evil*. After all, with 30,000 slots, the rewards were extremely generous. So, many confident players specifically waited for the 12 AM unlock to try out the experience and challenge themselves. However, these players never expected that this damn *Resident Evil* really was a horror game, perfectly fitting the Halloween theme. Moreover, this game wasn't just ordinarily scary; the continuous sense of oppression upon entering the game directly made many timid players pee their pants. Soon, the Nebula Games Platform community was filled with players discussing *Resident Evil*.

“Damn, damn, damn, I was wondering why these benefits were so good, it really does fit the holiday theme!”

“It’s actually a horror game, I’ve been utterly screwed! High alert, absolutely do NOT play!”

“Back in the day, I lingered long before Mount Massive Asylum and eventually left, but this time, Ethan actually willingly enters the room!”

“2333333 (lol), this setting is truly full of Mr. Chen’s malice. I hesitated at the room’s entrance for a long time, then watched my character walk in, and literally peed my pants!”

“Damn, this game reminds me of Chen Xu’s *Outlast* and *Silent Hill PT* from before!”

“The key is that this game’s graphics are so awesome, and it’s a VR version, the immersion is just insane!”

“Chen Xu doesn’t just want our money, he wants our lives too!”

All players who entered and experienced *Resident Evil* couldn't stop grumbling about the game. Everyone initially thought they had scored a good deal, that this Nebula Games benefit would be easy to claim. But they never expected Chen Xu to be waiting for them right here. What kind of damn benefit is this?! Right after entering the house, they saw a pile of unsettling food models, followed by a somewhat intense horror videotape. Then, in the pool, almost eighty percent of players were startled by the floating corpse. The game then combined the jump scares of *Outlast* with the environmental and psychological suggestions of *Silent Hill PT*, absolutely maxing out the sense of fear. Finally, after players painstakingly managed to meet Mia, they were brutally subjected to domestic violence. Countless players issued statements of divorce, declaring they could no longer live this life. Discussions about *Resident Evil* quickly became the hot topic of the day.

Many players who hadn't stayed up late woke up early, preparing to participate in the event and clear their Nebula Games Platform shopping carts, only to habitually open the game platform and community, or chat groups, and find everyone almost exclusively discussing *Resident Evil*. The consensus was clear: they had all peed their pants because of this game. This also sparked a tiny bit of curiosity in many players. Halloween horror game? Alright, that's pretty fitting for the theme. But is it *that* scary? Many players felt a little curious deep down. After all, for many horror games, if you don't play them yourself and only hear others talk about them, it always feels like something is missing. Especially in *Resident Evil*, although Mia in her frenzied state was terrifying in the game. But if you just took screenshots, it actually looked quite appealing. To put it in crude terms, it was 'simpable'. Just like the *Fatal Frame* series in his previous life, many players questioned how scary this game could truly be? So many moe girls, I'm gonna 'simp' hard, alright? Then, after entering the game, forget 'simping' hard; they just straight up peed their pants. However, many players who outwardly claimed 'that's it?' did encourage quite a few people. After all, with more people saying it, combined with not being particularly timid themselves, some felt an urge to try it out, thinking 'maybe I'm brave enough not to be scared?' Furthermore, just like getting brutalized in Souls-like games, or getting scared in horror games. There will always be some players, driven by a desire for revenge, who want more people to suffer and be scared, thus fueling the fire. These more superficial players would say things like, 'This game isn't scary at all, I've already 'simped' for Mia.' But some high-level players were different; they would analyze the game’s unique characteristics. For instance, they would tell players that the game was indeed a little scary, but mostly limited to the environmental atmosphere. As for the intense scenes and the oppressive feeling of being hunted? Just because I don't mention it doesn't mean it's not there! This information asymmetry also led many naive and ignorant players to gradually step into this bottomless abyss.

Of course, there were also some players with stronger willpower who, facing *Resident Evil*, declared they would absolutely not try it. However, there were also players with mischievous friends who, waking up early and not yet understanding what *Resident Evil* was all about, found a gift waiting for them on the game platform as soon as they logged in. What the hell kind of gift was that?! This was a time bomb, wasn't it!?
