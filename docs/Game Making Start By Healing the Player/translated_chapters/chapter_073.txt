Chapter 73: Direction of Development (Thanks to 'Weixia Guozi' for becoming an Alliance Master)

Following the release of Chen Xu's official Weibo post, it can be said that it sparked a frenzy of complaints from countless players, and was reposted across various game communities.

Beneath the comments section of Chen Xu's official Weibo post, countless players gathered. The sentiment expressed by these players was largely the same: 'Who'd fall for that?'

'Communication, inclusivity, patience?'

It sounds reasonable, but it feels like they're just trying to fool us.

Regarding Chen Xu's rhetoric, some players believed it, while others didn't. But one thing remained unchanged: 'Overcooked', this seemingly adorable and heartwarming game.

After Valentine's Day, it quickly dominated major live streaming platforms, video websites, and relevant game communities. Suddenly, many people were discussing this special cooperative game. Its sales, 'Overcooked', were also steadily climbing. One week after the game's launch, sales officially surpassed 450,000 units.

Compared to the previous 'Undertale' and 'To the Moon', and even the sales of 'Outlast' which wasn't highly regarded by the industry, the 450,000 sales of 'Overcooked' didn't seem as high as imagined.

However, it's worth noting that 340,000 of these 450,000 sales came from the Nebula Games Platform. This also meant they gave away 340,000 copies of the game.

And a more important point is that, compared to 'Outlast' and 'To the Moon', 'Overcooked' delivered on its earlier promise. It brought a considerable number of users to Nebula Games. Although, to be honest, these users currently have no loyalty whatsoever. But they are still users. At the very least, the Nebula Games Platform is already installed on their computers, and they have registered for a Nebula Games Pass. This was something 'Outlast' was completely unable to achieve before.

Furthermore, in terms of game duration, 'Overcooked' is also stronger than 'Outlast'. After all, there are still very few players who are truly bold. Most players, when faced with a game like 'Outlast', basically consider buying and watching it equivalent to playing it themselves. But 'Overcooked' is different. Playing with good friends brings a completely different kind of fun.

With the success of 'Overcooked', Nebula Games and Chen Xu also entered the view of many people. Before this, whether 'Undertale' triggered a wave of meta-game fever in the indie game scene, or Chen Xu won first prize in the Sci-Fi Game Design Competition with 'To the Moon', for most companies in the gaming industry, these achievements, while impressive, weren't considered a huge deal.

However, the buzz generated by two consecutive games, 'Outlast' and 'Overcooked', was completely different from before.

………………

Nebula Games' office.

Chen Xu, leaning on the sofa, grinned widely as he looked at his points.

It has to be said that 'Overcooked' is quite powerful. The efficiency of point growth was even comparable to 'Outlast' which had used items before. In just one week, he had already accumulated enough for 20 ten-pulls.

Looking at the current points on the UI interface, he thought for a moment and decided not to draw yet. Those dozens of ten-pulls before had really scared him. It was all 'blue sky and white clouds' (common items). He decided to save up; a larger quantity would eventually yield good results.

As for the next new game, he hadn't quite decided what to develop yet. His current abilities were sufficient for now; it wouldn't be too late to draw again later when there was a need, after all, points wouldn't grow wings and fly away.

Furthermore, with the New Year comes a fresh start. During the National Day holiday last year, the company had already undergone an expansion. However, the staff was still a bit insufficient.

Next, they would need some personnel responsible for game operation. Unlike games such as 'Undertale', 'To the Moon', and 'Outlast', 'Overcooked' is an online multiplayer game, and there would be subsequent opening of the Workshop and new version updates. Someone was needed to manage the game's operation, and the platform also required operations personnel.

In addition, he would certainly develop truly multiplayer games in the future, which would further necessitate an operations team. After all, he needed to cultivate an operations team that embodied Nebula Games' philosophy. For a game, operation is paramount, especially for multiplayer games where operations can sometimes even outweigh the game's quality.

Secondly, the development team members also needed to be expanded. Music, action, and art—the office had mentioned to him before that they were struggling, so personnel needed to be recruited there too. Approximately 15 more people needed to be hired.

As for office space, that also needed to be expanded, as it was getting a bit crowded. Coincidentally, an entire floor above the current office building seemed to be vacant, so they could contact the landlord about subleasing it.

After broadly confirming these plans, Chen Xu called over the office staff and instructed them to start with the recruitment matters. It wasn't realistic to hire everyone in the short term, but Chen Xu wasn't in a hurry. Two or three months wouldn't be an issue.

However, during this period, besides dealing with recruitment, Chen Xu also received a somewhat unexpected call – it was from Meng Zuo of NetDragon, whom he had met once before.

However, the other party was clearly not calling specifically to build rapport with him. Instead, they were representing NetDragon in expressing an interest in acquiring Nebula Games. After all, the success of several consecutive titles, while not big productions, could certainly be called hugely successful. Especially the recent 'Outlast' and 'Overcooked' had generated considerable buzz. As one of the giants in the gaming industry, they naturally paid attention to Nebula Games.

And the day after NetDragon expressed its acquisition intent, TengHua Games, somehow getting his contact information, also indicated a desire to talk.

In the current gaming industry, these two companies are in direct competition. Simply put, if TengHua Games wanted to do something, NetDragon would get involved. And vice versa.

As for Chen Xu, the object of both companies' pursuit, he wasn't thinking that much. He definitely wouldn't sell. But this was also a good opportunity to see how the two companies truly viewed Nebula Games.

“But no matter what, the pace of development needs to accelerate!”

Chen Xu hung up the phone, propping his chin with a thoughtful expression. If you're talking about huge money, Nebula Games certainly didn't have much right now. However, following the current systematic development, it could be said that they weren't lacking.

To date, the cumulative sales of multiple games including 'Mirror (Game)', 'Undertale', 'To the Moon', 'Outlast', and 'Overcooked' had already surpassed ten million units. And they were still continuously growing.

Among these games, some had high R&D costs, and some had low R&D costs. But overall, all of them were profitable. Including the company's daily employee salaries, bonuses, and expenses like rent, Nebula Games' company account had nearly 200 million in liquid funds.

Large-scale games on VR platforms typically have average development costs ranging from approximately 50 to 150 million US dollars. Of course, this is an average; some top-tier blockbusters would still go higher. Blockbusters on PC platforms also generally cost around 10 to 40 million US dollars.

Purely developing them was certainly affordable, but for Chen Xu, there was still some risk. After all, this was just the R&D cost. It didn't include marketing and distribution. It was impossible to develop a blockbuster and then not market or distribute the game at all, right?

Moreover, the current staff was indeed stretched, so personnel expansion was essential. And even if he were to develop AAA-tier games next, even for PC platforms, they would inevitably need to build momentum for their own platform. What was the fastest way to get the Nebula Games Platform into the sight of most players and attract them? The best method was undoubtedly exclusive games. It was a very conventional, yet very effective strategy.

However, if he were to pursue the exclusive games route, sales would inevitably be affected. According to Chen Xu's original idea, it was to continue focusing on small and medium-sized games, taking a steady and sure approach. Slowly consolidating the Nebula Games Platform and expanding its game library.

As for now, he needed to give some thought to the direction of future development.
