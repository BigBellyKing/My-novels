## Chapter 25: Million-Sales Milestone

‘Thank you all for your support, Undertale has surpassed 500,000 sales.’

After Chen Xu posted this on his official Weibo account.

Some independent game designers and media who followed Chen Xu were stunned.

Why?

Because this exact format of an official announcement—they felt like they’d seen it once before.

Breaking 100,000 sales within three days of launch, and now, just a week later, sales had already exceeded 500,000?

This growth rate was terrifying!

As a result, another wave of articles about Undertale flooded the internet.

‘Sales exceed 500,000 in 10 days! Rating高达 9.7!’

‘A must-play title for every gamer! An independent game masterpiece!’

‘Redefining players’ understanding of RPGs! A truly special RPG!’

‘An incredibly震撼ing game!’

For independent game designers in the industry, even those who previously hadn’t paid much attention, now began studying Undertale in depth.

If positive reviews alone weren’t convincing, the game’s solid sales figures now proved that this model had real market potential.

As for the media, they had already published similar articles before—so why not recycle them? A simple title change was all it took.

The gaming media uniformly praised the game, because Undertale was simply too explode-worthy.

It had reputation, it had sales, and its overall quality was flawless.

Coupled with its unique meta-game setting, it left countless players and designers awestruck.

For a game like this, even critics would struggle to find angles to attack.

Under this wave of relentless media coverage, Undertale’s popularity soared.

Even though sales had already surpassed 500,000,

this level of口碑 and special热度 clearly meant 500,000 wasn’t the end for this game.

At the same time, the massive popularity drew many previously indifferent players to Zhong Mei’s official Weibo account.

Unfortunately, he had already deleted his earlier posts,

and completely shut down comments on his Weibo.

This guy’s public image was truly terrible.

Now that Undertale was exploding in popularity, whether players had genuine grievances or just wanted to watch the drama, they naturally wouldn’t let it go.

Especially those who had played Mirror (Game) before—they were especially combat-ready.

Even though Zhong Mei had deleted his posts and disabled comments, Chen Xu’s official announcement still existed.

So, many players rushed to the comment section under Chen Xu’s post, tagging Zhong Mei repeatedly.

‘@Zhong Mei, Teacher Zhong, come critique Undertale quickly! Games are art! How can such a game strut around proudly!?’

‘@Zhong Mei, Teacher Zhong, come say something! Blooming (Game) will definitely crush Undertale, right? What do you mean sales only passed 50,000? I don’t believe it! Teacher Zhong’s game is art—these players just don’t appreciate it. It’s not that the game is bad, it’s that these players are bad!’

‘@Zhong Mei, Teacher Zhong, keep going! You were so confident before!’

Under Chen Xu’s few official Weibo posts, every single one was flooded with @Zhong Mei messages. Some particularly sarcastic replies had already gathered thousands of likes.

As for Zhong Mei now?

Two words: feigning death.

In truth, he didn’t want to do this.

But he had no choice!

In his original plan, his secret technique was to use his strengths to attack others’ weaknesses.

If your sales are higher than mine, I’ll talk about口碑.

If your口碑 is better, I’ll talk about art.

If you’re more artistic, I’ll bring up sales.

And if all else fails, I can still boast about game length with a thick enough face.

Anyway, I’ll always compare based on where I outshine you.

But now? Everything had been crushed.

Was he supposed to claim that his Blooming (Game) at 40 yuan was 4 yuan more expensive than your Undertale?

So Zhong Mei decided to feign death!

He refused to believe that Chen Xu could create another work this excellent in his next game.

…………………

Under the entire gaming industry’s attention, Undertale’s various data continued to rise.

Thanks to its excellent口碑, the game’s subsequent growth remained remarkably stable.

When Chen Xu publicly announced that Undertale had surpassed 500,000 sales, the sales curve was still climbing steadily.

On August 15th, exactly one month after Undertale’s official launch,

its total sales finally broke through 1 million, achieving a milestone that Mirror (Game) had never reached.

First-month sales hitting 1 million—this news instantly stunned countless independent game designers.

With Undertale priced at 36 yuan, even if most sales came from third-party platforms, Chen Xu’s revenue from this game alone had already surpassed ten million yuan in just one month.

Not to mention that during this period, the DLC for Mirror (Game) was also released and sold quite well.

And apart from Mirror (Game), Undertale’s sales were entirely driven by its excellent story and design.

This prompted countless game designers to analyze Undertale’s characteristics and success factors.

For Nebula Games, still in its early stages, Undertale’s success brought both fame and fortune.

Moreover, compared to his previous life, in this Parallel World, Undertale had achieved its first-month million-sales milestone relying solely on the domestic market. Chen Xu summarized a few reasons:

First, the environment of this Parallel World. Just like in his previous life, where console platforms were niche in China while PC and mobile games dominated, the game market in this Parallel World was vastly larger.

In his previous life, the domestic market claimed to have 700 million players, but much of that was inflated.

But in this Parallel World, even excluding overseas markets, the domestic market alone was already terrifyingly large.

After all, it was the world’s most populous country.

Second, compared to his previous life, Chen Xu had significantly improved the game’s visual presentation.

After all, in his previous life, Undertale was made by a single independent game designer with crowdfunding—extremely limited manpower and funds.

For any game, strong visual presentation was always a bonus, never a drawback.

There were players who couldn’t get into a game due to poor graphics, but there was absolutely no player who avoided a game because its graphics were too good.

Chen Xu was already extremely satisfied with Undertale’s current sales performance.

As for overseas markets, due to different policies in this Parallel World compared to his previous life, he hadn’t considered them in the short term.

Mirror (Game) hadn’t even passed domestic censorship—its release was on overseas official platforms. Though technically official, its nature was completely different from Undertale’s.

Undertale, on the other hand, had already launched on domestic platforms.
