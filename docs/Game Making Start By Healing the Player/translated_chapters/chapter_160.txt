Chapter 159: Now This is What You Call a Conscientious Designer! (Happy Mid-Autumn Festival, please subscribe for monthly passes)

While Meng Zuo and Chen Xu were chatting.

The other Game Designers also began discussing the types of DEMOs they wanted to develop.

“I think it would be better to create a Sports Game with an Extreme Sports Theme. On one hand, it can test the new Engine and the VR equipment's Environmental Interaction. On the other hand, this Immersive Mode of extreme sports can also provide excellent Feedback Data.”

“Indeed, it has great potential. As an extension, there are action-adventure games, such as Mountain Climbing, introducing the Falling Experience, and the Overly Immersive Feedback when facing Various Beasts in the Forest.”

“Speaking of which, what do you think about horror games? Like Chen Xu's *Outlast*, if you want to test a Threshold for the sense of immersion in a game, aren't horror games quite suitable?”

“Suitable, yes, but *Outlast* is too bloody. It might be fine on the PC platform, but on a VR platform, with *Outlast*'s Level of Gore, it's definitely going to Fail Review.”

“That's also true, but without the gore, *Outlast*'s horror level would immediately drop many notches.”

Some of the surrounding designers, those who knew each other, were engaging in discussions.

Different Game Designers had varying opinions on what type and theme of game would achieve better testing results.

However, some designers also thought along the same lines as Chen Xu, which was to approach it from the perspective of horror games.

After all, these are the games that can cause the greatest emotional fluctuations for players.

This was also why Chen Xu chose *Silent Hill PT* for this test.

On one hand, the theme was suitable, and on the other, in his previous life, this game truly was just a DEMO.

But despite being a DEMO, it nearly scared countless players who experienced it out of their wits.

Especially the endlessly terrifying loop of scenes made many subsequent horror games draw inspiration from this technique.

Unlike *Outlast* with its copious amounts of gore, *Silent Hill PT* presented no other visual fear in the game, apart from the deformed baby in the sink and the 'cute' Wife Lisa.

It can be said that *Silent Hill PT* is the purest form of Eastern Horror, not scaring players through visuals, but primarily through the unknown.

It makes players constantly wonder what might jump out from where to scare them, leading to self-doubt.

It's like someone finishing a horror movie alone at home at midnight, when suddenly the lights go out, and a strong wind howls outside.

You're alone in the house, yet you feel there's someone outside your window, inside your room's closet, and beyond your front door.

This self-suggested horror is the core content of the Silent Hill series, and *Silent Hill PT* perfected it.

Narrow corridors, endless loops combined with the game's music, sound effects, and the gradual changes happening in the same scene.

It can be said that *Silent Hill PT* reached its peak in shaping an atmosphere of fear.

As for whether making this game would scare people badly.

After researching various materials and consulting with the relevant research staff from the Game Department, Chen Xu felt reassured.

First off, it will definitely scare people.

If a horror game can't scare people, can it even be called a horror game?

As for scaring someone badly, that's completely impossible.

Firstly, this isn't a game directly aimed at all players, but a DEMO provided for testing new VR equipment.

The testers are basically carefully selected.

Furthermore, during testing, bodily functions will be continuously monitored, not just by the VR equipment, but also with backup monitoring devices, and specialized medical first responders will be on standby to ensure the testers' physical safety.

If a tester's body and emotional fluctuations show severe changes, the VR gaming pod system will immediately suspend the game.

Then, based on the tester's feedback, the experience will be recorded and corresponding data provided to the research technicians of the VR gaming pod for future development.

So, safety is fully guaranteed.

As for the so-called “scared to death,” it doesn't literally mean dying from fright, but refers to other symptoms triggered by emotional fluctuations.

In the human brain, there's a center called the amygdala, which governs human fear. The expression of fear is actually a form of human self-protection.

When humans feel fear and cannot determine if it poses a threat, the amygdala's feedback mechanism is triggered, causing a frantic secretion of adrenaline, which leads to accelerated heart rate, increased blood pressure, vasoconstriction, elevated blood sugar, and other reactions.

Only by continuously maintaining this state will the body operate under overload, causing heart tissue damage.

For a physically sound and healthy-hearted person playing a horror game, if they genuinely get “scared to death.”

There's only one scenario: during the game, the person has already been paralyzed with fear, clearly feeling discomfort.

Yet, they still persevere, continuing to experience the extreme fright of the horror game as if nothing's wrong, ultimately leading to physical overload and death.

Thus, Chen Xu no longer had any worries about *Silent Hill PT* causing any adverse effects.

He could boldly and confidently pour out his creativity.

………………

After completing the relevant content registration with the Game Department, Chen Xu and Meng Zuo chatted briefly before returning to Nebula Games.

The VR Development Prototype for *Silent Hill PT* would be delivered by dedicated personnel from the Game Department at the appropriate time.

As for the subsidy, Nebula Games would still cover the costs initially. Later, once invoices and other documents were sent to the Game Department for review, the subsidy money would be transferred to the company's account.

Back at the company, Chen Xu began writing the Design concept document for *Silent Hill PT*.

After all, it was just a DEMO, and the story it revealed was not complicated.

As for some easter eggs in the game, Chen Xu thought about it and decided not to change them.

The original *Silent Hill PT* had two special easter eggs.

For example, after completing the game, there would be a male monologue, hinting at the irreconcilable conflict between the game's producer, Hideo Kojima, and his former employer, Konami.

And a string of mysterious numbers, 204863, mentioned in the game, like Kojima's previous work *Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain*, hinted at the game's location.

Regarding these two easter eggs, although players in this Parallel World might not fully understand the former.

It could still set a trap. Even though this VR DEMO Version wouldn't be released to players.

The Game Department would likely edit some related promotional videos later.

At that time, players would also be able to see the content of this DEMO through them.

When there's an opportunity to bring the *Silent Hill* series to the lovely players in the future, this easter egg will take on a different meaning for them when they look back.

Thinking of this, Chen Xu also smiled.

As a Game Designer, one must always care about the players' experience; that's what a Conscientious Designer does!

With a sigh of emotion, Chen Xu continued writing the Design concept document.

The content wasn't extensive, and Chen Xu had already completed most of it by afternoon.

At the same time, the Game Department's efficiency was remarkably high, and the developed VR prototype had already been delivered.

Including a higher-level permission for Game Designers, which was temporarily unlocked.

Coming out of the office to the project room.

Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, and Qin Yi were intensely working on the production of *Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame*.

Um... the production of the promotional trailer.

“Art Team, pause for a moment. Ningxue, assign a group of people from your team; there's a VR platform DEMO that needs to be developed next,” Chen Xu said, arriving at the studio.

Upon hearing Chen Xu's words, everyone showed surprised expressions.

Ruan Ningxue, in particular, widened her eyes: “VR!? Are we developing a VR game? A New IP, or an Old IP? Could it be the VR version of *It Takes Two*?”

Not just Ruan Ningxue, but Yang Xin, Qin Yi, and others also looked bewildered.

They had agreed that the main focus recently would be the promotional video for *Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame*, right?

Why were they suddenly making a VR game?

Could it be related to Mr. Chen's trip to the Game Department?

Many secretly began to guess.

“None of the above. It's just a DEMO for testing. The Workload isn't huge, so only a few people are needed. Modeling will also be Outsourced. The main tasks will be on the VR Content Camera and Art Atmosphere Presentation,” Chen Xu explained with a smile.

“Mr. Chen, I'll do it!” Ruan Ningxue was the first to volunteer.

Her Workload for *Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame* wasn't heavy, and more importantly, she was genuinely interested.

One must know, this was her first time encountering VR.

Although the job content shouldn't be too different from before, the game's nature was different.

Even though Chen Xu said it was just a DEMO.

In that instant, Ruan Ningxue seemed to rediscover the excitement she felt when first making a game.

“Uh... alright then. Ningxue, and two more from the Art Team. I'll explain the features of this VR game to you,” Chen Xu said, slightly stunned by Ruan Ningxue's excited expression, then pointed to two more people, who were also delighted to be chosen.

Following Chen Xu towards the meeting room, Ruan Ningxue was still beaming, guessing in her heart what kind of game the VR DEMO Version to be developed would be.

Would it be warm and harmonious like *It Takes Two*, grand and majestic like *Dark Souls*, or casual and cute like *Fall Guys*?
