Chapter 251: That's It!?! (Fifth Update)

Chapter 251: That's It!?! (Fifth Update)

Facing the Great Jagras before him, Zhang Yi was starting to lose a bit of patience.

This boss acted just like the bosses in Dark Souls' Death Mode, perfectly embodying the concept of 'If the enemy doesn't move, I don't move'.

Pulling out a Whetstone from his item pouch, Zhang Yi sharpened his Great Sword. During his earlier pursuit, he'd been harassed by a few Crown-crested Dragons, which had reduced his sword's sharpness.

Shouldering his Great Sword, Zhang Yi charged straight at the Great Jagras.

But before he could even launch his attack, the Great Jagras, seeing him charge forward, initiated its own assault.

Facing the Great Jagras's attack—resembling a giant lizard lunging forward—Zhang Yi didn't opt to dodge with a rolling maneuver. Instead, he chose to hard-countered the hit, taking the damage head-on.

He mainly did this to test the enemy's attack strength and get a better sense of its capabilities.

"This damage is significantly higher than that of the previous Crown-crested Dragon!"

Looking at the numerical design of his health bar dropping, Zhang Yi felt a bit surprised.

The collision from the Great Jagras had shaved off roughly one-tenth of his health bar.

Clearly, this boss posed a real threat.

Still, despite that, Zhang Yi felt no worry at all.

His margin for error was still very generous.

Unlike Dark Souls, where you'd be nearly dead after two hits and finished after three, he could easily withstand seven or eight hits like this!

And most importantly, unlike Dark Souls, which confined battles to specific zones, Monster Hunter: World allowed free movement during combat without area restrictions.

"Perfect! I'll use this guy to test my Great Sword properly!"

Zhang Yi became excited.

The previous Crown-crested Dragon and Great Jagras didn't have enough health—his Charged Slash couldn't be fully utilized, let alone his True Charged Slash. They'd collapse after just one strong charge.

Now, he finally had the perfect chance to go all out with the Great Jagras!

"One slash! Two slashes!"

Alongside his partner Palico, Zhang Yi launched a frenzied assault on the Great Jagras.

His routine was simple: slash once, then immediately start charging in place.

When the Great Jagras attacked, during the charging animation, his character entered a hyper armor state, allowing him to tank the hit and trade damage.

"True! Charged Slash!" Zhang Yi had already assumed his stance, ready to strike.

On-screen, his Hunter character raised the massive Great Sword with both hands, building momentum.

*Clang!* The Level 3 Charged Slash indicator activated in the game.

In an instant, the Great Sword's most powerful True Charged Slash came crashing down!

In Zhang Yi's mind, he already pictured the Great Jagras being one-shot by this devastating blow, instantly crippled and defeated.

But in the next moment, the Great Jagras suddenly shifted its Aggro, twisted its rear, and lunged toward the nearby Palico.

At the same time, his Hunter character, still wielding the oversized Great Sword, executed a spinning slash.

Boom! Rumble!

Two consecutive True Charged Slashes slammed into the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust.

Just as Zhang Yi finished his ground-chopping maneuver, the Great Jagras reoriented its Aggro and charged back, knocking him far away with a headbutt.

Zhang Yi looked completely bewildered: "????? What? This is allowed?!"

Watching his character rise from the ground, Zhang Yi, seated before his computer, looked utterly bewildered.

His skill had completely missed!?

Still, his confusion was short-lived, as the fight against the Great Jagras was progressing smoothly overall.

One thing that kept making him grumble inwardly, though, was that the Palico kept drawing the Great Jagras's Aggro, causing his charged attacks to repeatedly hit empty air.

Yet, despite this, Zhang Yi couldn't really blame the Palico.

Since he hadn't turned off damage indicators, he noticed the Palico was actually dealing quite a decent amount of damage.

And although his Great Sword had essentially become a Hoe for hitting the ground, pioneering the true ground-chopping sword style, it did make the fight significantly easier.

While the Palico distracted the Great Jagras, Zhang Yi could freely output damage—though he often missed.

Even better, when his health dropped, the Palico actually brought him a Vigorwasp, breaking open its nectar sac to instantly restore a substantial amount of health.

The battle with the Great Jagras went fairly smoothly. At first, unfamiliar with the monster's attack patterns, Zhang Yi had been knocked down multiple times. But after a few exchanges, he realized that despite its intimidating appearance, the Great Jagras was actually quite weak.

Not only were its movements sluggish, but its damage output wasn't as high as expected.

The only thing it had going for it was being meatier than the earlier Crown-crested Dragon and Herbivore.

But ironically, this was exactly what made Zhang Yi feel very satisfying—because it allowed him to slash away freely.

Under the combined assault of Zhang Yi and his Palico, the Great Jagras quickly accumulated numerous wounds.

Clearly, the Great Jagras realized it was outmatched.

After one final furious charge, instead of continuing its assault, it turned and fled deep into the forest.

"This monster can actually run away!?"

Seeing the Great Jagras escaping, Zhang Yi at his computer was shocked—he hadn't expected this at all. Nevertheless, he followed the green guiding bug and gave chase.

Fortunately, the Great Jagras had just swallowed a Jagras and hadn't fully digested it, leaving it with a bloated belly that slowed its movements significantly. It wasn't long before Zhang Yi caught up.

At this point, the Great Jagras was clearly at the end of its strength, limping as it walked—obviously in a severely wounded state.

Just as before, Zhang Yi charged forward, Great Sword in hand, followed by his Palico.

After just a few slashes, the roaring Great Jagras finally collapsed.

Simultaneously, a message appeared on screen: 【Primary Objective Completed】.

"I still feel like I haven't had enough!" Zhang Yi approached the fallen Great Jagras to harvest materials, feeling slightly unsatisfied.

Although the Great Jagras wasn't particularly difficult, the issue was that while his Great Sword dealt high damage, its speed was still a bit slow.

Out of ten attacks, about half missed.

Especially the True Charged Slash—throughout the entire fight, it only landed once. But no doubt about it, the damage it dealt was immense.

He also noticed another thing: the Great Sword's hyper armor wasn't truly Invincible.

It could withstand regular attacks, but attacks capable of knockback could still break hyper armor.

"I wonder what new monsters await later!"

Looking at the countdown, Zhang Yi sighed with emotion.

So far, his experience had been excellent. He felt he could give Monster Hunter: World a solid nine out of ten. He'd save the last point for now.

The main reason? He found the new player tutorial somewhat unreasonable.

During the fight with the Great Jagras, the Research Team Leader kept instructing him on various operations—clearly the tutorial NPC.

But this guy just stood there watching. We're both Hunters—why don't you jump in and help me fight!?

What are you just standing around for!?

Just because you're the Commander-in-Chief's grandson, you think you're special!?

The Hunter's Guild doesn't need nepotism!

I hate people like you the most—princelings!

While grumbling inwardly, Zhang Yi hummed a tune as he returned to Astera Base to turn in his quest, preparing to take on a new mission for another round of hunting.

However, at that very moment, a pop-up notification appeared.

【Demo version ends here. Game officially launches on August 7. Stay Tuned!】

No... it's over!?

Zhang Yi stared at the message, looking completely bewildered.
