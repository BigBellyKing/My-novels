Chapter 312: Tactical Lineup is Fine, We'll Win This Round For Sure! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Looking at the dark, beeping contraption on the ground.

Before the few of them could react.

‘Boom!’

Accompanied by a deafening explosion, a ball of fire erupted in the center of the five individuals.

If they had faced it head-on, their Greatshields might have withstood the damage from the Remote Charge.

But at that moment, Wang Yifan had his back to the Remote Charge, while the others had their faces to it.

In reality, they would surely have been blown to pieces.

However, this was a game after all, and such graphic scenes wouldn't appear. The resulting effect was that the Greatshield remained standing, while five bodies were directly sent flying by the powerful impact.

In the upper right corner of everyone's game interface, kill icons flashed one after another.

One Remote Charge, five kills!

“Holy cow! What just happened?!”

“That little black box was a bomb?”

“I’m stunned!”

“What the heck was that? That bomb was so powerful?!”

Song Ren, Zhang Yi, and the others were all utterly bewildered.

What happened?

They were blown away just like that?

Just now, the opponents threw three or four hand grenades, which didn't cause any damage or threat at all.

What kind of thing was that? How could it cause so much damage?

It completely annihilated all five of them?

Meanwhile, the defenders were ecstatic, clearly not expecting to pull off such a massive comeback.

Kapkan (operator) and Rook, who were downstairs, immediately rushed to the bomb defusal device and disarmed the bomb in the nick of time.

“It’s over, we’ve been executed! We might even become online content!” Song Ren said with a bitter expression.

He had originally thought it would be a big show.

The first half of the story had unfolded exactly as he had planned.

But he never expected the script's ending to take an unexpected twist.

And indeed, just as he thought, in the internet cafe lobby on the first floor, many people who couldn't find a spot chose to sit in empty seats, watching and waiting.

This scene unfolded, immediately making countless players burst into laughter.

“I’m dying of laughter! This must be the first five kills in Rainbow Six Siege, right?”

“Haha, it was clearly Shock Brother Bandit’s five kills, but why is all my attention on the attacking squad?”

“+1! It’s too hilarious!”

“But the train formation tactic isn't invincible after all!”

“Of course it’s not invincible! And it’s completely different from previous FPS games. In Rainbow Six Siege, gadgets, Operator skills, and environmental destruction all have a significant impact on combat!”

Many FPS game enthusiasts in the lobby started discussing animatedly.

Even though it was just a simple game, many FPS players already felt the unique enjoyment of Rainbow Six Siege.

In previous FPS games, it was all about marksmanship, but in Rainbow Six Siege, they saw more strategic chess games.

On the defender’s side, led by Bandit, they turned the tide from defeat to victory, and their morale soared.

At the same time, they understood some basic game elements: the Plaster Walls in the garage that could be smashed open needed to be reinforced.

And because they had won the previous round by discreetly throwing Remote Charges from the second floor, they now had to pay a little attention upstairs.

Although the attackers didn't have Remote Charges, they did have Fuze and hand grenades.

“Let’s adjust our lineup,” Bandit, the veteran on the defender's side, suggested.

Since they were playing together and given his excellent performance earlier, everyone agreed to follow his command.

Soon, the defender's lineup was finalized.

Mute (operator name), who could place signal disruptors to disable electronic devices.

Pulse, the bald, sunglasses-wearing, cool-looking Operator who could scan heartbeats.

Shock Brother Bandit, who had put on a great show in the last round.

Valkyrie, who provided vision with her Black Eye cameras.

And a Recruit, chosen by the system by default when the player didn’t know which Operator to pick and ran out of time.

Players currently had no clear understanding of lineup composition, such as what kind of playstyle was needed for defending and attacking teams, and there were no established tactics.

But not understanding the game mechanisms or having clear tactics didn't mean players lacked flashy moves or ideas.

As for Song Ren's attacking team, they still used an old routine.

“Listen to me, I think our tactics and lineup are fine, it’s just our playstyle that’s problematic. We’ll win this round!” Song Ren, acting as a team motivator, rallied his squad.

Despite being attacked by a Remote Charge in the last round, Song Ren firmly believed it was just an accident.

They had simply been a little careless, which led to their inability to respond effectively.

This time, he was confident that with their more mature experience, they would be able to handle it well.

“The garage door is reinforced this time!”

“Hey! Why is my drone broken? It can’t move?”

Even with previous attacking experience, the Chicago Mansion map still left a few of them somewhat bewildered.

They either got lost, had their drones destroyed, or were interfered with by Operator skills.

After the countdown, the game officially began. As before, they destroyed the outdoor cameras, and the Greatshield and Flash Shield took the first two positions, continuing to push forward.

However, this time the Garage Room wasn’t so easy to enter.

The Plaster Walls of both the large and small Garage Rooms were completely reinforced with steel plates and electrified.

If they wanted to proceed, they could only go through the wooden door next to it.

Although it fit the characteristics of the train formation tactic, Song Ren, who was scanning the door with IQ, found himself in a dilemma. His scan showed two traps at the entrance.

If the Greatshield took the hit, he wasn't sure if it would lead to death, as they still didn’t fully understand these game mechanisms.

Smashing the wooden planks and clearing them with guns wasn’t out of the question, but the crucial point was that the only one among them with a hand grenade was Joey’s Sledge, and he had chosen a Concussion Grenade for this round.

The others had no hand grenades at all; they could only smash the wooden planks and clear them with guns.

But the confined space made Song Ren a little nervous.

After all, he didn't know what the situation inside was. When clearing traps, the Greatshield couldn’t stand guard to protect those behind, which could easily lead to one of them being picked off.

“Joey, smash this wall open!” Seeing the plain white wall beside them, Song Ren's eyes lit up, and he confidently gave the order.

Upon hearing Song Ren’s words, Joey paused for a moment.

“Joey? Joey?” Song Ren called out twice, seeing Joey frozen there.

Without a sound, Joey silently walked to the wall, swung his Sledge, and smashed it once. However, the wall remained completely intact.

“Ahem… I haven’t played Sledge before, so I’m not clear on his skills. This wall can’t be smashed, huh?” Song Ren coughed twice to ease the awkwardness.

“So what do we do now?” Zhang Yi asked.

“No big deal, let’s go around first. There’s still plenty of time, there must be other ways,” Song Ren suggested.

Following his words, the group moved in a stealth walk, still in their train formation, towards the side of the garage. After passing through a courtyard, they quickly found a staircase leading to the basement.

The path to the underground warehouse through the staircase was blocked by a door barricade.

Song Ren scanned it, confirmed there were no electronic traps inside, and then discussed tactics with the team.

“Same old routine, Greatshield and Flash Shield go first and second, the ones behind follow a bit slower, then we push straight in and take it!”

“But this time we need to spread out a bit more and also pay attention to what’s above!”

The group whispered tactical plans at the entrance, lowering their voices with a great sense of immersion.

However, what Song Ren and the others didn't notice was a pile of broken wooden planks beneath the door barricade.

As for the Unmanned Reconnaissance Vehicle?

Just like in the first round, they only played with it at the beginning; when the real fight started, everyone completely forgot about it.
