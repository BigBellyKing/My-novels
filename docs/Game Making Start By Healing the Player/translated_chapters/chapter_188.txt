Chapter 187: Mr. Chen's Miscalculation? (7th update, requesting subscriptions, monthly passes)

Undoubtedly, players of the Souls series can be said to be very hardcore.

Even though most ordinary players might have just finished their bell-ringing journey and started a new journey of suffering, for some hardcore players, many had already completed their first playthrough.

At the same time, various scene maps of Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame were drawn by enthusiastic players online. In addition, as players explored and delved into the game, they even researched some strategies that allowed rookies to sweep through enemies in their first playthrough.

This was truly a Hack-and-Slash experience, not the kind of joke where monsters were mowing down players. The simplest of these was located at Wyvern Bridge. In the early game, one could first buy bows and arrows in Undead Burg outside the city. Then, at Wyvern Bridge, slowly shoot arrows at the Red Dragon's tail. After twenty or thirty shots, one could cut off its tail and obtain the Drake Sword.

Although it's an early-game weapon, in the Undead Burg area outside the city, an Undead wielding the Drake Sword is the coolest kid. For players seeking a slightly more challenging technique, they could practice parkour, head directly to the Catacombs, sign a covenant with the Gravelord, and obtain the Gravelord Sword.

This method is very simple; players only need to skillfully traverse the map and avoid being killed by monsters mid-way. The only difficult part, which also tests luck, is in the tunnel, where there's a gigantic headless Wedge Demon. Besides dodging its massive attacks, hiding in a nearby stone coffin also requires a bit of luck.

This is because there's a chance of being discovered by the Wedge Demon and executed. However, by staying in the coffin for half a minute, you can reach the Gravelord and sign a covenant with him. Compared to one's starting weapon with a Base Attack Power of less than 100, the Gravelord Sword boasts a Base Attack Power over 300. With it, as long as you're careful in the early game, you can basically sweep through enemies, making for an extremely good game experience.

Not only that, in Darkroot Garden, there's a very mighty Black Knight wielding a Guandao. Luring him near a cliff and using the terrain to act as a despicable Undead might earn you the Black Knight Halberd, also known as the Guandao. Like the Gravelord Sword, obtaining the Guandao makes the entire game much simpler.

However, compared to the Gravelord Sword, the Guandao has slightly higher stat requirements for the player. Additionally, one could try killing the Black Knight to see if a Black Knight Sword drops, but this requires a certain level of player skill and luck.

Although in high New Game+ cycles, weapons like the Gravelord Sword don't scale well, and the Guandao is only usable, in the first playthrough, it's incredibly satisfying. It truly makes players feel how easy and joyful the game can be. Compared to the previous game's famously frustrating Musou method where the second BOSS was the Dancer, while this new installment is much more suffering if played normally, using specific strategies makes it incredibly satisfying!

As various strategy videos from veteran players emerged, the players became delighted. Although this situation definitely means more suffering in high New Game+ cycles, requiring them to make up for all the avoided difficulties, what does it matter? They're having a blast now!

“Haha, Chen Xu never expected this, did he!”

“Hehe, suffering doesn't exist! Musou is too satisfying!”

“+1, this Guandao is too strong, just a few hits to defeat the BOSS!”

“Friends, hurry up and enjoy it, I'm afraid Chen Xu will release a patch later to fix the loopholes!”

“That's right, that's right, hurry up and enjoy it!”

The 'Undead' online were laughing very happily.

At the Nebula Games experience store, in the rest area, Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin were playing Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame. One person held the newly acquired Gravelord Sword, rampaging through Undead Burg, while the other was still trying to figure out how to get the Guandao.

“Mr. Chen, should we fix this?” Qin Yi asked, sitting next to Chen Xu.

“Why should we fix it? This is part of the game, isn't it?” Chen Xu said with a smile.

Hearing Chen Xu's words, Qin Yi showed a surprised expression. Something was off! According to the extremely cruel settings for Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame during its development, how could Chen Xu remain indifferent now that players were sweeping through enemies?

“What kind of expression is that? I'm very considerate of players, I just don't say it. Players of the previous game said it was too difficult to play, some even used trainers. Look, this installment maintains a high difficulty in its normal progression, but it also provides players with ways to cheese it. This is all for the players, this is my love!” Chen Xu said with emotion.

Hearing Chen Xu's words, Qin Yi was speechless, and Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin, who were playing the game nearby, involuntarily rolled their eyes. They didn't believe him!

Seeing everyone's expressions, Chen Xu shrugged helplessly. Trust between people was becoming increasingly scarce!

“Right, Qin Yi, take a look at this, then this afternoon have the project team start working on the new mode. Tomorrow, you'll go with me to Galaxy Smart Tech again to understand the latest AI parameters and settings, so we can coordinate and create the new mode.” Chen Xu picked up a design concept document and handed it to Qin Yi.

Qin Yi paused, then took the concept document from Chen Xu. When he saw the first four characters, his hand trembled.

‘Death Mode!’

An ominous premonition surged from within him. Then he looked at the content below and the keyword directory.

[Gods and Lords of Cinder in their Prime]

[First Playthrough Completed Players Unlock Challenge]

Qin Yi hadn't read the rest of the content, but just seeing the first two key points, he understood. Going to Galaxy Smart Tech must be related to AI Technology-Applied Game. And for the 'Gods and Lords of Cinder in their Prime', Qin Yi thought about the game's settings.

In the game, the player's final opponent is Lord Gwyn, who has burned into an empty shell, fighting purely by instinct and completely unable to use his signature move Sunlight Spear. From a lore perspective, this was to show Gwyn's weakness and the spirit of willingly linking the fire and burning into an empty shell.

But from a combat perspective, Gwyn was indeed a bit weaker compared to some other BOSSes, especially since he could be parried. But now??? A Gwyn who can't be parried, and can throw Sunlight Spears? The most crucial point is a core aspect: 'Death Mode' unlocked for first playthrough players!

Although he hadn't believed Chen Xu's words at all before, Qin Yi never expected that this was where he was waiting for the players! Qin Yi finished reading the entire document, then opened the game forum, looking at players still commenting things like 'Chen Xu's Miscalculation', 'Chen Xu's Mercy', and 'hurry up and enjoy it' under various strategy videos and posts. He couldn't help but feel extremely emotional.

Mr. Chen is Mr. Chen after all!
