Chapter 321: Ten Years Making Games, Nine Years Making CGI (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

The development progress of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was proceeding very smoothly.

Although this was the team's second large-scale VR game, 

they had prior experience from Rainbow Six Siege, and thanks to the strategic cooperation with NetDragon, which also provided substantial technical support, 

they didn't encounter any particularly difficult challenges.

The remaining issue was the art resources. Currently, Nebula Games had only developed Rainbow Six Siege, so the accumulated resources weren't extensive.

Moreover, the player experience between the two games was completely different.

All action systems, including shooting mechanics, were entirely incompatible.

After all, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare needed to deliver an intense, swift, and exhilarating fast-paced experience to players.

Regarding the vast amount of art resources, apart from the core designs, the rest could be fully outsourced to external developers.

For game development, content outsourcing—especially art resources—was a common practice, 

as it could save the team a significant amount of time.

………………

While Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was quietly under development, 

NetDragon was also making big moves. First, they announced the PC version of Rainbow Six Siege 

and simultaneously planned to host related esports tournaments.

Chen Xu didn't get too involved in this, 

since organizing competitions was something NetDragon had plenty of experience with, given their portfolio of competitive games.

Moreover, Nebula Games was primarily responsible for subsequent content operations.

Meanwhile, information about Atrai's Storm Action continued to flow steadily into the domestic market through the Channel Alliance.

After all, it was a popular IP and Zeus's flagship title.

Clearly, Atrai had a well-thought-out plan.

Simultaneously with the announcement of the Storm Action game, 

the film's production company also revealed news about a sequel to Storm Action.

It was evident they were aiming for a powerful collaboration to boost popularity.

The domestic Channel Alliance also placed high hopes on this blockbuster, especially since Nebula Games Platform's market share was continuously expanding.

An increasing number of third-party game developers were choosing to launch their games first on the Nebula Games Platform.

Although the Channel Alliance had gradually reduced its revenue share, it made no difference.

Coupled with games like Warcraft, Minecraft, and Rainbow Six Siege continuously strengthening Nebula Games' player base, 

they were now slowly eroding the alliance's influence.

Therefore, the Channel Alliance also held high expectations for the Storm Action blockbuster.

Besides offline showcases and press conferences, 

more and more information about Storm Action was emerging.

First, the actors who played the lead roles in the film would participate in motion capture for the game, ensuring the characters remained true to the original.

Then came related gameplay details and materials, revealing scenes from the movie and Easter eggs.

This excited many fan players.

After all, several years had passed, and there were still many players who had seen Storm Action and missed it.

Now, with news of a new movie, the game adaptation, and those familiar scenes, 

it instantly felt authentic to them.

"The fidelity is so high! And it even looks better than the movie!"

"Indeed, but I wonder which timeline and story phase it covers."

"I'm more interested in the gameplay!"

"No need to doubt that—Atrai still has the capability!"

"I wonder if they can recreate the epic-scale battles from the original film, especially the scene where the protagonist escapes the building, and then the entire building gets blown up—absolutely spectacular."

"I think there might be even bigger scenes?"

Players, seeing the information Storm Action released, expressed great anticipation.

After all, for such an adapted IP game, 

the first impression for players was always about the quality of the graphics and how faithfully the game recreated the original work.

Atrai clearly understood this. Otherwise, there would be no need to spend so much money acquiring the license.

All the released materials were centered precisely on these points.

In an instant, it gave these fan players a powerful boost of confidence.

The gameplay might still be unclear, 

but in terms of graphics and fidelity, expectations were already maxed out.

This was a very standard IP warm-up promotion.

However, just as Atrai and the domestic Channel Alliance were continuously promoting and building hype for Storm Action, 

Chen Xu's official Weibo account was updated after a long hiatus.

The post featured a picture of a barren wasteland.

Heavy machine guns, shoulder-mounted rocket launchers... various weapons were displayed.

There were also group photos of staff members.

The caption was just a simple sentence:

"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare—a game that defines the theme of contemporary warfare—will launch on the Huanyu VR Platform!"

……………………

As soon as this Weibo post went live, players instantly exploded with excitement.

Because this post was a direct statement!

Mr. Chen had been quiet for a while—clearly, he was making another new game!

And it was a contemporary warfare-themed game.

Judging from the images, Mr. Chen's ambition this time was unprecedented!

Heavy machine guns, shoulder-mounted rocket launchers—did this mean the game would feature these real combat weapons?

Immediately, all players lost their composure.

"I lack culture, so all I can say is 'Damn it!'"

"As expected, Mr. Quick Shooter won't stay idle—he's planning something big!"

"The surprise came too fast, catching me off guard!"

"So he's going head-to-head with Atrai now!"

"A game that defines contemporary warfare? Mr. Chen is so bold—but I love it!"

"Judging from this momentum, is it almost finished developing!?"

Countless players were extremely excited and thrilled.

Even though they had no idea what the game looked like, and only a theme and title had been announced, 

over the years, Nebula Games had accumulated enough popularity and reputation to make them eagerly anticipate it.

While countless online players were celebrating, Nebula Games was discussing with Qin Yi how to better showcase actions and VR chamber force feedback systems in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, 

when Yang Chen from the Game Department called.

"Mr. Chen? How's the development progress of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare? You must ensure the game's quality. Don't worry about tight deadlines—Zeus overseas is progressing at a similar pace to us, or possibly even slower. So Storm Action, which is supposed to support Zeus, isn't developing as quickly as imagined," Yang Chen said, clearly anxious.

Although Huanyu VR's supporting games weren't limited to just Nebula Games, 

the initial impression given to players was also important.

Yang Chen was worried that Chen Xu might rush development to gain an early advantage over Atrai and capture attention, thus compromising the game's content.

Hearing Yang Chen's words, Chen Xu smiled knowingly. "Don't worry, Minister Yang. I would never joke with Nebula Games' reputation. The development of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is going very smoothly, and the quality is absolutely guaranteed. As for racing against them? We never even considered it."

After a few more exchanges with Yang Chen, Chen Xu hung up the phone and smiled.

Chen Xu naturally wouldn't neglect game content just to rush progress.

After all, as the old saying goes, no one remembers a garbage game released on schedule.

Whether it's released on time, delayed, or even reverse-delayed with an early launch, as long as the quality satisfies players, everything is fine.

Otherwise, no matter if you release on time, delay, or reverse-delay with an early launch, players will roast you so badly your own mother won't recognize you.

As for now? Let's just say it's being made, it's being made.

For Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, although the game's progress had only completed about one-sixth of the total, 

the progress on CGI was like a heifer riding a rocket—lightning fast.

After all, in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Chen Xu chose to use CGI to mask most loading transitions to ensure outstanding visual effects.

Combined with the various operator CGs from Rainbow Six Siege and the CGs from Warcraft, 

Chen Xu could confidently say that Nebula Games was absolutely professional in this area!

Ten years making games, nine years making CGI.

This was the previous online evaluation of Nebula Games, and Chen Xu was determined to live up to it.

Otherwise, how disappointed would the players be?

After all, he, Chen Xu, was a game developer who never lied and never disappointed players.
