Chapter 152: Players' Complaints (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

As a thread-based game, *It Takes Two* is quite large in scale.

However, if excluding repeated plays of various mini-games, the entire playthrough takes approximately 12 hours.

With the first batch of players clearing the game, discussions about its content began to flourish.

‘Honestly, this has to be the most interesting game so far this year!’

‘Agreed. I think it’s not just the best this year—this is easily the most interesting game in recent years. And if we narrow it down to two-player co-op, it’s definitely number one!’

‘+1. This game is simply unbelievable! Every level has a different theme, unique items—just wow!’

‘Exactly! It’s like watching an animated movie!’

‘Most importantly, the gameplay is incredibly rich. From the first level to the last, the items and level design are absolutely brilliant.’

‘Haha, yeah! I had so much fun playing with my girlfriend. Chen Xu really didn’t lie this time!’

‘Indeed. The Warrior of Love finally made a heartwarming game!’

‘Yes, the story really touched me by the end.’

‘Absolutely. Especially the ending, when they showed every item we encountered—it was just amazing.’

‘Though that part where we had to destroy the little plush toy… honestly, it made me feel terrible.’

‘Same. My girlfriend nearly quit the game and shut down in sadness.’

‘Damn it! You played with your girlfriend?!’

‘But seriously, doesn’t anyone remember the Rhinoceros Beetle inside the Greatwood? We promised him nectar—why did we blow up the beehive!?’

‘2333333, I forgot about that until you mentioned it—the Rhinoceros Beetle is the most tragic character!’

‘Haha, the forgotten Rhinoceros Beetle. Now that you mention it, he really got screwed.’

‘Rhinoceros Beetle: Heh, maybe I’m not human, but you guys are truly dogs. Just a disposable tool insect, right?’

Across various related forum communities, many players who experienced *It Takes Two* were thoroughly impressed by the game.

Regarding the game’s content, nearly all players gave uniformly positive reviews on gameplay.

On the Nebula Games Platform, *It Takes Two* received a player rating as high as 9.8 out of 10.

Among the few negative reviews, aside from those who were just playing along with memes, the majority centered on the game’s only controversial storyline.

That is, when Cody and May mistakenly believe their daughter Rose’s tears are the antidote,

and thus forcibly destroy the little plush toy.

Many players said this part made them extremely uncomfortable.

After all, the Elephant Princess—Poppi—is truly harmless within the game.

So innocent and adorable, only to be destroyed by May and Cody.

That’s hard for many to accept.

Many players sided with Rose and the toys, feeling that Cody and May, as parents, were simply too awful.

Like the space monkeys, who as toys knew how to prevent Rose from being sad, yet as Rose’s parents, Cody and May actively tried to make her cry.

However, some players expressed understanding toward Cody and May.

After all, from a plot and character perspective, suddenly transforming from humans into a puppet and a clay figure—how could anyone stay calm?

When they believed they’d found the right method, they naturally pursued that goal.

Besides, they weren’t actually trying to harm Rose—they just wanted her to cry.

In real life, hasn’t every parent made their child cry at some point? To claim that Cody and May don’t love their daughter based solely on this is completely unreasonable.

After all, dialogue in the game shows that May works outside the home and frequently works overtime, yet still remembers the date of Rose’s dentist appointment.

And though Cody, as a stay-at-home dad, forgot to take Rose to the dentist at the start, his concern for her is evident—Rose’s Lego castle was built by Cody himself.

If there’s anything wrong with Cody and May, it’s their self-righteousness—whether toward their partner or their child.

That’s their biggest flaw.

Of course, this was just a debate among a portion of players who paid closer attention to the plot setting.

Another group of serious-minded players focused on something entirely different.

‘Wait, has no one noticed Rose? Don’t you think, if you look at this game from another angle, a joyful game instantly turns into a thrilling horror game?’

‘Haha, now that you mention it, it actually makes sense! Parents mysteriously fall into an unbreakable sleep, supernatural occurrences keep happening at home—what’s the truth behind all this? Stay tuned for tonight’s Approaching Science segment!’

‘The daughter’s just minding her own business at home—suddenly the vacuum cleaner explodes, the toolbox falls and gets damaged, her favorite plush toy drops out of nowhere, the Cuckoo Clock repairs itself, the garden’s withered flowers suddenly bloom again, eerie sounds come from the gramophone in the second-floor attic—Damn it! Utterly terrifying when thinking about it deeply!’

‘You guys are going too far! It was such a joyful game, and now I have goosebumps!’

Besides discussions about the game’s content, players also voiced complaints about their real-world experience.

The game’s theme revolves around repairing a marital relationship, the characters are a married couple (male and female), and the genre is two-player co-op.

Coupled with its announcement on Valentine’s Day, it was clearly labeled as a couple's game.

But the problem is—where are all the couples?

Or rather, many players—some haven’t even dated a young lady, let alone found themselves as lone wolves, completely alone!

Moreover, *It Takes Two*, as an Adventure Game, demands not only tacit understanding but also slightly precise operations in certain levels.

Thus, the online trend began to shift.

Initially, everyone praised the game’s level design and how perfectly the art style and story blended together.

But after two or three days, as more players completed the game, all sorts of bizarre complaints started emerging.

And these resonated strongly with a large number of players.

Across various game forums and the game’s own review section, comments like these flooded in:

‘Incredible value. At 146, it’s not inferior to any blockbuster. Only regret? I don’t have a young lady to play with!’

‘An absolute masterpiece. But I thought my wife was too bad at it, so I kicked her out and played with my bro for two days. Guys, was I right?’

‘Great game, but the title is misleading. Others play *It Takes Two*, I play *Male Bonding Takes Two*.’

‘Help! I played this with my dorm roommate, and now he keeps giving me weird looks. Plus, he insists on showering with me every time!’
