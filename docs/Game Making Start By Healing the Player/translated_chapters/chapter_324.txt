Chapter 323: The White House – Fallen (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Clicking on the video, Zhang Yi's vision was first plunged into darkness, then the Nebula Games LOGO appeared.

This was a standard opening.

But the next moment.

A sound reached Zhang Yi's ears.

*Swoosh*... it sounded like something falling, then... *Boom!* a huge explosion.

This was immediately followed by rapid gunfire, screams, shouts, and more explosions.

In the darkness, enhanced by the VR gaming pod's stereo sound, Zhang Yi was instantly immersed in the atmosphere of war.

Even though the screen was still dark, Zhang Yi was already certain.

This was a game completely different from *Rainbow Six Siege*.

Because in *Rainbow Six Siege*, while there were explosions and gunfights, they were mostly indoor combat. But with this *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*, even though the visuals hadn't appeared yet, the sound effects alone made him feel an atmosphere called war.

“Move! Move! Quick!”

“Support! Requesting fire support!”

“Attack! Attack!”

“R—P—G!”

“I’m hit!”

“Fire! Fire!”

“2 o’clock, requesting supp...”

Amidst the cacophony, the darkness before Zhang Yi's eyes finally lifted.

It was replaced by a blur.

Promotional video content presented from a first-person perspective?

The sound was a bit noisy, and his vision was also a bit blurry.

Then a soldier, who had been lying on the ground, slowly stood up.

But the next moment, before he could react.

A bullet instantly pierced his head.

At this point, the classic bullet time sequence appeared. Accompanied by the bullet and blood, the camera followed the bullet's trajectory, slowly rising.

“Oh my god!” As the bullet stretched, Zhang Yi was completely stunned.

What did he see?!

This battlefield was actually the White House!

America's most iconic administrative building, the White House, located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C.!

And the tattered Stars and Stripes flag, all indicated that the White House had fallen!

This was absolutely insane!

In an instant, Zhang Yi's eyes widened.

Countless soldiers moved through a hail of bullets and explosions. In the dark night, heavy rain poured down, but it couldn't extinguish the flames burning from the explosions.

The once magnificent White House was now in ruins and rubble.

In the sky, a fighter jet strafed the enemies outside the White House, its fire spitting relentlessly, drawing a fierce line across the air.

But at this moment, a roar came: R! P! G!

With sparks and a fiery trail, a rocket hit the fuselage directly. Accompanied by a thunderous explosion and the brilliant firelight of the night.

In the air, a Blackhawk falls!

The entire White House was completely engulfed in the flames of war, with only the tattered Stars and Stripes still fluttering.

The White House – Fallen!

“Damn it! This is so freaking awesome!”

With wide eyes, Zhang Yi cried out.

With the panoramic view and stereo sound of VR, the entire atmosphere of war was vividly displayed.

Of course, the most crucial part was the setting!

It was absolutely insane!

Who could have imagined that Chen Xu would pull off such a crazy scene in this game called *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*?!

The White House falls!

My god!

It's absolutely insane!

Zhang Yi roared in his heart, but goosebumps had already risen all over his body from excitement.

Putting everything else aside, just this scene of the White House falling was enough to thrill him.

A definite buy!

There's nothing more to say!

This *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare* is definitely a must-buy game!

As Zhang Yi was excited, the video continued to play.

“Why did you do this?! Where did you get the nukes?”

A man with a mustache and a boonie hat used a set of skilled hand-to-hand combat techniques on an enemy, slamming him to the ground and beating him severely.

“Who is it?!”

“Who! Tell me! His name!”

Looking at the beaten enemy on the ground, the officer with the boonie hat had a cold expression.

However, the person tied to the chair, even though his consciousness was blurred from the beating, still didn't utter a word. At this moment, the camera zoomed in.

His expression was one of fear.

Then the phone next to him rang.

“Sir, his phone is ringing.”

The soldier handed the phone to the captain.

After answering the call, the officer with the boonie hat said nothing, turned, and shot the enemy he had just interrogated.

“Sir, who was that?” the soldier next to him asked, confused.

“Zakhaev... Imran Zakhaev.” Throwing the phone away, the officer with the boonie hat seemed to fall into a memory.

As the words faded, the scene on the screen gradually disappeared.

The next moment, the camera moved into the sky, a God's-eye view overlooking the land.

This was a city engulfed in war.

Countless attack helicopters and tanks and armored vehicles were evacuating.

But at this very moment, a dazzling flash of light erupted from the city.

A huge explosion sounded, followed by a mushroom cloud rising.

Dust filled the sky, and a visible shockwave spread outwards from the epicenter.

Countless buildings instantly collapsed, helicopters in the sky, armored vehicles and tanks on the ground, all fell or were directly overturned and exploded.

As the dust settled, the central area of the city was a massive crater.

The city was nuked!

“My god!” Zhang Yi swallowed, having already guessed when the mustachioed officer interrogated the enemy.

But he never expected such a scene to actually appear. Was this part of the game's story?

No way?!

The scene flashed, and countless armored divisions and fully armed soldiers slowly advanced in the Middle East.

Outside Earth, an EMP missile was launched into space, causing a space station to disintegrate, and astronauts screamed in panic.

At Champ de Mars, countless soldiers desperately resisted enemy armored tanks and attack helicopters, and amidst the bombing, the Eiffel Tower, which had stood tall, collapsed into the Seine River.

In the dark night, amidst lightning and heavy rain, a cruise ship sailed on the sea, and a special operations team left no armed militant alive on board.

An exhilarating snowmobile chase across vast snowy terrain.

Amidst a hail of bullets and explosions, a chase with tanks through the city, the once prosperous city turned into ruins after being ravaged by artillery fire.

Cars on the streets exploded and burned, engulfing the city in flames.

Assault boats on a turbulent river facing helicopters.

Frantically fleeing drone bombings in a mountain town.

Almost every imaginable intense action sequence was vividly displayed in this promotional video.

Finally, with the launch of two nuclear missiles, the game's name officially appeared.
