Chapter 253: Official Launch (Seventh Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Online, players were still very happy because of Chen Xu's official Weibo post.

After all, Chen Xu had also positively responded to their feedback.

Moreover, many players noticed a particular detail: an information point Chen Xu mentioned in the official Weibo post.

In the later stages of the game, there would be a brand new monster: the Tempered monster.

According to the explanation, 'Tempered' refers to monsters that have endured countless battles, which perfectly applies Nebula Games' latest AI technology.

This garnered significant attention from many players.

Before this, players had all personally experienced the demo version of *Monster Hunter: World*, as it was free after all.

Among the features highlighted during previous promotions, the AI performance effect specifically emphasized by Nebula Games had also caught the attention of many players.

Ordinary creatures like the Aptonoth, Coronated Dragon, and Small Jagras didn't elicit much of a reaction.

However, when many players faced the Great Jagras, they felt a distinct difference.

It truly seemed to be assessing the danger posed by hunters or other animals, and then making decisions accordingly.

Many observant players also discovered that in *Monster Hunter: World*, every creature possesses unique ecological habits and related patterns.

Simply put, the Ancient Forest was a self-sustaining world.

For instance, the Great Jagras didn't just stay in one spot without moving, even though the demo version of *Monster Hunter: World*'s quest only featured the Great Jagras.

Moreover, the Ancient Forest area was not fully accessible to players.

The only place players could explore was the area available in the trial version.

But it was still explorable, nonetheless.

And many players also discovered that the Great Jagras in the game wasn't a so-called fixed-location BOSS, waiting there for players to confront it.

All monsters in the game would wander around.

They would also hunt.

Furthermore, their hunting methods varied depending on the creature.

For example, when facing the most docile and also the 'noobiest' Aptonoths—those most frequently slain by players—the Great Jagras would essentially charge straight at them, devouring them without a second thought upon capture.

However, when facing Coronated Dragons, it wasn't the same as dealing with Herbivores.

Instead, it would first observe from the sidelines, biding its time, and more often than not, the Great Jagras would target smaller female Coronated Dragons rather than the larger males.

It also prioritized devouring isolated Coronated Dragons.

Because, compared to the virtually defenseless Herbivores, Coronated Dragons, when in groups and possessing some offensive capability, clearly posed a greater threat than Herbivores, and a rash attack could put the Great Jagras in some danger.

Furthermore, many players also discovered that after being attacked, the Great Jagras would indeed flee, but it wouldn't necessarily run back to its nest every time.

Instead, it would escape based on the current map environment.

These behaviors were actually more about the details.

Many players didn't notice them when they first started playing the demo.

Because these detailed AI performances weren't overly obvious, and upon first encounter, it was easy to assume they were pre-scripted.

Many players, when first trying the game, were mostly focused on fighting monsters, completely overlooking these details.

However, because the trial content of the demo version was limited, many players, after completing it, felt they hadn't had enough and replayed it, or chose new weapons to continue hunting monsters.

It was then that players began to notice some of the details they had previously missed.

And these observations made players even more excited.

After all, this was just a demo, and the Great Jagras could only be considered a tutorial BOSS in the game.

The Anjanath and Rathalos from earlier promotional videos hadn't even appeared yet, let alone the Nergigante that was featured in the initial promotions.

All of this made many players incredibly excited, and they also held some anticipation for the upcoming Tempered monsters that utilized AI technology.

For many players, they now felt that *Monster Hunter: World* was simply a game that couldn't be more perfect!

Firstly, the worldview was incredibly unique, creating a vivid and lifelike New World.

Secondly, the combat system was also flawless, with each weapon possessing its own distinctive characteristics.

The Hunting Horn, capable of playing a melody that rends one's heart, leaving no kindred spirit to be found across the world.

The Dual Blades, delivering visceral strikes with their Demon Dance, incredibly agile and free-flowing.

The Long Sword, with its Foresight Slash as swift as wind, never fainting.

And the Hammer, like a whirlwind spinning top, and the Lance, with its courageous thrusts.

Each weapon had its unique gameplay and style.

Before this, many players had expressed that the game was too easy.

After all, it felt like they couldn't die no matter what; the monsters were too weak, and the Palico was too strong. How could they possibly get carted?

But now, Chen Xu stated on the official Weibo account that there would be entirely new difficulties later on.

Especially the description of the Tempered monsters made the hardcore players, who were eager for more challenges, extremely excited.

For a time, *Monster Hunter: World* seemed to have completely captivated players from all demographics.

………………

On August 7th, amidst the players' eager anticipation (literally 'longing for stars and moon').

*Monster Hunter: World* officially launched.

Players who had pre-ordered the game were eagerly awaiting its unlock.

In various forums and chat groups, players were chatting enthusiastically.

“Half an hour left! Damn it, I really feel like every day is a year!”

“Bros, what weapons are you guys picking? Let’s add each other, I’m a Long Sword user!”

“Long Sword +1!”

“I think the Hammer is more dominant!”

“I still prefer the Bow, ranged output is super fun!”

“Some veteran players have already tested it in the game. On paper, the Great Sword has the highest damage, and the Bow is also very powerful, but it requires significant kiting. The Charge Blade is quite brutal, but to deal super high damage, you need to use Super Amped Element Discharge, and gathering phials can be a bit troublesome. As for the Heavy Bowgun and Light Bowgun, they seem to be related to ammunition, so resources might be scarce in the early game.”

“Bro upstairs, your stats are very convincing, but I'm still playing Long Sword!”

“Exactly! You might be strong for a moment, but I'll be cool forever!”

Many players were discussing which weapons they would use.

Among them, the Long Sword undoubtedly received the most votes.

It was simply too cool.

Moreover, in the early game, any weapon was viable; it was just a matter of monster-hunting efficiency.

Additionally, while weapons did have different difficulty levels, everyone was still in an exploratory phase. Since the trial version only showcased up to the Great Jagras, all players were very confident in their chosen weapons.

As for the future?

Perhaps only Long Sword players would feel a bit lonely.
