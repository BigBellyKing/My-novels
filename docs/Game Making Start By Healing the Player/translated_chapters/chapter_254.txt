Chapter 253: Officially Launched (Seventh Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)

Meanwhile, online, players were delighted because of Chen Xu's post on the official Weibo account.

After all, Chen Xu had directly responded to their feedback.

Moreover, many players noticed a particular detail—an information point Chen Xu mentioned in the official Weibo post.

In the late game, a brand-new type of monster would appear: the Tempered monster.

According to the explanation, "Tempered" referred to monsters that had survived countless battles, precisely utilizing Nebula Games' latest AI technology.

This caught the attention of many players.

Previously, players had personally tried out the demo version of *Monster Hunter: World*, especially since it was free.

During earlier promotions, Nebula Games had highlighted a specific AI performance effect, which also drew significant attention.

For common creatures like Herbivores, Crown-crested Dragon, and Small Jagras, the effect wasn't particularly noticeable.

However, when facing the Jagras, many players sensed a distinct difference.

Compared to low-intelligence creatures like Crown-crested Dragon and Herbivores, Jagras genuinely gave the illusion of being capable of thought.

It seemed as if it were actually assessing the threat level of Hunters or other animals before making decisions.

Many observant players also noticed that every creature in *Monster Hunter: World* had unique ecological habits and behavioral patterns.

Simply put, the Ancient Forest was a self-sustaining world.

For example, Jagras didn't remain stationary at a fixed location, even though the demo version's quest only involved Jagras.

Moreover, the entire Ancient Forest region wasn't fully accessible to players.

The only explorable area was the limited zone provided in the trial version.

Still, there was some exploration possible.

Many players discovered that Jagras wasn't a fixed-location BOSS waiting passively for players to attack.

All monsters in the game roamed freely.

They also hunted prey.

Furthermore, their hunting methods varied depending on the target.

For instance, when confronting the most docile and weakest creatures—the Herbivores, which players slaughtered the most—Jagras would charge directly and swallow them without hesitation.

But its behavior toward Crown-crested Dragon was entirely different.

Instead of immediate attack, it would first observe from the side.

Moreover, Jagras tended to target smaller female Crown-crested Dragons rather than larger males.

It also prioritized isolated individuals.

Compared to nearly defenseless Herbivores, groups of Crown-crested Dragons possessed some aggression and posed a greater threat, so a reckless attack could endanger the Jagras.

Additionally, many players noticed that after being attacked, Jagras didn't always flee toward its nest.

Instead, it escaped based on the current map environment.

These behaviors were subtle details.

Many players didn't notice them during their initial playthrough.

Such nuanced AI performances weren't overly obvious, and at first glance, they could easily be mistaken as pre-scripted events.

During their first attempts, players were so focused on fighting monsters that they completely overlooked these details.

However, due to the limited content in the demo, many players, after completing it, felt unsatisfied and replayed it—sometimes choosing different weapons to fight monsters again.

It was then that they began noticing details they had previously missed.

These observations heightened their anticipation.

After all, this was only the demo, and Jagras was merely a tutorial BOSS.

Players hadn't yet encountered Anjanath or Rathalos shown in the promotional videos, let alone the Nergigante featured in early promotions.

All of this intensified players' excitement, and they began looking forward to the Tempered monsters powered by advanced AI in subsequent content.

For many players, *Monster Hunter: World* now seemed like a game perfected beyond perfection!

First, its worldview was uniquely crafted, creating a vivid and lifelike New World.

Second, the Combat System was exceptionally well-designed, with each weapon possessing distinct characteristics.

The Hunting Horn, evoking sorrowful melodies across vast distances.

The Dual Blades, delivering visceral strikes and Demon Dance with unmatched flair.

The Long Sword, wielding Foresight Slash like the wind, never fainting.

The Sledge, spinning like a top, and the Lance, charging forward with fearless thrusts.

Each weapon offered unique Gameplay and style.

Previously, many players had complained the game was too easy.

After all, they barely died, monsters seemed weak, and Palico companions were overpowered—how could they possibly get Carting?

But now, Chen Xu's official Weibo post mentioned upcoming new difficulties.

Especially the description of Tempered monsters, which thrilled hardcore players craving greater challenges.

Suddenly, *Monster Hunter: World* appeared to have captivated players across all skill levels.

………………

On August 7th, amid players' eager anticipation,

*Monster Hunter: World* was officially launched.

Players who had pre-ordered the game waited anxiously for its unlock.

On various forums and chat groups, discussions were heating up.

"Half an hour left, damn it! I'm really experiencing the feeling of time dragging!"

"Bro, what weapon are you picking? Let's add each other! I'm playing Long Sword!"

"Long Sword +1!"

"I think the Sledge is more imposing!"

"I still prefer Bow and Arrows—ranged damage output is super fun!"

"Some veteran players have already tested in-game. On paper, Great Sword has the highest damage, and Bow is also very strong, but it demands good positioning. Charge Blade is brutally powerful, but to achieve ultra-high damage output, you need Super Amped Element Discharge, and gathering phials is a bit troublesome. As for Heavy Bowgun and Light Bowgun, it seems to depend on bullets—probably limited resources in the early game."

"Bro upstairs, your data analysis is super convincing, but I'm still going with Long Sword!"

"Exactly! You may dominate temporarily, but I'll stay stylish forever!"

Players enthusiastically debated which weapon to choose.

Unsurprisingly, Long Sword received the most votes.

After all, it was simply too cool.

In the early game, practically any weapon could be used—differences were merely in efficiency when fighting monsters.

Although weapons varied in difficulty, everyone was still in the learning phase. Since the demo only featured Jagras, players felt confident in their chosen weapons.

As for the future?

Well, perhaps only Long Sword players would eventually feel a bit lonely.
