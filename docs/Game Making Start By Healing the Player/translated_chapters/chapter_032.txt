Chapter 32: How Did It Suddenly Turn into a Ghost Story?

As the conversation between the male and female doctors unfolded, Dong Zhen was finally able to access the controllable interface.

Simple, yet sarcastic dialogues—like when approaching the squirrel, he could even witness the bickering between the two doctors.

"Honestly, the game details feel pretty solid. The dialogues are all super detailed, just like *Undertale*—everything’s meticulously crafted," Dong Zhen commented as he controlled the protagonist.

For instance, when seeing a signpost, they’d grumble: "In the middle of the mountains, wouldn’t this sign just get stolen?"

The dialogue was slightly humorous, and a little threatening to Dong Zhen’s job as a streamer.

Because usually, *he* was the one making such comments.

Now the game had already made them all—how was *he* supposed to react?

"So this is a story-driven game? Feels a bit plain so far," Dong Zhen mused.

Except for briefly moving aside a rock-like object, the entire gameplay so far consisted only of walking and simple conversations—nothing particularly special.

*Undertale* at least had those bullet-dodging combat segments.

The only real highlight so far was the Music.

From *Mirror (Game)* to *Undertale*, and now *To the Moon*—the Soundtrack was truly excellent.

As for the graphics, Chen Xu’s version of *To the Moon*, while slightly improved from the pixelated style of the classic RPG Maker from Dong Zhen’s previous life, could only be described as average—nowhere near outstanding.

While Dong Zhen Sighed with Emotion internally, in the game, Doctors Neil and Eva arrived at their destination: a large mansion.

After knocking, a middle-aged woman opened the door. Introduced as Lily, she was the caretaker for the elderly man named Johnny.

The two children playing piano earlier were her daughter and son.

After the introduction, Lily led the two doctors upstairs.

Meanwhile, downstairs, the two children briefly argued over who got to play the piano next, then sat side by side and began playing—the same piano piece from before the doctors’ car accident.

The game’s theme song?

Dong Zhen speculated.

As Eva and Neil continued bickering, Lily and the Doc explained the protagonist Johnny’s current condition.

Johnny was bedridden, in a long-term coma, with only vital signs indicating he was still alive.

According to the doctor, he had only two or three days left.

His final wish before passing? To go to the Moon.

But why did he want to go to the Moon? Lily, the caretaker, admitted she didn’t know. Although Johnny was her employer, he rarely spoke to anyone—making him seem quite peculiar.

"Damn, this old man’s got big dreams! Wants to go to the Moon? So the main goal of this game is to figure out *why* he wants to go, then help him fulfill his wish?"

"A Puzzle Solving game? What the heck, now we’re talking! A game for brains—I’m good at this!"

Based on the information collected so far, Dong Zhen slapped his thigh in excitement.

After talking to caretaker Lily, he obtained a clue: they needed certain key items from Johnny’s life to enter his memories and alter them to fulfill his wish.

Since a person’s memories span a lifetime, machines alone couldn’t access everything—hence the need for physical mediums.

He let the female doctor handle the machine while he controlled the male doctor, wandering around the house.

"Man, this old guy’s loaded! Huge house!"

"But honestly, this old man’s lucky he got *me*. Want to go to the Moon? If you wanted to go to Mars, I’d get you there too!"

As he spoke, Dong Zhen guided the male doctor around, talking to the two kids downstairs, hoping they’d give him a tour of the house and maybe reveal some clues. But the troublemaking players/griefers demanded he first fetch a candy cane staff for them.

"Man, how annoying are these kids? Whatever, adults don’t stoop to kids’ levels."

Entering the kitchen, the doctor spotted the candy cane staff on a shelf—but being too short, he couldn’t reach it. He had to drag over a nearby stool and stand on it to grab the staff.

"Don’t say that! I’m not the one who can’t reach it—it’s the in-game doctor, not me!"

"I’m a 1.92-meter giant! You think I can’t reach a shelf? Come on!"

Dong Zhen twitched at the bullet comments in the live stream room, but he couldn’t let up.

"I’m 1.92 meters tall—the kind who can jump and dunk!"

After delivering the candy cane staff to the troublemaking players/griefers, he received some clues in return.

When Johnny was still mobile, he frequently visited the catacomb. Also, the piano piece the kids were playing was one Johnny used to play when he was healthy.

Following the kids’ hints, Dong Zhen headed down to the catacomb, entering a small room.

Pitch black, with only a desk lamp nearby.

But the moment Dong Zhen pulled the switch, the Soundtrack changed instantly.

Eerie. Sinister. Unease.

Combined with the dim yellow light, and the fact that the entire room was filled with colorful paper bunnies...

"What the heck?! Why did it suddenly turn into a ghost story?!"

No warning at all—the sudden shift in atmosphere gave Dong Zhen goosebumps.

The room wasn’t particularly large—seemed like a storage warehouse.

Handmade paper rabbits were piled on the floor. On the table near the door sat a platypus plushie.

Not exactly terrifying.

But it *was* psychologically unsettling!

The bullet comments in the live stream room began flooding in.

‘The atmosphere suddenly turned grim!’

‘Is this a horror game now?!’

‘Guys, spam more comments—I’m scared!’

‘Why are you all so scared? It’s broad daylight—what’s there to fear?!’

Glancing at the overly dramatic bullet comments, Dong Zhen adjusted his Mindset and began searching the room.

The platypus plushie could be taken—seemed like a key item.

As for the game, despite the grim atmosphere...

He’d already checked earlier—there was no horror game tag.

Only labeled as Adventure and story.

No panic. No panic. Even if it *was* a horror game, so what?

He was a 1.92-meter giant—the kind who could jump and dunk. Could a mere game scare *him*?

"Alright, look at you all, so scared!"

"No more talk. Let’s keep going and see what the hell this game’s really about. Why does the old man want to go to the Moon? What’s the secret behind these paper bunnies? We’ll uncover it all—just wait and see."

Dong Zhen exchanged a few words with the live stream room’s bullet comments and continued progressing through the story.
