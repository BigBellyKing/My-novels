Chapter 340: Shepherd! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

"What the heck is this broken computer, this broken hard drive! Why is it copying so slowly? Is the technology in this fictional world that bad? Why is it taking so long? You ambitious schemers, always trying to overthrow world governments, can't you put a decent solid-state drive in your computers?"

Zhang Yi watched the flickering progress bar, practically dying of anxiety. The enemy's firepower was simply too fierce. If he hadn't switched from "Normal" to "Recruit" difficulty again, he probably would have seen the famous "YOU DIED" quote already. And that storage progress bar on the computer was driving him crazy. An old lady crossing the street would be faster than this!

Ghost blocked the main entrance, preventing enemies from stepping even half a pace into the safe house, while Roach guarded the window, eliminating any possibility of the enemy flanking them. Inside, Roach and Ghost worked together skillfully; after all, this wasn't their first time fighting side-by-side. The previous slums had already allowed them to develop sufficient tacit understanding. Ghost was also a highly tactically proficient soldier, his status within Task Force 141 second only to Captain Price and Soap.

The defense was incredibly difficult, but then Ghost's voice invigorated Zhang Yi.

"Roach, transmission complete!"

"I'll hold the front door, you go get the DSM hard drive! We need to retreat, quickly!" Ghost's voice rang out in the headphones.

Just then, General Shepherd's communication also connected.

"I'm almost at the extraction point, what's your status?"

"We're preparing to evacuate, get ready to receive us!" Ghost replied, then, with Roach holding the DSM hard drive, they fought their way out of the safe house.

Although they were NPCs, they still maintained the experience from the previous Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, which was that of a very reliable Big Bro. Always so trustworthy, you could completely entrust your back to Ghost without reservation, and he would never disappoint you. "Good Big Bro, after this fight, I'll buy you a drink!" Zhang Yi shouted with a strong sense of immersion, looking at Ghost beside him, his heart feeling warm. He had never encountered such an NPC teammate in all his gaming experience. After all, all he'd ever met were pig teammates, including Old Song! Though, from their perspective, others might have thought the same about him.

During the operation, Lingdian and Scarecrow had already fallen, but under the cover of Toad and Sharpshooter, they still had a certain firepower advantage. Roach and Ghost, like brothers, looked out for each other, fighting and retreating. Along the way, other teammates also fell, but even with the will to support, they were powerless to turn the tide, as the distance was too great. Moreover, they themselves were like clay Buddhas crossing a river, barely able to save themselves.

After passing through the dense forest, they reached an open clearing, when suddenly, artillery fire rained down. Huge explosions erupted around them, the shells falling like dumplings. Suddenly, a precise shell exploded next to Roach, and Zhang Yi's screen abruptly shook, then was immediately covered in red. "Damn it! Roach!" Zhang Yi cried out, a wave of worry rising in his heart. From the first-person perspective, he could clearly feel Roach being blown away. The screen turned blood-red, everything in front of him was blurry, and all he could hear were explosions and Roach's gasping.

Just then, a pair of hands wearing tactical gloves grabbed him. In his blurry vision, a face wearing headphones and a skull mask appeared before him. "Roach! I've got your back! Hold on!" Yes, it was Ghost! Even in such an environment, Ghost hadn't abandoned Roach. Just like Griggs had supported Soap on the bridge back then.

Ghost dragged Roach while firing and shouting through his tactical headset.

'T21! I've thrown a red smoke grenade into the woods! That's the target, prepare to engage!'

'T21! Engage!'

'Roach, hold on!'

His vision cleared slightly, and Zhang Yi vaguely saw enemies swarming everywhere, with some also appearing behind Ghost. Grabbing his gun, Zhang Yi immediately aimed and began to spray fire. Countless bullets whizzed past them like meteors, hitting the soil and sending dirt flying. Ghost, beside him, held Roach tightly, walking and firing.

'Roach, hold on!'

'We're almost there!'

'Just a little longer!'

At this moment, Roach said nothing, only gripping his weapon and continuously firing at the enemies behind them. Finally, two attack helicopters arrived and began strafing the enemies behind them. Under such firepower, the enemies finally began to retreat. "We're safe!" Zhang Yi breathed a sigh of relief, looking at the Golden Eagle fighter jets before him. Just then, the pilot issued an order: "Search for snipers with thermal imaging, over!"

The attack helicopter's door opened, and Shepherd, seated inside, stepped out. Looking at the two injured men, Shepherd asked, "Did you get the intel?" Without thinking, Ghost nodded in response, "Yes, sir!" "Good! The mission is complete." With that, he pressed the revolver in his hand against Roach's chest and fired. 'Bang!' In an instant, completely unexpected, it happened too fast. All sounds seemed to vanish at that moment. Roach looked at the officer in front of him with an incredulous expression, his body uncontrollably collapsing.

Ghost, standing nearby, was also stunned by the shock. He instinctively raised his gun, preparing to fire, but Shepherd was already prepared. He swiftly turned the revolver in his hand and fired another shot at Ghost. 'Bang!' The bullet pierced Ghost's heart, drawing a streak of blood. Shepherd stepped forward and picked up the hard drive from Roach's hand. With his last breath, Roach looked at Shepherd in disbelief, slowly raising his hand as if to question him, but no words came out. Shepherd merely gave the fallen Roach a cold glance and turned to leave, while nearby Shadow Company members responded to an order. 'Snipers eliminated.' At this moment, Roach finally understood that the "snipers eliminated" referred not to the enemies, but to Toad and Sharpshooter!

Then, two of Shepherd's subordinates came forward, lifted Roach and Ghost, and threw them into a dirt pit. They had once traversed slums, broken out of the Gulag, and fought side-by-side in safe houses. Throughout their journey, they were brothers who could entrust their lives to each other. No matter how great the difficulties or dangers, they had overcome them all. It seemed there was nothing they couldn't accomplish. Just as Captain Price had said: Nothing could stop Task Force 141. They were the world's most elite soldiers, yet they didn't die on the battlefield; instead, they died at the hands of General Shepherd, whom they had always trusted.

As gasoline was poured over their bodies, Captain Price's voice echoed in the tactical headset—a belated warning.

'Ghost! Ghost, respond to me!'

'We've been attacked by Shepherd's men at the Afghan Scrapyard, it's a trap! Don't trust Shepherd! Soap, get down!'

'Ghost! Roach! I repeat, do not trust Shepherd!'

Captain Price's voice gradually faded. The scene before them also blurred.

Looking at the two men doused in gasoline on the ground, Shepherd took a deep drag from his cigar, thick smoke dissipating into the air. Then, with a flick, just as Captain Price and Soap had flicked their cigars away, this cigar landed on Ghost and Roach. Instantly, roaring flames engulfed the two men. Ghost: Simon Riley. Roach: Gary Sanderson. Curtain call.

Outside the game, Zhang Yi was absolutely furious at this moment. Finally unable to hold back, he roared. "Shepherd! You son of a bitch!"
