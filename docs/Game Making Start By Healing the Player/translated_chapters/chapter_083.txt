Chapter 83: Players at the Exhibition

At the entrances of various exhibition areas, many players were discussing.

“NetDragon and TengHua are making big moves this year!”

“Holy crap, they just launched a VR blockbuster during the New Year, and now there's a new title?”

“Don't get your hopes too high, it's probably a demo, isn't it always like this every year?”

“That's still exciting! I'm off to queue up!”

“Exactly, exactly, I really need to experience it, after all, it's NetDragon and TengHua's latest VR blockbuster.”

“But there are too many people, aren't there?”

“More people will just join the queue later.”

“Forget it, I'll go check out other exhibition areas instead.”

Many players' first choice, without a doubt, was the exhibition area where TengHua and NetDragon were located.

And everyone's goal was very clear: to see the latest VR blockbusters brought by NetDragon and TengHua this time.

They were simply too eye-catching.

Of course, quite a few players were deterred by the sight of the long queue.

After all, it was simply too long.

Of course, even without queuing up, and thus no way to experience the game content, there were still other things to see.

Namely, the showgirls' long legs in each exhibition area.

“Wow! Those legs are so big... no, so long!”

“These are legs to play with for years!”

“You people are too fickle, always preferring the new over the old. I'm different, I can play with them for two years.”

“So everyone here is an old lecherous man!”

“Don't talk nonsense, we're not lecherous, we're just good at appreciating the beautiful things in the world!”

“Exactly!”

Of course, not all players' gazes were fixated on long legs.

There were still some exceptions.

“Stop staring, your eyeballs are practically popping out.” Rolling her eyes, Wang Han said grumpily to Zhang Yi beside her.

“Ahem, don't talk nonsense, I wasn't looking. I'm not interested in those.” Zhang Yi said, slightly embarrassed, then immediately changed the subject: “By the way, which exhibition area should we visit now, the NetDragon one?”

“Sure, I'm quite interested in their new game.” A very robust young man nodded. This was Song Ren, who had been scared witless while playing *Outlast* before.

Accompanying him were another young man and a girl. All of them were friends in real life.

This time, they had also planned to come to the gameplay Expo together.

“I think we should forget it. There are too many people! Queuing for two or three hours just to experience a few minutes, the VR gaming pod won't even warm up.” Wang Han said.

To be honest, she was also very interested in NetDragon and TengHua's VR blockbusters.

But after seeing the long queue, she gave up on that idea.

“Oh, right, Nebula Games seems to be participating in this exhibition too. Let's go check out their exhibition area, maybe they have something new!” Wang Han suddenly remembered something.

She had a very good impression of this game developer.

*To the Moon*, *Undertale*, and *Overcooked* — she loved them all.

“Right! Let's go see the Nebula Games exhibition area. I wonder if they'll have any new games this time.” Another female voice, named Joey, agreed.

“I have no objection.” Another young man named Wang Yifan shrugged.

However, Zhang Yi and Song Ren, standing nearby, widened their eyes after hearing this.

To this day, he still couldn't forget how he ended up washing dishes every day at home.

Similarly, Song Ren couldn't forget how he almost peed himself from fright while playing *Outlast*.

But in the end, they decided to first check out Nebula Games' exhibition area, as the long queues at NetDragon and TengHua's areas looked truly intimidating.

And players heading to the Nebula Games exhibition area, like Zhang Yi and his friends, were actually not few in number.

After all, a string of high-quality games had given Chen Xu and Nebula Games considerable renown within the independent game community and among specific player groups.

Thus, quite a few players came specifically for Nebula Games and Chen Xu.

Similarly, some gaming media from the industry and streamers attending the exhibition were also heading towards the second- and third-tier companies, as well as some well-known independent games.

Why?

There's no need to mention NetDragon and TengHua; they are naturally the subjects mainstream media are keen to report on.

But if too many reports come out, how can you compete with those media outlets for traffic?

It's better to choose game developers that have some recognition but face less intense mainstream competition.

Nebula Games, of course, was one of them.

However, when players arrived at the Nebula Games exhibition area, many were a little bewildered.

The art style was completely different!

Looking at other exhibition areas, even independent game ones.

There were plenty of showy girls and dazzling long legs, not a single one missing.

In contrast, Nebula Games was a breath of fresh air!

There were definitely girls, but only three or four of them. Most of the people were wearing mascot costumes.

On a designated display stage, they were pulling, tugging, and jumping around, looking very comical.

“What's going on?! Why are Nebula Games' showgirls like this?!”

“Friend, these aren't showgirls, if you look, there are only three female cosplayers besides the staff.”

“Haha, but seriously, it's actually quite fun.”

“Looking at the exhibition area's signs, these are Chen Xu's new games!”

“*Sanguosha*, *Fall Guys*... I've never heard of them before. Is this Chen Xu's big move specifically prepared for this exhibition?”

Players who came to the Nebula Games exhibition area all had expressions of novelty.

They began to discuss animatedly.

After all, compared to other exhibition areas, this was simply too peculiar.

“Honestly, those colorful toy figures really do look a bit like jelly beans, super comical.”

“Exactly, at least in terms of presentation, Nebula Games is truly unique!”

“But speaking of Nebula Games bringing new games this time, why are there so few devices prepared?”

“Yeah, *Fall Guys* takes up such a large space, but there are only fifteen computers?”

“And for *Sanguosha*, there are only five computers, besides that, what's with all the chairs and tables?”

“Is this Nebula Games and Chen Xu's first time participating, lacking experience?”

“That shouldn't be the case, they've been preparing for so many days in advance.”

Players gathered in the Nebula Games exhibition area began to whisper among themselves.

What puzzled the players was why there were so few trial devices in the Nebula Games exhibition area.

But next, their questions were answered.

The Nebula Games exhibition area was divided into three sections, with a stage left vacant in the center.

The center of the stage was filled with showgirls dressed as Fall Guys characters, though their genders couldn't be distinguished in the mascot costumes.

Soon, the Fall Guys characters on stage bounced apart, and Chen Xu stepped onto the stage, acting as the presenter for the Nebula Games exhibition area.

With Chen Xu's appearance, it was clear that some fans of Nebula Games, who had also learned about Chen Xu, immediately recognized him. They waved and shouted loudly.

However, the content of their shouts was irresistibly funny.

“Chen Xu, give me back my girlfriend!”

“Exactly, Chen Xu, give me back my girlfriend!”

“What happened to the 'Warrior of Love' you promised?!”

Seeing the 'excited and agitated' players, Chen Xu couldn't help but feel a little dumbfounded.

Chen Xu motioned for everyone to quiet down: “Everyone, please settle down. You all seem very enthusiastic!”

“However, there are a few misunderstandings about me.”

“Of course, that's fine, because the games brought to this exhibition will wash away your prejudices against me. It's time for me to prove myself again!”

“Without further ado, *Fall Guys* is a lighthearted, joyful, harmonious, and loving multiplayer variety show obstacle course game that will make players immensely happy. *Sanguosha* is a multiplayer strategy card game.”

On the large screen behind him, promotional art for *Fall Guys* and *Sanguosha* appeared.

As Chen Xu introduced the games, the initially quiet players, hearing him mention 'lighthearted, joyful, harmonious, and loving'...

...instantly burst into a joyous chorus of laughter.

Because this description sounded eerily familiar!

However, before they could react further, Chen Xu's next words filled them with surprise and excitement.

“I believe everyone has noticed that our on-site trial equipment is very limited. As for the reason...”

“...you can scan the corresponding QR code to directly download the mobile versions and experience the fun of both games in advance during the exhibition.”

“Additionally, on the last day of the exhibition, we will have a grand finale program for everyone.”

(Daily request for recommendation tickets, monthly passes – *Clang, clang, clang!* Lastly, when it comes to complaints, leave it to me! [You're too short!] [This excitement lasts all day] [I saw it but felt like I didn't~])
