Chapter 173: Next Time for Sure! (8th Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)

Chapter 173: Next Time for Sure! (8th Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)

The gameplay Expo lasted four days, just like last year.

Unlike last year, which felt like a battle of titans, with TengHua and NetDragon both unveiling their latest VR blockbusters, this year’s gameplay Expo had only one highly anticipated blockbuster announcement that players truly looked forward to: news about *Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame*.

But that wasn’t the most talked-about topic.

What shocked many game developers and gaming media was that this year’s Expo bore a slight resemblance to last year’s.

Last year, TengHua and NetDragon’s two VR blockbusters should have been the coolest kids at the exhibition.

Yet, they were completely overshadowed by Nebula Games’ *Fall Guys* and *Sanguosha*.

This year, everyone had already assumed that Nebula Games’ announcement of the new *Dark Souls* title would be the star of the first day.

But no one expected that Nebula Games only brought a promotional trailer for *Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame*.

The real game that captured all players’ attention at the exhibition was a primitive Big Hammer Game.

Although playing it yourself sent your blood pressure skyrocketing, watching someone else play it was an entirely different experience.

Especially on the day of the exhibition, the game was launched directly onto the Nebula Games Platform.

In just a few short days, thanks to its performance at the exhibition and some media coverage, this unadvertised, free game instantly became the core attraction on major live streaming platforms and video platforms.

It wasn’t that this game had as many players as *Fall Guys* did back then.

It was simply that the game’s popularity exploded.

On live streaming platforms, by the second day of the exhibition, the crude mini-game called *Hammer Swing Ascension* went viral overnight.

Initially, it was mainly fans of streamers spamming chat, urging their favorite streamers to download and play it.

This piqued the curiosity of many streamers.

Then, they instantly understood exactly what their viewers had in mind.

And once several streamers began playing a game on a live platform, naturally more and more streamers joined in.

In no time, the entire live streaming platform was filled with streamers wailing and screaming in agony.

Opening any live stream currently playing the game revealed a panorama of human emotion.

"Friends in the audience, everyone says this Big Hammer Game is difficult, but today I’m going to tell you—there’s nothing impossible in this world if you have the will. As long as we persevere, we will eventually achieve something."

"What? You say I can’t clear it?"

"Impossible! Don’t worry, I’ll definitely clear it."

In one live stream room, a streamer was speaking very seriously.

"What’s most important when playing with a hammer? It’s mastering the right amount of force. As the saying goes, *big hammer eighty, small hammer forty*—this doesn’t just refer to the hammer itself, but also to the force applied when swinging it."

"So you can’t rush this game. See? Isn’t climbing up the hill smooth and easy?"

"Not a bit of rushing. The entire purpose of this game is to break the player’s mindset. Once your mindset collapses, you’ll definitely fail to clear it."

"So we must maintain a good mindset."

"Friends in the audience, watch this operation carefully. Don’t rush. Hook and pull hard! Ahhhhhhhhh!!!"

"It’s okay… It’s okay. Don’t rush. Keep your mindset stable. You must always play with a smile."

"Mistakes once or twice are completely normal. We can just climb again, right?"

"Remember my words—your mindset must be good when playing games. Always play with a smile."

"Hehe, hooked! Go… Ahhhhhhhhhhh! I’m f***ing done!!!"

Accompanied by a cry of powerless rage came the sound of fists pounding the table like someone smashing a cucumber.

Besides streamers who insisted on seeking punishment, the game also attracted many ordinary players to download and try it.

After all, seeing streamers on every major platform playing it sparked curiosity in many players.

And games like this one seemed incredibly simple at first glance. How hard could it possibly be with just one hand?

It’s just a Big Hammer Game, right?

Let me give it a try!

 
 This was the prevailing thought among most players—that they were surely better than the streamers. Many assumed the streamers were deliberately acting stupid for entertainment effect, and that the game wasn’t actually that difficult.

Plus, since the game was free, there was no risk at all. At worst, it was just another addition to their collection—no need to refund anything.

So even though they knew it might be a game that tests one’s patience, a steady stream of players still poured in.

However, after these players downloaded the game onto their computers,

and experienced it for about ten to twenty minutes, accompanied by the perfectly fitting BGM,

nearly 90% of them left only one sentence: "F*** this geoduck! Get off my computer!"

Then they angrily uninstalled the game.

Many players gave the lowest possible ratings and negative reviews.

The review content was extremely simple.

Phrases like "I'm a fool!" and endless strings of "**********" vividly expressed the raw emotions players felt when writing them.

Of course, some players deliberately left five-star positive reviews, hoping to lure even more people in.

"This game is so fun! I’ve been screaming while playing, and now my blood pressure is low and my mood is calm. But I have one request for everyone: I’m deeply grateful to Chen Xu. This game brought back the joy of my childhood, so I’d like to ask—where does Chen Xu live? I’d like to personally visit and thank him!"

"A very simple and fun game that brought me great joy. I truly hope more people can experience this happiness."

"Extremely effective! My son loved gaming and hated studying, so I downloaded *Hammer Swing Ascension* for him and told him he’d have to solve one problem every time he fell. Now he’s been accepted into Tsinghua and Peking University!"

"Thank you, Chen Xu. I’ve always wanted to replace my mouse but couldn’t bring myself to do it. Now, thanks to this game, I’ve finally succeeded in getting a new one! No more words—my old mouse must be buried with honor."

Chen Xu in the Nebula Games office couldn’t help but laugh out loud reading these hilarious comments.

Although it was released for free and didn’t count toward the platform’s points system,

it didn’t really matter. Games of this type, even if free, rarely attract many players anyway—let alone if they were monetized as buy-to-play titles.

For Chen Xu, his goal had already been achieved—players had felt the fun this game brought.

And it wasn’t without benefits. At the very least, the game’s popularity had driven a massive wave of traffic to the Nebula Games Platform.

Though the misunderstanding players had about him was growing deeper and deeper!

Seeing online how players had once again dug up the interview Game Timespace had done with Chen Xu after *It Takes Two* launched, Chen Xu sighed with emotion.

In the article, certain keywords were highlighted: *warm-hearted*, *nurturing love for players*.

Then, silently, players attached screenshots of *Silent Hill PT* and *Hammer Swing Ascension*.

Countless players left comments in the section, grumbling: Is this your love for players, Chen Xu?

Reading the endless online grumbling and discussions, Chen Xu sighed deeply.

Then, quietly opening his official Weibo account, he posted a long message:

"Actually, *Hammer Swing Ascension* isn’t just a game designed to shatter your mindset.

Yes, its design is excessively malicious, but it’s not impossible to clear. True, some players experienced mindset collapse and quit the game mid-way, but there are others who, after enduring suffering and shedding tears, once again swung their hammer and started over again.

Think about it—doesn’t this mirror life itself? Each time you swing the hammer, it’s like making a decision in life. There’s no undo, only lessons learned, and we can only keep moving forward along an unknown path.

Along the way, we may face failure, endure setbacks, or even have all previous efforts wasted.

But just like in the game, we have no saves. Even if we fall from a great height and are battered and bruised, all we can do is dust ourselves off and start climbing again.

Isn’t the character in the game just a reflection of ourselves in the real world?

So now, are you willing to try once more? To overcome those difficulties, whether in reality or in games?"

After Chen Xu posted this official Weibo, countless players were stunned.

So this game actually had deep philosophical meaning?

Although it sounded reasonable, countless players declared they’d fallen for Chen Xu’s trickery!

Especially that last sentence—*Are you willing to try?*

Did that even need an answer?

Countless players, staring at Chen Xu’s post, silently typed four words into the comment section:

"Next time for sure!"

Alright, finished for today. See you tomorrow.
