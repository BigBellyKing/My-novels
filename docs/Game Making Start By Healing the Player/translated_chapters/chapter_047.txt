Chapter 47: Hot Discussion Among Players and the Industry

In the early hours of October 31st, Chen Xu, on schedule, uploaded a pre-recorded video to his official Weibo account.

At the same time, he posted a message: Guess what the new game is?

Although it was the early hours of the morning, it must be said that at this time, there were still quite a few night owls among the players following Chen Xu's official Weibo account.

As soon as this message was posted, it quickly caught the attention of some players.

'What's happening? Look what I found? Chen Xu has a new game?'

'Damn, releasing news in the early hours, isn't that a bit... much?'

'Oh my god, what kind of video is this! Posting it late at night, I thought it was something good!'

'Wait, what the heck is this video! A horror game?'

'Damn, this DV art style is too grim!'

'So the next game, Chen Xu is making a horror game?'

'I don't really care about horror games, but the key is the timing, isn't this too grim!?'

'So the next game is related to DV?'

Many players were taken aback.

After all, Chen Xu's intention was quite obvious; this extremely grim video was clearly telling players that the next new work would be a horror game.

What players discussed even more was the timing of the announcement.

The next day, Chen Xu's Weibo post triggered numerous media reposts and reports.

After all, Chen Xu still had a bit of buzz left from winning the first prize in the Sci-Fi Game Design Competition with "To the Moon".

Furthermore, November was approaching, and there were no major blockbusters worth mentioning on the market yet.

As for Chen Xu's video, players discussed it animatedly, analyzing what theme his new game might have.

After all, even horror games have thematic classifications.

'There's a DV and it seems to be an indoor office, so it should be a modern setting.'

'Someone holding a DV is filming something, but the entire video is eerily silent, and considering the room in the video is very chaotic, we can boldly guess: Do ghosts only become visible through a DV?'

'Holding a DV, walking through dark corridors and rooms, and as they walk, a ghastly face appears on the DV screen, then pulls the filmer into a dark abyss!'

'MMP, a bunch of drama queens, there's nothing there, can we stop with the wild guesses? It's broad daylight and I'm getting chills!'

'You're too timid, giving up already? I advise you to wear a diaper when you play or watch it.'

'It's really too grim. I stumbled upon it past midnight yesterday, it didn't reveal anything, but I scared myself into thinking there was someone under the bed, and it kept me on edge for half the night.'

Players on the internet discussed animatedly, but it was mostly wild speculation, as Chen Xu's video only hinted to players that the next work would be a horror game.

However, the specific type had not yet been revealed.

Likewise, it wasn't just players; it also sparked heated discussions among game designers and media in the industry.

'Did you hear? Chen Xu's new work is actually a horror game!'

'It's a bit unexpected, I didn't think Chen Xu would choose horror games as his entry point.'

'But it's not too surprising. For small teams and independent game designers, horror games can be a relatively good point of entry.'

'Small team? Chen Xu isn't a small team. Haven't you seen the introduction to Nebula Games? Chen Xu's team isn't exactly small anymore.'

'It's normal, after all, "Undertale" and "To the Moon" both sold quite well.'

'But horror games are still quite niche. Let alone domestically, even internationally, there don't seem to be many outstanding horror games, right?'

'Yeah, although VR seems to fit horror games well, market and cost are still big issues.'

'I think Chen Xu's horror game might be like "hanging a sheep's head and selling dog meat" (a Chinese idiom meaning to sell something under false pretenses).'

'How so?'

'Look at "To the Moon" and "Undertale"; it's clear Chen Xu is a designer who is good at storytelling. So, is it possible that this so-called horror game is merely cloaked in a horror facade to tell a heartwarming story?'

'When you put it that way, it doesn't seem impossible. After all, didn't Chen Xu say he was a Warrior of Love before?'

'That makes sense!'

Game designers in the industry discussed Chen Xu and news of his new work.

However, for various gaming self-media outlets chasing traffic, it was a bit of a chaotic spectacle.

"Strange Video Released Late at Night, What Is Chen Xu's Intention?"

"From Heartwarming to Horrifying? Designer Chen Xu Switches to Horror Games!"

"Abandoning a Familiar Field, Trying Niche Horror Games, Confidence or Blindness?"

......

Reports flooded various websites and forums.

Some larger media websites were still able to maintain a degree of neutrality.

But for some marketing accounts and second- and third-tier small gaming media, it was all about setting the narrative.

This was mainly due to the type of game Chen Xu chose.

After all, the industry hadn't seen an excellent horror game in many years.

While the entire horror game industry wasn't quite a stagnant pool, it certainly lacked vitality.

Some horror games that sold reasonably well on the market were mostly IP series, and their annual sales were continuously declining.

The types of horror games were also incredibly diverse.

Domestic zombie and female ghost themes.

Foreign serial killer and demon themes.

Realistic, surreal.

It could be said there were all sorts of types.

But none of them sold particularly well.

This was mainly because these horror games hadn't broken out of a certain mold.

They still relied on a tight mode of jump scares, gunfights, and linear storytelling.

It wasn't that this mode was bad, but it was truly difficult to make it outstanding.

In his previous life, among the many games combining gunfights and horror, how many were truly memorable?

Essentially, only "Resident Evil" and "Dead Space" stood out. Of these two IPs, only the former could still be considered a top-tier IP, while the latter essentially died out until many years later, when EA ran out of old rice to fry and decided to bring it back to stir-fry again.

However, for Chen Xu and the entire Nebula Games team, these online discussions didn't have much impact.

Because the game's development progress was visibly increasing.

Although the game wasn't yet complete, some of its early content was already playable.

After experiencing it, Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue, along with others in the team, all had but one thought.

That was... "Damn it, this absolutely cannot be played at night!"

There was no helping it; it was simply too terrifying.

Even though everyone was involved in the game's development, and every aspect was created through their collective efforts.

That didn't mean they weren't scared!
