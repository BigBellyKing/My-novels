### Chapter 242: The Difficulty is Just Right, Perfectly Balanced! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)

Time passed day by day. During this period, numerous games launched their promotional campaigns.

Even the Channel Alliance began promoting certain games.

However, this had little impact on Nebula Games.

After all, Chen Xu had just recently announced a wealth of information about *Monster Hunter: World*.

At this stage, both the so-called Channel Alliance and Nebula Games clearly understood this was a war of attrition.

Victory wouldn’t be decided quickly. It all came down to releasing game after game, steadily increasing players’ attention, spending, and loyalty toward their respective platforms.

While online communities buzzed with discussions about the latest popular games,

Inside the Nebula Games office,

Chen Xu was finalizing future content plans for *Monster Hunter: World* with Qin Yi and the team.

Game development was progressing smoothly. Thanks to prior experience developing *Dark Souls*, many challenges were no longer difficult.

Moreover, compared to before, Nebula Games Platform’s transformation had allowed the team size to grow further.

Now, employees joining Chen Xu’s team were almost exclusively industry elites.

Under Chen Xu’s leadership, the game development speed had naturally become vastly different from the past.

The game’s overall framework was essentially complete. A massive amount of art assets had already been reviewed and approved.

What remained were primarily weapon-specific actions, boss feedback mechanics, numerical balancing, and fine-tuning details.

"The appearance of third-party creatures shouldn’t be too frequent. It’s one of the game’s selling points, but not the core aspect."

Sitting at his desk, Chen Xu observed the scene on-screen.

In the middle of battling Diablos, he was suddenly interrupted by a Barroth barging in.

Although the Barroth was instantly crushed—had Diablos been carnivorous, not even bones would’ve remained—

In ten test runs, Barroth had appeared five times. That’s a fifty percent chance.

Such a high probability was simply too much.

The game world was a continuous open-world environment. Zones were separated by narrow tunnels, rushing rivers, and steep cliffs, forming distinct regions. Meanwhile, the entire ecosystem would behave dynamically.

But too high a probability wasn’t desirable.

"Appearing occasionally can surprise players, but appearing constantly turns surprise into annoyance. Reduce the chance significantly. You can reference the Murlocs vs. pigs battle easter egg in *Don't Starve* as a reference," Chen Xu explained to the nearby employees, pointing out certain shortcomings in the game.

"Hmm… Bazelgeuse is an exception, though. Given its ecological behavior of roaming across the New World in search of prey, its appearances should naturally be more frequent," Chen Xu added.

"Then Mr. Chen, should we adjust the difficulty later on?" Qin Yi asked tentatively.

Having worked on monster action design, they were well aware of the game’s difficulty.

On the surface, the game seemed simple, but in reality, it was extremely hardcore.

Especially when players first encountered monsters like Diablos.

Frequent Dragon Charges, tough scales, massive damage, and various roars that could stun you—

It was incredibly frustrating.

Not to mention the weapons, which looked flashy and cool,

But mastering them required serious practice.

If you jumped in with zero experience, you’d likely end up with Great Sword’s Level 3 Charged Slash swinging at air, Charge Blade’s Super Amped Element Discharge hacking the ground, Long Sword’s Foresight Slash never landing its 'ding,' and Hammer users just foot-trimming.

Actually, new players probably wouldn’t even execute a Super Amped Element Discharge—they’d just swing wildly at random.

As a result, Hunters’ daily routine would often devolve into being carted three times in a row back to camp.

"Adjust what? The difficulty is perfectly balanced—just right! Look how easily you can deal with Great Jagras, and Kulu-Ya-Ku is a walk in the park. Compared to *Dark Souls*, this is far more humane, gradually progressing from easy to Hardened. Isn’t that completely normal?" Chen Xu said with a cheerful grin.

Hearing Chen Xu’s words, Qin Yi was momentarily speechless.

Chen Xu couldn’t help but chuckle.

In reality, the difficulty of *Monster Hunter: World* had indeed been significantly reduced.

The original *Monster Hunter* series was notoriously difficult.

But *Monster Hunter: World* struck just the right balance.

By following the main quest and occasionally grinding gear, players could generally only achieve one-shot kills by the time they reached Nergigante.

Throughout the journey, healing items, armor, traps, and Palicos provided ample support, greatly reducing the difficulty.

There were even many cheese strategies available in the game.

Of course, these required players to have a basic understanding of *Monster Hunter: World*’s systems.

Without that understanding…

Great Sword’s charge attacks were the romance of men. Charge Blade’s Super Amped Element Discharge was pure damage output. Long Sword was cool, Palicos were cute—what else mattered?

"If all else fails, isn’t there the Team Up system? Players can just team up and fight monsters together," Chen Xu said with a smile.

Seeing Chen Xu’s cheerful expression, Qin Yi and the others nearby were utterly speechless.

Seriously, they believed him!

Team up to fight monsters!?

As a cooperative hunting game, *Monster Hunter: World* could certainly showcase a unique charm.

In most games, teaming up drastically reduced difficulty.

But *Monster Hunter: World* was different. For rookie players, multiplayer hunts actually increased the difficulty!

Although there was no friendly fire, attacking teammates still caused flinch/stun.

During a Dragon Charge, the Dual Blades-wielding teammate beside you suddenly unleashes Demon Dance.

Stunned, you watch helplessly as the Dragon Charge turns into a carting.

You’re executing a Rising Slash with your Long Sword to sever a tail, already picturing the Elder Dragon writhing in pain—

Then, out of nowhere, a Level 3 Charged Hammer strike smacks you in the face.

The most dangerous part of cooperative hunting isn’t the boss—it’s the teammate standing next to you.

Dual Blades foot-trimming and back-scrubbing, all white damage numbers, spinning and jumping straight into a cart.

Protect the Elder Dragon in front of you. Attack the teammate beside you.

That’s the daily reality of Hunters teaming up!

………………

Time continued to pass.

One after another, many games began their warm-up promotions.

In the industry, numerous designers discussed the current wave of gaming hype.

"Have you guys been following the recent few games? They seem to be gaining a lot of popularity."

"Of course. NetDragon, TengHua, and even the Channel Alliance haven’t said much, but it’s obvious they’re cooperating."

"Targeting Chen Xu? Planning to counter *Monster Hunter: World*?"

"Unlikely. Probably just testing. Besides, these games have decent quality, but nothing particularly unique."

"Still, *Monster Hunter: World* is a hunting game—it’s a relatively niche theme!"

"Exactly. It’s a test. If *Monster Hunter: World* underperforms, the Channel Alliance will definitely jump in. But if it succeeds, they’ll just feign death."

"Though come to think of it, Chen Xu hasn’t reacted much lately. No news about *Monster Hunter: World*—feels kind of low-key."

"Development’s been going on for a while. It’s probably nearing completion. Honestly, I really hope Chen Xu succeeds. Nebula Games Platform has truly reshaped the domestic dominance of traditional channels."

Many industry designers were chatting about this.

As for the players, they were growing increasingly impatient.

Why?

Previously, leaks about *Monster Hunter: World* popped up every few days.

But what now?

One game after another had started their promotions.

Why was Nebula Games still silent?

Could it be they only made a folder?

While players kept @-mentioning Chen Xu’s official Weibo account and flooded forum communities discussing *Monster Hunter: World*’s progress,

Finally, Chen Xu and Nebula Games’ official Weibo account dropped new news about *Monster Hunter: World*.

And they just announced something that excited many players.
