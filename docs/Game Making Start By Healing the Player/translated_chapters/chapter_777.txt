Chapter 776: Don't Unlucky Kings Deserve a Game Experience!?

As the story progressed, Zhang Yi couldn't help but sigh with emotion.

The plot itself wasn't particularly unexpected or high-energy, but the game's Storyboard and presentation effects were truly outstanding.

Even more importantly, Zhang Yi was completely stunned by the game's map design.

When he first arrived in Gormott Province, he felt this wasn't a traditional RPG at all—because the map was simply too vast.

Just the Gormott area alone felt even more expansive than typical open-world games.

And even more crucially, in *Xenoblade Chronicles*, it wasn't just the sheer size of the map. He discovered that the game also featured incredibly impressive details.

The monsters within the game would even display scenes of powerful carnivores killing weaker creatures to feed. While the various characters didn't have fully autonomous daily routines like those in true open-world games,

the side quests and dialogue exchanges still effectively showcased the game's rich culture and local customs for players.

But even more significantly, the entire map was three-dimensional.

Take the mission to rescue Nia aboard the Titan warship as an example: the massive vessel featured interconnected pathways in every direction, with numerous connecting routes.

As you progressed, you could unlock various shortcuts, allowing quick travel between distant locations.

This reminded Zhang Yi of Souls series games like *Dark Souls* and *Bloodborne*.

If there was one difference, it was that Mr. Chen in *Xenoblade Chronicles* was far too merciful.

Because in this game, you could directly teleport between different regions.

Even if you hadn't unlocked shortcuts yet, as long as you'd reached a location once, you wouldn't need to walk long distances again.

But Gormott Province was different. Many areas were vertically interconnected, and discovering hidden paths could save you a tremendous amount of time.

It was precisely these shortcuts and treasure chests that inspired Zhang Yi to consider pulling from the Core Crystal gacha.

In the game, each Blade possessed their own innate Talent skills,

divided into two categories: combat and scene. Combat Talents were self-explanatory—passive abilities used in battle—while Scene Talents were used to solve environmental puzzles and fulfill prerequisites.

For example, to open a certain treasure chest, you needed 'Fire Attribute Level 1' and 'Earth Attribute Level 1'. At the start, with only Pyra as Rex's Blade, it was impossible to open it. Only after Tora and initially Poppi α (who had Earth Attribute) joined could the chest be unlocked.

Scene Talents stacked when multiple Blades were equipped, so to solve certain environmental puzzles or reach hidden collection points, you needed a diverse roster of Blades.

Moreover, Zhang Yi noticed that with too few Blades, his damage output was practically *Dealing very low damage*.

Though Tora had already joined, he was beginning to grasp the roles of each character in the game.

While playstyles largely depended on which Blades you carried, judging from the current story progression, it was a classic tank, healer, DPS trio.

Rex served as the damage dealer, Nia as the healer, and Tora as the tank.

"Might as well pull now—there are two empty slots anyway," Zhang Yi thought, guiding Rex into the Blade Synthesis interface.

Staring at the Core Crystals in his inventory, Zhang Yi felt a strange mix of emotions.

It reminded him of the thrill of pulling for an Immortal in *DOTA*, or the joy of looting corpses in *World of Warcraft*.

"Got it!? One-shot success!?" As an exhilarating piece of Music played, the Core Crystal in Rex's hand burst into dazzling light, and Zhang Yi's heart leapt with excitement.

But the next second, his brow furrowed.

Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!

Accompanied by a cheerful melody, a dark-skinned male Blade wielding a battle axe appeared before him.

Still, Zhang Yi's furrowed brow relaxed slightly after a moment.

It was gacha. Did anyone really expect to pull an SSR right off the bat?

When you thought about it, this was actually pretty normal.

Chuckling, Zhang Yi continued tapping on the Core Crystals.

A flash of light—another dark-skinned female Blade appeared.

He pulled again.

A dark-skinned dog-like Blade, a tall dark-skinned man, a hat-wearing dark-skinned man, a hat-wearing dark-skinned woman, and finally, a hat-wearing dark-skinned dog-like Blade.

Staring at the final rare Blade pulled from his last Core Crystal, Zhang Yi fell into stunned silence.

So many black Blades—what was this supposed to imply?

Weren't they supposed to be all these cool, beautiful Blades?

Why hadn't he seen a single one!?

Was this false advertising!?

As Zhang Yi sat in silence, a voice came through the voice channel.

"Xiao Zhang, Old Song, what Blades did you guys pull from your Cores? I got KOS-MOS Re, a mecha girl Blade! She's so cool—and her damage is insane!" Wang Han's voice was brimming with excitement.

Hearing Wang Han, Zhang Yi glanced at the collection of dark-skinned male Blades in his warehouse, fell silent for a moment, then said, "I just entered that small town in Gormott Province. I've been exploring nonstop—gotta say, *Xenoblade Chronicles* is absolutely amazing! The Art and map design are just incredible!!"

As he spoke, Zhang Yi quietly clicked back to the main menu and selected 'New Game'.

Even though this was a Single-player game, and gacha was just a game mechanic—there was no such thing as a 'wasted account'—

as the saying went, some things were unbearable when compared.

He pulled nothing but dark-skinned male Blades during his first playthrough's early game, while others got SRs and SSRs. How could their player experience and enjoyment possibly be equal!?

Less than ten seconds after Zhang Yi finished speaking, Song Ren's voice came through: "Old Zhang, great minds think alike! I was also captivated by Gormott's scenery—though that gorilla at the entrance is seriously annoying."

Hearing Old Song's voice, Zhang Yi's stiff expression softened, and a small smile tugged at his lips. He realized something important: he wasn't the only one with bad luck.

"Exactly! That gorilla killed me too. Once I hit the late game, I'm gonna utterly destroy him!" Zhang Yi chimed in, then quietly sent Song Ren a text message: 'This game has way too much malice toward Unlucky Kings!'

Just one second later, Old Song's reply came—short and to the point: +1!

And Zhang Yi and Song Ren weren't alone. Many players felt the same. Although the game did have a 'Mercy' system,

it required players to open a certain number of Core Crystals before the guaranteed pull mechanism activated. And the Blades granted by the guaranteed pull followed a fixed Templates.

Powerful Blades like KOS-MOS Re and the Divine Beasts Mr. Chen had added to the pool were clearly excluded.

As a result, countless Unlucky Kings felt endless malice during early-game Core pulls.

Looking at forum communities and Tieba, seeing other players happily showcasing their SSR Blades, while their own warehouse was filled with nothing but Pyra, a crowd of dark-skinned male Blades, dark-skinned female Blades, and dark-skinned dog-like Blades—many shed tears of sorrow.

Don't Unlucky Kings deserve a game experience!?
