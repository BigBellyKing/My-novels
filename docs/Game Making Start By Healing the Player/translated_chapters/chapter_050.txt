# Chapter 50: The Eerie Mount Massive Asylum

'2333333, Big Bro's breathing seems a bit labored.'

'LOL, everyone stop, Big Bro's in trouble.'

'Horror games are as easy as breathing for me.'

'LOL, someone quickly bring Big Bro a breathing machine, he's having trouble breathing!'

'Big Bro, don't panic, if it's too hard we can just stop streaming, we understand you.'

'You guys don't get it, Big Bro is creating streaming effect!'

Even though it was a horror game, even though it had only started minutes ago,

the bullet comments in the live stream room were already lively as a festival.

Seeing the flood of comments, Sun Yixie couldn't help but feel a little embarrassed.

This game was completely different from the horror games he had imagined!

The Atmosphere, the graphics—it delivered such a strong sense of immersion, it was unreal.

It even felt no weaker than a VR game.

This was mainly due to the unique characteristic of horror games.

From a psychological perspective, when players maintain high level of concentration on a game, they achieve deep immersion.

Other games gradually draw players in through storylines and Music, among other elements.

But horror games were different.

Players knew full well they would be startled in such games, yet they never knew when or where the scare would come.

Combined with the Music and the Atmosphere of the scenes, it naturally kept players constantly on edge and attentive.

The same principle applied to FPS games.

This was also why playing such games continuously made players feel so exhausted.

Because these games demanded players' attention be fully "armored" at all times.

Looking at the game screen, then glancing at the bullet comments on the side,

Sun Yixie slowly pushed his chair backward, pulling the mouse and keyboard farther away, placing them on his knees and a small stool beside him.

He was trying to create distance, hoping it would make him feel more relaxed.

Of course, this only invited more sarcastic comments from the live stream room.

And it also made playing slightly inconvenient.

More importantly, Sun Yixie realized this change brought him no relief at all.

Instead, the increased distance created an illusion—that someone was right beside him, behind him.

After crawling through a wall gap into a ventilation duct, he glanced again at the secondary monitor's bullet comments. The discomfort of playing intensified.

Sun Yixie instinctively looked around the room, his voice rising as he tried to bolster courage.

'Damn it! What's there to be scared of, damn it!'

'Pfft! What's there to panic about!'

'Will panicking help?'

'Damn it, damn it, I still have to move forward step by step, don't I?'

'What good does panicking do?'

'I'm not scared at all!'

After crawling out of the ventilation duct, staring at the blood-stained walls around him, Sun Yixie discreetly swallowed a mouthful of saliva.

By now, he had guided the protagonist to an ajar door. Unprepared, he pushed it open.

In an instant, the game's Music turned sharp and urgent. Simultaneously, a hanging corpse behind the door suddenly swung towards the protagonist,

filling the entire game screen.

The protagonist in the game and Sun Yixie outside it let out a sharp scream together.

'AAAAAA!'

The sudden shock caused Sun Yixie to repeat his previous covering face action—this time, to bloom a second time (idiom for repeating an action or feat).

Breathing heavily, Sun Yixie clearly felt his heart pounding.

Thump-thump, strong and powerful.

All triggered by that terrifying scene.

'Damn it, damn it! If I scream, fine, but why do you scream too!' Sun Yixie muttered, hearing the protagonist's heavy breathing from the headphones, trying to shift the topic.

It might be hard to believe, but when he screamed, aside from the door jump scare, the main reason was that the game's protagonist had screamed first.

Startled, upon hearing the protagonist speak, Sun Yixie had instinctively and involuntarily echoed the scream.

His lower legs, hidden from the cameras under the table, were trembling slightly. Sun Yixie felt his back soaked with cold sweat from the fright.

One hand pressed against his chest, he slowly took two deep breaths.

Staring at the game screen, he hesitated slightly. On camera, he stood up, lowered the air conditioner's temperature a bit, then fetched a hooded down jacket from the nearby cabinet.

'Guys, it's a bit cold with the AC so low, I'm going to put on a jacket.' As he spoke, Sun Yixie put on the down jacket, pulled up the hood, and placed the headphones over it.

Seeing his actions, the audience in the live stream room simultaneously began grinding bullet comments.

'????????'

'Brother Sun is awesome. Brother Sun wears a hood because his head is cold, not because he's scared.'

'Exactly. Horror games are as easy as breathing for Brother Sun. Would he ever be scared?'

'Brother Sun, don't panic. We know you're not afraid.'

Seeing the sarcastic comments flooding in, Sun Yixie was exasperated but couldn't find a single argument to refute them.

Now fully "armored", Sun Yixie replaced a battery in the camera that had died, then continued his Search & Destroy.

Entering the room, he saw nothing but smashed and destroyed furniture. Bloodstains covered the floor and walls. Unidentified corpses lay scattered on the ground and inside cabinets, their heads completely vanished without a trace.

In night vision mode, the ghastly green画面 intensified the game's horrifying and eerie Atmosphere.

At the very least, he didn't dare to look at the dismembered limbs and corpses on the floor.

'Quick!'

Just as Sun Yixie reached the middle of the room, one of the 'corpses' suddenly spoke.

On camera, Sun Yixie shivered, his squinting eyes widened. But this time, he didn't scream.

'Damn it! People scaring people can kill!'

Following the voice, he saw a man impaled on rebar, like a skewer.

'Quick... quick... run!'

'Those people killed us... all of us... before they discover you... quick...'

'Run out... of this building...'

After speaking, the dying man fell silent. Clearly, he was just a messenger in the game—once his lines (dialogue) were delivered, there was no need for him to live.

But at this moment, Sun Yixie had no intention of uncovering the secrets of Mount Massive Asylum.

He had only one thought: run!

Because the scene and Atmosphere were too oppressive.

Everything was filled with horror and unease.

Why did he have to play this game? Why did he have to explore this asylum?

'Damn it, let me go! Let me go!'

Using the camera's night vision, Sun Yixie fled the oppressive dark room and entered a relatively well-lit corridor.

But he failed to notice, as he entered the corridor, a dark shadow flashed by inside one of the adjacent doors.
