## Chapter 22: A Double Triumph in Reputation and Sales

## Chapter 22: A Double Triumph in Reputation and Sales

As more and more players experienced Undertale, the game's data surged rapidly.

On numerous third-party game platforms, Undertale had already climbed onto featured recommendation charts.

Although Chen Xu, just like in his previous life, held a strong disdain for the channels in this Parallel World,

for the current situation, launching Undertale on these game platforms was clearly beneficial and harmless. "Money left unearned is for fools."

Even if he intended to reshape the landscape of the gaming industry, one unavoidable factor remained:

Capital.

Therefore, Chen Xu chose several third-party platforms willing to compromise.

Although Chen Xu was a newcomer in the gaming industry,

he differed from ordinary game designers.

First, Mirror (Game) guaranteed a solid baseline of sales; second, the hype from Zhong Mei had given Undertale built-in traffic.

Thus, some third-party channels were willing to lower their commission percentage.

This was also one of the reasons Chen Xu agreed to launch on these platforms.

Judging from the current results, Undertale's sales growth was truly impressive.

………………

While Chen Xu was monitoring Undertale's sales figures,

many game designers in the independent gaming community were also shaken by Undertale.

In a private group chat among independent game designers:

"Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! I can only use three 'Damn its!' to describe Undertale. Earlier, I thought Zhong Mei made sense—what good game could Chen Xu possibly make? But now, I can only say it's absolutely incredible!"

"What's going on? Is it really that exaggerated? Isn't this rating bought?"

"What are you talking about? How could it be bought? Maybe third-party sites, but try buying one on the official platform and see what happens."

"Right, stop spouting nonsense. Brought? Try grinding reviews on the official platform and show me! Want to get your designer status revoked and blacklisted?"

"I suggest those who haven't played it go try it. I was genuinely shocked—only 'unbelievable' can describe it!"

"Honestly, I was planning to release my new game next week, but now I think I'll need to polish it a bit longer."

"Is it really that good?"

"How should I put it… On the surface, it's just a Regular game, but it has several different endings. The first playthrough brings shock, the Pacifist Ending brings warmth, and the Genocide Ending left me in tears."

"I used to laugh when people said Mirror (Game) changed the Gentleman's Game scene, but I think Undertale might spark a wave of popularity for this kind of game mode!"

"Aren't you exaggerating? Are you saying it's establishing a new school of thought?"

"Establishing a new school might be too strong, but it's definitely popularizing and elevating the genre. I believe from now on, whenever this type of game is mentioned, Undertale will be an unavoidable name."

Amid the discussions, someone suddenly shared a public account article push in the group.

"Stop talking—check Chen Xu's official Weibo account!"

"Damn it! Is this even human?"

"Reputation and sales both thriving!?"

"Sales have already surpassed 100,000 in just three days? That's too exaggerated!"

Everyone clicked in and saw it was Chen Xu's official Weibo account.

A simple thank-you message, still related to Undertale.

'Thank you all for your support. Undertale's sales have surpassed 100,000, but I believe this is not the end!'

Chen Xu didn't hide these figures.

Firstly, it wasn't a big secret—within days, third-party research firms would likely announce similar data. Though not perfectly accurate, it wouldn't be far off.

Secondly, it was for promotion. With such positive reviews, revealing the numbers was clearly an excellent way to generate buzz.

As Chen Xu revealed the sales data, not only were the game designers following the situation shocked,

but also major media outlets paying attention.

A little-known mini-game, created by a designer previously known for Gentleman's Games, who had recently had a public spat with another designer—

this story was simply too hot a topic.

Moreover, Undertale's performance data was explosively impressive.

Previously, some gaming media dismissed Undertale as insignificant, but now their faces were thoroughly slapped.

As for ordinary players who had played the game, they had only one feeling:

Undertale's ratings and results were truly well-deserved.

The unforgettable characters in the game, especially the final ending, were profoundly moving.

Before playing this game, no player could have imagined a game could be made this way!

All players felt as though they were witnessing history.

Undertale might leave a brilliant mark in the history of independent games.

At the same time, other media outlets quickly followed up with news reports.

"Sales exceed 100,000 in 3 days! Rating as high as 9.9!"

"A masterpiece of independent gaming—a must-play for every player!"

"A special RPG that overturns players' understanding of the RPG genre!"

"Players: I was played by this game!"

"An unbelievable game! Unbelievable results!"

"The first playthrough brings shock, the second brings warmth, the third brings suffering, and the fourth brings reflection."

Undoubtedly, Undertale had become popular. Initially, it was the praise from media and players.

Then it spread through the game designer circles, because Undertale's setting was completely different from any previous game.

Not only in story, but also in presentation.

For example, Flowey's dialogue felt as if he were speaking directly to the player through the screen.

Such design made every game designer feel as though a Skylight had been opened.

To be precise, in Chen Xu's previous life, Undertale wasn't a game heavily saturated with META elements.

Aside from the beginning and ending, the interruptions throughout mainly told the stories of in-game characters like Sans, Papyrus, and Undyne.

Precisely because of this, Undertale possessed a greater sense of immersion than typical META games.

Only when the game's ending secrets were revealed did players experience an extremely intense sense of shock.

And after each ending, there was also a hidden philosophical contemplation and self-reflection.

This was the greatest characteristic of META games.

In terms of META elements alone, Undertale was actually inferior to The Stanley Parable or Pony Island.

But in this Parallel World, the concept of META games hadn't even begun to sprout.

Undertale's existing META setting, combined with its story, delivered an impact to players that was infinitely stronger than in Chen Xu's previous life.

Especially as live streaming platforms and video platforms began showcasing content from Undertale to players, the fire was fueled even further, burning more intensely than ever.
