Chapter 145: Player Hot Discussion (First Update for Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

With the release of the promotional trailer for "It Takes Two", it can be said that it attracted many players. In addition to Nebula Games' fans, there were also a large number of ordinary players.

The main reason was also that during this period, everyone was experiencing a game drought. There weren't many outstanding games that could excite players.

As Nebula Games, the developer of "Dark Souls" last year, and numerous small-scale games developed in the past, had earned the trust of many players in its brand.

Although it hadn't reached the point where everything Nebula produced was a masterpiece, it already had many loyal fans.

After watching the promotional trailer released by Chen Xu and Nebula Games' official Weibo account, many players were taken aback.

This included gaming industry designers who followed Chen Xu's actions. Because they found that this was a bit different from what they had imagined!

Immediately on the forums, countless players who had seen the "It Takes Two" trailer began discussing it animatedly.

"It feels completely different from Chen Xu's 'Overcooked' last year!"

"Yeah! Although the art style is cartoonish, the content feels much richer than 'Overcooked'. Is this an action-adventure game!?"

"Holy cow, does this mean it's a major production!?"

"And judging by the game content, it's two players playing as a man and a woman, overcoming challenges to progress?"

"Don't even mention it, it really fits the game's title!"

"From the description, it seems like a couple whose relationship is broken turns into clay and wooden dolls, and they have to fix their relationship to turn back into humans?"

"The content feels incredibly rich! Just in the trailer alone, there seem to be all sorts of genres: RPG, FPS, and even racing, it's unbelievable!"

"Now that you mention it, it's true, this game's gameplay content feels quite rich!"

As Chen Xu released the promotional trailer for "It Takes Two" and related information, it immediately garnered significant player attention.

From the art style of this promotional video, it was a very cinematic animation style. As for the content, it was a game that combined elements of platforming, parkour evasion, racing, shooting, and puzzle-solving. It could be said that it was completely different from what they had imagined.

Valentine's Day, couple's cooperation, warm and friendly. All these tags that Chen Xu initially mentioned made players instinctively think of "Overcooked", launched by Nebula Games around the same time last year.

Although many players playfully called it "Breakup Kitchen", it must be said that this game indeed generated a wave of popularity for cooperative games, and even spawned many similar casual games.

Although it wasn't explicitly stated, many players had subconsciously linked Nebula Games' new title with "Overcooked". But after watching the trailer for "It Takes Two" now, they realized it was completely unrelated!

While players were surprised, they soon discovered that Chen Xu's official Weibo account had sent another message. This message provided a detailed introduction to the features of "It Takes Two".

'Originally intended as a Valentine's Day surprise for all players, but unfortunately, it will be 20 days late.'

'This is a unique adventure game, where you will embark on the craziest journey of your life with your best friend.'

'It's an animated movie interactive game focused on two-player cooperation and a story-driven plot.'

'Players need to overcome challenges together with another player, experiencing various humorous and chaotic situations, but one thing is for sure: When two people are of one heart, their sharpness can cut through metal.'

'As a two-player game, "It Takes Two" does not require both players to purchase the game. As long as one player buys it, they can invite a companion to play for free. [Note: Requires Nebula Games Platform version]'

'Game price: 146 Yuan!'

After the message was posted, Chen Xu's official Weibo account was quickly filled with player comments.

'Mr. Chen, you're so thoughtful! A late Valentine's Day surprise, only you could do it!'

'Thinking about last year's 'Overcooked', and now 'It Takes Two' this year, is Mr. Chen trying to cultivate an annual release for Nebula Games!?'

'23333333, a couple's game every year. Last year's couple's game directly became a couple killer, I wonder what 'It Takes Two' will be like this year!'

'But I think it should be quite interesting, and it seems different from 'Overcooked' – is the story one of the core aspects of this game?'

'By the way, did anyone notice, this game only requires one purchase to play? But the price isn't cheap, it's 146 Yuan!?'

Many players, after reading the introduction on Chen Xu's official Weibo account, had essentially dug up some information.

First, it indirectly revealed the game's launch date. Additionally, the game was indeed an adventure game, rather than a casual simulation game like "Overcooked".

What many players found even more intriguing was that, unlike the "buy one get one free" model of the previous "Overcooked", for "It Takes Two", only one player needed to purchase it, and then they could freely invite other players to play together.

This was much more cost-effective than "buy one get one free". For instance, with "Overcooked's" "buy one get one free" offer, if you wanted to play with someone else who didn't own the game, you would still have to buy another copy. But "It Takes Two" clearly didn't have this problem.

As long as you bought it, you could play with anyone you wanted, the decision was in your own hands.

However, the price also surprised many players, as "It Takes Two" was priced at 146 Yuan.

And considering the prices of Nebula Games' previous titles, there was only one explanation. That is, "It Takes Two" would be a larger-scale game, at least larger than games like "Valiant Hearts: The Great War" and "To the Moon". Otherwise, Nebula Games would not have given it such a price.

As for players, they were still more concerned with the game's content. Although there was a promotional trailer, it wasn't an actual gameplay demonstration after all, so it was hard to say what the game was truly like.

The only thing that allowed players to make a connection was that Chen Xu had also developed a cooperative game, "Overcooked", last year. However, in terms of game type and scale, these two games were clearly different.

However, thanks to Nebula Games' accumulated reputation and the Annual Game Awards event before the New Year, Chen Xu's reputation had also spread quite widely.

Most players, after learning about "It Takes Two", also developed a strong interest. Of course, this was also related to the recent game drought experienced by players.

At the same time, because Chen Xu had clearly stated that this was a cooperative game that required two players to complete, some players who were preparing to play this game began forming groups and seeking companions to play with.
