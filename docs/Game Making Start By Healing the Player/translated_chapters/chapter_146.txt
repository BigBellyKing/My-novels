## Chapter 145: Player Hot Discussion (First Update – Please Subscribe, Monthly Pass Votes Needed)

With the release of the *It Takes Two* promotional trailer, it instantly attracted a large number of players.

Aside from Nebula Games' loyal fans, a significant number of ordinary players were also drawn in.

This was mainly because, during this period, players were collectively experiencing a game drought.

There weren't many outstanding games capable of exciting the playerbase.

Nebula Games, having developed *Dark Souls* last year and consistently releasing numerous small-scale yet well-received titles, had already built a strong sense of trust among many players.

While it hadn't quite reached the point where "Nebula's products are always high-quality," the company already boasted a dedicated fanbase.

After watching the promotional trailer released by Chen Xu and Nebula Games' official Weibo account, many players were taken aback.

Even gaming industry designers who closely followed Chen Xu's moves felt the same surprise.

Because they realized—this was different from what they had imagined!

Instantly, the forums exploded with heated discussions from countless players who had seen the *It Takes Two* promotional video.

"Feels completely different from Chen Xu's *Overcooked* last year!"

"Yeah! Though the art style is cartoonish in both, this one seems way more content-rich than *Overcooked*. Is this an action-adventure game!?"

"Damn it! So does this mean it's a major production!?"

"And judging by the gameplay, two players control a male and a female character, overcoming obstacles together as they progress?"

"Now that you mention it, it really fits the game's title!"

"From the description, it seems like a married couple, after their relationship breaks down, transform into a clay figure and a wooden doll, and must repair their bond to become human again?"

"The content feels incredibly rich! The trailer alone seems to include all kinds of genres—RPG, FPS, even car chases—simply unbelievable!"

"Now that you say it, the gameplay content does seem pretty diverse!"

As Chen Xu released the *It Takes Two* promotional trailer and related information, it immediately sparked widespread player interest.

Judging from the trailer's art style, it adopts a cinematic animated style.

In terms of content, it integrates various gameplay elements—platforming, parkour evasion, high-speed driving, shooting, and puzzle solving.

It was completely unlike what they had imagined.

Valentine's Day, couple's cooperation, warm and friendly.

When Chen Xu first mentioned these tags, players couldn't help but think of *Overcooked*, which Nebula Games had launched last year around the same time.

Although many players jokingly commented on it as "Breakup Kitchen," there was no denying that the game had sparked a brief surge in popularity for cooperative games, even spawning numerous similar casual games.

Though not explicitly stated, many players had already subconsciously linked Nebula Games' new title with *Overcooked*.

But after watching the *It Takes Two* trailer, they realized—this was entirely different!

As players were still astonished, Chen Xu's official Weibo soon posted another message.

This message provided a detailed introduction to *It Takes Two*'s key characteristics.

'Originally meant as a Valentine's surprise for all players, but it's 20 days late.'

'This is a unique adventure game—you'll embark on the most mad journey of your life with your best friend.'

'This is an animated movie interactive game centered around two-player co-op and story-driven gameplay.'

'Players must overcome challenges together with a partner, experiencing all kinds of humor and chaos. But one thing is certain: When Two People Are of One Heart, Their Sharpness Can Cut Through Metal.'

'As a two-player game, *It Takes Two* does not require both players to purchase it. One copy is enough—one player can invite companions to play for free. [Note: Applies only to the Nebula Games Platform version]'

'Game Price: 146 Yuan!'

After the message was posted, Chen Xu's official Weibo comments section quickly flooded with player reactions.

"Mr. Chen, you're too thoughtful—delivering a late Valentine's surprise, classic you!"

"Remember last year's *Overcooked*? Now we have *It Takes Two*. Is Mr. Chen trying to turn Nebula Games into an annual release tradition!?"

"23333333, one couple's game every year. Last year's turned into a 'couple killer'—wonder what this year's *It Takes Two* will be like!"

"But I feel it might actually be quite fun. And unlike *Overcooked*, the story seems to be one of the core aspects?"

"Wait, did anyone notice? You only need to buy one copy to play! Though the price isn't cheap—146 Yuan? That's steep!"

After reading Chen Xu's official Weibo post, players quickly dug out some key information.

First, it subtly hinted at the game's launch date.

Second, it confirmed that the game was truly an adventure game, not a casual simulation game like *Overcooked*.

But what drew even more attention was how it differed from *Overcooked*'s "buy one, get one free" model.

With *It Takes Two*, only one player needs to purchase it, and then they can freely invite others to join.

This was far more cost-effective than "buy one, get one free."

For example, with *Overcooked*'s model, if you wanted to play with someone who didn't own the game, you'd have to buy a second copy.

But *It Takes Two* clearly avoided this issue.

Once you bought it, you could play with anyone you wanted—the decision-making power was entirely in your hands.

However, the price also surprised many players, as *It Takes Two* was priced at a surprisingly high 146 Yuan.

Considering Nebula Games' previous pricing, there was only one explanation:

*It Takes Two* must have a significantly larger game scale—definitely larger than titles like *Valiant Hearts: The Great War* or *To the Moon*.

Otherwise, Nebula Games wouldn't have set such a price.

For players, however, the game's actual content remained their top concern.

Although there was a promotional trailer, it wasn't actual gameplay footage, so it was hard to judge the real experience.

The only reference point was Chen Xu's previous co-op game, *Overcooked*.

But in terms of game type and scale, the two titles were clearly worlds apart.

Still, thanks to Nebula Games' consistently strong reputation and the widespread publicity Chen Xu gained from the recent Annual Game Awards Event, most players developed a strong interest in *It Takes Two* after learning about it.

Of course, this was also partly due to the current game drought.

Additionally, since Chen Xu had clearly stated that this was a cooperative co-op game requiring two players, many who intended to play started forming groups and recruiting potential partners.
