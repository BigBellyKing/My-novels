# Chapter 26: Subsequent Arrangements

As *Undertale* achieved a double harvest in both reputation and sales, the keyword META garnered attention from countless game designers in the industry.

Purely in terms of plot, *Undertale* was indeed excellent, but it definitely wouldn't have reached its current level of achievement and acclaim without something more.

However, after incorporating the META element, everyone who played it had only one feeling: awe.

Not only designers in the Independent Game circle but also some mid-to-high-level game designers, and even those focused on VR games, paid attention to *Undertale*.

After all, from a certain perspective, it taught all game designers a lesson.

It showed everyone what the META element truly is and how this element should be interwoven into a game.

However, compared to the attention from many designers in the game industry,

Chen Xu at this time was completely relaxed.

The success of *Undertale* was truly a double harvest.

Both fame and fortune were attained.

In the office, Chen Xu held a bottle of Want Want Milk, looking at the system UI interface that only he could see.

“Doesn't quite cut it! Although it provides more points than *Mirror (Game)* did before, it only got me enough for 2 ten-draws.”

After deducting the odd amount, Chen Xu's accumulated points were now 2.1 million, just enough for 21 draws.

Compared to *Mirror (Game)*, *Undertale* indeed provided quite a bit, but not excessively so.

Chen Xu also summarized the ultimate reason.

It had to be emotions felt by players who bought and personally played the game for them to count.

Simply put, only when money was spent and strong emotional fluctuations occurred could points be accumulated.

If it was merely watched, no matter how impactful, it wouldn't be included.

What was most impactful in *Undertale*, besides the initial exposure to the META element, mostly came from the Genocide Route.

However, very few players were actually willing to play the Genocide Route, especially after various video guides came out; many players couldn't bear to play it and chose to experience it through videos (cloud play).

Therefore, the large amount of points currently accumulated mainly stemmed from players' initial shock and awe.

Thinking to himself, he also started drawing.

With a total of 2.1 million points, Chen Xu didn't do a ten-draw.

Anyway, this gacha system had no guaranteed SSR for ten-draws or any ten-draw discounts.

He did all single draws. As the saying goes, miracles happen with single draws, and single draws also have a sense of ritual.

There was just one thing: could this golden light be changed?

Looking at the flashing golden light before him, Chen Xu felt nothing inside.

As the light dissipated, a common plot +1 skill book appeared.

The most dazzling golden light, yet it produced the most common item. You really know how to do it!

Sighing with emotion, Chen Xu clicked through all of them at once.

After 21 consecutive draws, Chen Xu felt that he might not have washed his hands before drawing this time.

Except for two Memory Capsules, everything else was a common skill book; not a single rare one appeared.

As for the types, art, music, plot, level design, and Numerical Design, none were missed.

He took a sip of milk, lamented his bad luck as a Non-chief, used all the skill books, and then closed the system.

Opening the Official Game Engine backend on his computer, and logging into the Modu Game Department's division, Chen Xu checked his permissions.

Compared to the previous 1024, the resources Chen Xu could now use had been increased to 2048, roughly doubled.

Evidently, even though he hadn't received a job title promotion notice, the Game Department had noticed his development of *Undertale* and had raised his designer level.

“Next, I need to consider subsequent games.” Leaning back in his chair, Chen Xu fell into a state of hesitation.

AAA-tier game?

This was immediately ruled out by Chen Xu.

Because it was unrealistic.

Whether it was resources, manpower, funds, or Chen Xu's current capabilities, developing an AAA-tier game was still quite difficult.

After all, low-cost games relied on creative gameplay and plot presentation, while AAA-tier games tested overall performance more.

So for the next direction, Chen Xu still decided to focus on small-scale, low-cost games.

During this period, he would build up the core team and get Nebula Games on track as quickly as possible.

After all, in this entire company, only Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, and he were involved in game development.

Now that they had money, recruiting people was a natural next step.

Additionally, he would use the opportunity to accumulate more points and improve his own abilities.

As for pay-to-win games, Chen Xu currently had no such intention.

Because it could easily have a huge impact on his and Nebula Games' reputation.

And the immense success of *Undertale* proved one thing: the market in this Parallel World was completely different from his previous life.

It was possible to profit from buy-to-play games, and in this situation, Chen Xu naturally planned to pursue a high-quality route.

………………

In the meeting room, looking at everyone seated, Chen Xu briefly spoke about the achievements brought by *Undertale* and the *Mirror (Game)* DLC.

At the same time, he confirmed with everyone the main development direction for the future, which involved expanding the team departments.

And some related regulations, and as the boss, Chen Xu inevitably gave everyone two pots of motivational speeches.

It must be said, making grand promises and giving motivational speeches oneself feels completely different from having a boss shove those promises and speeches down one's throat.

At this moment, Chen Xu also understood why so many people in his previous life enjoyed making grand promises and feeding chicken soup.

It was quite satisfying.

After administrative and human resources matters were concluded, Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue remained in the meeting room for game-related discussions.

“So, are we going to launch a sequel to *Undertale* next?” Yang Xin asked, her face full of anticipation for the future.

This was the game industry she had always dreamed of!

Ruan Ningxue next to her was also excited.

When she first joined, it was partly due to Chen Xu and Yang Xin's relationship, and partly because making games felt good, and she also felt it had some prospects.

But now?

It wasn't just some prospects; it was very promising!

Especially when she saw people drawing fan stories of *Undertale* and *Mirror (Game)* on some websites, it gave her a wonderful feeling.

After all, these were projects she had participated in. In the past, she was always the one drawing, but now she could see others drawing.

Hearing Yang Xin's question, Chen Xu smiled and nodded: “There will definitely be a new project, but it won't be a sequel to *Undertale*, nor will it be a META-type game.”

Not a sequel to *Undertale*, not even a META-type game?

Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue were stunned.
