Chapter 337: Remember, No Russian (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

However, this thought didn't last long. Soon, Zhang Yi was completely attracted by the current level in front of him.

Because he actually stood together with Soap on a cliff ledge only about two meters wide.

Beneath his feet was thick snow. One more step forward would plunge him into an unfathomable, bottomless abyss.

The path ahead was even more extreme—only a narrow trail wide enough for someone to pass sideways.

"Damn it!"

Letting out a cry, Zhang Yi's legs immediately weakened.

As a player with even a slight fear of heights, this scene was truly overwhelming.

In the previous *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*, although there were high-altitude perspectives, they were mostly inside places like airplanes, and throughout, he could just keep shooting.

That greatly distracted his attention. But now?

He genuinely felt his legs go weak.

Especially under the新时代's incredibly high VR sense of immersion, he felt utterly shaken.

The ice-climbing segment, with ice axes striking the frozen surface and visible cracks spreading, made his heart pound with fear.

Slowly advancing toward the cliff's summit.

In the howling wind, Soap and Roach reached a flat section of the cliff.

To continue climbing, they had to leap across this gap.

As team leader, Soap was a seasoned veteran. With a leap, accompanied by a 'Click Sound', his ice axe embedded perfectly into the ice layer, and he pulled himself onto the ledge.

Taking a deep breath and seeing Soap waving at him, Zhang Yi controlled Roach to jump as well.

But unlike Soap's smooth landing, Roach was clearly far less fortunate.

The ice axe planted in the ice developed a terrifying crack. The ice surface couldn't support Roach's weight and shattered explosively.

"Holy crap, I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die!"

The sudden scene sent Zhang Yi's heart racing. Especially when he glanced downward—the sight of the endless abyss beneath made his legs go completely numb.

But at that moment, as snow tumbled down from above, a man grabbed an ice axe and firmly pulled Roach back to safety.

'Got you!'

The familiar voice came from Soap. Then, tilting his head, Soap signaled, and Roach quickly drove his ice axe into the ice, scrambling upward.

At this moment, Zhang Yi felt a slight tingling on his scalp.

That familiar line—back in the first installment, Captain Price had saved Soap exactly the same way!

And considering that in the first game, the protagonist he controlled was Soap himself, in that instant, the emotional bond between character and player was instantly forged.

An indescribably powerful feeling.

As Soap and Roach advanced deeper into enemy territory, that familiar sensation made Zhang Yi increasingly excited.

During combat, teammates' voices through walkie-talkies gave him direction.

During escape, they helped him clear obstacles.

When caught in a trap, your teammate was your last fuse.

Of course, what made Zhang Yi feel even better was the combat segment—he felt it offered far more choices than the previous game.

Silenced rifles, heart-rate sensors, and thermal scopes—essential for stealth.

Amid the blizzard, Roach and Soap moved like ghosts through the snow, piercing straight into enemy territory.

Deep inside the military base, Roach successfully located their target.

Yet in the end, Soap was discovered by the enemy in the warehouse.

But Soap didn't panic at all—he still had Plan B. As Roach triggered the detonator, the pre-planted bombs outside exploded. Taking advantage of the enemy's distraction from the blast, Roach and Soap launched a counterattack.

The two regrouped and, under the cover of the blizzard, began their retreat.

But due to the blizzard and the excessive number of anti-air defenses at the enemy base, the rescue Gyrocopter could only land on another hillside.

Here, a deadly high-speed chase unfolded—Roach and Soap hijacked a snowmobile and began a life-or-death escape.

Especially during the final stretch, controlling Roach on the snowmobile, accelerating downhill with the throttle fully open, they roared toward a steep cliff ramp, launching into the air like a bird with wings spread wide.

This sent Zhang Yi's adrenaline soaring.

He had waited ten days!

This heart-pounding sensation was exactly what he wanted!

Yet after this exhilarating experience, the next level delivered another kind of震撼ing impact.

One even greater than the nuclear explosion scene from the last game.

………………

Zakhaev International Airport. This time, Zhang Yi's perspective shifted to Joseph Allen.

But now, he was known as Alexei Borodin—the undercover alias he was using.

【Note: The content of this level may cause discomfort. Would you like to skip it, or watch it as a CG video?】

Below were three options: Skip, Watch as Video, and No.

Huh?

Was this level particularly special?

Wasn't this game already rated for adults?

Zhang Yi felt puzzled but still selected 'No'.

For a game hailed as groundbreaking, he didn't want to miss a single detail.

The screen faded in—inside an elevator.

Beside him stood a group of teammates. One of them Zhang Yi recognized instantly.

Makarov!

In the previous game's Operation Croaker, he had seen the man's photo.

Now, everyone carried assault rifles and wore bulletproof vests.

They seemed ready for some kind of operation.

'Remember, no Russian!' Makarov turned and looked at the group.

Then, the elevator doors opened.

Outside lay the terminal hall—a vast, open space filled with countless ordinary civilians. The noise was a bit chaotic but still orderly.

But the moment Makarov and his men stepped out, order collapsed.

Amid Zhang Yi's dumbfounded stare and the civilians' terrified screams in the game,

Makarov and his men raised their guns and opened fire on the crowd.

Zhang Yi never expected such a scene to appear in a game.

Watching Makarov and his men massacre innocent civilians, Zhang Yi instinctively raised his own weapon and aimed it at them.

He fired. In previous games, shooting at teammates would instantly trigger a mission failure screen, along with the famous message: 'Harming teammates is not allowed.'

But in this level, if the player does this, they would simply be gunned down in a hail of bullets by Makarov's men.

Blocking their path would result in the same fate—death.

Throughout, Zhang Yi merely followed woodenly behind Makarov and the others, not firing a single shot.

Moreover, compared to his previous life, Chen Xu had made many changes here.

For example, on the second floor of the airport, players previously had to kill two security personnel near a flowerbed—a level requirement.

Now, players could choose to go through the entire level without firing a single shot.

At this moment, Zhang Yi finally understood why there had been that initial warning.

Before this, Zhang Yi had never given much thought to so-called terrorist organizations.

His Aggro toward Zakhaev in the last game stemmed mostly from the fact that Zakhaev had killed Gaz, Griggs, and other comrades he trusted with his life.

But now, it was different.

Such inhumane actions were simply too震撼ing—even in a game.

Woodenly following behind Makarov, a waiting ambulance had already arrived to extract them.

"Well done, you've succeeded! Get in quickly! Makarov, we've sent a loud message with this attack!" The extraction member seemed ecstatic, patting Makarov on the shoulder.

"That wasn't the message," Makarov said, expressionless, extending his right hand toward Allen, the last one to board.

As an undercover agent, Allen, who believed his cover was flawless, had no suspicions.

But the next moment, Makarov pulled out his pistol and shot Allen straight through the heart.

"This is the message."

Bang!

The screen instantly turned red. Makarov coldly kicked Allen in the chest.

Allen's body went limp and collapsed heavily to the ground.

Zhang Yi was completely stunned.

What was going on?

The screen grew increasingly blurry, leaving only Makarov's faint voice echoing in his ears.

"The Americans thought they could manipulate us. But when they find this body, all of Russia will roar for revenge."

The truth? That doesn't matter. All that's needed is a pretext to start a war—and that's enough.

In an instant, Zhang Yi understood.

This was a conspiracy!

A setup designed to use Allen's identity as an American to provide a justification for war following this disaster.

Just as there were those who wanted war with America, there were also those who desired peace.

But now?

With the Zakhaev Airport incident, whether it was a conspiracy or not no longer mattered.
