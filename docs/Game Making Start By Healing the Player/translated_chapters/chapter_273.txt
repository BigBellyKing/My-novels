Chapter 272: Is Your Game Made of Gold? (Fifth Update, Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)

Regarding the two crossovers between Monster Hunter: World and Minecraft.

Essentially, within the gaming industry—whether players or industry designers—everyone already has a speculation.

That is, Nebula Games is definitely developing a new game.

The remaining question is what type of game it will be.

As for the theme, that doesn't require much thought.

Judging from the Kingdom of Lordaeron, combined with monsters like the Frost Dragon and Chimera, as well as the weapon appearances created through the crossover,

it's clear this will be a fantasy-themed game.

As for the genre, it really only comes down to a few options.

First, FPS can be ruled out immediately—it just doesn't seem plausible at all.

Beyond that, both industry designers and players generally believe it will either be an RPG or an action-adventure game.

Meaning either something like Dark Souls or something like Monster Hunter: World.

After all, judging from the blockbusters they've released so far, Nebula Games has proven highly skilled in both areas.

Moreover, both in Dark Souls and Monster Hunter: World, Nebula Games has demonstrated extraordinary strength in the action game and RPG domains.

What remains a concern for players is whether Chen Xu will pour his passion into this game.

After all, Chen Xu's past creations have been truly impactful.

And also quite agonizing.

Because with most games, if you add too many gimmicks, well, you can just choose not to play.

But Chen Xu's games are different.

They make you suffer, yet at the same time, they make you feel incredible.

This conflicting experience makes players both fearful and addicted.

They shout 'Go away!' 'Won't buy!' 'Won't play!'—yet their hands reach for their wallets, somehow unable to stop.

During this period, Chen Xu hadn't been idle either.

The development plan was progressing steadily.

As for the CGI, Chen Xu once again hired the same company that had previously produced the cutscene promotional animations for Dark Souls.

Their technical skill had already been approved by Chen Xu, and truthfully, CGI is mostly about spending money.

Domestically, as long as you're willing to spend, the results can even surpass overseas productions.

And naturally, Chen Xu was more than willing to invest heavily in Warcraft.

After several rounds of negotiation, Nebula Games' investment in the Warcraft CGI animation reached a nine-digit figure starting with the number 4.

Of course, the settlement unit was RMB.

Besides that, the modeling materials handled by Ruan Ningxue and outsourced teams were already mostly completed.

They were extremely exquisite. Chen Xu also added a special feature:

Close-up Setting—the in-game camera defaults to this.

Later, once the Map Editor is opened, players can adjust the camera based on their needs, including for the built-in campaigns.

However, in RTS battles, the camera will be fixed—only zooming in is allowed, not zooming out—mainly for fairness.

With the added close-up camera, players can click to switch and view the in-game modeling up close.

For an RTS game, there's actually no need to make the models so detailed, unlike RPGs.

Yet Chen Xu decided to pursue excellence. Not necessarily to rival traditional RPGs or linear game-type games,

but at least within the RTS genre, Chen Xu dared to claim that globally, currently, no game could match Warcraft in graphics and modeling.

Under these circumstances, naturally, players deserved a better, more direct sensory experience.

Of course, for unit types with slightly bold and revealing outfits—like the Human Sorceress and Elf Archer—underwear pants were included.

In addition, Chen Xu made some minor adjustments to the campaign.

Because the original campaign was still quite difficult for clumsy players. Many players even used invincibility cheat codes like 'whosyourdaddy' to simply Basic Attack their way through.

Of course, Chen Xu kept all these cheat codes, since they were a necessity for some players.

When facing 'madness-inducing enemies,' people always needed some cheat codes to save face.

Using 'who's your daddy' might be excessive, but using 'greedisgood 99999' to give yourself a little extra wood and gold—surely that wasn't too unreasonable?

………………

Days passed. Just as the topics sparked by the content in Minecraft and Monster Hunter: World began to gradually cool down,

Chen Xu and Nebula Games' official Weibo account finally moved.

The content left countless players and industry designers shocked and bewildered.

'Reefining RTS, development cost exceeds 700 million, upcoming fantasy blockbuster Warcraft launching soon!'

A simple sentence, accompanied by several concept artworks.

Tyrande Whisperwind riding Dromarch the White Tiger, Arthas as a Paladin, Tauren Chieftain Cairne Bloodhoof carrying a totem and wielding a Runic Spear, the Frost Dragon spreading its wings.

As Chen Xu's official Weibo post went live, it instantly attracted massive attention.

After all, the content from Monster Hunter: World and Minecraft had already captured the interest and focus of many players.

Many had been speculating whether Chen Xu had a new project, and if so, what kind.

But now, the information revealed in this message instantly left countless players dumbfounded.

'Redefine RTS,' 'RTS,' 'development cost exceeds 700 million'?

What!?

The combination of these keywords immediately caused the热度 to explode.

'Damn it! Mr. Chen has a new game again?!'

'It's actually RTS—did I read that right?!'

'These concept artworks are actually something! This Elf Girl riding the white tiger is so beautiful—nom nom!'

'Redefining RTS? 700 million cost? Are you just bragging?'

'Did I read this wrong? RTS and development cost over 700 million?'

Accompanied by Chen Xu's Weibo post, the entire gaming industry—players and designers alike—erupted into excitement.

Chen Xu's new game had actually become an insignificant point.

The real key points were the keywords that followed.

'Redefine RTS'—Chen Xu actually dared to say that!?

After all, although RTS wasn't exactly niche and was relatively simple, it was definitely not easy to make.

Player reactions weren't that intense, mainly because Nebula Games and Chen Xu's previous reputation had built trust.

Although Chen Xu always gave them 'shocks,' there were never lacks of joys.

And as for development costs, players didn't really care much. They cared whether the game was fun or not.

But judging from the current situation, clearly players had already gotten used to it—this was just another one of Chen Xu's pie-in-the-sky promises.

For players, they mostly discussed why Chen Xu would make an RTS, since they had assumed it would be an RPG or action game.

But for the gaming industry, it felt somewhat absurd.

Not because Chen Xu was making an RTS game, but because of the cost announcement.

Generally, during game development, companies sometimes disclose costs for promotional purposes—some true, some false.

But Nebula Games' announced cost for Warcraft was simply too outrageous?

An RTS game—publicly announcing a development cost of 700 million?

If you said project cost, fine—that could include marketing and other expenses later on.

But development alone costing over 700 million?

Is your game made of gold?

However, some perceptive designers noticed the deeper implications behind Chen Xu's RTS.
