Chapter 248: This Game Is So Easy! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)

After passing through a forest trail, Zhang Yi couldn't help but sigh in amazement.

In the distance lay a beach, along with the lush Ancient Forest. On the beach, numerous Herbivores gathered in small groups, each possessing a long tail resembling a hammer.

Ignoring the Research Team Leader who was waving at him ahead, Zhang Yi immediately sprinted toward a Herbivore that was drinking water in the distance.

"You'll be my first practice target!"

Facing the Herbivore, Zhang Yi felt a surge of excitement.

After all, this was his first real hunting attempt. Until now, all his techniques had only been practiced on wooden dummies.

As Zhang Yi approached, the Herbivore drinking water didn't seem to sense any danger.

Thanks to his prior knowledge of Monster Hunter: World, Zhang Yi understood that Herbivores were non-aggressive by nature—peaceful creatures that wouldn't attack first.

Clearly, their purpose in the game was to serve as beginner targets for players.

With a swing of his Great Sword, Zhang Yi struck and charged. A damage indicator shot up, and the Herbivore let out a pained cry, instinctively lashing out with its tail hammer before attempting to flee.

Nearby Herbivores scattered in panic.

Although struck by the tail, Zhang Yi's hyper armor during the charged attack prevented any flinching. The damage was negligible.

Then came a second strong charge. With a final cry, the Herbivore collapsed—defeated.

"No doubt about it—the Great Sword is truly divine! I didn't even use full strength, and you're already down!"

Zhang Yi was ecstatic.

Judging by size, the Herbivore was nearly as large and sturdy as two oxen.

Yet it had fallen so easily. The Great Sword's damage was simply explosive!

He knew this monster was designed as a practice target—something that wouldn't fight back or retaliate.

Still, the thrill remained.

Especially the Great Sword in his hands—the damage exceeded his expectations.

After only two or three strikes, the Herbivore was dead.

Each swing delivered satisfying sound effects and responsive feedback, as if the sword were truly slicing into meat.

It felt incredibly satisfying.

As for wounds, Monster Hunter: World didn't display overly bloody visuals.

Though it was a hunting game, forcing players to hack monsters into gory pieces and dismember them afterward would have been excessive.

Thus, while there were visible wounds during hunts to enhance the sense of immersion, the game didn't strive for realism.

Additionally, the game featured a damage indicator system, allowing players to see the damage they dealt.

This system was enabled by default, though it could be turned off to increase immersion.

It remained on by default primarily to help players learn the mechanics.

After all, Monster Hunter: World had hitzones and weak points on different body parts.

Damage indicators helped players better distinguish these differences.

Of course, for most experienced Hunters, this system was practically useless.

Knowing the weak spots didn't mean you could actually hit them.

Most would still end up as Foot Massage Masters or Back Scrubber Masters.

Which Old Hunter hadn't evolved from such humble beginnings?

As for hitzones or weaknesses?

Completely unclear!

One word: Just Go For It (colloquial)!

After a brief moment of excitement, Zhang Yi sheathed his Great Sword and began collecting loot.

He also pulled out a Whetstone to sharpen his blade, fully restoring its sharpness.

Though he had defeated his first prey in his hunting career, his excitement quickly subsided.

He well understood that Herbivores were designed solely for training.

There was virtually no chance of losing.

Under such circumstances, there was naturally no sense of achievement.

Like defeating Gundyr the Ash in Dark Souls for the first time—the overwhelming sense of accomplishment came from knowing that boss posed a massive challenge at that stage.

It took immense effort and skill refinement to finally overcome it.

Or in RPGs, grinding levels and crafting gear to finally defeat a boss due to insufficient level attributes—those too brought joy and pride.

But defeating a creature that couldn't fight back, barely stronger than a Training Grounds wooden dummy—feeling proud of that? That would be ridiculous.

So for Zhang Yi, the only takeaway was confirmation—he had chosen the right weapon.

The Great Sword was incredibly powerful.

Charged attacks with hyper armor, damage through the roof.

No wonder it was the protagonist Hunter's weapon in the promotional video.

As for those three Longsword Heroes at the end of the trailer? Clearly minor characters (gaming slang) level.

"Still, these Herbivores are way too fragile!"

Shouldering his Great Sword, Zhang Yi didn't immediately follow the green guiding bug to meet the Research Team Leader for the main quest. Fifty minutes still seemed plenty.

With the Great Sword on his back, he located and eliminated two more Herbivores.

Then he wandered around the outskirts of the Ancient Forest, discovering something fascinating.

On the game's large map, numerous interactive elements existed.

Pickable fruits and food items, even insects and small animals on the ground could be captured.

Just moments ago, he'd used a net to catch a gray Detour Rabbit.

After wandering for a while, Zhang Yi finally followed the green guiding bug through a narrow path, arriving at the quest location: Jagras's Den.

As he emerged, a group of Small Jagras appeared, along with a few larger ones nearby.

"So many!"

Seeing the swarm of Jagras, Zhang Yi instinctively felt a twinge of panic.

A lingering side effect from playing Dark Souls.

In Dark Souls, the scariest thing wasn't seeing a boss—it was seeing a cluster of mobs.

But once Zhang Yi actually started fighting, he realized his worry was completely unfounded.

"Finally, my health bar isn't just photoshopped on! It's so sturdy!"

Accustomed to Dark Souls' health bar that shattered with a single hit, seeing only a tiny sliver of health lost after being attacked by these Small Jagras made Zhang Yi instantly thrilled.

What did this mean? Monster Hunter: World truly wasn't a high-difficulty game like Dark Souls!

Then, swinging his Great Sword at a Jagras, the feedback further proved his point.

One charged strike sent it crashing to the ground. Two follow-up hits, and it was dead.

Monsters attacked him for negligible damage, while he cleared them in two or three hits—like turning into a boss himself!

Inside the cave, strange glowing creatures resembling fireflies existed. Interacting with them released a flashbang effect, blinding the Jagras instantly.

At that moment, Zhang Yi could mindlessly charge his Great Sword—**one hit, one kid**.

Even his companion Palico assisted in battle—**Invincible**!

He'd never felt this exhilarated before.

This game is so easy!

It's actually a Hack-and-Slash Game!
