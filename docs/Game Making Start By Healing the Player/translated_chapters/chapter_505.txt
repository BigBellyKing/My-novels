Chapter 504: Three Endings (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Many players understood from the very beginning that Bloodborne actually drew inspiration from the Cthulhu Mythos.

But it wasn't just about the appearance of the Great Ones; it was the entire core story.

That is: all human exploration into the unknown will lead to disaster.

Human exploration of the unknown isn't necessarily good; in many situations, it may lead them to see things humanity shouldn't, or doesn't want to see.

The truth of the unknown is indeed fascinating, but behind that fascination often lie dark secrets that should not be unearthed.

So, when humanity attempts to expand its tiny horizons, it has already sown the seeds of its own destruction.

Just like everything that happened in Yharnam, there is only tragedy.

In the game, after more than a week of intense fighting, Song Ren, as one of the first players to acquire Bloodborne, was about to reach the first playthrough's ending.

After all, as a veteran player of Souls-like games, once he adapted to Bloodborne's combat style and familiarized himself with the monsters in the game, he was stronger than some ordinary players.

The reason it took him so long was primarily his desire to achieve the third ending, as summarized by some veteran players online.

During this period, with the collective efforts of global players, all the BOSSes in Bloodborne were essentially conquered, and various hidden contents were continuously unearthed by players.

The conditions for achieving the game's endings were also summarized by players.

Song Ren returned to the Hunter's Dream, sighing at the sight of the burnt Hunter's Workshop.

In the backyard, the garden gate that had previously been unopenable now stood ajar.

The Doll informed the player that Gehrman was waiting for the Hunter in the garden.

Yes, the old man in the wheelchair in the workshop was once the true First Hunter: Gehrman.

Among the flowers, Gehrman sat in his wheelchair, congratulating the Hunter on defeating Mergo's Wet Nurse, signifying that the Hunter's work was complete.

After killing Mergo, the Hunter had helped the Moon Presence, the true mastermind behind everything, eliminate all its rivals.

So next, Gehrman would use his weapon to truly awaken the Hunter from the nightmare.

And this is where Bloodborne's three unique endings come into play.

The first ending is called: Yharnam Sunrise.

The Hunter agrees to let Gehrman send them away from the dream, so Gehrman takes out his weapon and severs the Hunter's head.

The Hunter awakens in the center of the Grand Cathedral, as the warm sun begins to rise from the city's horizon, its blinding light feeling so warm.

The Hunter seems to have finally escaped that terrifying nightmare.

But... the Hunter initially entered the dream at Iosefka's Clinic.

And now they awaken in the Grand Cathedral, wearing the clothes of an outsider they had on initially.

Now, they are in the clothes they wore when killed by Gehrman.

So, is this truly an awakening?

Or have they entered yet another new dream?

Moreover, the final mastermind, the Moon Presence, still exists, and Yharnam's tragedy will still not find release.

In the second ending, the Hunter refuses Gehrman's plea.

At this point, Gehrman expresses surprise.

'What makes you cling to the dream?'

'Is it the blood? Or the hunt?'

'However, none of that matters anymore.'

Gehrman slowly rises from his wheelchair.

His appearance is truly shocking; this seemingly frail yet inherently imposing disabled old man, who spent his days in a wheelchair, possessed such immense power.

With a soft clang, Gehrman draws the long-sealed weapon from his back: the Burial Blade.

In the garden, under the moonlight.

Gehrman seems to have returned to his former self.

'Tonight, Gehrman... joins the hunt!'

The former First Hunter and the current Hunter face off.

But the Hunter of today is no longer the newcomer who first stepped into Yharnam.

Through countless cycles of battle, countless life-and-death struggles within the Hunter's Dream.

The Hunter has acquired incredible power.

Gehrman, the once First Hunter, falls in the garden.

But his expression is serene, an expression of liberation.

In the Hunter's Dream, Gehrman suffered from nightmares daily.

Now he is finally free.

Regardless of what comes next, at least now he can close his eyes. Gehrman falls.

But the Hunter's Dream still needs someone to maintain it.

Thus, the true mastermind, the Moon Presence, appears.

The Moon Presence, the root of all evil.

As for the reason?

Do Great Ones have conflicts among themselves, with the Moon Presence using the Hunter to eliminate other Great Ones?

Or is all of this simply a show for the Moon Presence, which quietly enjoys it for its own amusement?

But none of that matters anymore.

The Moon Presence descends from the moon, slowly approaches the Hunter, and makes a gesture of embrace.

Now it needs the Hunter to replace Gehrman, to become the new surrogate and maintain the dream for it.

If the Hunter had not obtained three complete Umbilical Cords before this.

Then the Hunter would be unable to resist the power of the Great One, eventually becoming the new surrogate, sitting in the wheelchair with the Doll, waiting for the next Hunter to arrive.

But if the Hunter collected three complete Umbilical Cords before battling Gehrman.

The Hunter gains immense Great One wisdom.

Therefore, when the Moon Presence appears, the Hunter possesses enough power to resist the Great One.

Finally, the Hunter slays the deity, killing the Moon Presence, and evolves into a new Great One.

And Song Ren took so long to complete the game precisely for this final ending of resisting the Moon Presence.

If it were the old Song Ren, he would never have been able to defeat the Moon Presence.

But the current him is no longer the rookie Hunter who once had to rely on the tombstone trick to defeat Father Gascoigne in Oedon Tomb.

In this hunt, he has overcome countless powerful enemies.

The Blood-starved Beast, Mergo's Wet Nurse, and Maria, Laurence, Ludwig from the Hunter's Nightmare, as well as the Orphan of Kos that almost completely shattered him.

The current him harbors no fear.

The Hunter Axe in his hand has been replaced by Ludwig's Holy Blade, and in its two-handed charged attacks, the Moon Presence has no power to fight back.

And with the death of the Moon Presence, Yharnam's last nightmare is ended.

The old Great Ones are all dead, and a new god is born.

Laurence, Master Willem, and others' ultimate goal has been realized by the Hunter.

The Doll slowly approaches the Hunter, who has become an infant Great One, and gently picks them up, cradling them in her arms.

'Do you feel cold?'

'Oh, dear Hunter…'

Thus, Bloodborne and the story of Yharnam come to an end, but will the Hunter, now an elevated Great One, still be the same Hunter?

Is this truly a good ending?

Song Ren didn't know and didn't want to know.

Looking at the Doll cradling the squid-like Hunter in her arms at the end, Song Ren felt as if a lifetime had passed. There were too many stories in the game that moved him, and the fates of many characters deeply affected him and countless other players.

Gilbert, the kind soul who guided players and gave them the flamethrower, still transformed into a beastly werewolf after the Blood Moon arrived.

The little girl who asked players to find her father either went to Oedon Chapel and was eaten by a sewer boar on the way, or was transformed into a large-headed doll at Iosefka's Clinic.

Doctor Iosefka, a kind doctor who tried her best to protect her patients, was later murdered by a fake doctor.

The old hag who was incredibly harsh to the player, when the Blood Moon arrived, she went insane and treated the Hunter as her child, searching for all sorts of sedatives to help him, but ultimately died outside.

Amelia, who was always devoted to Laurence; Eileen the Crow; Djura, the machine gun guy guarding Old Yharnam, and his friend Henryk.

Lady Maria, who participated in the Fishing Hamlet massacre against the Great One Kos and deeply regretted it, becoming a nurse to meticulously care for the sick, only for her patients to become experimental subjects of the Healing Church.

Master Willem, who was obsessed with Great One research in the early days and caused everything, but later opposed the Great One's blood and created the Byrgenwerth Spider to freeze Yharnam's time, forever stopping it before the Blood Moon's arrival, waiting for a Hunter who could end everything.

Ludwig, the Healing Church's First Hunter, wielding the Moonlight Greatsword, even when he was no longer human-like, upon seeing the Moonlight Greatsword, his past memories and glory returned: 'Oh… you were at my side all along. My true mentor… My guiding Moonlight…'

And when he is finally killed, if the player wears the Healing Church's attire, Ludwig will genuinely ask the Hunter: 'Ah, my glorious Church Hunter, tell me, have my Healing Church Hunters all become valiant, loyal, and brave warriors?'

If the answer is yes, Ludwig will die content, but if the Hunter tells him everything, Ludwig will let out a cry of agony and regret.

Besides these, there are many other memorable characters for players: Laurence, who launched expeditions and orchestrated the Fishing Hamlet tragedy to hunt Great Ones; the tragic Father's family…

Among them are NPCs and BOSSes.

But no matter what, behind each lies a wonderful, unforgettable, and poignant story.
