Chapter 220: Is This the Game We've Been Playing? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)

After watching this official Weibo post, the comment section beneath the video and the player community forum instantly erupted.

Countless players went mad reposting it and leaving comments to express their inner excitement.

"Tell me this isn't real! This has to be CGI animation!"

"So this was actually made in Minecraft?"

"Damn it! This is freaking awesome! If this is possible, does that mean other buildings could also be replicated in Minecraft?"

"I'm impressed! This feels nothing like the game I've been playing!"

"I suddenly want to go online and try it out—why wasn't this shown before the Early Access trial?"

"Exactly! I'm suddenly interested in this game again! I'm sure if this had been released before the trial, I definitely wouldn't have made the dark room!"

"Pfft, it's nothing special. Given a hundred years, we could build it too!"

"Please don't use the word 'we'—I'm pretty sure I couldn't build it at all!"

"All I can say is: Holy smokes!"

"Awesome, plain and simple! But this couldn't have been made by just one person, right?"

"Of course there were multiple people involved! If it were just one person, the workload would be insane. Didn't you see the fast-cut video at the end? Clearly, this was a collaboration!"

"The workload is massive and requires teamwork, but what about smaller-scale projects?"

"Is this still the pixel game I know? It looks better than some blockbusters!"

"Exactly!"

Although Minecraft itself is a pixel game, that doesn't mean it's ugly.

On the contrary, unlike in his previous life, Chen Xu's developed version of Minecraft did not cut corners in the art aspect.

There was no cost control involved—pixels were merely an art adjustment made specifically for the gameplay.

The modeling and lighting and shadows in the game were all top-tier.

When looking at a single block, it might be hard to appreciate this.

But when used to construct large structures and building complexes, that sense instantly emerges.

This left countless online players utterly shocked after watching the video.

In most people's minds, Minecraft was supposed to be just a simple block-building game, perhaps with survival elements added in.

These aspects had already been experienced during the earlier Early Access trial.

Nothing particularly surprising.

Although in that trial, some players had built relatively nice Regular small houses, it didn't bring much sense of shock or anticipation.

After all, the trial was too short to truly reveal the game's potential.

But this new wave of video content was completely different.

What on earth is this?!

They actually recreated Along the River During the Qingming Festival inside the game?!

Is this even the same game they knew?!

It wasn't just casual onlookers—game designers within the gaming industry were also stunned after seeing Minecraft's promotional video.

A block-building game can actually be like this?!

Chen Xu had already established a complete promotional model for Minecraft.

Everything before was merely warm-up promotion. Now, the real promotion for Minecraft had begun.

With players shocked and Nebula Games rolling out various promotional channels, many industry designers noticed Minecraft's popularity skyrocketing.

It quickly broke out of its niche and even climbed to the trending search list on the official Weibo account.

The Game Department's official account even reposted it that very day.

Not only did gaming media repost it, but numerous unrelated media outlets also shared it.

The view count of the promotional video surged rapidly, reaching 15 million views in just one day.

Before this, other games had broken out of their niches, but those cases had little to do with the games themselves.

But Minecraft was completely different.

The main focus of media coverage was the recreation of Along the River During the Qingming Festival within the game.

Centered on the entry point of promoting traditional culture, the key point was that this recreation was itself a core gameplay element of Minecraft.

As a result, even people who had never played the game knew about a game capable of recreating the thousand-year-old Along the River During the Qingming Festival.

This also sparked people's imagination—since Along the River During the Qingming Festival could be replicated, what about other buildings and scenes?

In fact, they didn't have to wait long.

Because just three days after the initial promotional video was released, Chen Xu uploaded another video on the official Weibo account.

This time, the scene showcased was the legendary Forbidden City.

Having already experienced the awe of Along the River During the Qingming Festival, players were even more excited this time.

They eagerly clicked into the video.

And what they saw didn't disappoint.

Raindrops fell from a gloomy sky, lightly hitting the Forbidden City's city walls.

The camera slowly moved toward the city gate, revealing tranquil forests and pavilions, magnificent and resplendent glazed roof tiles.

White jade stairs and nine-dragon reliefs, ponds and stone bridges in the backyard.

Red columns, golden glazed tiles...

One by one, these elements revealed to players just how extremely magnificent this structure looked within Minecraft.

The previous buzz around Along the River During the Qingming Festival hadn't even cooled down yet.

Now, the release of the 'Forbidden City' was like adding fuel to the fire.

It caused Minecraft's popularity to skyrocket instantly.

Every game designer in the entire gaming industry was dumbfounded.

Undoubtedly, this was Chen Xu's promotional method.

More importantly, this kind of promotion was something they couldn't possibly replicate.

Because it was a unique characteristic of Minecraft itself!

And with the added bonus of promoting traditional culture, it achieved a full-scale breakout.

Meng Zuo, who had been closely following Minecraft, finally understood what Chen Xu had meant earlier.

With a stunt like this, who could possibly compete with you in terms of popularity!?

Meanwhile, in the project office for Voyage, Zhu Yi found himself in a dilemma.

If he pushed forward, Minecraft's popularity was simply incredible.

Voyage's upcoming launch was completely overshadowed. Aside from the players who had been following it all along, it couldn't make any waves.

But if he pulled back, the embarrassment wasn't really the issue.

After all, if good sales were achieved, a little embarrassment didn't matter.

The real problem was that the promotion had already gone this far.

Withdrawing now would mean a huge loss, and subsequently, they wouldn't receive any decent recommendation resources.

"It's not necessarily doomed. Although Minecraft's recreation of Along the River During the Qingming Festival and the Forbidden City is indeed shocking, isn't it still just block-building gameplay? Relying solely on this one gameplay element, even if the current popularity is high, Voyage's content might still win!" Zhu Yi comforted himself internally.

However, three days later, when Chen Xu once again released a new video on the official Weibo account, his illusion was completely shattered.

Two updates first, the rest later.
