Chapter 284: RPG Maps and Tournaments (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Qin Yi stared blankly at the several different documents in front of him.

Regarding the Map Editor in Warcraft, Qin Yi and the others had a rough understanding.

During development, Chen Xu had instructed their team to reserve dedicated ports specifically for integrating the Map Editor later on.

But what exactly were these now?

"Maps like single-player campaigns?" Qin Yi and the others looked slightly confused, clearly failing to grasp the true meaning behind these maps.

"More or less. Think of them as large-scale levels within a casual single-player campaign," Chen Xu said with a smile.

As the Map Editor, how could players quickly discover its fun aspects?

The best method was for the official team to lead by example—throwing out a brick to attract jade.

For these maps, Chen Xu had selected ones with particularly distinctive features.

Mini-games, defense maps, RPG dungeon crawling maps, and entertaining casual maps—all had strong individual characteristics.

These maps were being released under the official banner, but early on, many more interesting maps would be needed. Therefore, Chen Xu planned to later personally release some classic maps from his previous life under the identity of an ordinary player.

Additionally, he would open relevant permissions, allowing other players to perform secondary modifications on these maps.

This would help compensate for the initial shortage of available maps.

"I've written down the key features of each map. The core focus lies in gameplay. You can handle the numerical design yourselves. Also, the Art team can add some models into the Map Editor for scene and Hero model replacements," Chen Xu explained to the group.

He had no intention of personally creating these maps from his previous life—simply making sure the core gameplay concepts were clearly conveyed was enough.

As for numerical balance, it wasn't necessary.

After all, player-created maps inherently lacked high balance.

Weak heroes might struggle to clear a level alone, while strong ones could do so easily.

Given Qin Yi and their team's abilities, managing the numerical aspects of these maps wouldn't be an issue.

Compared to strict balance adjustments, these maps leaned more toward entertainment.

Besides, this was also a good opportunity to train Qin Yi and the other three members.

"Then what about you, Mr. Chen?" Qin Yi scratched his head and instinctively asked.

"Me? I'll just watch you work," Chen Xu replied matter-of-factly.

Everyone: ???? 

……………………

Of course, Chen Xu wasn't completely idle while watching Qin Yi's team work.

He occasionally offered guidance.

After all, Qin Yi and the others had been fully involved in the creation of Warcraft's campaigns.

They weren't unfamiliar with developing map content. Moreover, Chen Xu had recently streamlined the Warcraft Map Editor.

While not entirely foolproof, the learning curve wasn't steep—especially for someone like Qin Yi. A brief period of familiarization was enough to eliminate any major issues.

Most of the time was spent designing heroes and adjusting level gameplay.

Particularly in these maps, the design of Hero Skills differed completely from standard versus matches, yet still had to loosely align with the Hero's established setting.

For example, in the map 'Defend the Sword Pass,' set in the Three Kingdoms era, you couldn't possibly design Lü Bu as a Healer, could you?

Fortunately, Chen Xu hadn't imposed strict standards on skill combinations, allowing the team to freely unleash their imagination.

If a skill proved too unbalanced and couldn't be controlled through numerical adjustments, they could simply turn it into a boss for players to fight.

After all, it made perfect sense for a boss to have slightly overpowered skills, didn't it?

Over the next few days, Chen Xu enjoyed a relatively relaxed schedule.

It was a rare period of rest.

Meanwhile, Lin Rou reported to Chen Xu about the event arrangements on Shark TV.

The relevant terms had been mostly finalized.

And it wasn't just Shark TV—several other domestic live streaming platforms had jointly organized this event.

The tournament was named: Golden Monthly Tournament.

Held once every month, the prize pool would be funded by Shark TV and several other major platforms, along with contributions from hardware sponsors.

It featured both 4v4 team matches and solo matches.

The 4v4 team match wasn't a free-for-all brawl, but rather an arena match format.

Each team sent four players, with each match following a Best of 3 (BO3) format.

The team tournament offered 150,000 for first place, 100,000 for second, and 40,000 for third, with decreasing amounts based on ranking. All teams advancing to the Elimination Round received prizes, though last-place teams only received a three-digit consolation prize.

As for the solo tournament, it spanned four weeks: Week 1 was the open qualifiers, Weeks 2 and 3 were Points Matches, followed by direct elimination into Winner's Bracket and Loser's Bracket based on points.

Group stage matches used Best of 2 (BO2), with 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw, and 0 for a loss.

The Elimination Round used Best of 5 (BO5), while semi-finals and finals used Best of 7 (BO7).

First place earned 50,000, second 30,000, and third 10,000.

The first tournament would use an open qualifier format.

Future tournaments would adopt a mixed model of invitations and open qualifiers.

All players with a Ladder Score of 2000 or above in Warcraft could register.

Additionally, the Shark TV platform had specifically requested a dedicated server from Nebula Games.

The participants for the inaugural Monthly Tournament had already been mostly selected.

However, whether in team or solo events, all participants were from newly established Warcraft divisions of various clubs.

This wasn't surprising—there was still a significant gap between ordinary players and high-level players compared to those who treated gaming as a profession.

For most players, gaming was a hobby, but for competitors, it was a career.

The competitors were mostly familiar faces from the RTS community, veterans transitioning from other RTS games into Warcraft.

Chen Xu even spotted several overseas players.

"Overseas players too? Are they competing with latency?" Chen Xu asked, slightly surprised.

Although network technology in this Parallel World was far more advanced than in his previous life, physical civilian network latency still existed across the Pacific.

"Although they're overseas players, they've joined domestic clubs. Also, Target Software mentioned that some overseas organizers want to obtain authorization for Warcraft tournaments to host their own events," Lin Rou explained to Chen Xu.

Chen Xu nodded silently, yet felt a sense of emotion. In the realm of esports tournaments, this Parallel World was far more professional than his previous life.

He had initially assumed events organized by platforms like Shark TV would be similar to internet cafe tournaments—but in reality, they were nothing like that.

They had professional commentators, dynamic camera switching, and even specialized tournament tools.

For example, viewers watching the stream could click a plugin on-screen to instantly view in-game unit types and attributes, without relying on the broadcaster's camera angle.

There were also dedicated analysts. The entire production felt incredibly polished. To verify this, Chen Xu looked up some famous RTS tournaments from previous years.

Although those RTS games had little popularity now, and Chen Xu had never played them,

just listening to the explanations allowed him to grasp the general idea clearly—without any confusion.

In this aspect, Chen Xu had to admit that the Parallel World was significantly more professional in organizing competitive events.

He believed that the strong preservation of the RTS genre in this world was closely tied to its mature esports ecosystem.
