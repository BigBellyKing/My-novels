Chapter 256: Something's Not Right! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

As a Solitary Longsword Hero, Song Ren was currently hunting alone.

Song Ren was still very fond of the Long Sword as a weapon.

Personally, he felt its strength was quite good.

The only major drawback was that when his companions Zhang Yi and Wang Han weren't around, he could only transform into a lonely Longsword Hero, wandering the New World.

He even occasionally saw distress signals posted by others, but after he joined, the other party would instantly faint (cart).

This dealt a severe blow to his fragile heart.

As he gathered materials from the Tobi-Kadachi, Song Ren sighed with great emotion, wondering who Long Sword players had offended.

Isn't it just that they're a bit cooler!

"But I feel the difficulty has increased a bit. For an average player, facing this Tobi-Kadachi would probably be quite challenging."

"Although it has some tricks, unfortunately, not many."

The Longsword Hero Song Ren thought to himself, looking at the Tobi-Kadachi on the ground in front of his computer.

Compared to previous monsters, this Tobi-Kadachi was indeed much harder to deal with.

The monsters before it generally posed no great threat.

But the Tobi-Kadachi was different.

Its speed was exceptionally fast, just like its name "Flying Thunder."

At the same time, its aggressive intent was far stronger than previous monsters.

With its two-stage bite and various pounces, it could also climb trees. When attacking the Tobi-Kadachi's tail, it would leap up and release electricity through its tail to attack.

This damage was quite a bit higher. Also, compared to previous monsters, even though the Tobi-Kadachi wasn't very large, it was like it had ADHD. Fortunately, his weapon was a Long Sword, which wasn't too sluggish in comparison.

"If Old Zhang's Great Sword had to face this guy, he'd probably get beaten senseless." Thinking of the Great Sword's sluggish movements and the Tobi-Kadachi's agile figure, Song Ren couldn't help but chuckle.

"Sure enough, the Long Sword is number one!" Song Ren once again hyped up his weapon, the Long Sword.

After gathering materials, Song Ren returned to Astera Base and entered the Workshop on the second floor.

There weren't many things he could enhance, mainly just his weapon.

He could also enhance the helmet on his head.

As for other things, he hadn't really farmed materials much so far, mainly focusing on advancing the main quest.

Moreover, he felt that equipment didn't seem very important; just enhancing the weapon's attack power would do. After all, it was too hard to die in this game.

Mixing honey with potions to create a Mega Potion – the mixing in the game, which is essentially crafting, he still didn't quite understand.

However, he felt it didn't seem to have a huge effect anyway; as long as he had Mega Potions, it was fine. He'd study it when he got beaten.

Song Ren, full of confidence, walked towards the Research Team Leader, ready to accept the next quest.

This was a confidence stemming from deep within.

Especially after just dealing with the troublesome Tobi-Kadachi in his first encounter.

Song Ren's confidence soared even higher!

And this kind of confidence was different from the one he had after first defeating Gundyr the Ash in Dark Souls.

This time, his confidence was built upon countless BOSSes he had defeated.

Great Jagras, Kulu-Ya-Ku, Pukei-Pukei, Barroth, Jyuratodus, Tobi-Kadachi – so many BOSSes had already fallen before his Longsword Hero.

He had mastered the three-hit Spirit Gauge State, learned the Helm Breaker, and while his Foresight Slash wasn't yet perfected, it was only a matter of time.

He had also discovered a small trick for the Long Sword: when using slopes, he could quickly enter Spirit Gauge State with a jumping slash.

Having learned even such a small trick, Song Ren felt that only three words could describe him now.

Powerful, invincible!

"Anjanath, the brute of the forest? Isn't that the Tyrannosaurus Rex-like monster that swallowed the Great Jagras earlier?"

Looking at the accepted quest objective, Song Ren suddenly remembered.

At the start, the receptionist and he were attacked by a Great Jagras.

Then the Anjanath suddenly appeared and swallowed the Great Jagras whole.

Fortunately, the Research Team Leader appeared in time and drove away the Anjanath.

"Isn't this a coincidence? Although you swallowed that Great Jagras back then, which somewhat resolved my crisis, I'm sorry, I'm a hunter, I'm the future Azure Star, so you can only fall before my blade. But I'll give you a swift end then." Song Ren said, brimming with confidence.

Glancing at the bullet comments, Song Ren smiled.

Filled with strong confidence, Song Ren went to the dining area, to the bun-haired receptionist.

"Why does this bun-haired girl never come with me, always sitting here eating? Has the story not progressed enough? My NPC teammates haven't even appeared yet."

Looking at the receptionist holding a chicken leg, Song Ren also felt a bit strange.

However, he didn't dwell on it.

If he's alone, he's alone; it's not like he can't manage.

One person, one Long Sword, to become the legendary Azure Star!

"But I feel these fellow hunters are always slacking off!" After eating a Felyne Canteen meal, Song Ren scratched his head.

He wouldn't even mention the First Fleet's researchers, those scholars who studied ecology and plants, as they were intellectuals after all.

But what about the others?

The seemingly formidable Palicos were cooking in the canteen, the Commander-in-Chief was always in meetings and never seen in action, and the equally formidable Big Bro of the First Fleet was constantly eating with the receptionist on the third floor of the canteen, his mouth never stopping.

The Second Fleet consisted entirely of craftsmen, and the Fourth Fleet was responsible for logistics, never bringing back anything good, yet always claiming they had brought back decent items.

Song Ren felt that the things he took from Astera Base were much more valuable than what he brought back.

As for the Third Fleet, he only heard their name but never saw them, not knowing where they were.

As for the Fifth Fleet, so far, besides himself and the receptionist, the Mohawk-haired guy and his female teammate had only been seen twice in total, and none were present when executing quests.

After a slight inward grumble, Song Ren, full of confidence, began a new quest.

After entering the outdoor map, it was pretty much the same as before.

Players needed to search for traces of the Anjanath themselves and then determine its location.

Soon, following some clues on the map, Song Ren arrived near the Anjanath with the help of Scoutflies.

A cutscene was immediately triggered.

The Anjanath, resembling a Tyrannosaurus Rex, was feeding on a dead Great Jagras. Its powerful limbs, though not covered in scales like the previous Barroth, had a different kind of impact.

Watching the Anjanath feed, the hunter in the game carefully approached, then used an item to create a sound, luring the Anjanath over. While the Anjanath was distracted, the hunter used a crossbow to shoot and break the vine holding a giant boulder tied to the Anjanath's head.

With a roar, debris flew, and the Anjanath stood up from the pile of rocks completely unharmed, then stared intently at the hunter in the game.

At the same time, the game's UI interface appeared, and the character could now be controlled.

"It's so big, even bigger than the Barroth!"

Song Ren couldn't help but exclaim.

The Anjanath before him, from a visual standpoint, was absolutely impactful.

Just its thick thighs were bigger than the hunter in the game.

"Come on, in a narrow path, the brave win, whoever runs is a coward!" Song Ren swung his Long Sword and attacked.

Hunting a dragon means finding its weak spot first; this was a small trick he had learned so far.

'-8, -11'

Two consecutive slashes landed on the Anjanath's toes, showing two meager white damage numbers.

Then one slash hit its tail, and only then did a -24 orange damage number appear.

"As expected, large BOSSes are always 'big body, weak butt'! I'll attack the tail from behind first!" Song Ren muttered, as he crept towards the Anjanath's rear.

But the next moment, Song Ren saw the Anjanath's thick tail suddenly lift, then slam down towards him.

The tail attack, carrying a wind pressure effect, slammed heavily onto Song Ren.

His health bar immediately dropped by about one-sixth, and then the Anjanath spun around again, smashing its head towards him.

Song Ren, who had just gotten up, was sent flying before he could even react.

"Damn it, that health bar!"

Song Ren's eyes suddenly widened.

Because he saw his health bar in the top left corner; it was instantly halved.

One tail whip, one bite, and his health bar was halved!?

Song Ren immediately rolled twice to create distance. Fortunately, his Palico's skill triggered at this moment, bringing a honey bug from somewhere and refilling his health.

"Something's not right! This Anjanath is a bit off, damn it, why is its attack so high!?"

Thinking of the health bar that had just been halved, a ominous feeling arose in Song Ren's heart.

He seemed to have experienced such a bleeding status in another game before.
