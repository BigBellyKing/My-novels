Chapter 318 Level-based Cinematic Game (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

On New Year's side, players were still discussing how Nebula Games had suffered an explosive loss.

Although various little green bars meant Chen Xu's hands were barely keeping up.

After all, players had far too many pockets.

Yet, even as players verbally claimed Nebula Games had suffered massive losses,

there still needed to be at least some actual losses.

After all, he was a man of integrity—everything about him was fine, except that he was extremely honest and never lied.

Thus, on the official Weibo account, Chen Xu launched a daily gacha pull event.

Rainbow Six Siege, Warcraft, and some cash red envelopes led to very frequent interaction with players.

After all, these things were merely trivial to Chen Xu now.

Besides, the wool ultimately came from Hex himself.

Opening the work group chat, Chen Xu sent a few red envelopes, casually chatting with Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue about some amusing stories.

At that moment, his phone rang.

Picking it up, Chen Xu was slightly taken aback.

The caller was Yang Chen, the Minister of the Game Department.

"Happy New Year, Minister Yang," Chen Xu answered with a smile.

"Happy New Year, Mr. Chen," Yang Chen replied cheerfully.

After some small talk, Yang Chen paused slightly before continuing, "Mr. Chen, do you still remember participating in the VR testing two years ago?"

"Of course. Is there a new policy from the Game Department?" Chen Xu responded with a nod.

"Nothing specific there, but the new version VR will launch globally after the New Year—not only the domestic new version VR, but also the latest generation VR developed overseas will be released," Yang Chen paused and continued.

"So, Mr. Chen, if your development plan after the New Year hasn't been finalized yet, you might want to consider VR. Rainbow Six Siege performed exceptionally well, and as one of the first games to support the new version VR, the relevant departments will open up resources for use," Yang Chen from the Game Department told Chen Xu.

"I've already sent specific details to your game editor backend. You can review them in detail yourself."

Chen Xu replied, "Alright, Minister Yang, I understand. I'll look into it."

After chatting a bit more with the other party, Chen Xu opened his computer to learn more.

Regarding the new generation VR technology, Chen Xu had already learned about it while developing Silent Hill PT. The related experience and game support were significantly stronger than the current stage.

Especially when combined with the resources opened by the Game Department, it could deliver a far more immersive experience.

Likewise, the launch of the new version VR also meant seizing market share.

Overseas, the latest VR was also being released, and domestically, the launch of VR meant both sides were essentially competing for market standard discourse power.

And what determined this was naturally games.

As for whether the new version VR would fail to sell due to low device market share,

this wasn't something to worry too much about.

After all, game compatibility in this Parallel World was much more convenient than in his previous life.

Moreover, with a unified structure, while developing for the new version VR, the old version VR could still be supported, though the sense of immersion might not be as strong.

Players who purchased the new version VR would almost all buy games released for it.

After all, they had no other choice. If you weren't going to buy games for the new VR, why would you buy the new VR at all?

Could it be just to replay old games?

At first glance, this seemed like safeguarding the new version VR, but in reality, it was also an opportunity.

Because eventually, the new version VR would inevitably phase out the old version VR. Likewise, in terms of the game editor engine, supporting new version VR development technology would allow Nebula Games to stay ahead of other game developers.

This was clearly the benefit derived from previously participating in the new version VR testing and projects like Rainbow Six Siege.

The day after the Game Department communicated with Chen Xu, Meng Zuo also called, discussing this matter with Chen Xu.

Of course, the other party represented NetDragon.

According to NetDragon's intention, they didn't plan to develop a new game but instead focused their efforts on the project Rainbow Six Siege.

Although the child wasn't biologically theirs and had no blood relation, custody rights still belonged half to NetDragon—by treating it well, it could later support NetDragon.

Thus, on this matter, NetDragon reached an agreement with Chen Xu.



They would take charge of the PC version development and the new version VR development of Rainbow Six Siege, while Nebula Games would simply split and cover the porting costs based on development expenses.

As for the new version VR, NetDragon wouldn't enter this space in the first quarter.

Of course, Chen Xu hadn't intended to bring NetDragon along in this venture anyway.

………

Time progressed day by day, and the seventh day of the Lunar New Year marked the first official workday.

Most employees across various departments of Nebula Games had already returned to their posts.

Meanwhile, online rumors about the new version VR had already begun to surface.

Initially, news came from overseas—announcing that the new version VR named Zeus would soon launch.

Domestically, preparations were clearly complete as well, and less than a day later, the latest VR named Huanyu was also announced.

Initially, both sides mainly promoted the performance parameters and various features of the new version VR.

Essentially, they were making grand promises.

Until overseas made the first move—renowned game developer Atari announced its new work would launch on Zeus.

Moreover, Atrai stated that the new work would be a film-adapted IP game based on the blockbuster 'Storm Action' that had gained immense popularity a few years prior.

At that time, the film 'Storm Action' had become a global sensation, grossing a massive 800 million USD in worldwide box office.

Meanwhile, the domestic Channel Alliance also announced it had reached a strategic cooperation goal with Atrai and would act as the publishing agent for this game.

Clearly, the target was directly aimed at Rainbow Six Siege, developed by Nebula Games and NetDragon before the New Year.

As for TengHua, they didn't get involved this time.

After all, unless TengHua had their heads squeezed by a door, they would definitely stand with the Game Department in the battle between Zeus and Huanyu's New Era VR.

But the Channel Alliance? They didn't care. Aside from channel providers like Hero Entertainment that had their own R&D departments, the rest were purely focused on publishing and distribution.

Huanyu and Zeus had nothing to do with them.

As for ordinary players, they were the most straightforward group.

Whichever platform had good games, they would support that platform.

For a time, players both overseas and domestically were discussing topics related to 'Storm Action' and Atrai.

Likewise, within Nebula Games, everyone was also talking about it.

"Atrai is truly wealthy and generous! They directly bought such a massive IP!" Ruan Ningxue sighed with emotion after reading the news.

"Yeah, I rewatched that movie recently. It wasn't deep, but it was so thrilling to watch!" Yang Xin agreed.

"Adapting it into a VR game would definitely be explosive!" Qin Yi also expressed some excitement.

Chen Xu, walking over and hearing the entire conversation, smiled: "Not necessarily. Actually, whether it's manga-adapted games or film-adapted games, they sometimes fall into an awkward situation."

"Adapting an IP is ultimately for the fanbase of the original work, but films and games are inherently two different mediums," Chen Xu said with a smile.

Film adaptations into games, or games into films—sounded very plausible.

Yet, in his previous life, there were already many bloody examples laid out.

Only the Resident Evil series could be considered truly successful, but even that was changed so much that it was unrecognizable.

Following the film's narrative, how could a two-hour movie be expanded into a main quest lasting over ten or even twenty hours?

Endless mobs, complicated mazes, missions as tedious as helping Grandma cross the street?

If done this way, players would mercilessly leave negative reviews.

Similarly, adapting games into films faced the same issue—how to compress a ten- or twenty-hour gameplay into a one- or two-hour film?

Compared to film adaptations, novels—which lacked visual comparison—were clearly more suitable.

Or purely fan-service-oriented manga and anime-themed games that didn't change at all.

"Moreover, how could adapting an existing IP ever be as exciting as creating your own IP?" Chen Xu smiled and said, "Notify all departments. Prepare for a meeting this afternoon. We're starting a new project."

"A new project!?" Hearing this, Qin Yi and others instantly became excited.

"What is it, Mr. Chen!?" Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin looked at Chen Xu with eager anticipation.

"Atrai is doing a film adaptation into a game, and it's a special forces theme. Let's make one too. A level-based cinematic game. The theme? Modern Warfare and special forces theme would be perfect," Chen Xu said, stretching lazily.
