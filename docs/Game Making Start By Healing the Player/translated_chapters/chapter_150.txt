Chapter 149: While Others Play *It Takes Two*, We're Sword Fighting (Fifth Update, Please Subscribe for Monthly Passes)

There were quite a few lone wolf players just like Song Ren.

Originally, many players had some interest in *It Takes Two*, but due to the high threshold of requiring two players, they chose to wait and see for now.

But soon, they discovered something—whether on live streaming platforms, video platforms, or within the player community—this game was completely different from Chen Xu's *Overcooked* released last year.

First, there was the game's scale.

With its cartoon art style and two-player co-op gameplay, these two elements combined easily led players to assume it was an Independent Game or a low-budget production.

Yet *It Takes Two* was entirely different. In terms of content and scale, it was on par with some blockbuster titles.

Even more crucially, everything shown in the promotional trailer Chen Xu had previously released wasn’t just hype—it actually appeared in the game.

Different scenes paired with unique special abilities, along with cinematic animations throughout the gameplay, made players feel as if they were watching an interactive movie.

In terms of player experience, it contrasted sharply with *Overcooked* from last year, where players started out cheerful, gradually became Hyped Up, and eventually ended in arguments that turned 'cooking chaos' into 'breakup chaos'.

The content showcased by *It Takes Two* so far was far too heartwarming.

This was primarily due to the game's design.

*Overcooked* focused purely on cooperation and tacit understanding.

When cooperation failed and players' timing didn’t align, it naturally led to blame. If one couldn’t self-**counter**, it inevitably escalated into arguments.

But *It Takes Two* was completely different.

This game featured puzzle-solving and skill-based **operations** as well. If both players were clumsy, then it was a case of the pot calling the kettle black—everyone laughed together while playing.

And if one player was more skilled while the other struggled, the **Split-screen** mode allowed both to clearly see where the problem lay.

Unlike in *Overcooked*, where everyone thought they were right and the other was wrong, here the issue was transparent.

Once the problem was identified, players could patiently guide each other, deepening their emotional bonds, friendship, and connection.

Additionally, the game's **story** and **Level Design** were excellent at evoking emotions and facilitating **conflict** resolution.

Even the Book of Love in the game, which specialized in **instigating**, attracted a lot of player attention. In a way, it diverted focus away from interpersonal tension.

With a shared goal, arguments became rare, replaced instead by true teamwork.

After the game **launched**, especially on various live streaming platforms, many streamers—facing a game drought—paired up to play *It Takes Two*.

The entertaining and joyful atmosphere drew in many players who originally hadn’t planned to buy the game, making them unable to resist spending money.

But how were lone wolf players supposed to find teammates?

Naturally, they had to frequent major game forums and communities to search.

Soon, forums were flooded with similar friendship-seeking posts:

'Looking for a friend who can play long-term, preferably with a good temper, to play *It Takes Two* together!'

'Seeking a buddy, gender doesn’t matter, good temper and long online hours preferred. I’ll provide the game, you bring the player?'

'I’ll provide the game, you bring the player. Let’s enjoy *It Takes Two* this weekend. DM me if interested!'

Many players had previously been unable to experience this game simply because they were alone.

But lured by the game’s appeal, they began searching for partners.

And in doing so, many realized they weren’t the only ones feeling isolated.

There were numerous other players with similar experiences, also forced to play alone due to various reasons.

In that moment, many players who had previously felt **lonely** realized they weren’t so alone after all.

If there was one thing that felt off to them,

it was that on community forums, players who had experienced *It Takes Two* and were raving about it were all **in pairs**—either couples or romantic partners.

But when they looked back at their own team-seeking peers, it was uniformly **Real Man** after **Real Man**.

While others were **in pairs** playing *It Takes Two*, why had it turned into 'Male Bonding Takes Two' with mutual sword fighting for them?

………………

But whether it was *It Takes Two* or *Male Bonding Takes Two*,

one thing was certain:

After experiencing the game, players were completely amazed by its **Level Design**.

Especially as the **story** progressed, the game’s content proved incredibly rich.

Beyond the various **mini-games**, the gameplay was presented in many other creative ways.

Each theme came with its own **Special Item**.

For example, after transitioning from the Greatwood level into a room, May and Cody were captured by a space ape and taken to a space-themed scene.

There, the two gained new items.

May obtained **Shoes** that defied gravity, while Cody received a belt that allowed him to grow in size.

Using these two new items, the space-themed level delivered a strange, dreamlike experience akin to teleportation through time and space.

However, from this point on, the game’s narrative finally reached an intense **conflict**.

Cody and May, having transformed from humans into dolls, naturally found it difficult to accept.

Originally, they wanted to ask their daughter how they could return to normal.

But they discovered their daughter seemed completely unable to hear or see them.

Cody believed they had been struck by **Magic (attack type)**, transformed into dolls by their daughter Rose’s tears.

Therefore, if they could make Rose cry again, they might turn back into humans.

This was also why Cody and May were obstructed by the space ape.

A line from the space ape left a deep impression on players—'You’ll only make her cry!'

To further strengthen his point, the space ape even pulled out a tape recorder.

To make Rose cry, Cody and May quickly agreed on a plan: head to their daughter’s toy **castle** and destroy her favorite toys, making her cry from sorrow.

"How could parents do such a thing? That's too much!" Wang Han said, watching the scene after returning home from eating hotpot and continuing to play *It Takes Two*.

Destroying their daughter’s cherished toys to make her cry, combined with the space ape’s earlier behavior, was deeply ironic.

"But from a story perspective, it's somewhat understandable," Zhang Yi scratched his head. "After all, they turned from humans into dolls, and their daughter doesn’t react to them at all."

"That's true," Wang Han nodded thoughtfully.

"But more importantly, it's about communication. It reminds me of when I was a kid—my mom sold all my card collection as scrap, and I cried for ages!" Zhang Yi sighed with emotion.

"You had it rough. My childhood was happy—my parents never threw away my toys," Wang Han said with a triumphant smile.

"That's the importance of communication and mutual understanding!" Zhang Yi said.

"Absolutely," Wang Han agreed.

"So promise me—you’ll never throw away my figurines and models, okay?" Zhang Yi grinned.

Wang Han: …………

So that’s what this was leading to!

"Oh, come on! When have I ever thrown away your figurines? I even bought the glass display cabinet for you!" Wang Han replied irritably.

"Hehe, come on, let’s focus on beating this level. Watch the story, watch the story!" Zhang Yi quickly laughed and changed the subject.

Two updates first, two more before midnight
