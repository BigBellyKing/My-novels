Chapter 425: Run, Ganon, Link is Here! (Please subscribe for monthly passes)

Of course, the idea is wonderful, but reality is often harsh.

Some emotional players, after learning Princess Zelda's backstory, were filled with fervor. They couldn't wait to rush into the castle and tear Ganon limb from limb.

However, as they played, many players found their resolve to rescue the princess slowly wavering.

“It's not that I, Link, don't want to save the princess; it's just that I need to be fully prepared!”

“When fighting Ganon, to prevent interference from the four Divine Beasts under his control, shouldn't I first go and free them?”

“Alright, the four Divine Beasts are freed. But look, I don't have a suitable weapon on hand, so I should go get the Master Sword, right?”

“But here's the problem: although getting the Master Sword requires 13 hearts, what if that's not enough? After all, I just woke up from the Shrine of Resurrection and lost my former strength and memories, so I, Link, still need to be careful.”

“First, I'll clear all 120 shrines, gather enough health and stamina, and then go.”

“The Master Sword is successfully drawn, but Ganon is powerful. Though the Master Sword is mighty, we'll need all sorts of weapons to counter him, so I should prepare some backup weapons, shouldn't I?”

“Besides, carrying so many weapons means I can't fit them all, so I'll need to find Koroks to Expand Inventory Slots, right?”

“Even though it seems like just over 400 will fill all my inventory slots, what if Hestu is lying to me? So, just in case, I should collect all the Koroks.”

“Also, I have amnesia now, so I don't know the situation inside the castle, nor how strong Ganon truly is. Even ordinary weapons might not be useless, so I still need to collect them. After all, Small Details Make a Big Difference, and saving the world leaves no room for carelessness!”

“Once all this is done, it seems there are still quite a few unexplored areas on the map.”

“I definitely need to explore those, right?”

“After all, what if there's some hidden equipment or items that could help me better deal with Ganon?”

“After all this is taken care of, I'll also need to prepare more food, as Ganon is no ordinary BOSS.”

“Furthermore, if I can't beat him, I need a way to preserve my life, so a good horse is also essential. After all, I, Link, am Hyrule's last hope. If I die, the world truly is beyond saving.”

“Finally, once everything is prepared, I still need to hone my skills. Things like Flying Thunder God, Wind Bomb, and Link Time, all need practice.”

Old King: “The resources, skills, and map are all complete. Link, can you go save my daughter Zelda now?”

Link: “Zelda? Who's Zelda?”

Of course, this is all just a joke and teasing.

It's been a while since The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild launched.

Many players have already defeated Ganon and completed their First Clear.

However, even after defeating Ganon, it doesn't mean there's nothing left to play in the game.

For players who have defeated Ganon, there's actually a lot of unexplored content left on the map.

Let's not even talk about collectibles like Koroks. Many players haven't fully explored the 120 shrines, various side quests, and the rich and diverse interactive gameplay within the game.

During this time, more and more players weren't just content with exploration anymore.

They began to discover all sorts of Impressive Tricks and gameplay styles.

For instance, on the railroad tracks south of the volcano in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, there are two Minecarts. Using Link's Magnesis power in the game, players carefully position and stack these two Minecarts together.

Then, they can control the other Minecart, which is not under their feet, and fly through the sky.

Of course, the force cannot be too strong, otherwise, the Minecarts can easily fall apart.

There are also ways to use lightning elemental properties and Chuchu Jelly to take down the Guardians in various shrines.

Furthermore, out in the wilderness, you often encounter the Yiga Clan. These Yiga Clan members disguise themselves as ordinary Hyrule civilians, seeking Link's help.

Upon approaching them, a cutscene triggers where they jump backward a certain distance.

But before that, by effectively using the Stasis ability and predicting where they will land, you can launch a pre-emptive strike, which is quite entertaining.

The comments section below these videos is filled with players' laughter.

“23333333, Newton's coffin lid has been firmly shut, this is completely unscientific!”

“Holy cow, you can clear shrines like this?! Hyrule's Old Rogue!”

“You can even predict like that? Selling this game for 300 Yuan, Mr. Chen must be losing a fortune!”

Of course, besides these playful and entertaining videos,

many players also began speed-killing monsters. The targets, much like Nergigante in Monster Hunter: World, have become a unit of measurement for Lynels across the land of Hyrule.

Various dazzling Link Times and rush attacks made countless players exclaim that this was completely different from how they played.

Beyond that, there are also slightly more complex small tricks.

In one video, Link placed a bomb on the cliff edge, then jumped forward.

The moment he jumped, he used his bow to enter Link Time, then switched to another bomb, threw it, and then switched back to the bomb he had previously placed to detonate it.

With the explosion of the bomb and the loss of one heart of health, the blast wave sent the player-controlled Link soaring into the distance like a rocket.

In mid-air, Link opened his paraglider, slowly drifting towards the central Hyrule Castle on the map.

This is the Wind Bomb in the game. It is said that once Link masters this technique, he will never walk on the ground again, provided conditions allow.

And that's not all; in the latter half of the video, this player demonstrated another trick.

Standing on a high platform, facing a small monster frozen by ice elemental power below, Link performed a Shield Front Flip. The moment he landed, he Shield Surfed, then drew his bow, entered Link Time, and then with a 'ding' sound, Link in the game instantly flew into the sky.

From all sorts of Impressive Tricks to monster speed-kills and practical small techniques, then something even more exaggerated arrived.

That is, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild speedruns!

Although in the game, Chen Xu retained some benign bugs from his previous life,

some bugs were still fixed, such as clipping through walls to enter shrines.

The initial trick of clipping through walls from the Shrine of Resurrection to enter the snowy mountains will no longer happen.

However, even so, with Chen Xu retaining Link Time Shield Surfing and Wind Bomb,

most shrines and Traveling can save a significant amount of time.

Shrine Puzzles?

Who has time to slowly solve Shrine Puzzles with you? Just use Wind Bomb for a Bomb Jump, soaring over obstacles from high altitudes to reach the finish line.

Traveling? Who's Traveling with you?

Enemy Step Shield Jump, head straight for Hyrule Castle from the start! I can't wait a moment to save Zelda!

Watching these increasingly outlandish speedrun videos, with times still being cut down, many Zelda players who were still hunting, Fishing with Bombs, and Catching Grasshoppers were utterly stunned.

“Run, Ganon! Link is here!”

“Watching these Link maneuvers, I genuinely couldn't understand how such a powerful Link lost to Ganon 100 years ago.”

“The Old King has a saying: 'Link, were you Putting on an Act for me 100 years ago?'”

Amidst this laughter, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's sales continued to climb.

Because there's just so much content in the game.

If you want casual gameplay, there's casual gameplay. If you want hardcore gameplay, there's hardcore gameplay.

Even if many people have already played The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for dozens or even hundreds of hours, and have defeated Ganon twice,

they will still find that there's plenty of content in the game waiting for them to discover.
