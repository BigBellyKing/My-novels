Chapter 786: The Legend of the Chicken God

Regarding the content of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, even though only an official website and some simple text and image materials were released, for players, it felt like the New Year. Major communities and forums were all discussing the game's content.

Most of the discussions focused on one point: what kind of game The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim would lean towards. After all, with Red Dead Redemption, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and industry giants like Zeus venturing into open-world games, this genre had basically been segmented into three categories.

The first category consists of open-world games with strong narratives and rich backgrounds, like Red Dead Redemption and The Witcher: Wild Hunt. The second category features open-world games focused on strong exploration, akin to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The third, and currently most common, approach chosen by many game developers is the formulaic one: large-scale maps combined with multiple strongholds and side quests, creating a so-called sense of openness. Although criticized by many players, it undeniably holds significant market appeal. As long as the grind-heavy content isn't too outlandish, coupled with excellent art and scene design, many players are still willing to buy into it. The content is also easier to produce compared to the first two categories, making this formulaic open world a preferred choice for most game developers.

When it came to Nebula Games, many players hadn't considered that this game, named The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, would be a formulaic open world. After all, Chen Xu had directly announced its open-world nature in the promotion. If it were a formulaic open world, it would undoubtedly be a significant blow to Nebula Games' reputation. For the current Nebula Games, the profits gained from damaging its reputation through false advertising would be completely disproportionate to what it would lose.

But then the question arose: with Red Dead Redemption, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and The Witcher: Wild Hunt as precedents, could The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim still reach the heights of its predecessors? Online, players were in a frenzy: some believed The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim wouldn't be a typical open world, some remained calm and lowered their expectations, and some were pessimistic.

However, compared to the heated online discussions and investigations about The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Chen Xu and his team at Nebula Games weren't paying too much attention. This was because the entire team was accelerating the development of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's content.

“Mr. Chen, this chicken?” Inside the team, Qin Yi, who was reviewing and calibrating a numerical setting, looked a little confused. “In the scene design for Riverwood, this chicken triggers a bounty, but in the storyline, Riverwood doesn't have guards.” Qin Yi said to Chen Xu.

“Ah, that. It’s mainly to enhance the player’s sense of immersion. In the world of Skyrim, if you commit a crime, you must pay the appropriate price. And aren’t the villagers making a cameo?” Seeing where Qin Yi pointed, Chen Xu offered a slight smile.

Of course, that was one reason. Another reason was that Chen Xu felt it would be too much of a shame to omit this chicken. In his previous life, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim had a widely known meme among players. This meme even transcended The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim itself. It was the great Chicken God of Riverwood. As everyone knows, in addition to their daily worship of the capricious Daedra, the residents of Skyrim secretly worshipped the “Chicken God,” and a god must not be blasphemed, or the consequences would be severe. Manifestations of the ‘Chicken God’ were located throughout Skyrim. But the most well-known manifestation was in Riverwood.

Here, people madly worshipped the Chicken God, and anyone who committed an act of disrespect would be hunted to the ends of the earth. Well, that joke was, of course, just a joke. As Qin Yi said. The origin of this meme was actually due to a scene design flaw in the previous life's The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It wasn't a “bug” as players imagined, but rather an oversight in the map design. In The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, killing an NPC or stealing an NPC’s belongings would incur a certain amount of bounty. And the bounties in each region were independent; for example, if you committed a crime in City A, you’d be a free person again in City B, because it wasn’t under the jurisdiction of the same Jarl. If you wanted to clear your bounty, you either went to jail or paid a fine to the local guards.

Riverwood was a small town subordinate to Whiterun, and it was also likely the first starter village players would encounter after leaving Helgen. However, in this starter village, in his previous life, it was unknown whether the development team did it intentionally or by mistake. There were no guards in this small town, though it made perfect sense according to the lore. That is, because Riverwood was close to the Falkreath region, and for fear that Falkreath’s Steward, Nenya, might overthink things, Jarl Balgruuf did not send guards to Riverwood until news of dragons emerged, at which point guards were finally dispatched. The lore explanation was consistent, but the map design was different, because during this period, if players committed a crime, there was no way to pay a fine for atonement or go to jail.

The key was that at the entrance of Riverwood, there was a large rooster strutting back and forth. It was so conspicuous, its gait so arrogant. So much so that many players, upon seeing this chicken, couldn't resist the urge to mischievously kill it. And that's when a huge problem arose. Players incurred a bounty, but had no way to atone for it, so they would face a swarm of angry villagers. Many players' first death wasn't at the hands of giants, Daedra, or dragons. Instead, it was because of a seemingly harmless chicken that they lost their first life.

So, despite having modified most of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim’s content and corrected some flaws, Chen Xu still retained the ‘Chicken God’ setting in Riverwood. Of course, it couldn’t be kept as crudely as in his previous life, as that would leave players completely bewildered.

Here, Chen Xu also provided a process: Ralof, who accompanies the Dragonborn to Riverwood, would offer reminders through dialogue, and also give a friendly warning upon reaching the village entrance of Riverwood. If, at this point, the player stubbornly attacks the chicken, the villagers in the game will act as temporary guards and demand compensation from the Dragonborn for killing the chicken. It wouldn’t be a heavy compensation, as players would have collected some coins during their escape from Helgen Keep. Of course, if they didn’t have any money or were reluctant to part with it, then players would experience the iron fist of the rural villagers.

A Dragonborn’s life, if they never died because of a chicken, would be a life of regret, and could not be called a legend.
