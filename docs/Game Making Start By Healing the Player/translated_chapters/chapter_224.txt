Chapter 223: Are You the Insightful Ones? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Before entering the game, new players still needed to customize their characters. However, Zhang Yi had already played the Early Access trial after New Year's Day, so his character was already created. He simply loaded his previous save file. His luck was good; someone had just left the server, so after waiting for about ten seconds, the game screen went dark, and he entered. As the game screen appeared on his monitor, Zhang Yi was first startled by the overwhelming crowd before him.

There were simply too many players, all sorts of them with diverse appearances and outfits, floating in the air with chaotic IDs above their heads. Zhang Yi felt a bit overwhelmed, so he went into the options and hid the IDs above the players' heads. He immediately felt much better.

"Old Zhang, you're here!" "This is absolutely awesome! Perfect, I'll take you on a tour from the beginning." Song Ren and Wang Han's voices came through the voice channel. At the same time, in the game, Zhang Yi saw their characters appear beside him. In the tour server open to players, there was no physical collision volume between any players, and they could freely fly as in Creative Mode, including inputting specific commands to adjust their flight speed.

"If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't believe it! This Firelink Shrine is absolutely identical!" Hearing Song Ren's words, Zhang Yi now noticed his location. At first, he hadn't quite registered it. But looking closely now, goodness, wasn't this the Firelink Shrine from *Dark Souls*? Of course, not the open-air one from the Age of First Fire, but the one from the end of the Age of Fire. Almost everything was perfectly recreated! There was even a bonfire, and next to it, the Fire Keeper, rendered as a block character, was also present! The Crestfallen Warrior sat on the steps, along with Ludleth, who had lost his legs, and the Shrine Handmaid and Blacksmith.

"Right? We were shocked when we first came in too!" Song Ren said with a sigh. "Who would believe this thing is a pixel game!" Wang Yifan also exclaimed. At the same time, many players in the Firelink Shrine were excitedly discussing the current Firelink Shrine through the game's public voice chat.

"By the way, have you guys finished your tour?" Zhang Yi asked. "Not yet, we only saw the 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' map. You came online before we finished, so it's perfect; we can take you along." Wang Han said. "Let's go, then!" Zhang Yi was a bit impatient. He also knew how to tour, as there was a line of floating instructions in the sky.

Arriving at the bonfire in the central area, they ignored the group of players surrounding the Fire Keeper. In *Dark Souls*, it was understandable that people wanted to view the Fire Keeper from various angles; after all, he'd seen it himself, and she was incredibly beautiful. But in *Minecraft*, facing a pixelated block character, for all you players to still want to sneak a peek at the Fire Keeper from special angles—are you even human?! They approached the bonfire to trigger the teleportation, and after a brief black screen, Zhang Yi's display showed the next scene.

Zhang Yi finally saw that dreamlike scene. He spawned directly on the streets of Bianliang. Around him, NPCs wore special ancient-style clothing, while the other block characters were clearly normal players. In the bottom-left chat box, messages were scrolling frantically. At this moment, Zhang Yi's eyes widened as he gazed at the pixelated version of the thousand-year-old prosperous scenery. Bustling markets, taverns, painted pleasure boats, pavilions, merchants and tourists filling the streets and alleys. It made Zhang Yi feel as if he had traveled to another world. In his mind, he recalled the "dark room" (simple house) he and Wang Han had built. Then he looked at this bustling Kaifeng Prefecture. Zhang Yi instantly felt that the game he had played before and what he was seeing now couldn't possibly be the same game. The difference was just too immense!

Just then, Wang Han and the others also teleported over. "This is absolutely incredible! What do you guys think about us building a similar architectural complex in the future?" Song Ren exclaimed, marveling at the beautiful scenery before him. The voice channel fell silent as everyone silently controlled their characters, flying forward. Build a similar architectural complex? Zhang Yi quietly looked at the 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' painting before them. Sunlight shone, and even white mist could be seen rising from the Bian River. Lanterns hanging under the eaves gently swayed in the wind. Centered around the tall city tower, houses on both sides were closely packed. Teahouses, taverns, inns, butcher shops, temples, government offices... Even in the shops, there were various silks and satins, jewelry and spices — all represented by *Minecraft* items, of course, such as wool for silks and emeralds for jewels. Furthermore, there were cart repairs, fortune-telling, shaving, and cosmetic procedures; residents from all walks of life were present. Pedestrians crowded the streets, an endless stream of merchants doing business, gentry viewing the street scenes, men and women, young and old, scholars, farmers, artisans, merchants, people from all social strata, all accounted for. Transportation was also varied, with sedan chairs, camels, ox carts, and rickshaws, all sorts, everything complete, vividly portraying the prosperous scene of a commercial city. A place of such scale, and you say you want to build something similar? I'm out!

Although it was a game, the group of people didn't use flight mode but walked together on the streets along both banks of the Bian River. They appreciated the beautiful scenery in the game, just like tourists. There were quite a few players doing the same. Even through the public voice channel, players who didn't know each other struck up conversations.

"It's so shocking! Nebula Games is absolutely awesome! Haven't you noticed, even though it's pixelated, it's really well-recreated!" "Exactly, it's not just similar in form, but also in spirit, vividly portraying the hidden crisis beneath the prosperity!" "Right, right, on the street we just passed, did you notice? There's a fire watchtower. Because most Northern Song Dynasty buildings were made of brick and wood, prone to fires, each district had a dedicated fire watchtower to monitor for fires. But the fire watchtower we just saw was empty on its upper floor, which clearly seems intentional." "Yeah, and the city walls earlier had no guards whatsoever, no defensive fortifications on the earthen walls, not even battlements for archers, and not even nominal defenses." "Didn't you notice the boats coming and going on the Bian River? At that time, Emperor Huizong of Song used a large number of official grain transport ships to deliver the Flower and Rock Tribute, causing problems with grain transportation. Private boats then seized the opportunity, gradually controlled the city's grain market, and manipulated grain prices." "Exactly, exactly! And these events where NPCs appear, look ahead!"

Just then, a tax official at a corner pointed to some sacks and stated a desired number, immediately provoking dissatisfaction among the surrounding cargo owners. A cart driver anxiously shouted with his mouth wide open, the commotion loud enough to alert the night watchman on the city tower to look down. At the same time, two four-horse carriages made a sharp turn on the street and sped wildly, crashing into things, with passersby barely having time to dodge. These manifestations were, naturally, applications of AI technology. Various feedback events would randomly appear as players toured. To ensure the uniqueness of the 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' street, Chen Xu had put in considerable effort, creating a large number of random events.

"It's perfect! It fully depicts the customs and daily life of the common people, and even more so, it shows the hidden intricacies beneath the surface of commercial prosperity. This is a prosperous era fraught with hidden dangers, reflecting a sense of foreboding!" Listening to the various chats from other players around them, Zhang Yi, along with Wang Han and Song Ren, fell into a moment of silence. Are you the Insightful Ones? Everyone was touring the game, everyone was praising it. Why could you be so insightful, saying so many profound things? While he was just exclaiming, "Damn, awesome!" and "Damn, truly beautiful!" Listening to the discussions of these other players, he always felt a bit too common. So Zhang Yi made a decision: he would turn off the voice chat. As long as he couldn't hear it, he wouldn't feel so common. The world instantly became quiet! Turning off the voice chat and feeling the silent world, Zhang Yi smiled. Different locations, same actions. Wang Han, Song Ren, they all quietly turned off the public voice channel as well.
