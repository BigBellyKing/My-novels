Chapter 283: E-Sports Planning and New Version Plans (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Since the launch of Warcraft, aside from the game's story, it has also attracted many ordinary players.

At the same time, numerous players passionate about RTS gameplay have been actively exploring the gameplay content of Warcraft.

The RTS gameplay content of this game, no less impressive than its single-player story, has been discovered by many players to be far more complex than they initially imagined.

At first, most players simply kept producing units, creating heroes, advancing tech, and launching an all-in push.

As for anything else, they were completely bewildered.

But as players gradually gained understanding, many RTS experts began to uncover the significant impact high-level heroes had on battle sessions.

Moreover, since heroes could use items, some basic tactics began to emerge.

For example, escorting heroes with common soldiers during the early game to creep and level up faster.

Additionally, some targeted strategies were developed—such as the Orc Blademaster using Wind Walk to infiltrate the enemy base and harass Peasants.

Following enemy leveling groups and using Wind Walk's bonus damage to secure last-hits, steal experience, and grab Items.

To counter early-game harassment from units like the Blademaster or fast-moving Demon Hunters, some players discovered the secrets of Architecture in Warcraft—such as blocking off the path to the gold mine, effectively preventing harassment.

………………

Inside Nebula Games' office, Chen Xu was testing Warcraft's Map Editor.

A knock came at the door. After receiving permission, Lin Rou entered.

"Mr. Chen, Shark TV contacted us, hoping to obtain authorization for a Warcraft competitive tournament," Lin Rou said to Chen Xu.

"Competitive tournament? Explain in detail," Chen Xu replied, slightly taken aback.

E-sports tournaments were indeed part of Chen Xu's long-term plan.

After all, Warcraft was inherently a competitive game.

However, he hadn't seriously considered launching tournaments yet.

Primarily because player skill levels in Warcraft were still uneven.

Holding a Warcraft tournament at this stage, frankly, wouldn't carry much weight.

Moreover, players were still in the exploratory phase, and the game's spectator appeal wasn't particularly strong.

RTS was a particularly unique genre in e-sports.

If you understood it, the viewing experience was absolutely the most thrilling.

But if you didn't, you'd be completely lost.

Unlike FPS or MOBA titles, where even if you didn't fully grasp the mechanics, you could still follow basic highlights—like a solo kill or a one-health comeback.

But RTS?

That involved Macro.

For instance, if a hero died once, some players would immediately type 'GG'; if a few Peasants died, they'd surrender instantly.

For players familiar with game mechanics, this was understandable.

Because falling too far behind meant the opponent could accumulate overwhelming advantages through superior Macro, eventually suffocating you.

But for spectators who didn't understand, it seemed utterly baffling. They had no idea what tactics were being used. To them, it looked like one side lost a hero and three units, then suddenly gave up—possibly even suspecting match-fixing.

Launching RTS tournaments at this stage wasn't, in Chen Xu's view, an ideal move.

Moreover, in this Parallel World, the e-sports industry wasn't as underdeveloped as one might assume—in fact, it was quite prosperous.

Third-party tournament organizers, various sponsorship channels, well-established clubs, and corresponding guilds were all highly developed.

This meant the RTS e-sports scene already had a wide variety of projects.

Warcraft was indeed popular, but already after its launch, there were plans to run e-sports events?

With lingering doubts, Chen Xu listened to Lin Rou's explanation and finally understood.

"Shark TV wants to organize a platform event?" Chen Xu looked at Lin Rou.

It was simple—the live streaming platform noticed Warcraft's high popularity and, given that they already had several RTS expert streamers under contract, wanted to purchase an event authorization from Nebula Games to host a 'Shark TV Warcraft Monthly Tournament,' featuring their signed streamers.

All sponsorship, prize pools, and event operations would be handled entirely by Shark TV. Nebula Games would merely supervise, keep an eye on things, and collect revenue.

Put plainly, the platform wanted to run an event under the banner of competition, with content similar to early e-sports internet cafe tournaments—no Offline audiences or dedicated venues.

"Contact the people at Shark TV. We can discuss this. But we should also establish a dedicated department internally to study the relevant content and understand the insights," Chen Xu said after some thought.

He placed significant importance on e-sports tournaments.

Not for the money or tournament revenue.

What mattered most to Chen Xu was how such tournaments could drive the game forward.

When a game had the right ecosystem, e-sports could be an excellent way to solidify player stickiness and strengthen the IP.

For example, in his previous life, games like League of Legends and DOTA—even as player counts declined—their overall IP value never dropped.

Because even if many players no longer played, they still watched the tournaments. For Warcraft, cultivating such IP value was clearly essential.

Of course, a key point needed to be maintained: balancing third-party and official tournaments.

Like Blizzard in his previous life—if they had their way, they'd monopolize everything, which led to SC2's golden era collapsing due to conflicts with third-party organizers, turning a winning hand into a disaster.

Yet if you said they lacked capability, games like OW with declining popularity still managed to maintain healthy clubs and tournaments, ensuring everyone got a share.

This collaboration with Shark TV, beyond further game promotion, was also an opportunity for Nebula Games to cultivate internal understanding of the e-sports industry.

After all, Nebula Games would inevitably develop more games of this type in the future.

And well-run e-sports games could essentially become evergreen titles.

As for how Shark TV would organize the first 'internet cafe tournament' for Warcraft, those details could be discussed later.

After speaking with Lin Rou, Chen Xu sent a message in the work group chat, asking HR to identify employees interested in transferring roles and to begin recruiting new staff.

…………………

"Mr. Chen, are we hosting an e-sports tournament?" After discussing with Lin Rou, Chen Xu stretched and walked toward the project office. Seeing his arrival, the team looked curious.

"Just granting authorization for Shark TV to run it. Our direct department will learn from the experience. Even if we officially host one later, we'd likely outsource it to a third party. But we need to understand how to operate competitive games," Chen Xu shook his head and explained.

"Still, Warcraft does have the conditions for hosting tournaments now," Qin Yi said.

Warcraft had been launched for a while now, past the initial phase, and player skill levels had begun to differentiate.

Combined with Warcraft's domestic popularity, it had completely overshadowed other RTS titles.

As a result, major clubs had rumors of transforming their other RTS divisions into Warcraft teams.

With the influx of professional players from other RTS games, there were already several so-called 'expert' players emerging.

"Alright, enough talk. You've rested long enough—prepare for the planning of Warcraft's new version," Chen Xu said with a smile.

He pulled out a document that had been printed earlier.

"Huh? New version planning!?" Everyone was surprised—was a new version really being released this soon?

But when they saw the document, they looked completely bewildered.

What was this?

'Defend the Sword Pass,' 'Pyramid Escape,' 'Demon Hunter Chronicles,' 'Monopoly of the World,' 'Calamity of the Western World'—what were these?

How did Warcraft end up connected to the Pyramid and the Sword Pass?
