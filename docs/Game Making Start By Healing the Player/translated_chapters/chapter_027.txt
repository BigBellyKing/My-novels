Chapter 27: The Next Game

Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue were both full of confusion.

"Not developing a sequel to *Undertale*, and not making META games anymore?" Yang Xin couldn't quite understand why.

Ruan Ningxue felt the same way.

One must know that current game media was almost uniformly publishing various reviews about *Undertale*.

And in forums frequently visited by industry designers, various gaming industry professionals were analyzing the characteristics of *Undertale*'s unique approach.

After all, such a fresh element truly felt like it could become a new trendsetter.

Even some game developers and designers had openly stated that they had greenlit projects involving META elements.

But now Chen Xu was saying he wouldn't do it anymore?

Releasing such news would undoubtedly surprise many.

After all, the concept of META was unheard of before *Undertale*.

According to the normal mode, given *Undertale*'s popularity, one would naturally strike while the iron is hot and release a sequel, just like *Mirror (Game)* released its DLC.

At the very least, it should be a brand new META game!

In fact, Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin had discussed this privately before.

They even thought that their next project might be a prequel to *Undertale*.

After all, the story of Asriel and Chara in the game was basically just a brief overview, not fully developed.

Yet now, Chen Xu told them he wouldn't make a sequel to *Undertale*, or even any more META games?

"It's not very suitable, and the scope of META elements is very limited. *Undertale* certainly gave players a sufficient shock, but the main reason for this was that players had no prior mental preparation and no corresponding concept of META elements."

"If we continue to release META-style games at this point, the subsequent repercussions will definitely not be better than *Undertale*. In fact, due to players' first impressions, they might even feel that we're making things worse."

Chen Xu explained to the two.

Others might not be clear about the genre of META games, but Chen Xu certainly was.

Before he transmigrated, META games were no longer anything special.

*ICEY*, *The Stanley Parable*, *Pony Island*, and *Undertale*, which Chen Xu chose to develop, were all outstanding examples.

But the highest sales went to *Undertale* and *ICEY*. In his previous life, *The Stanley Parable*, which truly brought META into players' view, actually had lower sales than these two rising stars.

As for *Pony Island*, many players hadn't even heard of it.

The main reason was that META elements were not suitable as a primary core selling point.

Upon careful study, one would find that *ICEY* incorporated action elements.

Although *Undertale* overturned RPG settings, it was essentially a combination of RPG and bullet-hell gameplay.

Both of these games used META elements as a supplement, while *Pony Island* and *The Stanley Parable* focused more on META elements with other elements as secondary.

META elements could indeed be a setting that greatly shocked players.

However, they were not suitable as the main core; they were more suited as a lubricant, creating a chemical reaction with the game's inherent content.

Numerous large-scale games in his previous life also adopted similar designs.

For example, Psycho Mantis, the BOSS in the *Metal Gear* series, who could read players' controller inputs.

And the ending of *Nier: Automata*, which used players' save data to save others.

These were all uses of META elements, but mostly as supplementary settings.

The success of *Undertale* was definitely not solely due to META elements.

After listening to Chen Xu's explanation, Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin were still a bit bewildered.

They understood, but not completely.

However, one thing they did grasp: continuing to release META games might not earn much money, and the reputation might not be good.

Coupled with a large number of game developers incorporating META elements, players might even experience aesthetic fatigue.

"So, what type of project should we choose next?" Yang Xin asked Chen Xu.

"For now, we'll make a low-cost transition game, and the team also needs to expand," Chen Xu replied.

"As for the type... take a look at this."

With that, Chen Xu opened his laptop and logged into a website: the Game Department Official Website.

Then, under the slightly bewildered gazes of Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin, he opened an announcement.

"Science is the source of human progress; scientific advancement and innovation are bringing earth-shattering changes to our lives. This time, the National Game Department is holding a Sci-Fi Game Design Competition with the theme 'Technology Changes Life'."

"I. Participants: National game designers."

"II. Submission Requirements: No platform restrictions, themes must be positive and wholesome."

"III. Event Organization: This event is hosted by the National Game Department and will use a dual selection mode of judging and player voting to ensure fairness and impartiality."

"IV. Evaluation and Commendation: Based on the total number of competition entries, one first prize, three second prizes, six third prizes, and several honorable mentions will be awarded."

"Outstanding works will be promoted and recommended on the official platform's homepage after the event concludes."

"Additionally, award-winning designers will be granted the title of 'Excellent Designer' as encouragement."

"(Registration period for participants is September 1st to September 5th, and the event closes at the end of September.)"

"Are we entering the competition?" Yang Xin asked, surprised.

She was actually aware of this event.

It appeared to invite national game designers, but in reality, most participants were independent game designers or small and medium-sized game companies.

There were certainly benefits, as the host was the Game Department, which was primarily responsible for game reviews, job title evaluations for designers, game engine technology development, and the introduction of relevant game policies.

Making an official appearance before them would certainly be beneficial and harmless.

Moreover, promotion and recommendations on the official platform's homepage represented tangible benefits.

After all, the Official Game Platform was considered one of the largest distribution channels in the country.

As for why large developers didn't participate, it was mainly because this type of competition was a chicken rib for them.

High-cost, high-production games definitely didn't lack such exposure.

And high-cost, high-production games would surely be commercially driven.

Commercially driven games naturally wouldn't lack special elements that attract players.

Forget violence or suggestive content; even elements like "Multiple Female Protagonists with a Harem" would be very unappealing in such an official event.

So naturally, no large-budget games participated.

Most participants were independent game designers and small to medium-sized game developers, though some studios acquired by large developers would also participate.
