Chapter 222: Officially Launched (Seventh Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)

Chapter 222: Officially Launched (Seventh Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)

While players online were still discussing how the piano shown previously could possibly be built within Minecraft, three more days passed.

Chen Xu once again released a new video.

The content was simple: 'How to build a fully functional calculator in Minecraft.'

Viewing the calculator, entirely constructed from pixelated blocks, along with its internal components, and finally witnessing demonstrations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division,

players who had previously thought the piano was already impressive now had to admit: it wasn’t the most astonishing thing—there was always something more extreme.

Calculators weren’t particularly rare; many games even included them as built-in tools.

But the key difference was that in those games, they were pre-programmed features.

In Chen Xu’s latest Minecraft video, however, this device was entirely handmade.

Did that mean players could eventually build one themselves too?

Since the first video was released, Minecraft’s popularity had grown to an absurd, almost unbelievable level.

It had captured the entire gaming industry’s attention.

Anyone who was online and visited game communities, even casually, now knew about this game.

"Damn it, damn it! Is he dropping an impressive trick every three days?"

"Can this game actually be played like this? I’m completely stunned!"

"Looks like the claims in the original promotional trailer weren’t exaggerating at all! The only limit to gameplay is the player’s imagination!"

"This is absolutely mind-blowing! I’m definitely going to build one myself!"

"Don’t brag, sweetie, Mom’s scared! That structure looks terrifyingly huge—take a hundred years and try building it!"

"Damn you, don’t disrespect me! Once I figure out how it works, I’ll grind day and night to build one!"

"This is just too awesome! Building a calculator in a game—why not build a full computer next?"

With these four new videos, countless players expressed their amazement.

What players didn’t know, however, was that yes, it actually was possible to build a full computer in this game.

In fact, if a player’s computer specifications were high enough, it was theoretically possible to run Minecraft inside Minecraft.

Of course, that would require extremely high-end hardware.

But building a computer capable of running Snake, inputting Chinese characters, or playing Minesweeper was entirely feasible.

The reason Chen Xu hadn’t done it yet was simple—demonstrations with the piano and calculator had already been sufficient.

Each promotional video had a specific purpose beyond showcasing Minecraft’s charm and potential.

The Along the River During the Qingming Festival and the Forbidden City were meant purely to show players what could be achieved with the game’s seemingly simple block-building gameplay.

The piano performance and calculator, on the other hand, were designed to demonstrate the true capabilities of Redstone technology in the game.

Likewise, the fifth video naturally had its own specific purpose.

It was meant to make players understand that Minecraft wasn’t just a block-building game, nor merely an Adventure RPG.

Amid immense anticipation from countless players, the fifth video was officially launched.

This time, the content showcased was an amusement park.

A series of complex tracks allowed pixelated characters to ride roller coasters and experience thrilling loops.

In the southwest corner, a carousel and Ferris wheel spun continuously.

At the park’s center stood a massive maze built with Redstone technology. The maze changed its layout irregularly at set intervals, and numerous pixelated characters were playing a mini-game of obstacle course inside.

On the water, there was a mechanical obstacle track—similar to those seen in variety show obstacle course games—where many players competed in challenges.

The gameplay remained the same core mechanics of Minecraft, but through creative structures and Redstone-powered mechanisms, it delivered a completely different player experience.

Players could play Hide and Seek, race on tracks, or even ride on a continuously moving racing circuit, shooting targets with Bow and Arrows while in motion.

Amid widespread astonishment and heated discussion,

the calendar reached Chinese New Year's Eve—the final day.

On this day, Chen Xu released a video that was different from the previous ones.

It wasn’t about showing off skills or introducing new content.

Instead, it was a New Year’s Celebration Video, entirely created using Minecraft content.

The video didn’t introduce anything new, but creatively reimagined content from previous videos.

In the Along the River During the Qingming Festival scene, the banks of the Bian River were filled with the festive atmosphere of the Spring Festival—fireworks lit up the sky and river lanterns floated gently downstream.



The Forbidden City reappeared, but this time bustling with NPC characters, full of liveliness and joy.

The piano was still playing, but instead of the melancholic 'To Liva,' it now played a cheerful New Year’s song.

Finally, the video transitioned to the amusement park. The camera zoomed in on the block characters enjoying the fireworks, and each block character was revealed with their real name or nickname—

all employees of Nebula Games.

………………

On the first day of the Lunar New Year, immediately after Chinese New Year's Eve, Minecraft was officially launched.

Meanwhile, TengHua’s Voyage finally announced a delay.

The usual excuse: they wanted to polish the game further, so they had to make the difficult decision to postpone the launch.

In the past, announcing a launch date and then delaying it would have drawn massive backlash from players.

But this time, the announcement caused barely a ripple.

Because every player’s attention was now completely focused on Minecraft.

On the first day of the New Year, Minecraft was officially Unlocked.

………

At Zhang Yi’s home in the Imperial Capital, after finishing family visits and New Year greetings, he rushed home like most players who had been eagerly anticipating the game’s release, desperate to experience Minecraft.

His hands itched with excitement!

The previous videos had completely ignited his creative inspiration.

After logging in, Zhang Yi immediately noticed something:

Wang Han, Song Ren, Wang Yifan, and Joey were all online.

"Everyone’s here!?" Zhang Yi joined the voice channel and was immediately met with excited shouting.

"We were just talking about you! Old Zhang, haven’t you met each other’s parents yet?" Song Ren chimed in.

"We’re visiting on the fourth. Hang on, I’ll invite you in! You won’t believe how stunning and breathtaking it is! Mr. Chen actually set up a special server—now we can visit the Along the River During the Qingming Festival and the Forbidden City! There are even scenes not shown in the videos!" Wang Han said, thrilled.

"Wait, wait—I’m coming!" Hearing this, Zhang Yi felt a surge of excitement.

To actually experience these places in-game?

This is just too awesome!

He clicked to launch the game, which required a large update.

Fortunately, his home internet was fast.

After entering the game, Zhang Yi quickly realized this wasn’t the same experience as before!

For instance, after the Nebula Games Logo appeared and disappeared,

the opening animation had changed.

As the sun slowly rose over the eastern horizon,

the beach, green grass, mountains, and forests were beautifully illuminated by sunlight.

Then Steve walked along the shore, and the surrounding scenery shifted seamlessly.

He traveled from the beach to the banks of the Bian River a thousand years ago, experiencing its scenery and culture.

In the next moment, he arrived at the grand and majestic Forbidden City.

Then, he paused briefly beside the bonfire at the Flame Sanctuary.

After that, scenes Zhang Yi didn’t recognize flashed by one by one, before Steve finally entered the amusement park for some fun.

Finally, as the sun set, the scene returned to the banks of the Bian River. Countless Kongming lanterns shimmered in the sky, forming the words 'Minecraft.'

Meanwhile, the game’s UI interface had also changed—no longer the previous island theme, but now set on a painted pleasure boat floating on the Bian River.

Along the riverbank, options like 'Start Game' and 'Settings' were displayed.

Before he could finish taking it all in, Wang Han sent an invitation through the Friends list, asking if he wanted to join her server.

Without hesitation, Zhang Yi clicked Confirm.

As the black screen loaded, Zhang Yi’s heart swelled with anticipation.

And he already had a plan forming.

He was going to seek inspiration.

He knew he could never recreate the entire Along the River During the Qingming Festival.

But he was definitely going to study the residential houses in that scene—then build his own version later!
