Chapter 117: If You Can Do It, You Go Ahead!

Exit Game, New Save File

Let the character ‘123’ become the past, while the brand-new character ‘aaa’ will become the rising star to carry the flame of hope.

This time, Zhang Yi didn’t bother with detailed character customization.

Because the Knight class came with a full set of armor and a sword-and-shield by default, the head was completely covered by the helmet.

Thus, there was no point showing off his exquisite character customization skills, so he simply skipped it.

As for the burial gifts, the Twigs he had chosen last time might have some special function—he just wasn’t sure yet and would have to figure it out later.

But one thing he was certain of was that the Twigs were utterly useless against Ash Judgment Gundyr.

So this time, after discussing with Wang Han, Zhang Yi chose the Life Ring, the one that provided healing.

Since they didn’t know the functions of the other items, picking equipment that increased their own health was definitely the safe choice!

Skip the opening cutscene. Seeing the ‘aaa’ character on screen, holding a sword and shield and clad in full knight armor, Wang Han sitting before the computer suddenly felt a deep sense of reassurance.

Her confidence inexplicably surged!

Just like before, they progressed through the path, defeating each Hollow one by one.

They picked up the pulse for focus that boosted concentration, lit the first bonfire, dashed beside the platform, leapt onto the coffin, and retrieved a mysterious white object—a wedge-shaped stone fragment whose purpose remained unknown.

As for the Crystal Lizard down the side path, Wang Han had no intention of bothering it for now.

After all, grudges have their origins, and it wasn’t the Crystal Lizard that had tormented her.

Her main target was still firmly fixed on Ash Judgment Gundyr.

Passing through the stone gate, they entered the courtyard.

In this newly started save file, Gundyr the Ash still knelt on the ground just as before.

The only difference was the bloodstains scattered across the courtyard, stretching in every direction.

Wang Han took a moment to observe the death scenes left by other players.

Most were similar, but one thing made her nervous—among them, she noticed quite a few players wearing knight armor.

Some deaths were especially gruesome. On one side of the courtyard stood piles of gravestones and candles, while the other side dropped into a bottomless cliff.

Through the residual bloodstain echoes left by other players, Wang Han saw how many had rolled too close to the cliff’s edge, only to be swept off by some unknown force.

This made Wang Han decide to keep a safe distance from the cliff during the fight.

Being beaten to death by Gundyr wasn’t embarrassing—it wasn’t her first time, after all.

But dying to an Environmental Kill? That would be utterly humiliating.

After all, this area wasn’t some narrow path—it was a wide-open courtyard.

Taking a deep breath, Wang Han advanced ‘aaa’ forward and pulled the Coiled Sword from Gundyr’s chest.

After pulling out the sword, she didn’t immediately retreat to create distance. Instead, she swung her longsword at Gundyr, watching the stamina bar deplete as she practiced her offensive rhythm.

As the blade struck Gundyr, dark purple blood splattered out.


“What’s the point of attacking now? The boss isn’t even awake yet! Aren’t you just wasting stamina?” Zhang Yi grumbled from the side.


“I’m just getting a feel for it, sharpening my skills. Besides, I’m watching the stamina bar!” Wang Han retorted.


But what happened next stunned her.

When Ash Judgment Gundyr finally stood up fully, the UI health bar displayed on screen had already lost a noticeable chunk of health.


“Holy crap! You just got lucky—like a blind cat stumbling on a dead rat!” Zhang Yi exclaimed, stunned. “It can actually be like this?!”


“What do you mean lucky? This is experience and understanding of the game!” Wang Han huffed.


Though she hadn’t known this mechanic existed before, that didn’t stop her from boasting.

It’s common knowledge that intelligence drops when showing off, so Wang Han’s moment of triumph didn’t last long.


‘Boom!’ A deep, muffled sound echoed from the speaker on the desk.


Still caught in her self-praise, Wang Han failed to notice that Ash Judgment Gundyr had already awakened.


The boss brought his halberd down hard on the ground, launching her character flying backward.


“That’s not right! I’m wearing armor now—how is the damage this high?!”


Wang Han’s eyes widened as she watched ‘aaa’ go flying.


What was she seeing?

Why had a third of the health bar just evaporated?


It was true she could now withstand more hits than the Deprived.

But the key point was that going from surviving two hits to surviving three wasn’t much of an improvement!

What was the difference?!


Staring at the depleted health bar and the still-fearsome Ash Judgment Gundyr, Wang Han felt her entire worldview shatter in that instant.

This armor—was it just for show?


But the boss clearly wasn’t giving her time to reflect.

Moving with slow, deliberate steps that somehow closed the distance instantly, Gundyr swung his halberd like a tiger pouncing from the mountains.


This time, Wang Han instinctively raised her shield to block—but immediately regretted it.

Because earlier, when Zhang Yi had fought this boss as the Deprived, he’d also tried blocking.

And the result had been disastrous.

Not only did the stamina bar drain rapidly, but more importantly, the broken wooden shield couldn’t fully block the attacks—only reduce damage.

And the damage reduction? From 100 to 50.

Originally dying in two hits, now dying in four.


But the next moment brought Wang Han a delightful surprise.

Because her shield had perfectly blocked Gundyr’s attack.

Not a single drop of health lost!


“Invincible! So this is the cheat code to clearing the game!”


After two consecutive hits, seeing her character take zero damage, Wang Han’s face lit up with joy.


But her excitement clouded her judgment—she completely ignored her stamina bar.

The shield was still raised, and she hadn’t even finished speaking.

Suddenly, Gundyr dashed forward swiftly, and his halberd unleashed a double sweeping slash.


Her already low stamina bar was instantly emptied.

Her character stumbled,陷入僵直, and then Gundyr thrust forward with his right hand.


Wang Han watched as her character was impaled and flung into the air by the halberd, tossed around like a broken doll.

At the same time, health plummeted to zero.


【YOU DIED】—the words turned from crimson to monochrome, still the familiar three characters.


Wang Han fell silent.


“You’re not good at this! Stamina is crucial in this game. When your stamina runs out, it’s just like losing health. Blocking with a shield avoids damage, but it drains stamina twice as fast as rolling. And weren’t we supposed to Perfect Guard? Why did you just block and never counter?!” Zhang Yi commented on the battle.


The only thing that amazed him was that even after choosing the Knight, the defense didn’t seem to have improved much.

To put it simply: the Deprived was like soft tofu, and now the Knight in armor was just slightly tougher—old tofu.

Both were still tofu—easily shattered with a single hit.


Sitting on the chair, Wang Han’s face darkened as she listened to Zhang Yi’s hindsight comment: “If you can do it, you go ahead!”


“Fine! I will! Just watch me show you how it’s done!” Zhang Yi sat back down, already envisioning his battle plan against Ash Judgment Gundyr.
