### Chapter 94: Isn't This a Matryoshka Doll?

《Sanguosha》 and 《Fall Guys》, both officially launched games, continued to see their data steadily rise.

《Fall Guys》, in particular, a buy-to-play game, spread with incredible speed.

On major video websites, live streaming platforms, and player communities, the three characters 'Fall Guys' had absolutely exploded in popularity.

Even many players who hadn't played the game themselves knew of its existence from various sources.

This showed just how popular the game was.

It even spawned numerous crossovers with characters from other games.

Various fan creations emerged, transforming classic game characters into 'Fall Guys'.

All these also played a significant role in promoting 《Fall Guys》.

And it all owed to 《Fall Guys》' delightful art and character design, as well as the casual fun of its various levels.

Although many players on forums commented that once you mastered Fall Guys, you'd quickly turn into a Grabber.

For most players, however, it was clearly still a game that offered a lot of enjoyment.

Various media outlets also reported extensively on topics related to 《Fall Guys》.

In contrast, while 《Sanguosha》 didn't ignite the same kind of fervor as 《Fall Guys》, it maintained a very stable presence.

On major forums, players discussed which generals made the best teammates and which were universally recognized as troublesome.

Soon, the respective data for both games were released.

《Fall Guys》: 650,000 units sold in three days!

《Sanguosha》: 110,000 Yuan in gross revenue in three days!

These figures utterly astonished industry insiders who were following both games.

《Sanguosha》 didn't draw too much attention, but it was the sales of 《Fall Guys》 that truly captivated them.

Wasn't that just too terrifying?

But an even more jaw-dropping event was yet to come.

《Sanguosha》's related data showed stable growth without significant spikes.

However, on the fourth day, after 《Fall Guys》 launched on third-party platforms outside of the Nebula Games platform, its cumulative sales directly surpassed one million units.

And looking at the momentum, it showed no signs of stopping.

This number completely stunned industry insiders; they never would have imagined that such a game could achieve one million sales in four days.

Although it was partly due to the very cheap price of 《Fall Guys》, regardless of the price.

One million sales in four days, even if it only sold for one Yuan, was incredibly impressive from a certain perspective.

After the sales figures were out, industry insiders discussed it extensively.

"Did you see? The sales of 《Fall Guys》 are just explosive! Over a million in four days, I'm dumbfounded!"

"How is that possible?!"

"And the key is that player reviews are still very high!"

"Don't just focus on 《Fall Guys》, didn't you notice that 《Sanguosha》 is also very special? Although its gross revenue isn't high, pay attention to its operation: it doesn't force or even induce spending money, yet it still generated nearly 200,000 Yuan in gross revenue in four days under such circumstances!"

"《Sanguosha》 looks simple, but it's too difficult to imitate. Let's quickly research 《Fall Guys》 and reference some variety show obstacle course programs to try and get a piece of that pie!"

"Heh heh, while you're still discussing, smart designers have already started working."

Countless industry designers began their research, hoping to capitalize on the lingering popularity of 《Fall Guys》 and grab a share of the profits.

As for the players, they were focused on other juicy news from this gameplay Expo.

That was the promotional video Chen Xu released on the last day and the details about 《Dark Souls》 revealed on the official Weibo account.

In many game forums, players were discussing this game.

'《Dark Souls》, is that the name of Chen Xu's new work? Is it a fantasy theme then?'

'It's clearly a Western fantasy style, and judging by the scale of the promotional video, it should be a genuinely big production!'

'The Fire fades, and the Lords go without thrones. This story of the Firelinker sounds a bit despairing.'

'Haha, interesting! So we players will be playing as Firelinkers, carrying the flame of hope in a world of despair!'

'Haha, hope I can play it soon, I want to link the fire!'

'By the way, have you seen the concept art screenshots from the exhibition? So cool!'

'So these are the classes players can choose, or the BOSSes they can fight in the game? I'm really looking forward to it!'

After the official Weibo account posted, Chen Xu's fans.

Some had experienced everything firsthand at the exhibition, others learned about it from the official Weibo and media reports.

Everyone excitedly discussed it.

Meanwhile, Chen Xu began spending his points.

Since the New Year, he had accumulated enough points for a hundred-pull gacha.

Now that he was developing 《Dark Souls》, it was a good time to boost his related numerical abilities.

Opening his computer, Chen Xu first changed his desktop background to a vibrant red 'Fu' character, then launched his music software to play the Parallel World version of 'Good Fortune Arrives' in the background. Even if the lyrics and melody were different, the sincerity was what mattered.

With everything ready, Chen Xu tore open a pack of wet wipes, wiped his hands, took a deep breath, and started the lottery draw.

'Wow! Golden Legend!'

As golden light flashed before his eyes, Chen Xu's mind constantly conjured the corresponding voice acting.

It was just that the items that came out were too realistic.

Common, Common, Common... After nearly ten common items, a rare one appeared.

Among them were also mixed a bunch of Memory Capsules.

'Wow! Golden Legend!'

A hint of excitement appeared on Chen Xu's face.

Though it was still the voice acting he imagined, this time, he really got something good!

Following the flash of golden light, a golden item appeared before him.

【Mysterious Gashapon: After meeting the activation conditions, you will receive a mysterious item.】

A shimmering golden egg. At the same time, Chen Xu noticed several progress bars on this egg.

They were annotated with: Joy, Sadness, Resentment, and Anger, four different categories.

"So I opened a gashapon and got another gashapon?" Chen Xu was a bit speechless.

Isn't this a Matryoshka doll?

He opened a gashapon, and from inside the gashapon, he got another gashapon that required a key to open.

However, Chen Xu also developed some anticipation for this item.

After all, the requirements were so high, and it was golden quality; it couldn't be some ordinary item, could it?

While thinking, Chen Xu also used the skill books he had drawn, boosting his ability scores.

As for Joy, with 《Fall Guys》 having just launched, it could still provide a lot.

As for Resentment and Anger, Chen Xu estimated that after 《Dark Souls》 launched, it wouldn't be far off either.

Thinking about it this way, these conditions should actually be quite easy to meet!

And what made Chen Xu particularly relieved was that this item wouldn't interfere with his points, being relatively independent.

After exhausting his accumulated points and doing a bit of research, Chen Xu refocused his attention on 《Dark Souls》.

Next, he still had to grind out the design concept drafts for 《Dark Souls》.
