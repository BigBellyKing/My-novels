Chapter 166: I Thank You On Behalf of the Players! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Originally, all the designers had come today intending to inquire about the new VR device—its parameters and some development-related features.

But the DEMO submitted by Chen Xu, *Silent Hill PT*, completely disrupted their plans.

Meanwhile, the Research Park was experiencing a special theme today.

That theme was—'screaming'.

When one's emotions are unstable and fear is felt, what is the most effective way to release that emotion?

The answer is very simple: scream!

A real man, and even a battle-tested tester, letting out a scream of terror because of a test DEMO—this was something they considered quite embarrassing.

So at first, even though Li Yue was terrified—despite being startled when he first encountered Lisa (the female ghost) at the bathroom door—he only let out an instinctive cry.

It wasn't until he experienced an up-close and personal encounter with Lisa that, under the overwhelming emotional impact, he finally let go of himself and screamed aloud, following his body's instincts.

When Ye Xun and Tao Fa entered the experience, they finally understood what this game truly was.

This absolutely shouldn't be a game that exists in the real world!

The only thing that made them feel slightly better was that Li Yue had already released himself first, removing their pressure and allowing them to freely scream out their inner fear.

In an instant, the entire Research Park was filled with screams resembling those of pigs being slaughtered.

After resting for a while, Li Yue returned for another round, originally believing he could face it all with greater strength.

After all, at the end of the day, this was still just a horror game.

Once a player becomes familiar with a horror game, the fear it induces gradually diminishes.

But upon re-entering the game, Li Yue realized he had overthought it—or rather, only half-understood it.

Indeed, once a player becomes familiar, the fear a horror game produces lessens.

But the key issue now was—hadn't he still not fully grasped it yet?

The only thing he knew for sure was what the female ghost looked like.

As for everything else?

All was unknown!

Even whether the game contained other monsters remained a mystery.

He thought he had progressed quite far, but reality quickly taught him a lesson.

Because upon entering the otherworld, and passing through the Conduit once more, a faint sound of running water reached his ears. The original lighting had transformed into a sinister crimson glow.

Even the chandelier that had hung from the ceiling had been replaced by a large refrigerator.

Swinging back and forth in midair, the crimson light was actually the reflection of countless streams of blood emanating from inside the refrigerator.

During this segment, an incredibly eerie piece of music played for the first time in the game, and from inside the refrigerator came the deafening wails of a baby.

Combined with the static noise from a radio, a faint message could be heard: 'After killing his family, the father hanged himself with the rubber hose from the garage (the umbilical cord).'

At this moment, looking up at the refrigerator dangling from the ceiling, fresh blood would suddenly gush out, splattering directly onto the player's face.

Accompanied by the sudden sound of high heels approaching from behind, the game's atmosphere reached its most oppressive peak.

Under such conditions, coupled with Lisa's seductive face pressing against theirs, the testers at the Research Park launched into an impromptu soprano competition.

………………

Leaving the Research Park, Chen Xu felt quite relaxed.

He believed the *Silent Hill PT* DEMO would help the testers provide better feedback, thus aiding in the improvement of the VR equipment.

And judging from the testers' reactions, it was likely they wouldn't be able to beat the DEMO anytime soon.

As for the new VR device, Chen Xu remained quite interested.

In terms of experience, it truly was a significant step up from the older VR equipment.

Unfortunately, it would still be difficult to bring to market in the short term.

As Chen Xu was lost in thought, his phone rang. It was a call from Yang Chen, Minister of the Game Department.

"Is there something, Minister Yang?" Chen Xu answered.

"Nothing urgent. Just wanted to let you know, the subsidy should be credited by next Monday. Also, this DEMO you made has great testing value. But in the future, if you make VR games—especially horror games intended for the general market, Chen Xu, you should really take it easy!" Minister Yang's expression on the other end of the line was extremely complex.

He had already reviewed the content of this *Silent Hill PT* DEMO.

How should he put it?

It was just too special.

And the most critical point was that the game didn't contain any particularly bloody scenes throughout.

The only somewhat disturbing content was the infant embryo in the bathroom.

Meaning, even without conducting a DEMO test, the content of *Silent Hill PT* could completely pass the censorship standards.

But if this game were released, combined with VR devices—no one would dare imagine the consequences!

After all, the ones experiencing it wouldn't be specialized testers like them, but ordinary players.

This wasn't making games for players—this was practically sending them straight to the asylum!

How many players could withstand this?

"I think Minister Yang is absolutely right. Mr. Chen, if you really release *Silent Hill PT* to the market, you'll send half your players straight to the hospital," Meng Zuo joked after Chen Xu hung up and filled him in.

"Not that exaggerated. It's mainly because the new version VR's sense of immersion is too strong—both the graphics and sound effects are too realistic," Chen Xu sighed with emotion.

The reason a horror game is terrifying lies not only in shocking visuals but also heavily relies on sound effects.

Take *Outlast*'s Mount Massive Asylum as an example: the player stands before the gloomy asylum gate, and the distant structure resembles a giant beast lurking in darkness, feeling extremely oppressive.

But if Guo Teacher's crosstalk suddenly played in your ears, accompanied by Yu Teacher's comedic responses, the effect would be completely ruined.

Likewise, if you had ominous sound effects, but in front of you, Mount Massive Asylum transformed into the sunny Bikini Bottom, it would be impossible to feel any fear.

"That's true," Meng Zuo nodded in agreement.

"But horror games still struggle to achieve explosive sales," Meng Zuo sighed.

"Indeed," Chen Xu nodded.

This was precisely why horror games had always been categorized as a Niche Category.

Too terrifying and frightening—praised by critics but ignored by audiences. Players simply don't dare play alone, so sales naturally don't rise.

But if it's not scary, then what kind of horror game is it?

"But the design of *Silent Hill PT* truly gave us designers a masterclass—especially the supernatural loop of the endless corridor, the narrow space design, and Lisa's turn-around jump scare. Even recalling it now sends a lingering fear through me!" Meng Zuo exclaimed emotionally.

"It's mainly because this is just a DEMO, so we could fully unleash our creativity," Chen Xu said with a smile.

"Too bad it can only be played on the new version VR. Otherwise, I'd love to study your DEMO more closely, Mr. Chen," Meng Zuo said jokingly.

"No problem, Teacher Meng. If you want to play, it's just a DEMO. The Game Department even said there's no need for secrecy. When I get back, I'll prepare a copy. Then we can have an in-depth discussion—feel free to give me some suggestions," Chen Xu replied.

Hearing this, Meng Zuo was taken aback.

Wait!

That wasn't what he meant! He was just engaging in routine professional flattery!

Who actually wants to play it? That wasn't what he meant at all!

Meng Zuo froze, wanting to speak but finding it too awkward to voice his true feelings.

Could he really say he was a little afraid?

"Mr. Chen, there's no need, really no need," Meng Zuo pleaded.

"Teacher Meng, don't be modest. Releasing a PC version is quite easy—after all, the materials are ready. It'd only take two days. Besides, it's like a little gift for the players, giving them some surprises," Chen Xu said with a smile.

Hearing Chen Xu's words, Meng Zuo fell into silence.

Surprised? He was certain the players would indeed be shocked.

But did you just call that a 'pleasant' surprise?

I thank you on behalf of the players!
