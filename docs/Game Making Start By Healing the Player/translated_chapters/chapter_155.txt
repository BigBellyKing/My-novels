Chapter 154: This Is Mr. Chen's Original Intention (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

With dual high scores from both media and players, and continuous heated discussions across game communities and forums—including popular "looking for teammates" threads—the popularity of *It Takes Two* continues to soar.

It's not just players who are paying attention. Numerous game designers in the gaming industry are also closely observing *It Takes Two*, analyzing the elements behind its success.

Although *It Takes Two* features rich content, with a main quest spanning over a dozen hours of gameplay,

from the first level in the Shed to the final level at the gramophone, traversing multiple scenes,

at its core, it remains a game of moderate scale.

For many independent game designers, the scale of *It Takes Two* is clearly too large to replicate.

However, for second- and third-tier game developers, this scale is entirely within their manageable range.

Compared to major first- and second-tier studios, which often focus on genres like FPS or ARPG,

smaller studios with limited funds and resources tend to explore niche game types and themes.

*It Takes Two* clearly presents an excellent reference point.

Given the scarcity of two-player co-op games in the market, the success of *It Takes Two* has reignited player enthusiasm for this genre.

This naturally creates a viable market.

So, what exactly are the keys to *It Takes Two*'s success?

Can it be replicated?

Can it be learned from?

These have become the core concerns for many game developers and designers.

The game's Level Design, Numerical Design, tutorial, graphics, Art, Music, and even subtle details

have all been meticulously studied, establishing *It Takes Two* as a benchmark in the two-player co-op genre.

For Chen Xu, however, *It Takes Two* is essentially complete.

Moreover, this game differs from earlier titles like *Fall Guys* or *Overcooked*.

It's not suitable for a Workshop (modding platform).

The game is simply too complex—the art style of scene themes, Level Design, and functions of Special Items—are all intricately tied to the game's story and overall theme.

Any modification to a single element could disrupt the entire gameplay experience.

Thus, despite being a Level Design-focused game, *It Takes Two* is entirely unsuitable for a modding platform.

As for the game's achievements, Chen Xu is largely satisfied.

After all, his original intention in creating this game was simply to let players experience its joy.

In that regard, the outcome has been near-perfect.

Inside Nebula Games' office, Chen Xu leaned back in his massage chair, phone in hand, scrolling through his official Weibo account and related community forums.

Under Chen Xu's official Weibo post, comments from players who've experienced *It Takes Two* flooded in.

Most were similar—overwhelming praise.

But what pleased Chen Xu most was that players had finally recognized him again!

In a single sentence: the "Warrior of Love" truly lived up to his name.

As Chen Xu continued scrolling, a knock came at the office door. After receiving permission, Lin Rou entered and announced, "Mr. Chen, the reporter from Game Timespace has arrived."

"Alright, I'll be right there," Chen Xu nodded.

After the explosive reputation and popularity of *It Takes Two*, Game Timespace had reached out to Nebula Games, hoping to conduct an in-depth interview with Chen Xu on gaming topics.

Given that recent discussions in the industry had largely centered around *It Takes Two*, Game Timespace wanted to produce a feature story.

Moreover, Nebula Games had previously collaborated closely with Game Timespace last year.

Additionally, Chen Xu had given interviews to this media outlet before, and the published reports had not caused him any discomfort. Therefore, upon learning of the request, Chen Xu readily agreed to the interview.

Entering the reception room, Chen Xu pushed the door open.

The three Game Timespace staff members seated on the sofa stood up immediately. The reporter in the center looked familiar to Chen Xu.

"Weren't you the one who interviewed me last year at Game Timespace?" Chen Xu asked, noticing the name "Wu Tian" on the reporter's badge.

"Exactly, Mr. Chen! You have a great memory!" Wu Tian smiled, though memories of last year's interview flashed through his mind.

Back then, he had been too inexperienced. The entire interview had unknowingly turned him into a mere note-taker, completely led astray.

This year, he was determined not to repeat that mistake.

Facing Chen Xu with a smile, Wu Tian silently resolved: "This time, I won't make that error again."

Determined not to falter, he took the lead: "Mr. Chen, thank you for making time amidst your busy schedule. Shall we begin now?"

"No problem, let's get straight to the point. Lin Rou, bring a few bottles of coke," Chen Xu nodded, sitting down on the sofa and turning to Lin Rou.

Lin Rou acknowledged and retrieved several bottles of coke from the ice chest, distributing them to everyone.

"Thank you..." Wu Tian instinctively said as he took the cold coke from Lin Rou.

But then he paused—this scene felt strangely familiar.

Yet, having learned his lesson, Wu Tian this time stayed sharp. As the interviewer, he quickly took control: "Mr. Chen, last year your development of *Dark Souls* had a profound global impact, earning the award for Best Role-Playing Game of the year."

"Online, *Dark Souls*' story sparked widespread debate among players. Many believed your next project would be a sequel to *Dark Souls*, fully continuing its narrative. So why did you surprise everyone this year with *It Takes Two*, a completely different game?"

Chen Xu smiled and nodded: "Primarily, it was a gift for players. After *Dark Souls* launched, I noticed many players misunderstood me—thinking I particularly enjoyed watching players suffer. Especially after the Game of the Year event, many misinterpreted my gratitude speech. That actually hurt me quite a bit."

"Because all along, I've always tried to think from the players' perspective. Whether it's ARPG, RPG, action-adventure, or casual simulation—I'm not a designer who sticks to one genre. I enjoy challenging myself with diverse game types."

"Of course, one thing will never change—my original intention in making games: every title carries my love for players. I've always strived to create games that warm and heal players' hearts."

"Many players associate *Dark Souls* with high difficulty, but upon closer examination, its difficulty isn't so extreme as to deter everyone. In fact, once players understand its Level Design, BOSS design, and combat mechanics, the game becomes quite manageable."

"The key lies in whether players can discover the methods within the game. When they can't find the trick, it naturally feels extremely hard. But once they do, most can clear the game relatively smoothly—just like in *It Takes Two*, when players develop tacit understanding and solve puzzles, progression flows naturally. *Dark Souls* is no different."

"The difference is that *Dark Souls* expresses this subtly, while *It Takes Two* brings it to the surface."

Wu Tian nodded as he listened to Chen Xu's explanation. Something felt slightly off, yet he couldn't pinpoint it.

Because everything Chen Xu said was true!

"Mr. Chen, may I ask something players are particularly interested in? Will there be a sequel to *Dark Souls*?" Wu Tian decided to shift the topic—he feared getting drawn too deep into the conversation again.

"Of course. It's already in our development plan. The sequel to *Dark Souls* will be presented as a Prequel. However, it may still take some time before it's ready for players. But fans can look forward to it at the May gameplay Expo," Chen Xu said with a smile.

Compared to last year, he hadn't even created a folder yet—but can a game producer's teaser really be called empty promises? This is called early warm-up promotion.

Unaware of this, Wu Tian immediately mentally pictured a playable demo of the *Dark Souls* Prequel at the gameplay Expo over a month away.

Wu Tian's face lit up with excitement: "Mr. Chen, how difficult will the *Dark Souls* Prequel be?"

Chen Xu smiled gently: "I've already mentioned this. Every game I make aims to bring joy and heartwarming experiences to players. When I design games, I don't focus on whether it's hard or not—I focus more on whether it's reasonable."

"As for what I can reveal, I can say it will be a brand-new and mad adventure. Players will experience greater surprises than before, and in terms of artistry and gameplay, I believe it will surpass the original."

Seated on the sofa, Chen Xu discussed numerous topics with Wu Tian—not only about *Dark Souls*, but also other subjects players cared about,

such as Nebula Games' overseas performance.

But for Wu Tian, today's interview content was absolutely explosive!

Especially the revelation of a *Dark Souls* Prequel—this alone thrilled him, as he himself was a devoted Chosen Undead!

Under the curious glances of several Nebula Games employees, Wu Tian left the office building with an exceptionally radiant smile.

The next day, Game Timespace's homepage featured a bold, red-font exclusive interview article: 'This Is Mr. Chen's Original Intention'
