Chapter 228: Nothing Short of a Miracle (Sixth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)

While Chen Xu and his team were conducting maintenance on Minecraft, as well as developing the mobile and VR versions,

the unique gameplay of Minecraft attracted an increasing number of players.

Initially, most players focused on crafting beautiful little houses.

But as time progressed, many high-level players began discovering the wonders of the Redstone system.

Much like a puzzle, Redstone Torches continuously emit signals.

Meanwhile, objects like Conduits, music boxes, and dispensers activate when receiving a signal, and deactivate when the signal stops.

Levers and pedals are straightforward—they function as simple switches.

The Repeater adjusts signal strength, since Redstone signals weaken over distance; with a Repeater, the signal can be restored to maximum strength.

Though no players had yet created complex mechanisms like calculators or pianos,

simple structures such as automatic chicken farms, small minecarts, and signal doors had already been successfully built by some.

Meanwhile, players exploring Minecraft’s Adventure mode discovered another mind-boggling gameplay element: Enchanting.

Additionally, various temples could be found in forests, deserts, and even underwater.

Of course, some unlucky players, upon first encountering a desert temple, jumped right in without hesitation—only to be brutally taught a lesson by TNT.

Videos of these incidents sparked heated discussions on Minecraft’s official forum.

'My mom asked me why I was kneeling while watching videos!'

'We all paid 68 yuan for the same game—why does yours look nothing like mine?'

'I think I bought the wrong game. I’m playing Minecraft, but what world are you guys actually in?'

'Wait, you can actually play it like that?'

'Seriously, selling this game for 68 yuan to Mr. Chen is an absolute loss!'

'Holy crap! I’m still living like a caveman in the Stone Age, and you guys are already entering the Industrial Era?!'

'Caveman here too—I’m still struggling to build my first house, and you’re already constructing Chicken Farms and Minecarts?'

Watching countless videos of master players showing off their creations, many players online joked that while they were playing Minecraft, others were playing Others' World—it was practically a different game!

Of course, despite the jokes, none of this dampened their enthusiasm.

Because every player could find their own unique joy within Minecraft.

This was all thanks to the game’s distinctive nature.

The game itself doesn’t impose any specific goals—everything you do is driven solely by your own imagination.

This level of freedom in gameplay was truly unprecedented.

Coupled with its special game mechanisms, the game became filled with astonishing possibilities, sparking endless imagination among players.

It truly lived up to the phrase from the promotional video: the larger the player’s imagination, the more enjoyable the game becomes.

………………

Miracle.

This was the term nearly every game designer in the gaming industry used to describe Minecraft over the past month.

It wasn’t just PC developers—game designers specializing in VR were equally dumbfounded.

Over the past month, Minecraft’s performance had been nothing short of miraculous, leaving everyone in awe.

It was simply unbelievable.

If the first-day sales of 3 million and first-week sales of 10 million were impressive, that would’ve been understandable.

After all, there had been other games in history that achieved similar results.

But the real shocker was Minecraft’s subsequent performance. Typically, after explosive first-week sales, the second week sees a sharp drop—sometimes even a halving.

Yet Minecraft was different. Although sales declined in the second week, the drop was remarkably stable.

This brought Minecraft’s total sales over two weeks to an astonishing 17 million.

And there was no sign of slowing down.

Not only domestically, but the overseas version of Minecraft launched a week and a half after the domestic release, priced at $14.90.

Initially, international players familiar with Nebula Games were confused.

After all, this studio had previously developed Dark Souls.

How did they suddenly release a pixel-style game?

But the moment players took notice of the game, they were stunned.

When Minecraft launched overseas, Target Software pulled off a massive cosplay of Nebula Games, directly translating and reposting all the mind-blowing domestic videos to international platforms.

Even before the game’s official release, classic domestic builds, tutorial videos, and Redstone technology demonstrations exploded in view count overseas.

This instantly ignited the game’s popularity.

Within just one week of its overseas launch, Minecraft had already sold 13 million copies.

Its subsequent sales trajectory mirrored the domestic trend almost exactly—steadily climbing forward.

Yes, sales were gradually declining, but only slightly.

It was as if the game possessed some extraordinary magic.

Although its price was comparable to most Independent Games, that hardly mattered in the face of its terrifying sales figures.

After Minecraft achieved this sales miracle, major media outlets overflowed with praise.

Even the domestic Game Department, in an unprecedented move, published an official review:

'There is no other game quite as special as Minecraft.'

'This is a game about blocks and adventure—though that description might be too narrow. In this unique game, players can explore a procedurally generated world solo and create astonishing miracles.'

'Whether it’s a tiny prison darkroom or a luxurious large villa, players are free to unleash their imagination and build anything they desire.'

'In Survival Mode, players must collect resources to build bases and weapons to face unknown dangers. Almost every player can find their own unique joy in the game.'

'As stated in the promotional trailer, the only limit to this game’s fun is the player’s imagination. Judging from current results, this statement couldn’t be more accurate.'

'If we were to define what a sandbox game is, it would undoubtedly be a game like Minecraft!'

This review carried immense weight—effectively, the Game Department was endorsing the game and formally recognizing 'sandbox game' as a distinct genre.

As for game designers across the industry, they were now deeply studying Minecraft’s design and mechanics.

If some designers had previously dismissed the game,

thinking a pixel-style sandbox game couldn’t possibly offer anything interesting,

no one held that opinion anymore. The facts had proven one thing:

Minecraft didn’t just 'play any new tricks'—it had become a phenomenon adored by millions.

Yet Chen Xu, the center of all this attention, wasn’t particularly focused on the industry or media reactions to Minecraft at this moment.

Instead, he was busy editing and producing a deeply meaningful video—

the first episode of a series documenting the historic milestones and major events created by players in Minecraft.
