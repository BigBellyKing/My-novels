Chapter 157: Players, I Wish You Good Luck (Seventh update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)

Chen Xu could probably guess what they were thinking from their hesitant expressions, and he chuckled as he explained.

"Don't worry, it's not what you're thinking."

"The bonfires in the game aren't completely devoid of teleportation. As the story progresses, after players navigate through areas like Undead Burg and Blighttown and successfully ring the bells, they can then travel to Anor Londo to obtain an item called the 'Lordvessel,' which will enable teleportation."
"Furthermore, players can directly level up at bonfires within the game."

Hearing Chen Xu's words, everyone suddenly understood.

"So the Fire Keeper's functions have been integrated into the bonfire, and the teleportation function has been tied to an in-game item," Qin Yi quickly grasped the bonfire's design in the game.

"Exactly." Chen Xu nodded. "This is also to let players experience the intricate design of the game's map."

So the teleportation function still exists, it's just been assigned to an item.

This primary design choice is mainly to highlight the exquisite map design within the game.

With various interconnected map areas, linked by elevators and shortcuts, players can travel from one region to another in a very short amount of time.

If we talk about the pinnacle of Souls series map design, it's undoubtedly the map design of Dark Souls 1.

And if teleportation between various in-game areas were immediately available,

then this exquisite map design experience would be significantly diminished.

After finishing his explanation of the prequel titled 'Age of the First Flame,' Chen Xu asked Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, the Art Team, and Qin Yi's level design personnel to stay behind.

Next, he still needed to discuss the game's maps and various aspects of level design with everyone in detail.

Compared to the previous Souls games, there were many areas in the prequel that required meticulous design.

"A trap design shouldn't be superficial. We've all had experience with this before when developing Dark Souls. For instance, if there are two enemies ahead in this area."
"Normally, when a player steps into this spot, it's a blind spot, allowing an unwary player to be ambushed. This kind of 'corner kill' has been used before; it's a basic introductory trap."
"But in the prequel, we can't be so basic. We must bring players entirely new surprises, so we need a reverse way of thinking: don't hide it, even make it obvious."
"We need players to discover this overt trap, but in reality, there's another trap hidden behind it, like a thousand-layer pancake. The outer layer is designed for players to find, but in the treetops, in corners, another enemy is hidden – that's the true setup."
"And there's another benefit to doing this: it creates the illusion for players that their death here was just due to their own carelessness."
"So, after dying, players will become even more cautious, subtly guided by skill-based methods, slowly leading them into deeper traps, maintaining a sense of novelty and challenge, and thus achieving a sense of accomplishment."

Chen Xu sat in front of the computer and sketched out a rough scene, making sure everyone understood what he was trying to convey.

Qin Yi and the others discreetly swallowed, imagining the combination of non-teleporting bonfires, these traps, and this level design—it was truly inhumane!

Just mentally picturing it, and recalling players' previous experiences in the Dark Souls world, he could already feel the profound malice.

"So it's like boiling a frog in warm water, and at the same time making players feel like they've been sold and are still counting the money?" Yang Xin nodded thoughtfully.

Chen Xu didn't speak, he just gave her a glance.

Why did she put it so harshly!

Though it was indeed quite fitting.

"It's mainly to increase the game's gameplay for players, so they can feel surprised."
"What is gameplay?"
"Isn't the gameplay of Dark Souls its unexpected level design, highly intense BOSS battles, and omnipresent deadly traps?"
"If we reduced this gameplay, wouldn't that be letting the players down?"
"To allow players to experience the joy of the game."
"Everything for the players, he wasn't just saying it; he was putting it into action."
"This is the quality a gaming industry professional should possess!"

Listening to Chen Xu, Qin Yi pursed his lips and remained silent.

As for surprise, it was certainly surprising.

But as for joy... well, players, I wish you good luck.

I can only silently feel for you all.

After all, Qin Yi admitted he was a little scared just thinking about what kind of game it would turn out to be once developed.

After the meeting, the Dark Souls prequel had entered the development phase.

However, the main work currently was still the production of art assets.

Because in this installment, while the action assets didn't change much,

the entire game map would almost completely be replaced.

Even the original Anor Londo, Farron Cesspit, and Royal Gardens could not reuse previous assets.

After all, in terms of time span, one was the end of the Age of Fire, and the other was shortly after the Linking of the Fire began.

It needed to convey a sense of great changes over time, allowing players to feel the passage of years.

Besides this, another major task was the promotional CGI for Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame.

Chen Xu had already provided the relevant storyboard script to Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue.

All that remained was the production of the CGI.

The company was the same one that had previously created the opening cinematic for Dark Souls.

Their previous collaboration had been quite pleasant, and their capabilities were considered top-tier in the industry.

For Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame, there wasn't anything Chen Xu needed to constantly supervise for the time being. Additionally, this year's gameplay Expo would be handled by Zhang Yida for arrangements.

As for preparing a completely new game like last year, Chen Xu had no such plans this time.

After all, he had previously developed It Takes Two, a title of considerable scale, and now a new Dark Souls game was also greenlit.

Time was truly tight.

Therefore, Chen Xu did not intend to get involved in this year's gameplay Expo.

Regarding the overseas market, Target Software had also contacted Chen Xu, intending to attempt a global simultaneous release.

Chen Xu agreed to Target Software's suggestion.

After all, Dark Souls' performance overseas last year had been exceptionally brilliant, giving the IP a certain level of recognition.

After summarizing Nebula Games' current situation, Chen Xu stretched on the office sofa.

However, the phone on the table rang at that moment.

Chen Xu picked it up and looked, revealing a surprised expression.

It was actually the landline from the Game Department.

Why was the Game Department calling him?

Chen Xu answered, utterly bewildered.
