Chapter 307: First Game Experience (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Amidst the eager anticipation of enthusiastic players.

Chen Xu's official Weibo account, Nebula Games, and NetDragon's official websites all announced content related to the Rainbow Six Siege experience.

However, it wasn't just that players could officially download the VR version from the Nebula Games Platform and NetDragon Games Platform. There was also an offline event. An early access trial held at VR internet cafes in major cities across the country.

For online early access, players needed to purchase the game in advance. Offline, however, VR internet cafes provided a special VR internet cafe exclusive version, allowing players to log in directly with their NetDragon and Nebula Games accounts to play and save their account data. However, compared to typical VR games, Rainbow Six Siege was priced slightly lower. After all, the game itself had in-app purchases like skins, and it was purely an online game with no single-player content. The domestic price was 499 Yuan, while the overseas price was 99 USD. As for overseas, there were no similar offline VR internet cafe events, as operating conditions did not permit it.

………………

Soon, the date arrived at February 1st. This year, the Lunar New Year was relatively late, still half a month away. For players who had long been anticipating Rainbow Six Siege, they couldn't wait to jump into the game and experience it as soon as it unlocked on that day. Zhang Yi and Wang Han, who were already on their New Year's Holiday, also made plans to head to a VR internet cafe.

They actually had VR gaming equipment, but only one set at home. Who got to play became a crucial factor. Plus, their old friend Song Ren had been busy before, but was now free as the New Year approached. So, they took this opportunity to meet up offline, enjoy the game during the day, and then have dinner together in the evening.

“So many people! It seems a lot of them are here to experience Rainbow Six Siege!” After Zhang Yi and the others paid and registered at the front desk, they found a private room with five sleeping pods available. In the center of the main hall, there was a huge screen displaying a match of Warcraft, clearly a high-ranked player match from the PC section of the internet cafe. However, Zhang Yi also noticed a small window next to it, showing a countdown to the unlocking of Rainbow Six Siege. It was clear that once the game unlocked, it would replace Warcraft as the new featured game.

“Well, the New Year is coming soon, and besides, this is the only blockbuster that has launched recently,” Song Ren said, not particularly surprised.

“Alright, alright, stop chatting. Hurry up and get on the machines, log in, and wait for the server to open. By the way, did you guys buy the game?” Wang Han asked.

“Of course we bought it! How could we not buy Mr. Chen's game?” Song Ren replied.

Wang Yifan and Joey both agreed.

The group chatted as they entered the VR gaming pods, eagerly awaiting the game's unlock.

As soon as the time arrived, everyone quickly reacted and entered the game. Previously, Chen Xu and NetDragon Games had communicated with the Game Department regarding whether the military version could be released to players, but ultimately, it didn't work out. However, in terms of content, the military version and the player version of the game differed more in subtle details. For example, in Hostage Mode, defenders could force the hostage to a more advantageous position for themselves, which was already a pre-determined feature. Additionally, there were no in-game prompts whatsoever; if a player was scanned, there would be no notification saying their position was exposed. Similarly, the heartbeat sensor wouldn't make an obvious 'beep-beep' sound, and the performance of gadgets like breaching rounds, as well as the destructibility for players, were also different. If these features were truly presented to players, Chen Xu estimated that while players might be interested at first, they would quickly stop playing. It would mainly be a gimmick. After all, it was too unbalanced. For the attackers, it would be as disadvantageous as possible. But that was a more realistic scenario.

“The game forces you to go through a new player tutorial!” Zhang Yi said in the voice channel.

“Same here. It's just a new player tutorial, won't it be over quickly?” Song Ren replied.

“I've already started!”

Compared to Rainbow Six Siege in his previous life, Chen Xu had put a lot of effort into the game's guidance. Ultimately, this was because Rainbow Six Siege was not a simple, casual game. The maps were slightly more complex than typical FPS games, and getting lost was commonplace for first-time players of Rainbow Six Siege who didn't consult map guides. Coupled with the various Operators' skills, it was quite challenging to get started. Therefore, when players entered the game, they would undergo relevant new player training.

In addition, the game had a built-in information system. This included skill effect demonstration videos for each Operator, layered maps, and camera locations. This made it easier for players to understand these aspects within the game.

Song Ren also entered the game's tutorial ahead of the others. There were eleven Operators, but currently, only the Recruit Operator was highlighted. So there wasn't much to choose from.

Entering the game tutorial.

“Shooting, running, crouching, proning, stealth walk, fast roping... you can even breach windows like this!” Song Ren watched the in-game character, who kicked off the wall with both feet, swung back with the rope, and then kicked through a wooden window, looking very excited. This kind of scene, usually only seen in movies, combined with the VR perspective feedback, was incredibly cool! Other operations were generally not a big problem. The only point was that in this game, the character's running and walking movements were relatively slow. But thinking about it, it was quite realistic. After all, carrying tens of pounds of counter-terrorism gear, how could one not be slow?

“So this is how attackers operate: start with a small drone, enter the building, and begin investigating and gathering information.” “Hey, if I get scanned, will I be detected? Does that mean if someone scans me, I'll get a notification?” Watching the drone squeeze through a door crack in the game, then get immediately destroyed by AI after scanning an enemy, and the subsequent notification screen, Song Ren suddenly understood.

The entire new player tutorial didn't delve into overly deep content, focusing mainly on basic common knowledge. Operations, information gathering and feedback for attackers and defenders, functions of different equipment, how Operators' skills are deployed, and how to win in the three different modes. With a total of five new player tutorial levels, and it not being Song Ren's first FPS game, he quickly completed them. He then gained the qualification to choose 10 Operators, five attackers and five defenders. He didn't know which ones were good anyway, except for Ying on offense and Lesion on defense, whom he set as mandatory picks. Although his real name was Liao Zilang, combining it with the English name Lesion made 'Liu Xing' sound so much smoother. For the other slots, he just picked randomly. For example, Blackbeard, Ash, and Sledge, who had left a deep impression on him from the previous promotional video. As for the last one, he personally didn't like those who carried shields, so he finally set his sights on a Russian character. Fuze, according to his description, was all about explosives. His Operator skills and equipment were entirely related to explosives, clearly a powerful firepower output point, which suited him perfectly.

“You guys haven't finished the tutorial yet?” After selecting his Operators, there was a moment of silence in the voice channel, then Song Ren asked, a little dejected.

“Not yet, I'm only on the third level!”

“Just got to the fourth level! The immersion in this game is really strong! And destroying houses is especially fun!”

“Yeah! I tore down everything in the house that could be torn down!”

Hearing everyone's comments, Song Ren felt a wave of frustration. The fastest one is only starting the fourth level?

“Then I'll go try out Terrorist Hunt Mode first. Call me when you guys are ready!” Song Ren said. Waiting idly was a bit boring, so he decided to play some Terrorist Hunt Mode. From the description, it seemed to be the game's PVE mode, and it could be played solo, perfect for waiting for his friends.

As for the information station? He never looked at that stuff when playing games! A veteran FPS player, needs it?

“Normal, Hard, Realistic? I'll try a round on Realistic.” Looking at the available options, Song Ren thought for a moment and decided to try a Lone Wolf Terrorist Hunt on Realistic difficulty. To see just how realistic this difficulty truly was.
