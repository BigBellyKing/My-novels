Chapter 307: First Game Experience (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Chapter 307: First Game Experience (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Amidst the eager anticipation of passionate players.

Chen Xu's official Weibo account, Nebula Games, and NetDragon's official websites all announced content related to the trial experience of *Rainbow Six Siege*.

But it wasn't just about players being able to download the game from the official VR sections of the Nebula Games Platform and NetDragon Games Platform.

There was also an offline event.

An Early Access trial held in collaboration with VR internet cafes across major cities nationwide.

For online players, early access required purchasing the game in advance. For offline players, the VR internet cafes provided a VR internet cafe exclusive version. Players could log in directly using their NetDragon and Nebula Games accounts, play the game, and save their account data.

However, compared to typical VR games, the pricing of *Rainbow Six Siege* was slightly cheaper.

After all, the game itself featured in-app purchase content similar to cosmetic skins, and it was purely an online game with no single-player content.

The domestic price was set at 499 Yuan (Chinese currency), while the overseas pricing was 99 dollars.

As for overseas regions, there were no similar offline VR internet cafe events due to operational constraints.

………………

Time quickly arrived at February 1st. With the New Year arriving relatively late this year, there were still over half a month left.

For players who had long been eagerly awaiting *Rainbow Six Siege*, they couldn't wait to dive into the game the moment it unlocked.

Zhang Yi and Wang Han, who were already on their New Year's Holiday, made plans to head to a VR internet cafe together.

They actually owned VR gaming equipment themselves, but there was only one set at home.

Who got to play became a crucial factor. Plus, their old friend Song Ren had been busy before but was now free as the New Year approached.

So everyone seized this opportunity to meet up Offline (referring to real-life connections), enjoy the fun of gaming during the day, and then gather for dinner in the evening.

"There are so many people here! Seems like most of them are here to try out *Rainbow Six Siege*!" After paying and checking in at the front desk, Zhang Yi and the others found a private room with five sleeping pods available. In the center of the main hall hung a massive screen broadcasting a match of *Warcraft*, clearly a high-ranked player's session from the PC section of this internet cafe. Zhang Yi also noticed a small window on the side displaying a countdown for *Rainbow Six Siege*'s launch. Obviously, once the game went live, it would replace the current broadcast as the featured gameplay.

"Well, it's almost New Year, and lately, hasn't this been the only blockbuster released?" Song Ren wasn't particularly surprised.

"Alright, enough talk. Let's quickly get on the machines and log in to wait for the server launch. By the way, did you guys buy the game?" Wang Han asked.

"Of course we did! How could we not buy Mr. Chen's game?" Song Ren replied.

Wang Yifan and Joey nodded in agreement.

Chatting as they went, the group entered the gaming pods, eagerly anticipating the game's launch.

The moment it unlocked, everyone rushed into the game as quickly as possible.

Previously, Chen Xu and NetDragon Games had discussed with the Game Department about the possibility of releasing the military version to players, but in the end, they couldn't make it happen.

However, the differences between the military version and the player version were mostly in minor details.

For example, in hostage scenarios, defenders could force hostages to move to positions advantageous to them—this was already predetermined.

Additionally, the game provided absolutely no hints. There was no notification telling players their position was exposed when scanned.

Heartbeat Sensors didn't emit obvious beeping sounds, and equipment like breaching rounds had different performance and destructive power compared to what players experienced in regular gameplay.

Chen Xu estimated that if these elements were presented to players, they might find it interesting at first.

But soon, they would stop playing—it would just be a selling point.

After all, it was far too unbalanced. For attackers, the disadvantage would be extreme.

But that was closer to real-life situations.

"The game forces you to go through the new player tutorial!" Zhang Yi said in the voice channel.

"Same here. What's the big deal about a tutorial? It'll be over quickly, right?" Song Ren responded.

"I've already started!"

Compared to the *Rainbow Six Siege* from his previous life, Chen Xu had put considerable effort into the game's guidance system.

The root reason was that *Rainbow Six Siege* wasn't a simple casual game.

The maps were slightly more complex than those in typical FPS games. Without consulting a map guide, getting lost during your first playthrough of *Rainbow Six Siege* was practically routine.

Add to that the various Operators' unique skills, making the learning curve quite steep.

Therefore, upon entering the game, players would undergo relevant new player training.

Additionally, the game included an in-game information system.

This featured skill effect demonstration videos for each Operator, layered maps of the levels, and camera locations.

All designed to better assist players in understanding these elements within the game.

Song Ren was the first to enter the game's tutorial.

Eleven Operators were displayed, but currently, only the Recruit was available.

So there wasn't much choice.

He entered the game tutorial.

"Shooting, running, crouching, prone, stealth walk, fast roping... You can breach windows like this too!"

Song Ren watched as the character in the game kicked off the wall, swung back on the rope, and slammed through wooden planks to breach the window, visibly excited.

Scenes like this, usually only seen in movies, felt incredibly cool with the VR perspective's feedback—utterly awesome!

Other operations didn't pose much of a problem.

The only thing was that character movements—running and walking—were relatively slow in this game.

But it made sense. After all, carrying counter-terrorism gear weighing十几斤 to二十几斤, how could they not be slow?

"So this is how attackers operate: start with a small drone, enter the building, and begin investigating and collecting information."

"Hey, will I be detected if I scan? So if someone scans me, I'll get a notification too."

Looking at the notification screen that appeared after his drone, peeking through a door crack to scan enemies, was immediately destroyed by AI, Song Ren suddenly understood.

The entire new player tutorial didn't cover overly complex content, focusing mainly on basic knowledge.

Operations, information gathering and feedback for attackers and defenders, functions of different equipment, how to use Operator skills, and how to win in three different modes.

After completing a total of five new player tutorial levels, Song Ren, no stranger to FPS games, passed through quickly.

Then he obtained selection qualification for 10 Operators—five attackers and five defenders.

Since he didn't know which ones were good, apart from setting Feng (Mythra) as a must-pick attacker and Lesion as a must-pick defender.

Though the character's real name was Liao Zilang, saying "Lesion" just felt so much more natural with that English name.

For the remaining slots, he picked randomly.

For example, Blackbeard, Ash, and Sledge—characters that left a strong impression on him from the promotional video. For the last slot, he didn't particularly like shield-bearing characters, so he turned his attention to a Russian character.

Fuze, according to the description, specialized in explosives—both his Operator skill and equipment revolved around explosives. Clearly a powerhouse in firepower output, a perfect match for him.

"You guys haven't finished the tutorial yet?" After selecting his Operators, the voice channel fell silent. Song Ren broke the silence, feeling a bit depressed.

"Not yet, I'm only on the third level!"

"Just reached the fourth level! The sense of immersion in this game is really strong! And destroying buildings is especially fun!"

"Yeah! I've destroyed everything in the building that could be torn down!"

Hearing their responses, Song Ren felt even more frustrated.

The fastest among them had only just started the fourth level?

"Then I'll go try out Terrorist Hunt Mode first to warm up. When you're done, call me!" Song Ren said.

Waiting around was a bit boring, so he decided to try out Terrorist Hunt Mode.

From the description, it seemed to be the game's PVE content, and it supported solo play—perfect for passing time while waiting for his friends.

As for the information station?

He never bothered with that when playing games!

A veteran FPS player like him—did he need it?

"Regular, Hardened, Realistic? Let's try Realistic difficulty this time."

Looking at the available options, Song Ren decided to give the Realistic difficulty in Lone Wolf Terrorist Hunt a try.

Let's see just how realistic this difficulty really was.
