Chapter 85: Could This Be the Peach Garden?


After finishing the new player tutorial, Zhang Yi and the others officially entered the game.

On the main interface, numerous players could already be seen chatting in the lobby.

Clearly, these were the exhibition attendees.

The five computers provided for the experience were set up in a private match by default. Since the computers weren't arranged side by side, there was no way to glance sideways and peek at someone else's screen to figure out their identity.

Only the Lord's identity was revealed; all others remained hidden.

Zhang Yi happened to draw the Lord role and chose Liu Bei as his general.

On one hand, this gave him a strong sense of immersion—after all, Liu Bei was historically the ruler of Shu Han.

On the other hand, he was simply more familiar with this general, having already used him during the tutorial.

The gameplay was straightforward: distribute cards to others and perform healing.

As for the others, Wang Han was a Rebel who chose Zhao Yun as her general.

Song Ren was the Loyalist, picking Zhuge Liang.

The remaining player, Wang Yifan, belonged to the Spy faction and selected Sun Shangxiang.

The other girl, Joey, chose Zhen Ji.

All of them were carefully reading through their general's skill descriptions.

Having just completed the tutorial, they only had a vague understanding of the game and were still unsure about their own abilities.

After finalizing their selections, the game officially began.

As Lord, Zhang Yi first examined his hand cards, equipping himself with a Zhangba Snake Spear and a Defensive Horse. He then played Southern Barbarian Invasion, immediately dealing one point of damage to Sun Shangxiang.

The others, however, each had a "Sha" (Attack) card and thus avoided taking damage.

Since it was still early in the game and unclear who the Rebels, Loyalists, or Spy were, Zhang Yi chose a safe, conservative playstyle—holding back.

Next was Wang Han, seated to his left. Without hesitation, she equipped herself with a Guan Stone Axe.

Though she hadn't drawn a "Sha," she held three "Shan" (Dodge) cards.

Activating Zhao Yun's skill, she used a "Shan" as a "Sha" and attacked Zhang Yi.

"To advance and retreat is truly a divine weapon!"

Accompanied by Zhao Yun's iconic line, a striking attack animation flashed across the screen.

"Shan!" Zhang Yi calmly discarded a "Shan."

Wang Han then discarded two more "Shan" cards, triggering the Guan Stone Axe's ability and forcibly dealing one damage point to Zhang Yi.

"Zilong, Zilong! I never expected the Rebel to be you!" Zhang Yi exclaimed dramatically, instantly jumping into character upon Wang Han's betrayal, overcome by theatrical flair.

Though he lost one health point, he remained calm.

After all, his Liu Bei could heal.

Once he identified the Loyalist, he'd immediately send them two cards.

That was true generosity!

"Hmph! Just wait till I take down your incompetent Lord!" Wang Han sneered before ending her turn.

After Wang Han's turn ended, play proceeded clockwise to Joey.

As a Rebel, she immediately activated Zhen Ji's Luo Shen skill.

"Graceful as light clouds veiling the moon, drifting like snow swirling in the wind."

She successfully passed the judgment three times in a row—an incredibly lucky draw—obtaining a Spade A Zhuge Repeating Crossbow and a Spade 6 card, "Indulge in Pleasure and Forget Home."

The third draw, a Block "Shan," failed the judgment.

After quickly reviewing her hand, Joey immediately turned against Zhang Yi.

She played "Indulge in Pleasure and Forget Home" directly.

Then Joey froze in embarrassment.

"Why can't I attack Old Zhang!?" Holding a "Sha" in her hand, she realized she could only target Zhao Yun and Sun Shangxiang, the players adjacent to her.

Hearing Joey's outburst, Wang Yifan grumbled, "Didn't the tutorial clearly explain the rules? You need an Offensive Horse or a weapon with an attack range greater than one to attack non-adjacent players. Your Zhuge Repeating Crossbow doesn't have enough range!"

"Go back and study the tutorial properly. Now you're exposed and completely helpless."

But even as the words left his mouth, the in-game Zhen Ji struck, playing a "Sha" directly at his Sun Shangxiang.

"For talking too much!"

Unable to attack the Lord and with her Rebel identity now exposed, Sun Shangxiang—whether Loyalist or Spy—was clearly not on her side.

From a strategic standpoint, eliminating her was the right move, especially since she could only legally target Sun Shangxiang.

On a personal level—because you just had to talk!

"Wait, this is just using public power for personal revenge!" Wang Yifan's eyes widened.

What had he done to deserve this?

Even worse, he had no "Shan" in hand.

His cards were one "Create Something from Nothing," one "Take a Goat in Passing," and two Offensive Horses.

From one perspective, this was a dream start—"Heaven's Blessing."

From another, it was a nightmare.

Under the weight of despair, the second "Sha" struck.

Combined with the damage he'd taken earlier from Southern Barbarian Invasion, he became the first player eliminated.

"Good grief, this general is too fierce! If you keep drawing black cards with Luo Shen, aren't you basically Invincible?" Zhang Yi's eyes widened in shock.

Thankfully, someone had taken the hit for him—after all, he only had one "Shan" left in hand.

Comparing himself, he felt his Liu Bei was utterly useless!

What good was giving cards to others!?

Wasn't this just letting everyone else have fun?

It was like going to a foot massage parlor for a deluxe service—Liu Bei's role was essentially: "Guys, enjoy yourselves! I'm treating tonight!"

But don't just pay for others—join in the fun yourself!

"Why is everyone ganging up on me!?"

Wang Yifan listened helplessly to the in-game Bow-waisted Princess's mournful cry: "No... I can't die yet..." He was utterly speechless.

His very first round of Sanguosha had ended in such a sudden defeat?

The worst part—he hadn't even played a single card!

"Friendly reminder—it's not that we're ganging up on you. Only Joey targeted you!" Wang Han chuckled.

"Tsk tsk, tragic. Lucky I'm sitting after you," Song Ren added, visibly relieved.

Of the five players... well, actually, four were now deeply engaged in the game.

Meanwhile, spectators watching via the large screen—those who hadn't played but only observed—were equally amused by the scene.

This was just unbelievably unlucky.

At the same time, many players gained a clearer understanding of the game.

They realized that aside from strategy, luck played a massive role in Sanguosha.

In fact, legendary "Heaven's Blessing" hands could occur.

For instance, if Zhen Ji drew the Zhuge Repeating Crossbow, could attack the Lord, and continuously judged black "Sha" cards, couldn't she eliminate the Lord in a single turn?

Skill mattered, but so did luck.

Experienced gamers quickly analyzed and identified the core characteristics of Sanguosha.

Ordinary players, however, didn't think that deeply.

To them, the game simply seemed exciting and surprisingly easy to grasp.

The game continued, but the battlefield entered a stalemate. Zhang Yi and Song Ren, playing Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang respectively, perfectly mirrored their historical ruler-minister relationship—one the Lord, the other the Chancellor.

But it had to be said—these two skills didn't synergize well at all.

And their seating positions were particularly awkward.

"Old Zhang! I don't know how Zhuge Liang died in history, but one thing's clear—I, as Zhuge Liang, will definitely be killed by you!" 

Staring at his hand—"Borrowed Knife to Kill" and one "Sha"—he felt like cursing.

He had just emptied his hand last turn, and now drew two more cards.

At least give me a "Shan"!

His Empty Fort skill hadn't triggered even once!

Thankfully, earlier he'd used the Observe Stars skill to play "Cross the River and Demolish the Bridge," removing Zhen Ji's Zhuge Repeating Crossbow. Otherwise, he'd have died a thousand times over.

"Sorry, my health is a bit dangerous. Bear with me," Zhang Yi said lightly, coughing twice.

What could he do? He was just as desperate.

Compared to the Rebels Zhao Yun and Zhen Ji, their general skills seemed decent individually.

But combined with their seating order? They were nothing but a dopey fool!

"Stop your futile resistance!"

"Yeah, just surrender already."

Wang Han and Joey were now fully equipped—weapons, armor, Defensive and Offensive Horses, the works—though their health was poor, both down to two points.

"Hmph, surrender? Surrender is impossible! The time for a comeback has arrived!" Song Ren's eyes lit up as he drew his card, thrilled.

"Lord, fear not! I, Liang, have a plan!" Song Ren declared dramatically.

Then the in-game Zhuge Liang spoke his line:

"Lightning!"

A flash of light streaked across the screen, and a lightning icon appeared above Zhuge Liang's head.

"Brilliant plan! Chancellor, your strategy is truly magnificent! Combined with your Observe Stars, the Rebels will have nowhere to run!" 

Seeing the lightning icon appear over Song Ren, Zhang Yi instantly understood.

Though it was their first game, after the initial confusion, they had mostly grasped the rules.

Invincible!

"Ah! No 'Cross the River and Demolish the Bridge' or 'Take a Goat in Passing'!"

"Me neither!"

When Wang Han and Joey's turns came, neither had cards to remove equipment.

They attempted to force-kill Zhuge Liang, but he still had a Peach and healed himself immediately.

"It's okay, Joey. We still have hope. As long as luck is on our side and the lightning doesn't strike us, we can eliminate him in our next turn," Wang Han said.

"Hmph, don't delude yourselves! The comeback has begun! Long live the Chancellor of Great Han!" Zhang Yi declared triumphantly.

But before he could finish, the in-game Zhuge Liang uttered a line:

"Create Something from Nothing!"

??????

"Wait, Old Song, what are you doing!?" Zhang Yi's eyes bulged.

Song Ren, just realizing what he'd done, looked equally embarrassed.

Initially, he had remembered using Observe Stars to position the Lightning card.

But here was the problem.

Among the four cards, he spotted a "Create Something from Nothing" and instinctively moved it to the second position.

When he drew that card, he couldn't resist the urge.

Drawing two extra cards—what an irresistible temptation!

Anyone would have done the same!

Besides, he noticed the fourth card—the upcoming judgment card—was actually a Bagua Array.

It was fate!

"It's fine, probably not a big deal. Emperor Liu is blessed with divine protection..." But before he could finish, he fell silent.

Because in the center of the screen, the judgment card was revealed.

Spade 7 "Sha."

The Lightning judgment condition was Spade 2 through Spade 9—so the Lightning effect triggered.

Instantly, a dark cloud gathered above the in-game Liu Bei. Thunder roared, and a bolt of lightning struck him directly.

"Could this be the Peach Garden...?"

Hearing Liu Bei's final words, Zhang Yi remained expressionless. Wang Yifan, already eliminated, struggled to hold back laughter.

Song Ren looked utterly bewildered.

Wang Han and Joey high-fived in celebration.

"Chancellor, care to explain?" Zhang Yi shot Song Ren a sideways glance.

"Ahem... let's try playing Fall Guys instead! Chen Xu wasn't lying this time—this game really is fun!" 

Facing the intensely awkward moment, Song Ren noticed the commotion around the Fall Guys station and quickly shifted the topic.
