Chapter 287: The Milky Fragrance Is Too Strong! (6th Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Over the course of two days, Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and others at Nebula Games had been continuously developing the several RPG maps provided by Chen Xu.

Currently, the development was basically nearing its end.

Still, there were parts that needed further refinement.

"You guys haven't left work yet?" Chen Xu looked at the group in the company, slightly puzzled.

It was already quitting time, and there wasn't any urgent work requiring overtime.

"Well, today Mr. Chen, aren't you live streaming on Shark TV? Let's watch, watch," Qin Yi chuckled awkwardly.

Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, Lin Tao, Lin Rou, and even Zhang Yida from the operations department all nodded like little chickens pecking at rice.

Hearing them, Chen Xu was slightly speechless. "You all have phones, can't you just watch on the live streaming platforms directly?"

The group just chuckled sheepishly, not offering further explanation.

Could watching live in person really be the same as watching a stream?

Shaking his head, Chen Xu didn't press them further. He stretched lazily and walked over to the project office. Previously, during the Monster Hunter: World live stream, he had streamed from here.

This time, he had already coordinated in advance with Shark TV, even having an official host and commentator assigned.

Chen Xu also turned on the cameras on his computer, making sure his keyboard and mouse operations were visible to others—just in case competitors tried to slander or awkwardly attack him later.

Entering the live stream room, a dense stream of bullet comments scrolled across the screen.

Although the screen was still black, clearly many people were already waiting for the show to begin.

Then Chen Xu opened the streaming software.

Without setting any delay or other features, the moment the streaming connection succeeded, the live stream displayed Chen Xu's side of the画面.

Instantly, the audience in the live stream room exploded.

"It's really Chen Xu!?"

"He's actually going to play against professional players? I wonder if Mr. Chen can win even one game tonight?"

"Feels really uncertain!"

"Mr. Chen, how about we nerf the Orcs just a bit? Let's pretend this never happened?"

Bullet comments flooded the screen.

Over the past two days, players from all over, especially Warcraft players, had been discussing nothing but tonight's event.

Especially regarding Chen Xu's personal skill level, players had their own opinions.

"Alright, everyone, stop spamming. The theme tonight is simple: you all think Warcraft has balance issues, but as the Game Designer, I believe it doesn't."

"So the solution is simple. Warcraft is a high-depth competitive RTS game. I'll play against some high-level players—then you'll see whether there are balance issues or not."

"Of course, it won't be like what some of you might expect—me getting utterly destroyed playing all four races from start to finish, then claiming the game is balanced. Tonight, I'll mainly showcase each race's unique characteristics and some tactical gameplay. Currently, most people feel Orcs are strong, primarily because various Orc tactics have been explored and developed by players," Chen Xu joked, while simultaneously entering a host game.

While chatting casually with the audience, Chen Xu quietly opened his system and used the Keyboard Spewing Milk Card he had drawn earlier. Was it just an illusion?

After using it, Chen Xu suddenly sensed a strange milky fragrance wafting from somewhere.

Meanwhile, in the official commentary channel for tonight’s Warcraft Balance Exhibition Match, Shark TV had assigned two professional commentators to explain the event.

"As you all know, tonight's program features Mr. Chen—the designer of Warcraft—crossing swords with professional players, mainly in response to the current balance debates surrounding the game."

"Mr. Chen's intention is good, and I think what he says makes a lot of sense. Warcraft is a newly released game. I played it briefly right after launch. Everyone's still exploring the different races, so claiming it's unbalanced right now feels rather hasty. Look, professional players from the Human race, Night Elf, and Undead haven't complained about imbalance."

"However, I think Mr. Chen is going to be in serious trouble tonight," Huang Donglai, himself a well-known RTS player, offered his assessment.

"Brother Huang, I think you're jumping the gun a bit. We don't even know Mr. Chen's skill level yet. What if he's actually really strong?" Sun Yixie, sitting beside him, voiced disagreement.

"Ah, impossible! Just look at the opponents Mr. Chen is facing tonight—I suspect someone's setting this up on purpose. Look at who he's been matched against! All top-tier players: Guadi, undefeated from open qualifiers to group stage—I was stunned by his triple-line operations. Do you know what Warcraft players call him now? He's not human—he's a god! GOD!"

"Then there's Satellite, nicknamed 'Lu Bu, Lu Fengxian'! And The Grandmaster also showed overwhelming dominance in the group stage. Each of them is insanely strong, okay?"

"Well, let's just wait and see who Mr. Chen's first opponent is."

"Oh no! First up is 'Shu Ben'! Though his career includes over twenty second-place finishes, and he seems to still be adjusting after switching to Warcraft, his strength is absolutely not to be underestimated. His main race is Orcs, and his fast attack strategy has won every group stage game in under 15 minutes."

"Mr. Chen is in deep trouble now! Ah, I can't even bear to watch!" Huang Donglai sighed dramatically on the commentary desk.

Bullet comments in the live stream room also flooded with teary-eyed emojis.

Inside the match room, Chen Xu and the first professional player he would face tonight gradually entered the host.

At a training room in a club somewhere in Modu, the player known as Shu Ben felt rather apprehensive.

After all, his opponent tonight wasn't just anyone—it was the game's designer.

In RTS games, the gap between veterans and regular players was still huge.

He had twenty-plus runner-up titles—was it just bad luck?

No, it was simply that his skill wasn't on par with others.

If it were an ordinary player, he wouldn't mind utterly dominating them.

But the problem was, his opponent was Chen Xu. If he tormented the designer too badly, what would happen? The Orcs would surely get nerfed into oblivion.

After all, he actually believed that the current strength of Orcs stemmed from many players delving deeply into Orc tactics.

At least when he played against Night Elf and Human race pros, the win rate was roughly 60-40.

And that even accounted for map variables.

But if he went easy on purpose, he didn't dare either.

Because if he did, and later online rumors spread that he'd been bought off by Nebula Games to engage in match-fixing, that would be an even bigger disaster.

With an extremely nervous mindset, Shu Ben entered the game. There was a five-second freeze time before the game started, giving players time to think and perform basic courtesy rituals.

After both players typed "GLHF" (Good Luck, Have Fun) on screen as a polite gesture, Shu Ben made up his mind.

No matter what—he'd just play normally and genuinely.

Meanwhile, in Nebula Games' project office, Chen Xu remained quite relaxed, his thoughts unusually clear. Clearly, the commentators on the main stage didn't think highly of him!

Everything was progressing smoothly—except for one thing about the item. The milky fragrance was just too strong.
