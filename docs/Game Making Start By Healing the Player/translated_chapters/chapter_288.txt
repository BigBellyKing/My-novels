## Chapter 287: The Milky Fragrance is Too Strong! (6th Update, Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)

Over the past two days, Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and others at Nebula Games had been continuously developing the RPG maps Chen Xu provided.

At present, the development was basically coming to an end. However, some content still needed to be refined.

"Aren't you all leaving work?" Chen Xu looked at everyone in the company with a hint of surprise.

It was past closing time, and there was no urgent work requiring overtime today.

"Well, Mr. Chen, weren't you live streaming on Shark TV tonight? We're here to watch, to watch!" Qin Yi grinned awkwardly.

Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, Lin Tao, Lin Rou, and even Zhang Yida from the Operations Department all nodded like chickens pecking at rice.

Chen Xu felt a little speechless hearing them. "You all have phones, don't you? Why don't you just watch on the live streaming platform?"

The few of them chuckled but didn't offer much explanation.

How could watching live in person be the same as watching a stream?

Shaking his head, Chen Xu ignored them, stretched, and walked to the project office. He had live-streamed *Monster Hunter: World* in the same way before.

This time, he had already communicated with Shark TV in advance, and there was even a dedicated official host and commentator. At the same time, Chen Xu also turned on his computer's camera, making sure the keyboard and mouse area was visible to prevent competitors from slandering him with baseless accusations.

Upon entering the live streaming room, countless bullet comments scrolled across the screen.

Even though it was still a black screen, it was clear many people were already waiting for the show.

Then, Chen Xu launched the live streaming software. He hadn't set any delays or anything similar. The moment the streaming successfully connected, his screen was displayed in the live room.

Instantly, the audience in the live room erupted.

"It's really Chen Xu!?"

"He's actually going to play against professional players? I wonder if Mr. Chen can win a single match tonight?"

"It feels very uncertain!"

"Mr. Chen, why don't we just nerf the Orcs and pretend this never happened?"

The bullet comments in the live room were continuously refreshing.

Over the past two days, players, especially *Warcraft* players, had been constantly discussing this very event. Regarding Chen Xu's personal skill, players all had different opinions.

"Alright, everyone, stop spamming. The theme today is simple: you all feel that *Warcraft* has balance issues, but as the game designer, I believe there are no problems."

"So, the solution is also simple. Since *Warcraft* is an RTS game with considerable competitive depth, I'll just play against some high-level players, and then you'll know if there are any balance issues."

"Of course, it won't be like some of you imagine, where I play all four races and get thrashed repeatedly, then claim there are no balance issues. Today, I'll mainly demonstrate the characteristics of each race and some tactical gameplay. Currently, everyone generally feels the Orcs are relatively strong, mainly because their various tactics have been thoroughly explored by players," Chen Xu said with a laugh, while also joining a host lobby in advance.

While chatting with the players, Chen Xu quietly opened the system and used the Keyboard Spewing Milk Card he had previously drawn. He wondered if it was just his imagination; after using it, Chen Xu inexplicably detected a milky fragrance from somewhere.

Meanwhile, in the official commentary channel for tonight's *Warcraft* Balance Exhibition Match, Shark TV had two professional commentators introducing the general situation for the evening.

"As you all know, tonight's event is about Mr. Chen, the designer of *Warcraft*, going head-to-head with professional players, mainly to address the current balance issues surrounding the game."

"Mr. Chen's idea is good, and I think what he said makes a lot of sense. After all, *Warcraft* is a newly released game. I played it a bit myself when it first came out, and everyone is still figuring out the various racial developments. So, saying the balance is bad right now, I think, is a bit presumptuous. You see, even the Human, Night Elf, and Undead professional players haven't complained about the balance."

"However, with this event, I think Mr. Chen is in for trouble tonight." Huang Donglai, a renowned RTS player himself, offered his judgment.

"Brother Huang, I think you might be speaking a bit too soon. We don't know Mr. Chen's skill level yet, what if he's really strong?" Sun Yixie interjected.

"Oh, impossible! Look at the opponents Mr. Chen is facing tonight. I even suspect they're trying to stir up trouble! Who are these opponents they've chosen? They're all from the strongest batch, like Guadi, who went undefeated from the open qualifiers to the group stage. His three-line operations blew my mind! Do you know what *Warcraft* players call him now? He's not human, he's a god! He's GOD!"

"And Satellite, who's been nicknamed Lu Bu, Lu Fengxian! Plus, The Grandmaster also showed extremely strong dominance in the group stage. Every one of them is fierce as a tiger, alright?"

"Anyway, let's see who Mr. Chen's first opponent is tonight?"

"Oh no! It's over! The first one up is 'Shu Ben!' Although he has over twenty runner-up finishes in his professional career, and he seems to still be adapting to his transition to *Warcraft*, his strength is absolutely not to be underestimated. His main race is Orc, and in the games he won in the group stage, none of his fast attacks exceeded 15 minutes."

"This time, Mr. Chen is in for trouble! Oh, I can't bear to watch!" Huang Donglai sighed repeatedly from the commentator's desk.

Including the bullet comments in the live room, many also spammed teary-eyed emojis.

In the match room, Chen Xu and the first professional player he was to face tonight entered the lobby one after another.

At this moment, in a training room at a club in Modu, the player named Shu Ben felt a bit apprehensive.

After all, his opponent tonight wasn't just anyone; it was the game's designer.

And in RTS games, the gap between masters and ordinary players is significant.

He had accumulated over twenty runner-up titles; was it just bad luck? No, his skill simply wasn't as good as others.

If it were an ordinary player, he would crush them. But the key was that his opponent was Chen Xu. If he crushed him too badly, what would happen if the Orc race got nerfed into the ground?

Because he actually believed that the Orcs' current strength was mainly due to many players delving into their intricacies.

At least when he played against some Night Elf and Human players, the win-loss ratio was roughly 6:4.

And he also had to consider the map factors. But going easy? He was a little afraid to do that too.

After all, if he went easy, and then rumors started circulating online that he was paid by Nebula Games to fix the match, it would be even worse.

With immense apprehension, Shu Ben entered the game. Before the game started, there was a five-second freeze time, allowing players to think and engage in simple courtesies.

After exchanging the polite phrase GLHF on screen, Shu Ben made up his mind. He decided to just play his normal game, seriously.

Back in Nebula Games' project office, Chen Xu was quite relaxed, and his thoughts had become remarkably clear. Clearly, the commentators on the main stage didn't think much of his chances!

Everything was progressing smoothly, except for one small thing with the item: the milky fragrance was a bit too strong.
