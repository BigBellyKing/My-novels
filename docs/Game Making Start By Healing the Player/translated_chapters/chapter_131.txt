Author's Note on Release

Mwah…… The book has gone on sale today. I'm not good at speeches, so to make a long story short……

How far a book can go depends entirely on subscriptions. I hope everyone can show their support.

Since the beginning of this novel, I’m deeply grateful for all your votes and rewards.

The final update will be released around 6 p.m. Because I don’t have any saved drafts (crying), I’ll write as much as I can manage, but it won’t be less than ten thousand characters.

As for extra updates: the current收藏 (collection count) is 20,000. Starting from zero, every additional 200 average subscriptions will trigger one extra chapter. Additionally, donations have produced one Alliance Master, granting one extra chapter. The total donation amount has reached 120,000 points—each 10,000 points count as one extra chapter, totaling 12 extra chapters.

Of course, I won’t release them all at once. With a guaranteed pull of at least two extra updates, I’ll release the rest gradually over time.

Finally, thank you to all my readers, and special thanks to my editor, Niqiu.

That’s it, mwah (sound of a kiss, an affectionate sign-off)! I hope you’ll support legitimate subscriptions.
