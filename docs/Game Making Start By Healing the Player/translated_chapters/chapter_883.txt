Chapter 882: First Experience

The first reaction of players who had finished watching the entire promotional trailer was confusion.

While this art style surprised many players, it wasn't unprecedented for Nebula Games. The previous Xenoblade Chronicles, for example, adopted a similar style. And if one were to talk about "chuuni" tendencies, the scene in the promotional trailer where a contract seemed to be signed could be said to have been frequently enacted in Xenoblade Chronicles as well.

What sparked more debate among players, however, was the game's gameplay and background.

It appeared to feature a turn-based combat system, yet the game also exhibited characteristics of a visual novel. One moment, players were battling monsters in a strange castle; the next, they were working part-time, fishing in cities like Shibuya, and even attending school.

Judging by the character designs in the promotional trailer, the protagonist seemed to be a high school student. Although Rex from Xenoblade Chronicles next door was also a soft and cute boy, that was, after all, a fantasy setting.

However, this Persona game, at least from the content revealed so far, clearly possessed a modern setting. High school student, saving the world... once these elements combined, the game's unique flavor immediately emerged.

Many players also began discussing this unique game.

"This flavor is too strong! High school student + saving the world + chuuni, holy crap, Mr. Chen just maxed out the elements!"

"And with a Japanese island nation setting, it's just incredible!"

"Speaking of which, I'd bet my chest on it, there's definitely gonna be all kinds of beautiful girls in the game, just don't know if they'll be 'big' or not!"

"Can you guys stop discussing that stuff? Can't we talk about the game itself? Didn't you notice the game's background setting is really interesting? Cognitive change, hypnosis, and all sorts of demons, so it's materializing people's negative emotions?"

"Indeed, and based on earlier dialogue, the protagonist's 'Phantom Thieves' seem to possess the power to change people's hearts."

"Did everyone notice the game's music and color scheme are super cool?! And the monsters in the game are all from various mythologies around the world."

"I actually quite like this type of game, and the protagonist's appearance also gives me a strong sense of immersion."

"Pfft! Shameless!"

Players discussed this unique game, but for most, discussion aside, they were definitely still going to buy it.

On one hand, it was due to Nebula Games' reputation built over the years; on the other hand, as a next-gen VR launch title, players didn't have many other choices.

Although players learned from the previous official press conference that it would be compatible with older VR versions, there wasn't much difference in the experience. Furthermore, next-gen adaptation would require game developers to push subsequent update patches.

So, to experience the latest next-gen feel, players clearly had few options.

………………

At Zhang Yi's home, looking at the newly installed next-gen VR gaming pod, he appeared extremely excited.

"You and Old Song have such dog-shit luck; usually, when you run a Warcraft dungeon, you get nothing but trash, yet you actually managed to snatch one of these."

Wang Han next to him couldn't help but complain.

"That's not luck, that's hand speed, alright!" Zhang Yi said proudly.

Although the new era VR gaming pods weren't sold via lottery but by limited purchase, as a new product launch—and with a price only double that of the old VR gaming pods—they still immediately sold out amidst simultaneous purchasing by so many domestic players.

At this point, the importance of internet speed, hand speed, and equipment performance became evident.

These three core elements were absolutely indispensable.

"I'll play for two hours first, you cook and wash the dishes, then the remaining six or seven hours tonight are all yours." Zhang Yi finally felt like the head of the household.

"Look at you, so smug!" Wang Han pouted, looking at the triumphant Zhang Yi but not offering any opposing words.

While she liked Nebula Games in the past, she wasn't as enthusiastic. But Persona was different; the protagonist in the previous promotional trailer had truly impressed her with his coolness.

Moreover, the highly fashionable art design and theme music made her eager to experience the game thoroughly.

So, she took on the day's chores in exchange for a longer gaming experience tonight. There was no other way; after all, she hadn't managed to snag the gaming pod herself, otherwise, their roles would have been completely reversed.

Zhang Yi watched Wang Han leave the room, gently closing the door behind her, then quickly slipped into the gaming pod, excitedly pumping his fist.

How long had it been since he'd felt this way!? When was the last time he'd ordered her around like that, years ago?

To be able to play a favorite game right away, and not have to do chores, this feeling was awesome!

Entering the gaming pod, the view before him plunged into darkness.

After messing around for over ten minutes, and consulting the pop-up electronic manual, Zhang Yi finally understood the various functions of the new gaming pod.

This time, Persona had the game pre-installed when it left the factory. Players only needed to connect online, log into their Nebula Games Platform account, and after a permission check confirming the purchase, they could directly enter.

After confirming the entry selection, the system settings for the pre-game experience began.

There wasn't much difference from previous VR games; after making a few customary adjustments, Zhang Yi officially started the game.

Then Zhang Yi felt a sensation different from before.

Although it shared the cartoon-anime art style of Xenoblade Chronicles and Zelda, Persona spared no detail.

The character's body movements and facial expressions were extremely well-done. When Joker spoke in the game, the facial muscle reactions were incredibly detailed; even the slight twitch of an eyebrow or the subtle shift of an eyeball could be seen clearly.

Set in a casino, the ensuing plot involved a series of previous escapes, followed by betrayal and capture.

However, after this sequence, the official game content presented to Zhang Yi left him a little bewildered.

Judging from the game's background, it was a flashback.

That is, Ren Amamiya, imprisoned in jail, recounted the events of his past.

And all of this traced back to when Ren Amamiya first enrolled in Shujin Academy High School.

One night, while returning home, Ren Amamiya, driven by a sense of justice, intervened to save a woman being harassed by a drunken man and ended up injuring him.

However, he hadn't expected the other party to be an ordinary person; instead, the influential man falsely accused Ren Amamiya of intentional assault, leading to his arrest by the police.

Consequently, Ren Amamiya received a suspension from his hometown school and a probation period. He was forced to leave his home, transfer to Shujin Academy in Tokyo as a second-year student, and reside at Cafe LeBlanc, run by his parents' friend in Yongen-Jaya.

This segment of the plot gave Zhang Yi a feeling similar to when he first played Detroit: Become Human.

Except that it had transitioned from realism to cartoons, and from a societal setting to a school one.

Then, on his very first day of school, Ren Amamiya unintentionally encountered a blonde-haired boy named Ryuji Sakamoto on the way, and together they entered Suguru Kamoshida's Palace, 'The Castle'.
