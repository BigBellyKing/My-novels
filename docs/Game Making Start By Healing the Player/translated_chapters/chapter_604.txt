Chapter 603: Chen Xu's Mercy? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Li Yue took a deep breath as he emerged from the gaming pod.

As a thread-based game, the playthrough of "The Last of Us" was neither too long nor too short. If one didn't get stuck on a level at normal difficulty and didn't deliberately focus on collecting items, it could be cleared in about 10 hours. Out of three days of experience time, he spent a day and a half.

He wasn't the only one; reporters from other media outlets were also in the same situation. Li Yue glanced around; many were still in their gaming pods, but some had clearly finished and emerged. After all, everyone's progress was roughly similar.

"It's simply... simply incredible!" Li Yue walked towards two reporters who were talking by the window. As he approached, he heard one of the Black reporters exclaim in astonishment.

"Exactly, the combat system isn't particularly brilliant, the apocalyptic setting is quite cliché, and even though the story is excellent, there are no shocking twists. Yet, it just moved me. The game's interactive performance and atmosphere creation can only be described as divine," another white, blonde youth sincerely praised.

"And the span of time," Li Yue interjected, joining the conversation, "from the Boston quarantine zone to the final Salt Lake City, the scenes and time jumps in between are massive, filled with all sorts of details constantly hinting at Joel and Ellie's relationship."

Hearing Li Yue's words, the other two showed no displeasure; instead, they nodded in strong agreement: "You're right! In terms of interactive presentation, you can only say this game used magic!"

"From the very beginning, we stepped into Chen Xu's trap. Sarah's death at the start, including Tess, and Bill, as well as Henry and Sam—everyone felt like a vast net, constantly tightening our emotions. Then, Ellie's first outburst in the cabin, followed by the tension brought by encountering David later, solidified Ellie and Joel's inseparable bond. This perfectly explained the later storyline of who was more important: Ellie or the world."

The three discussed various designs in the game, as well as some deeper allegories. Until another person joined them, saying something that silenced the three for a moment.

"But don't you think the most perfect part is that Chen Xu didn't twist the knife?" a brown-haired female reporter interjected.

It seemed there was indeed some truth to that.

So, was the most perfect part Chen Xu's mercy?

Li Yue and the other two exchanged glances.

While playing, their emotions were like a rollercoaster. Especially during the period when Joel was gravely injured, Li Yue was truly afraid that Chen Xu's big knife would suddenly 'plunge in.' And when Ellie was finally taken to the operating table, it also caused him immense worry. It wasn't until Joel escaped from the Fireflies with Ellie that he could finally breathe a sigh of relief.

"But Chen Xu's mercy only extended to this ending!"

"Exactly, the part with the brothers Sam and Henry was truly despair-inducing," the other two regained their composure and remarked with emotion.

As they chatted, other reviewers who had finished the game successively joined the discussion. Throughout more than ten hours of gameplay, everyone experienced everything alongside Joel and Ellie. From the Boston quarantine zone to the final Salt Lake City. They went through the changes of all four seasons: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. From urban areas to the wilderness, from schools to hospitals. Different scenes, different seasons, different enemies, and different companions. They experienced too much throughout the game, and lost just as much. Especially the final scene where Joel carried Ellie out of St. Mary's Hospital. It made everyone who played feel as if they were momentarily transported back to that night 20 years ago when the Cordyceps fungus infection crisis first broke out. Back then, Joel had also carried his daughter Sarah while fleeing, but the only difference was that 20 years ago, Joel couldn't properly protect his daughter. And 20 years later, Joel would absolutely not allow anyone to take Ellie away again.

A highly controversial point: Was the world more important, or was Ellie more important? Everyone who experienced the entire game personally could be said to have fully immersed themselves in Joel and Ellie's emotions. The answer they ultimately gave was completely consistent: screw the world; I just want Ellie to live.

…………

It could be said that "The Last of Us"' performance completely conquered all media reviewers. And upon careful reflection, there were actually many thought-provoking aspects within the game. Firstly, for the protagonists Joel and Ellie, after finally arriving at Tommy's town, could they truly survive well there? In the game's world, did humanity ultimately rebuild civilization? These were the broader questions. There were also smaller questions, such as what ultimately happened to Bill, who provided Joel with a car on their journey. In reality, there were many such detailed elements in the game. It was precisely because of this that "The Last of Us"' story was so touching. In a desperate world, every character seemed so vivid and real.

Some, like the suicidal couple Joel and Ellie saw in the hotel room, chose to escape this cruel world. Others, like the top-tier hunter David, had completely abandoned their human conscience; although still in human form, having cast aside their humanity, they could no longer truly be called human. How much difference was there between them and the Runners or Clickers? Yet, there were also those who, in this desperate and cruel world, still clung to their own convictions and beliefs. Just like Tommy and his group, they built their own beautiful home in this harsh apocalyptic environment. There was too much content in the game worthy of discussion.

………………

While these reviewing media outlets savored "The Last of Us" or utilized their review time to delve deeper into the game's content, players online had erupted in debate. This was mainly because after "The Last of Us" announced its launch date, no new information was released. Of course, if it were just that, it wouldn't be much. The key was that during this period, FOW also made a move, announcing the A-round test play time for "Wasteland 1981 (Game)". Although it was two days after "The Last of Us", FOW's news also captured the attention of many players. After all, the content previously showcased by this game was quite rich. In contrast, "The Last of Us"' promotion was somewhat Riddler-like, and there didn't seem to be any major highlights. Furthermore, FOW itself was considered a rival to Nebula Games, and with the excellent performance of its previous title, "Wasteland 1978", it had gathered many fans. For a time, fans of Nebula Games and FOW were fiercely clashing online, alongside an even larger number of spectators.

However, at this very moment, Chen Xu finally made a move. On the eve of "The Last of Us"' launch, Chen Xu and Nebula Games simultaneously posted on their official Weibo accounts. There was no text content, only a simple and clear image.
