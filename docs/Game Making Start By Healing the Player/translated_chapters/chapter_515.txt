Chapter 514: Making Grand Promises? Is This Really Making Grand Promises? This Is an Easter Egg! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Listening to Chen Xu's brief overview of the new game's worldview background, everyone had a general impression.

Evidently, they were about to develop a fantasy-type game.

"So, Mr. Chen, will this be an RPG-type game?" Yang Xin asked curiously.

Even with just a few words, Yang Xin managed to analyze a good deal of information.

In the introduction, it clearly emphasized exclusiveness and coldness, and the protagonist was a Witcher.

So, it was clear that in the game, Witchers, including so-called sorcerers, did not have a good relationship with humans.

At the same time, the game mentioned countries and factions, meaning there would certainly be more than one country in the game.

And since they were countries in a fantasy world setting, these countries obviously wouldn't be playing house. The player, as a Witcher, would inevitably be involved.

This was clearly the template for an RPG-type game. Otherwise, Chen Xu wouldn't have emphasized the game's worldview setting in such a way.

"Exactly, this will be an open-world ARPG," Chen Xu said with a smile, nodding at Yang Xin's words.

In terms of influence, the topic popularity of *Resident Evil* and *Bloodborne* was quite high. However, in terms of sales, it couldn't quite match the phenomenal popularity.

During this period, Zeus, after acquiring FOW, released *Medieval: Deliverance*, which, although it initially clashed with *Assassin's Creed*, wasn't a failure due to its excellent quality. Following this, FOW's technical capabilities, combined with the deep pockets of Zeus, led to the successive release of two more high-quality games. This significantly increased Zeus's market share.

In contrast, while Chen Xu developed *Resident Evil* and *Bloodborne*, their simultaneous launch on PC, coupled with the inherent characteristics of the games themselves, didn't have a huge impact on Huanyu VR.

As for domestic developers like NetDragon and TengHua, after TengHua's disastrous failure with *Chaotic Heroes*, they did release two decent-looking games. But 'decent' was all they were; they were still a far cry from being impactful flagship titles.

NetDragon, after the Waterloo of its previous sequel, did not focus on the VR platform in the latter half of last year and the first quarter of this year. Instead, it targeted Nebula Games' Switch. Combining its motion-control mode, NetDragon directly launched into a 'reheating old rice mode', pulling out a very classic game that had become obsolete due to the times: a game called *Dance Dance Revolution*.

In its early years, this was a globally renowned major IP, but it required specialized equipment like dance mats. Before VR and PC became mainstream, this IP was a global bestseller. However, as times changed, it gradually declined.

But when NetDragon ported it to the Switch and specifically optimized the gameplay modules, sales unexpectedly soared. This instantly opened a new world for NetDragon.

While their VR new title suffered a Waterloo, and declining revenue made their financial reports look bad, with industry investors losing confidence, here they were given a boost through the Switch. 'Hey! It's alive!'

Thus, NetDragon's attention immediately shifted to the Switch.

Meanwhile, other well-known overseas game developers saw Zeus's aggressive money-based strategy, causing many developers originally under Huanyu VR to switch allegiance to Zeus. This made the Game Department a little flustered, and Yang Chen had privately discussed it with Chen Xu.

Additionally, Chen Xu's identity was no longer just the boss of Nebula Games; he also held an honorary position in the Game Department. Of course, while it was an honorary position, he still had some special privileges.

For example, some of his games could get through review more easily. Otherwise, Chen Xu wouldn't have thought of making the next game.

*The Witcher*, or rather the third installment, *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt*, was the game Chen Xu chose next.

Compared to Souls-like and horror games, ARPGs arguably have the broadest global player base, even surpassing FPS games.

Although the *Witcher* series in his previous life was adapted from a Polish novel, it actually didn't matter. *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt* became a global sensation and was once hailed as one of the greatest ARPGs. Most players had not played the previous games or read the original novels.

And this did not affect their experience of Geralt of Rivia's story in the slightest. Because, although it was an adaptation, aside from using The Witcher series' worldview, the entire game's story was completely different from the original novel. From the first *Witcher* game, it directly continued the novel's original story.

In the original novel, Geralt of Rivia, during an uprising against non-human races, stepped forward to protect his dwarf friends but was fatally wounded by a peasant with a pitchfork. His beloved Yennefer, in an attempt to save him, exhausted her life force on the spot, and they died together. Finally, their adopted daughter Ciri took their bodies. In the original novel, this was Geralt's final ending.

In the adapted game, the story continued directly, and many settings from the original novel were changed. The reason for choosing *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt* as the target, apart from its more mature and complete gameplay and settings, was its entire story.

The first game mostly showcased the myriad forms of life, while the second focused on depicting the political wars of the Northern Kingdoms. In both these games, Geralt initially remained an observer, passively drawn into certain power struggles and major events. In the third game, 'Wild Hunt', Geralt truly began his main story.

"This game will be quite substantial in scale. During this period, we need to depict the scenery and customs of various different regions; I will focus on this with you all later."

"Additionally, before that, Qin Yi and Ruan Ningxue, you both have some work. Add some related easter eggs to Nebula World. We need to continuously warm up the game during its development," Chen Xu slowly said to the group.

Upon hearing Chen Xu's words, everyone was instantly stunned.

Few games before had received such treatment!

And this project hadn't even been approved, yet they were already 'making grand promises'!?

Before, they always started after creating a new folder!

"What do you mean 'making grand promises'? Don't put it so harshly. Only purely verbal content, like putting a poster on the official Weibo account or writing a title, that's what you call making grand promises. We are going to use Nebula World to showcase some of the game's background and related information to players."

"This is an easter egg, not making grand promises!" Chen Xu said very seriously to everyone.

How could they speak like that? If they couldn't speak properly, they should consider not speaking.

Could this be called making grand promises? This was clearly a precious easter egg presented to the players.

Of course, besides rousing player enthusiasm and anticipation, Chen Xu also considered this move quite important.

In his previous life, although *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt* was of excellent quality, many people were still turned away from it.

The reason wasn't the game's quality, but rather the overwhelming amount of information within the game, which confused players. Coupled with the slow pacing of *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt*'s White Orchard content in the early game, many players gave up there, naturally failing to experience the vast worldview of *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt* later on.

So, while developing *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt*, Chen Xu planned to use various easter egg crossovers in Nebula World to gradually reveal some of the game's background content to players. For example, the Witcher's Trial of the Grasses, and some basic worldview settings, among other things.

So, this was definitely not making grand promises; it was a genuine easter egg crossover and a thoughtful consideration for the players!
