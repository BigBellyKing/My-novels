## Chapter 146: Game Experience (Second Update, Please Subscribe for Monthly Passes)

As time progressed day by day, many players who had been following *It Takes Two* began to grow increasingly excited.

During this period, Nebula Games also carried out some pre-launch promotion to boost the game's popularity.

After all, in terms of scale, this was currently Nebula Games' second-largest title after *Dark Souls*.

Although neither players nor industry professionals and gaming media following the game believed it could live up to the hype, promotional efforts were still necessary.

Moreover, the promotional budget for *It Takes Two* was significantly lower than that of last year’s *Dark Souls*.

This was mainly because the gaming industry had recently lacked excellent releases, leaving players in a state of game drought—any title that appeared moderately impressive could attract considerable attention.

And with game media starved for big news, they eagerly reported on any game that looked promising.

Last year, Mr. Chen had swept the Annual Game Awards Event, and his new work naturally carried immense spotlight.

Combined, these factors meant that even though *It Takes Two* was a game with high entry barriers, it had already gained significant attention.

It was truly a case of perfect timing and favorable conditions.

As for human harmony, that naturally referred to Nebula Games’ loyal fanbase.

Unlike ordinary players, who remained skeptical about *It Takes Two*'s quality, Nebula Games and Chen Xu's fans had only one word in mind: Buy!

In a residential complex in the Imperial Capital, Wang Han was already fully prepared.

Two computers were logged into the Nebula Games Platform, waiting only for the game to unlock for purchase.

Beside her, Zhang Yi watched his girlfriend’s eager expression with a rather complicated look on his face.

He recalled the unequal treaty he had signed a year ago.

Because of a game called *Overcooked*, he had been doing the dishes for an entire year.

Still, despite that, he had absolutely no resistance toward any game released by Nebula Games.

Whether it was *Mirror (Game)*—a title only Nebula Games’ two-year-old fans would know—or last year’s *Dark Souls*, which had left him utterly stunned, he loved them all.

As for the game about to unlock, *It Takes Two*, truthfully, he was quite looking forward to it as well.

Judging from the promotional trailer, the gameplay content appeared extremely rich.

"It’s unlocked, it’s unlocked! This game is huge! It’s almost as big as *Dark Souls*!" The moment the game became available, Wang Han immediately purchased it, staring in surprise at the download interface that popped up.

While game size wasn’t necessarily an indicator of quality—and compression technology also played a role—

*It Takes Two* and *Dark Souls* were both developed by Nebula Games, so compression technology differences were irrelevant.

There was only one explanation:

The scale of *It Takes Two* was definitely no smaller than that of *Dark Souls*.

This realization instantly heightened Wang Han’s anticipation.

Beside her, Zhang Yi, after a brief moment of excitement, quickly snapped back to reality. Staring at the screen, he silently repeated a phrase in his mind:

‘Impulse is the devil!’

Absolutely no impulsiveness. He must not get Hyped Up while playing this game.

Otherwise, forget about dishes—he’d be doing laundry for the rest of his life!

Even though, based on all available information, *It Takes Two* was a completely different genre from last year’s *Overcooked*,

Mr. Chen’s reputation was well-established, and the official Weibo account had described the game in such mystical terms. Moreover, *It Takes Two* was a game that required two-player cooperation.

Every time he thought about this, Zhang Yi’s mind flashed back to how utterly Hyped Up he had been while playing *Overcooked*.

And how loudly he had promised to become the ultimate dish-washing man.

Zhang Yi silently repeated his mantra three more times. Then, Wang Han reminded him, "Hurry, the game finished downloading! Get in quickly—I’ll invite you right away."

"Alright, I’m coming," Zhang Yi replied, nodding as he entered the game.

After a brief Nebula Games Logo splash screen, the game’s visuals appeared.

The scene was set in a yard resembling a Farm.

Cody, stepping outside to take out the trash, was talking with May, who arrived by car holding a document folder.

The couple’s relationship had broken down, and they were about to divorce.

Even over minor daily matters, they complained and argued with each other, each feeling that the other couldn’t understand them or grasp how much inner pressure they were under.

They continued to quarrel in the yard.

On the windowsill, their daughter Rose watched them with a heartbroken expression, holding two doll figures and whispering her wish—clearly, she hoped her parents would stop fighting.

Then, the画面 froze.

On the frozen screen, the two dolls in Rose’s hands—one male, one female.

Cody was a clay doll, while May was a wooden doll.

Zhang Yi and Wang Han, having seen the promotional trailer, were not unfamiliar with them.

On this paused screen, the appearing UI choices clearly indicated they were meant to select their respective characters.

"Are these two characters different?" Wang Han asked curiously.

"Of course they are!" Zhang Yi jumped in.

"What’s the difference?" Wang Han asked.

"Haven’t you noticed? One’s male, one’s female. One’s clay, one’s wood," Zhang Yi said with a chuckle.

Wang Han gave Zhang Yi a Speechless look.

As if she didn’t know that?

Seeing her expression, Zhang Yi stopped fooling around and shared his speculation: "Didn’t Chen Xu’s official Weibo and the promotional trailer show this? The two characters have special abilities in the game and need to cooperate. I think the male and female characters have different special abilities."

"Ah, I see!" Wang Han exclaimed in understanding.

Still unsure about the exact nature of the characters’ special abilities, they chose according to gender.

Wang Han selected May, while Zhang Yi chose Cody.

After confirming their character choices, the game screen faded into a black screen.

After about one or two seconds, visuals and audio returned.

But the game didn’t immediately begin. Instead, a cutscene played.

In the living room, at the dining table, facing their daughter Rose,

Cody and May finally told Rose they were getting a divorce.

Hearing this, Rose appeared calm on the surface, simply taking her little elephant toy and returning to her room.

But the next moment, she grabbed the dolls representing her father and mother, climbed out the window, and went to the storage room.

Under the storage room table lay a red book titled *Book of Love*.

"Dr. Hakim, you have to help me... They have to stay together."

"Look, it says: [Love Requires Effort]. See?"

"You have to put in effort. You can’t just give up."

"Mom, Dad, I hope you can become friends again."

Tears fell from Rose’s eyes as she held the dolls representing May and Cody.

After a brief moment of darkness, the scene cut back to the two doll figures.

Cody and May, waking from their sleep, panicked to find themselves transformed into wooden and clay puppets.

At that moment, the personified *Book of Love*—Dr. Hakim—appeared, offering a brief explanation of the general situation.

Though seemingly explaining the circumstances to May and Cody, this was clearly aimed at the players sitting in front of their monitors, introducing them to the game.

"It feels just like watching an animated movie!" Wang Han exclaimed in admiration.

"Yeah, and the scenes around the game world are so精致 too," Zhang Yi nodded in agreement.

Already immersed in the game, he looked around the environment in amazement.

In terms of visual presentation, *It Takes Two* wasn’t quite in the first tier.

But unlike realistic-style games, *It Takes Two* adopted a cartoon art style.

Combined with relatively detailed modeling, the surroundings became incredibly dreamlike.

Especially since the player controlled clay and puppet characters, the sensation of being shrunk down created a unique visual experience.

Wooden floors, table legs, and cardboard boxes

had all become enormous. This shift in spatial scale brought a sense of contrast and novelty, making the gameplay experience for every *It Takes Two* player feel incredibly engaging.
