Chapter 269: There Is No Such Thing as a Protagonist (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)

Inside Nebula Games' studios.

Ruan Ningxue was discussing game-related matters with Yang Xin and Qin Yi.

"Even though it's an RTS, this time the workload feels especially massive! It's not smaller at all compared to our previous *Monster Hunter: World*!" Ruan Ningxue sighed with emotion.

"Yeah, and judging from the worldview and plot setting, it's also incredibly vast—Dwarves, Elves, Orcs, Undead, Goblins, Elemental Creatures—so many different races!" Yang Xin nodded in agreement.

"But with so much content involved, I wonder how the story will be handled. Plus, most RTS games on the market don't really seem to have much of a story," Ruan Ningxue said curiously.

"I'm not sure either. I haven't received any materials about the story yet," Yang Xin shook his head, indicating he didn't know.

"I think regardless of the story, just based on the gameplay, this RTS is definitely going to succeed!" Qin Yi, who had just finished entering data and bore two dark circles under his eyes signifying a workaholic, spoke with a face beaming with excitement.

"That extreme?" Hearing Qin Yi's words, the two were somewhat surprised.

Although they had confidence in their game, the final product hadn't been completed yet, so no one could really say for sure.

"Of course! It's incredibly rich, and the various types can form countless variables. For an RTS, this is absolutely crucial," Qin Yi said, still brimming with excitement.

These past few days, while inputting and structuring the Numerical Design, he had been thoroughly energized.

Although Chen Xu had provided him mostly with tables, as a Gaming Industry Professional, Qin Yi could still glimpse some of the brilliance.

Compared to other RTS games on the market, at least in terms of Numerical Design, this one was top-tier.

"Alright, take some proper rest recently. Plan your work schedule reasonably—no need to push yourself so hard!" Chen Xu, walking out from the office, heard Qin Yi's words and then noticed the dark circles under his eyes.

Although Chen Xu had handed over all the work content to Qin Yi at once, he hadn't set a strict deadline, allowing Qin Yi to manage his own time. But clearly, Qin Yi had completely transformed into a workaholic, attempting to finish the entire workload during the early game phase.

After expressing his concern briefly, Chen Xu walked over to Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue and showed them the organized line art.

"The line art for several major characters in the game has been completed. I've also written detailed requirements. You can add finer details. I've also roughly organized the corresponding story introductions. You two will be responsible for the initial review with the outsourced team," Chen Xu said to them.

Receiving the thick stack of line art from Chen Xu, Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin gasped in amazement upon seeing the first sheet.

"So cool!"

Most of the sketches were still rough drafts, but the first few pages had already been colored by Chen Xu.

The first drawing depicted a handsome young man with golden hair, wearing silver-blue knight armor and a flowing cape, with a Lion-headed belt around his waist.

On his back was a massive hammer. His expression was firm and resolute, his eyes radiating a pursuit of justice. Combined with the warm tones of the background, the young Paladin in the artwork exuded an overwhelming sense of righteousness.

Meanwhile, a blurred background bathed the young Paladin in golden light.

Beside the drawing was the character's identity: Arthas Menethil, Prince of Lordaeron, a brave and selfless Paladin of the Knights of the Silver Hand.

This must be the protagonist!

So cool!

Looking at the first drawing, everyone couldn't help but marvel.

But when they flipped to the second drawing, their expressions froze instantly.

The second drawing also featured Arthas as the central figure, but the entire style had completely changed.

The once silver-blue knight armor had turned dark and gloomy. His golden hair had become a lifeless gray-white.

His expression remained resolute, but his eyes no longer conveyed justice—they radiated pure evil.

The great hammer that once symbolized the Paladin had been replaced by a demonic sword emitting blue light, engraved with Magic runes.

Beside the artwork was the character description.

The protagonist was still Arthas, but now his identity had shifted—from Prince of Lordaeron and Paladin of the Silver Hand to the Death Knight of the Scourge.

"So extreme!"

"Mr. Chen, is Arthas the game's protagonist? Is this a transition from hero to antagonist? Or is it a case of 'a reformed prodigal is more precious than gold'?"

Looking at the two drawings, everyone struggled to contain their excitement and began discussing.

The main point of their concern was the meaning behind these two sketches.

Regarding the story, none of them knew anything yet, as Chen Xu hadn't mentioned it at all.

But they were aware of some basic settings.

For example, the game featured four playable races: Human race, Orcs, Elves, and Undead.

Now, with a single character, Arthas, undergoing such an extreme transformation—from justice to evil, from prince to Death Knight—everyone's imaginations ran wild.

Would the controversial prince fall to darkness and become an evil Death Knight? Or would the evil Death Knight return to become a righteous Paladin?

"Protagonist? During certain events and periods, Arthas certainly is the protagonist, but in the grand Warcraft story, Arthas is merely one brilliant stroke among many in this era," Chen Xu replied, shaking his head.

"Huh!"

Hearing this, everyone was momentarily confused.

"Mr. Chen, do you mean it has multiple protagonists?" Qin Yi asked, speculating.

"No. There is no such thing as a protagonist. Or rather, each period has its own protagonist," Chen Xu shook his head.

"Just like the History of civilization, every era and every race has its own glorious tales, with numerous heroes emerged in their time—be they evil or righteous. Whether it's characters like Arthas or Illidan, or the Human race, Orcs, or Elves—during certain periods, they are the so-called protagonists, but not eternally," Chen Xu explained simply.

Listening to Chen Xu, everyone gradually understood what he meant.

The game wouldn't tell its story from a single character's perspective, but from a much broader viewpoint.

Thinking about it this way, it actually seemed perfectly suited to the RTS genre!

And the scale felt even grander.

"Alright, continue developing *Warcraft* under the current mode. But you can start working on the crossover with *Monster Hunter: World* and the building complexes for *Minecraft*."

"Consider it a warm-up promotion for the game's early phase," Chen Xu said, addressing the team.
