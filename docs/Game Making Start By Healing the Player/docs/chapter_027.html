<h2>Chapter 27: The Next Game</h2>
<p>Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue wore expressions of complete confusion.</p>
<p>"We're not developing a sequel to <em>Undertale</em>, and we're not making META games anymore?" Yang Xin couldn't quite grasp the reasoning.</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue felt the same way.</p>
<p>After all, gaming media outlets were uniformly publishing various reviews and analyses of <em>Undertale</em>.</p>
<p>On forums frequented by industry designers, professional game developers were actively discussing the characteristics of <em>Undertale</em>'s unique gameplay mode.</p>
<p>After all, such a fresh element truly felt like it could become a new trendsetter.</p>
<p>Even some game developers and designers had publicly announced they had greenlit projects incorporating META elements.</p>
<p>Yet now Chen Xu was saying they wouldn't do it?</p>
<p>Releasing such news would undoubtedly surprise countless people.</p>
<p>After all, the concept of META had been completely ignored before <em>Undertale</em>.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, with <em>Undertale</em>'s current popularity, the logical move would be to strike while the iron was hot and quickly release a sequel—just like <em>Mirror (Game)</em> had done with its DLC.</p>
<p>At the very least, they could develop a completely new META game!</p>
<p>In fact, Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin had privately discussed this before.</p>
<p>They even believed their next project might be a prequel to <em>Undertale</em>.</p>
<p>After all, in the game, the stories of Asriel and Chara were merely summarized, never fully fleshed out.</p>
<p>Yet now, Chen Xu told them they wouldn't make a <em>Undertale</em> sequel, or even any META games at all?</p>
<p>"It's not very suitable. The scale of META elements is inherently limited. <em>Undertale</em> did deliver a powerful impact to players, but the main reason for that was players had no prior expectations and lacked any concept of META elements."</p>
<p>"If we continue releasing META games now, the subsequent reception definitely won't match <em>Undertale</em>'s. In fact, due to players' first impressions, they might even perceive the quality as declining."</p>
<p>Chen Xu explained to the two of them.</p>
<p>Others might not understand the genre of meta games, but Chen Xu did.</p>
<p>In his previous life, meta games were nothing particularly novel.</p>
<p>Games like <em>ICEY</em>, <em>The Stanley Parable</em>, <em>Pony Island</em>, and the <em>Undertale</em> he had chosen to develop were all outstanding examples.</p>
<p>Yet the highest sales belonged to <em>Undertale</em> and <em>ICEY</em>. <em>The Stanley Parable</em>, which truly brought META into the mainstream player consciousness in his previous life, actually sold less than these two newer titles.</p>
<p>As for <em>Pony Island</em>, many players had never even heard of it.</p>
<p>The primary reason was that META elements weren't suitable as the main selling point.</p>
<p>Careful analysis reveals that <em>ICEY</em> incorporated action elements.</p>
<p><em>Undertale</em>, while subverting traditional RPG settings, was fundamentally a fusion of RPG and bullet-hell gameplay.</p>
<p>Both games used META elements as a supporting feature, whereas <em>Pony Island</em> and <em>The Stanley Parable</em> placed META elements at the forefront, with other elements playing a secondary role.</p>
<p>META elements could indeed create a shocking experience for players.</p>
<p>But they weren't suited to be the core focus. They worked better as a catalyst, creating a chemical reaction with the game's inherent content.</p>
<p>Even many large-scale games from his previous life adopted similar designs.</p>
<p>For instance, Psycho Mantis, the boss in the <em>Metal Gear</em> series who could read the player's controller inputs.</p>
<p>Or the ending of <em>Nier: Automata</em>, which used the player's saves to save others.</p>
<p>These were all examples of META elements in use, but they served more as supplementary features.</p>
<p>The success of <em>Undertale</em> was absolutely not solely due to its META elements.</p>
<p>After hearing Chen Xu's explanation, Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin still felt somewhat bewildered.</p>
<p>They understood, yet not completely.</p>
<p>But one thing they did grasp clearly was this:</p>
<p>Continuing to release META games might not generate much profit, and the reputation might not be good either.</p>
<p>Combined with a flood of game developers incorporating META elements, players could easily develop aesthetic fatigue.</p>
<p>"Then what kind of project should we pursue next?" Yang Xin asked Chen Xu.</p>
<p>"For now, let's make a small-budget transitional game. Also, we need to expand the team," Chen Xu said.</p>
<p>"As for the genre… take a look at this."</p>
<p>With that, Chen Xu opened the nearby laptop, logged into a website: the Game Department Official Website.</p>
<p>Then, under the slightly bewildering gazes of Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin, he opened an announcement:</p>
<p>【Science is the source of human progress; scientific advancement and innovation are transforming our lives in unprecedented ways. This time, the Game Department hosts the Sci-Fi Game Design Competition under the theme "Technology Changes Life."】</p>
<p>One: Participants: National Game Designers.</p>
<p>Two: Requirements: Platform unrestricted, theme must be healthy and positive.</p>
<p>Three: Organization: This event is hosted by the National Game Department, utilizing a dual selection mode of expert review and player voting to ensure fairness and impartiality.</p>
<p>Four: Awards and Recognition: Based on the total number of submissions, one first prize, three second prizes, six third prizes, and several excellence awards will be granted.</p>
<p>Outstanding works will be promoted and recommended on the official platform's homepage after the event.</p>
<p>Winning designers will be awarded the title of "Outstanding Designer" as encouragement.</p>
<p>(Registration period: September 1st to September 5th. Event concludes by the end of September.)</p>
<p>"Are we going to participate?" Yang Xin asked, visibly surprised.</p>
<p>She was actually aware of this event.</p>
<p>Although it appeared to invite game designers nationwide, in reality, the participants were mostly independent game designers or small to medium-sized game companies.</p>
<p>The benefits were clear. After all, the organizer was the Game Department, which oversaw game censorship, job title evaluations for designers, game engine tech development, and related gaming policies.</p>
<p>Appearing before the official authorities was certainly beneficial.</p>
<p>Moreover, being promoted on the official platform's homepage was a tangible benefit.</p>
<p>After all, the Official Game Platform was one of the largest domestic channels.</p>
<p>As for why major studios didn't participate, it was mainly because such competitions were like a chicken rib (an idiom for something that has little value but is difficult to discard; a mixed blessing, or something not worth the effort) to them.</p>
<p>Big-budget, high-production games simply didn't lack exposure.</p>
<p>Furthermore, high-cost productions were naturally driven by commercial interests.</p>
<p>Commercially driven games inevitably included special elements designed to attract players.</p>
<p>Even without mentioning violence or fanservice, elements like multiple female protagonists with a harem would look extremely inappropriate in an official event like this.</p>
<p>Thus, naturally, no big-budget productions participated.</p>
<p>Instead, mostly independent designers, small and medium game developers, and sometimes studios acquired by large companies, would take part.</p>
