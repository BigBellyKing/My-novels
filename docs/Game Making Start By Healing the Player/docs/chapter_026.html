<h2>Chapter 26 Subsequent Arrangements</h2>
<p>With <em>Undertale</em> achieving both critical acclaim and commercial success, the keyword "META" had captured the attention of countless game designers across the gaming industry.</p>
<p>If judged solely on story, <em>Undertale</em> was indeed outstanding—but certainly not enough to warrant the overwhelming praise and results it was receiving now.</p>
<p>Yet once combined with the META element, everyone who played it shared one singular feeling:震撼—awe and shock.</p>
<p>It wasn't just indie game developers paying attention; even mid-to-senior-level game designers, and those specializing in VR games, were closely observing this title.</p>
<p>After all, from a certain perspective, <em>Undertale</em> had delivered a masterclass to the entire industry.</p>
<p>It demonstrated to everyone exactly what a META element was, and how such an element could be seamlessly woven into gameplay.</p>
<p>But while numerous designers in the gaming industry were analyzing its brilliance,</p>
<p>Chen Xu, at this moment, was completely relaxed.</p>
<p>The success of <em>Undertale</em> was truly a double victory.</p>
<p>Fame and profit, both achieved.</p>
<p>In his office, Chen Xu held a bottle of Wangzi Milk, staring at the system UI interface only he could see.</p>
<p>‘Not impressive enough! Although it provides more points than <em>Mirror (Game)</em> did, I’ve only managed to save up for two ten-pulls.’</p>
<p>After rounding down, Chen Xu had accumulated exactly 2.1 million points—enough for 21 pulls.</p>
<p>Compared to <em>Mirror (Game)</em>, <em>Undertale</em> did offer significantly more points, but still not overwhelmingly so.</p>
<p>Chen Xu had analyzed the reason thoroughly.</p>
<p>Only emotions experienced by players who actually purchased and played the game counted.</p>
<p>Simply put: you had to spend money and feel intense emotional fluctuations for it to contribute to his points.</p>
<p>Passive viewing, no matter how emotionally impactful, didn’t count.</p>
<p>What shocked players the most in <em>Undertale</em>, aside from their first encounter with the META element, mostly stemmed from the Genocide Route.</p>
<p>Yet very few players actually chose to play it—especially after various video walkthroughs surfaced, leading most to watch passively rather than experience it firsthand.</p>
<p>Therefore, the bulk of the accumulated points came primarily from players’ initial shock upon first playthrough.</p>
<p>As these thoughts crossed his mind, he began pulling.</p>
<p>With only 2.1 million points, Chen Xu decided against ten-pulls.</p>
<p>There was no guaranteed SSR from a ten-pull, nor any discount for consecutive pulls.</p>
<p>He went for single pulls instead—after all, "single pull, miracle strike!" Plus, single pulls carried a certain ritualistic satisfaction.</p>
<p>Though one thing did bother him—could the golden light design change?</p>
<p>Staring at the flashing golden light before him, Chen Xu felt utterly unmoved.</p>
<p>As the light faded, a common plot +1 skill book appeared.</p>
<p>The most dazzling golden light, yielding the most ordinary result. Really, now!</p>
<p>Sighing with emotion, Chen Xu used them all at once.</p>
<p>Twenty-one consecutive single pulls. This time, Chen Xu suspected he hadn’t washed his hands before pulling.</p>
<p>Aside from two Memory Capsules, every other result was a common skill book—no rares, not a single one.</p>
<p>As for types: Art, Music, story, levels, and Numerical Design—none were spared.</p>
<p>He took a sip of milk, sighed, "Unlucky King," used up all the skill books, and then shut down the system.</p>
<p>Opening the official game engine’s backend on his computer, he logged into the Modu Game Department’s partition and checked his permissions.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous 1024, his available resources had now been increased to 2048—almost doubled.</p>
<p>Clearly, although no formal notification about a job title upgrade had arrived, the Game Department had taken notice of his development of <em>Undertale</em> and upgraded his Game Designer rank accordingly.</p>
<p>"Next, I need to think about what game to develop afterward." Leaning back in his chair, Chen Xu fell into deep thought.</p>
<p>A AAA-tier game?</p>
<p>Immediately dismissed.</p>
<p>Too unrealistic.</p>
<p>Whether it was resources, manpower, funding, or Chen Xu’s current capabilities, developing a AAA-tier game would be extremely difficult.</p>
<p>After all, small-scale, low-cost games thrived on creative gameplay and narrative expression, while AAA games tested comprehensive execution across all aspects.</p>
<p>Thus, Chen Xu decided his next direction would still focus on small-scale, low-cost games.</p>
<p>In the meantime, he’d build up his team foundation and get Nebula Games fully operational as soon as possible.</p>
<p>After all, the entire company currently had only three people handling game development: Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, and himself.</p>
<p>Now that they had money, hiring was naturally the next step.</p>
<p>Additionally, he’d continue accumulating points to further enhance his abilities.</p>
<p>As for pay-to-win games? Chen Xu currently had no interest.</p>
<p>They could severely damage both his reputation and Nebula Games’.</p>
<p>Moreover, the massive success of <em>Undertale</em> proved one thing: the market in this Parallel World was completely different from his previous life.</p>
<p>Buy-to-play games could still be profitable. Under these circumstances, Chen Xu naturally intended to pursue the high-quality route.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>In the meeting room, Chen Xu gave a brief overview of the results brought by <em>Undertale</em> and the <em>Mirror (Game)</em> DLC to the team.</p>
<p>He confirmed the company’s primary development direction going forward, discussed expanding departments, and established relevant policies.</p>
<p>As the boss, Chen Xu inevitably served up a couple of motivational speeches.</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, delivering grand promises and motivational speeches felt entirely different from being on the receiving end.</p>
<p>In that moment, Chen Xu finally understood why so many people in his previous life loved making grand promises and giving motivational speeches.</p>
<p>It really did feel satisfying.</p>
<p>After wrapping up administrative and HR matters, Chen Xu remained in the meeting room with Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue to discuss game development.</p>
<p>"So, are we going to release a Sequel to <em>Undertale</em> next?" Yang Xin asked, her eyes filled with anticipation for the future.</p>
<p>This was the gaming industry she had always dreamed of!</p>
<p>Beside her, Ruan Ningxue was equally excited.</p>
<p>Initially, she’d joined partly due to her relationship with Chen Xu and Yang Xin, and partly because making games felt enjoyable and offered some potential.</p>
<p>But now?</p>
<p>It wasn’t just potential—it was tremendous potential!</p>
<p>Especially after seeing fan-made stories and artwork for <em>Undertale</em> and <em>Mirror (Game)</em> on various websites, she felt an indescribable sense of pride.</p>
<p>After all, these were projects she had helped create. In the past, she was always the one drawing others’ works—now, others were drawing hers.</p>
<p>Hearing Yang Xin’s question, Chen Xu smiled and nodded: "There will definitely be a new project, but it won’t be a Sequel to <em>Undertale</em>, nor will it be another META-style game."</p>
<p>Not a Sequel to <em>Undertale</em>? Not even a META game?</p>
<p>Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue stared, stunned.</p>
