                <h1>Chapter 26: Subsequent Arrangements</h1>
<p>As <em>Undertale</em> achieved a double harvest in both reputation and sales, the keyword META garnered attention from countless game designers in the industry.</p>
<p>Purely in terms of plot, <em>Undertale</em> was indeed excellent, but it definitely wouldn't have reached its current level of achievement and acclaim without something more.</p>
<p>However, after incorporating the META element, everyone who played it had only one feeling: awe.</p>
<p>Not only designers in the Independent Game circle but also some mid-to-high-level game designers, and even those focused on VR games, paid attention to <em>Undertale</em>.</p>
<p>After all, from a certain perspective, it taught all game designers a lesson.</p>
<p>It showed everyone what the META element truly is and how this element should be interwoven into a game.</p>
<p>However, compared to the attention from many designers in the game industry,</p>
<p>Chen Xu at this time was completely relaxed.</p>
<p>The success of <em>Undertale</em> was truly a double harvest.</p>
<p>Both fame and fortune were attained.</p>
<p>In the office, Chen Xu held a bottle of Want Want Milk, looking at the system UI interface that only he could see.</p>
<p>“Doesn't quite cut it! Although it provides more points than <em>Mirror (Game)</em> did before, it only got me enough for 2 ten-draws.”</p>
<p>After deducting the odd amount, Chen Xu's accumulated points were now 2.1 million, just enough for 21 draws.</p>
<p>Compared to <em>Mirror (Game)</em>, <em>Undertale</em> indeed provided quite a bit, but not excessively so.</p>
<p>Chen Xu also summarized the ultimate reason.</p>
<p>It had to be emotions felt by players who bought and personally played the game for them to count.</p>
<p>Simply put, only when money was spent and strong emotional fluctuations occurred could points be accumulated.</p>
<p>If it was merely watched, no matter how impactful, it wouldn't be included.</p>
<p>What was most impactful in <em>Undertale</em>, besides the initial exposure to the META element, mostly came from the Genocide Route.</p>
<p>However, very few players were actually willing to play the Genocide Route, especially after various video guides came out; many players couldn't bear to play it and chose to experience it through videos (cloud play).</p>
<p>Therefore, the large amount of points currently accumulated mainly stemmed from players' initial shock and awe.</p>
<p>Thinking to himself, he also started drawing.</p>
<p>With a total of 2.1 million points, Chen Xu didn't do a ten-draw.</p>
<p>Anyway, this gacha system had no guaranteed SSR for ten-draws or any ten-draw discounts.</p>
<p>He did all single draws. As the saying goes, miracles happen with single draws, and single draws also have a sense of ritual.</p>
<p>There was just one thing: could this golden light be changed?</p>
<p>Looking at the flashing golden light before him, Chen Xu felt nothing inside.</p>
<p>As the light dissipated, a common plot +1 skill book appeared.</p>
<p>The most dazzling golden light, yet it produced the most common item. You really know how to do it!</p>
<p>Sighing with emotion, Chen Xu clicked through all of them at once.</p>
<p>After 21 consecutive draws, Chen Xu felt that he might not have washed his hands before drawing this time.</p>
<p>Except for two Memory Capsules, everything else was a common skill book; not a single rare one appeared.</p>
<p>As for the types, art, music, plot, level design, and Numerical Design, none were missed.</p>
<p>He took a sip of milk, lamented his bad luck as a Non-chief, used all the skill books, and then closed the system.</p>
<p>Opening the Official Game Engine backend on his computer, and logging into the Modu Game Department's division, Chen Xu checked his permissions.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous 1024, the resources Chen Xu could now use had been increased to 2048, roughly doubled.</p>
<p>Evidently, even though he hadn't received a job title promotion notice, the Game Department had noticed his development of <em>Undertale</em> and had raised his designer level.</p>
<p>“Next, I need to consider subsequent games.” Leaning back in his chair, Chen Xu fell into a state of hesitation.</p>
<p>AAA-tier game?</p>
<p>This was immediately ruled out by Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Because it was unrealistic.</p>
<p>Whether it was resources, manpower, funds, or Chen Xu's current capabilities, developing an AAA-tier game was still quite difficult.</p>
<p>After all, low-cost games relied on creative gameplay and plot presentation, while AAA-tier games tested overall performance more.</p>
<p>So for the next direction, Chen Xu still decided to focus on small-scale, low-cost games.</p>
<p>During this period, he would build up the core team and get Nebula Games on track as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>After all, in this entire company, only Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, and he were involved in game development.</p>
<p>Now that they had money, recruiting people was a natural next step.</p>
<p>Additionally, he would use the opportunity to accumulate more points and improve his own abilities.</p>
<p>As for pay-to-win games, Chen Xu currently had no such intention.</p>
<p>Because it could easily have a huge impact on his and Nebula Games' reputation.</p>
<p>And the immense success of <em>Undertale</em> proved one thing: the market in this Parallel World was completely different from his previous life.</p>
<p>It was possible to profit from buy-to-play games, and in this situation, Chen Xu naturally planned to pursue a high-quality route.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>In the meeting room, looking at everyone seated, Chen Xu briefly spoke about the achievements brought by <em>Undertale</em> and the <em>Mirror (Game)</em> DLC.</p>
<p>At the same time, he confirmed with everyone the main development direction for the future, which involved expanding the team departments.</p>
<p>And some related regulations, and as the boss, Chen Xu inevitably gave everyone two pots of motivational speeches.</p>
<p>It must be said, making grand promises and giving motivational speeches oneself feels completely different from having a boss shove those promises and speeches down one's throat.</p>
<p>At this moment, Chen Xu also understood why so many people in his previous life enjoyed making grand promises and feeding chicken soup.</p>
<p>It was quite satisfying.</p>
<p>After administrative and human resources matters were concluded, Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue remained in the meeting room for game-related discussions.</p>
<p>“So, are we going to launch a sequel to <em>Undertale</em> next?” Yang Xin asked, her face full of anticipation for the future.</p>
<p>This was the game industry she had always dreamed of!</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue next to her was also excited.</p>
<p>When she first joined, it was partly due to Chen Xu and Yang Xin's relationship, and partly because making games felt good, and she also felt it had some prospects.</p>
<p>But now?</p>
<p>It wasn't just some prospects; it was very promising!</p>
<p>Especially when she saw people drawing fan stories of <em>Undertale</em> and <em>Mirror (Game)</em> on some websites, it gave her a wonderful feeling.</p>
<p>After all, these were projects she had participated in. In the past, she was always the one drawing, but now she could see others drawing.</p>
<p>Hearing Yang Xin's question, Chen Xu smiled and nodded: “There will definitely be a new project, but it won't be a sequel to <em>Undertale</em>, nor will it be a META-type game.”</p>
<p>Not a sequel to <em>Undertale</em>, not even a META-type game?</p>
<p>Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue were stunned.</p>
