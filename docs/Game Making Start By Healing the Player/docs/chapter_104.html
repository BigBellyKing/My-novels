                <p>Chapter 104: Heart-wrenching Plot</p>
<p>From initially being casual, then smiling at some humorous scenes and scenarios in the game. To then falling into deep silence, feeling the cruelty brought by what is called war. All the players were immersed in the game's story.</p>
<p>Fortunately, through Karl's subsequent storyline, players understood that Karl hadn't actually died. Instead, he swapped his dog tag with another deceased soldier, leading others to believe he was dead. He, himself, was doing everything possible to return to his wife at Saint-Mihiel farm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Emile, who had heard of Karl's death, didn't know that Karl had merely faked his death. He fell into serious illness from grief. Freddie, on the other hand, drove the Old Professor's modified tank to Somme, battling through obstacles and ultimately defeating Baron von Dorf on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Baron von Dorf was reassigned from the front line. For many soldiers, this was a coveted wish. But for someone like Baron von Dorf, this was even more terrifying than death, as it meant the end of his military and political career.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, Liuliu felt no sense of satisfaction or excitement from revenge. What she cared about more was whether Karl was truly dead. And what would happen to Emile.</p>
<p>In this emotional state, the game screen switched back to Karl. On his journey of escape, Karl encountered Anya and the dog, finally arriving at Saint-Mihiel, the recruitment office where Emile had first enlisted. However, times had changed; this time, it had become a German army training ground for new recruits.</p>
<p>Here, the search and rescue dog met its original owner, but just like the previous scene in the mine. The next moment, France launched an artillery bombardment on Saint-Mihiel. With the help of new friends, Karl and the dog entered the house first, but he was directly killed by the blast.</p>
<p>Sitting in front of the computer, watching this scene unfold, Liuliu simply pursed her lips. Having played up to this point, she no longer knew how to describe her feelings.</p>
<p>After escaping the barracks, the French army also began using poison gas attacks. After countless hardships, Karl finally returned to his home farm, but at that very moment. A gas shell fell from the sky, Emile's farm was destroyed, and his wife Marie and son were trapped beneath the collapsed house.</p>
<p>Karl searched for a long time and finally found Marie and his son. There, Marie gave the simple gas mask to her son, while she herself was exposed to the gas. Seeing this, without any hesitation, Karl chose to put his own gas mask on Marie's head. Karl, having removed his gas mask, dragged Marie outside. As he walked, Karl tried to comfort the unconscious Marie.</p>
<p>"Marie...it's me...I'm here!"</p>
<p>Until finally, without his gas mask, he could no longer hold on and collapsed. At this moment, his headphones filled with his son's sorrowful cries.</p>
<p>Playing up to this point, Liuliu's eyes in front of the computer involuntarily reddened. At the same time, there was a glimmer of hope. Hoping that the game developers wouldn't be so heartless as to let Karl and Marie die here. But clearly, the game wouldn't tell her, the player, what happened to Karl next at this point. The screen then shifted to Emile.</p>
<p>April 16, 1917. Emile's illness still hadn't healed, but a general named Nivelle on the front line demanded that all soldiers who could still stand join the battle, launching his Great Offensive. Changing from the game's previous humorous art style, the entire game's color palette became incredibly dark.</p>
<p>On a front line in ruins, an officer roared, brandishing his military saber, telling Emile to find soldiers capable of charging. The French army attacked once more.</p>
<p>Again, this was another battle that could potentially end the war. And before this, they had already participated in countless such battles.</p>
<p>Watching the game screen before her, Liuliu, in front of the computer, no longer narrated as she played, as she had done before. She was simply experiencing the game's story.</p>
<p>At the officer's command, all soldiers used countless broken corpses as cover to continue their desperate charge. Compared to previous levels, this final one was more difficult. The enemy's attacks were simply too dense, requiring perfect timing for every move. Inside the game, all participating soldiers seemed to have become numb. All the soldiers were afraid, but under the coercion of the supervising officer, they had no choice but to attack.</p>
<p>This level left Liuliu, and all players, with only one feeling: an overwhelming sense of oppression. The surroundings were filled with soldiers' corpses, blood staining the ground red. Even the game's visual colors depicted an incredibly dim night. Amidst a hail of bullets and explosions, Emile and his teammates slowly advanced, while comrades around them fell one after another.</p>
<p>They could only charge; pausing or turning back even slightly would result in being shot dead by the officers behind them. They charged using their comrades' bodies as cover, and charged using carts piled with corpses.</p>
<p>Fewer and fewer people charged, until only Emile was left. Yet, even then, the officer behind him still held his gun high, ordering the soldiers to make a suicidal charge. A shell landed beside Emile, knocking him unconscious, but the officer behind him continued to command the trembling soldiers to charge.</p>
<p>At this moment, Emile, regaining consciousness, looked at the roaring officer in front of him and the trembling soldiers, slowly advancing. There were no system prompts here, but all players instinctively did one thing, which was also what Emile believed to be the right thing at that moment.</p>
<p>He swung the shovel in his hand forcefully at the officer's head, ending the reckless charge and sacrifice.</p>
<p>"The Nivelle Offensive was a bloody battle, a massacre."</p>
<p>"Soon, a mutiny broke out among the French infantry regiments, bringing the offensive to an abrupt end."</p>
<p>"Among them, Emile and another deserter were incarcerated, awaiting the judgment of a military tribunal."</p>
<p>Emile was imprisoned and about to be tried? Seeing this, Liuliu's heart trembled in front of the computer, and she had a bad premonition.</p>
<p>But the next moment, the camera angle switched again, moving to Karl. Compared to the incredibly oppressive, hellish atmosphere from before, Karl's side seemed to have a ray of sunshine.</p>
<p>The dog, that German search and rescue dog, dragged Karl's family of three out of the poison gas and, traveling thousands of miles, found Anya and led her to Karl's farm. After simple emergency treatment, Karl was sent to a field hospital and finally woke up. After years of war, their family of three was finally reunited.</p>
<p>Watching Karl, Marie, and their son embrace, Liuliu, in front of the computer, also let out a long sigh. At the same time, a hint of expectation arose in her heart. Although the previous storyline was too cruel, too dark. But seeing Karl's family of three so heartwarming now, perhaps Emile on the other side would also see a turn for the better?</p>
<p>With such anticipation and thoughts, Liuliu continued playing the game.</p>
