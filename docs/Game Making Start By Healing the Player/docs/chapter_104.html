                <p>Chapter 104: Heart-wrenching Plot</p>
<p>Chapter 104: Heart-wrenching Plot</p>
<p>From initial indifference, to smiling at the game's humorous graphics and scenes, then falling into deep silence—feeling the oppressive cruelty brought by war.</p>
<p>Every player was immersed in the game’s story.</p>
<p>Fortunately, through Carl’s subsequent storyline, players realized that Carl hadn’t actually died.</p>
<p>He had exchanged his identification tag with another dead soldier, making everyone believe he was dead.</p>
<p>Carl himself had gone to great lengths to return to his wife at the Saint-Mihiel farm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Emile, upon hearing of Carl’s death, remained unaware that it was merely a feigned death. Overcome with grief, he fell into a serious illness.</p>
<p>Freddie, on the other hand, drove the old professor’s modified tank to Somme, cutting through enemy lines and ultimately defeating Baron von Dorf on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Eventually, Baron von Dorf was reassigned away from the front lines—a dream come true for many soldiers.</p>
<p>But for someone like Baron von Dorf, this punishment was worse than death, as it meant the end of his military and political career.</p>
<p>Yet at this moment, Liuliu felt no sense of revenge or excitement.</p>
<p>Instead, she was consumed with worry—had Carl really died?</p>
<p>And what would become of Emile?</p>
<p>Under this emotional weight, the game graphics switched back to Carl.</p>
<p>During his escape, Carl encountered Anna and the dog along the way, finally arriving at Saint-Mihiel—the very Recruitment Office where Emile had enlisted.</p>
<p>But times had changed. This place had now become a training ground for new German army recruits.</p>
<p>Here, the German search and rescue dog met his original owner. But just like that scene in the mine earlier—</p>
<p>The next moment, French artillery bombarded Saint-Mihiel. With the help of new friends, Carl and the dog rushed into a building, only to be instantly killed by an explosion.</p>
<p>Sitting at her computer, Liuliu bit her lips tightly.</p>
<p>By this point, she couldn’t even describe how she felt.</p>
<p>Having escaped the military camp, the French army now launched a gas attack. After enduring countless hardships, Carl finally returned to his family’s farm—only for a gas shell to fall from the sky.</p>
<p>Emile’s farm was utterly destroyed, and Carl’s wife Mary and their son were crushed beneath the collapsed ruins.</p>
<p>After a long search, Carl finally found Mary and his son.</p>
<p>Here, Mary gave her son a makeshift gas mask, exposing herself to the deadly gas.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Carl took off his own gas mask and placed it over Mary’s face.</p>
<p>With his mask removed, Carl dragged Mary toward the outside.</p>
<p>As he staggered forward, he kept trying to comfort the unconscious Mary.</p>
<p>["Mary... it's me... I'm here!"]</p>
<p>In the end, deprived of his gas mask, Carl collapsed, unable to go on.</p>
<p>At that moment, his son’s heart-wrenching cries filled the headphones.</p>
<p>Watching this scene unfold, Liuliu’s eyes welled up with tears.</p>
<p>Yet, she still held onto a sliver of hope.</p>
<p>She hoped the game developers wouldn’t be so heartless as to let Carl and Mary die here.</p>
<p>But clearly, the game wouldn’t reveal to the player what happened to Carl next.</p>
<p>The screen shifted to Emile.</p>
<p>April 16, 1917. Emile had still not recovered from his illness, but General Nivelle at the front demanded every soldier who could still stand to join the Great Offensive.</p>
<p>The game’s tone shifted dramatically from its earlier humorous style—now the color tone was overwhelmingly dark.</p>
<p>At the ruined front lines, officers raised their Military Sabers, bellowing orders for Emile to gather soldiers for the charge.</p>
<p>The French army launched another attack.</p>
<p>Once again, another battle that might end the war.</p>
<p>Yet before this, they had already fought countless such battles.</p>
<p>Staring at the game graphics, Liuliu no longer narrated and commented as she played, as she had before. Instead, she simply experienced the story.</p>
<p>Under the officers’ orders, soldiers used piles of corpses as cover, desperately charging forward.</p>
<p>Compared to previous levels, this final level was significantly more difficult.</p>
<p>The enemy fire was too intense—timing had to be perfect.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, within the game, the soldiers seemed to have become numb.</p>
<p>All were terrified, yet under the threat of the Supervising Officer, they had no choice but to advance.</p>
<p>This level left Liuliu—and every player—with only one feeling: overwhelming oppression.</p>
<p>Corpses lay everywhere. Blood stained the ground red.</p>
<p>Even the game’s color palette depicted a bleak, dark night.</p>
<p>Through the hail of bullets and explosions, Emile and his comrades inched forward, while comrades beside them fell one by one.</p>
<p>They could only charge forward. Anyone who paused or turned back was instantly shot by the officers behind.</p>
<p>They charged using their fallen Companions as cover, using carts filled with corpses to advance.</p>
<p>Fewer and fewer remained—until finally, only Emile was left.</p>
<p>Yet even then, the officer behind still raised his gun, urging the soldiers to launch their desperate assault.</p>
<p>A shell exploded beside Emile, knocking him unconscious. The officer behind continued to force trembling soldiers forward.</p>
<p>When Emile awoke, he saw the bellowing officer ahead and the trembling soldiers behind. Slowly, he began to move.</p>
<p>There was no system prompt, yet every player simultaneously made the same choice—what Emile believed, in that moment, to be the right thing.</p>
<p>He swung his Shovel hard at the officer’s head, ending the futile charge and sacrifice.</p>
<p>["The Nivelle Offensive was a bloody battle, a massacre"]</p>
<p>["Soon, mutiny broke out among French infantry units, bringing the offensive to a halt"]</p>
<p>["Emile and another Deserter were incarcerated, awaiting judgment by the military tribunal"]</p>
<p>Emile was imprisoned and would be put on trial?</p>
<p>Seeing this, Liuliu’s heart trembled—she sensed something terrible was coming.</p>
<p>But the next moment, the scene shifted again—back to Carl.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous hellish, oppressive atmosphere, Carl’s side now seemed touched by a ray of sunlight.</p>
<p>The German search and rescue dog dragged Carl’s family of three out of the gas, then traveled a great distance to find Anna, leading her back to Carl’s farm.</p>
<p>After basic first aid, Carl was sent to a Field Hospital and finally regained consciousness.</p>
<p>After years of war, the three of them were finally reunited.</p>
<p>Watching Carl embrace Mary and their son, Liuliu let out a long sigh of relief.</p>
<p>A flicker of hope stirred in her heart.</p>
<p>Though the earlier story had been too cruel, too dark—</p>
<p>Now, seeing this warm reunion of Carl’s family, perhaps Emile would also get a second chance?</p>
<p>Holding onto this hope, Liuliu continued playing the game.</p>
<p>(Daily plea for recommendation votes and Monthly Pass—wuwuwu…)</p>
