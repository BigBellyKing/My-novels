                <p>Chapter 75 Game Expo</p>
<p>"Come in."</p>
<p>After receiving a response, the office door was pushed open. Lin Rou, the recently recruited assistant, approached Chen Xu with a document in her hand.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, the gameplay Expo has invited us to participate in this year's event. This is the exhibition area division for the gameplay Expo." Lin Rou handed Chen Xu a venue map.</p>
<p>Chen Xu took the document from Lin Rou's hand and looked at it.</p>
<p>It was a simple schematic drawing of the venue.</p>
<p>From the data, the expo covered a total area of 50,000 square meters, divided into 7 exhibition zones.</p>
<p>Nebula Games was invited to Zone Six, which was designated as the Independent Game Exhibition Zone.</p>
<p>And Nebula Games would have approximately 500 square meters of booth space.</p>
<p>It was quite large, already considered top-tier within the independent game exhibition hall.</p>
<p>To be honest, Chen Xu in this Parallel World hadn't paid special attention to expos like this.</p>
<p>Without immediately replying to Lin Rou, Chen Xu searched online.</p>
<p>He quickly gained a rough understanding.</p>
<p>In this Parallel World, just like in his previous life, there were all sorts of expos.</p>
<p>However, this gameplay Expo was a little different from ordinary expos.</p>
<p>Namely, this expo was not purely commercial in nature.</p>
<p>The sponsors of this expo, besides industry giants like NetDragon and TengHua Games, included a rather special entity: the Game Department.</p>
<p>Simply put, this expo had a somewhat official character, with the slogan and direction being 'to promote the prosperous development of the domestic gaming industry.'</p>
<p>The venue for the annual expo was not fixed; this year, it had come to Modu.</p>
<p>It was scheduled for early May.</p>
<p>That left about two months until its opening.</p>
<p>The expo would last for 5 days.</p>
<p>As for why there was no prior notice, it was mainly because this expo was entirely non-commercial.</p>
<p>Simply put, they invited the first batch of game developers more than two months in advance.</p>
<p>If you wanted to participate, you signed up.</p>
<p>If not, other game developers would fill in.</p>
<p>As for what "hot news" you might reveal at the expo, whether you brought news of a new game to players, or simply showed your face to them, that was up to each game developer.</p>
<p>In any case, the expo stage was set for you; the rest was up to you.</p>
<p>"I understand now. Reply to the organizer that we will participate. Also, tell Zhang Yida to prepare a plan for this expo," Chen Xu said to Lin Rou.</p>
<p>"Understood, Mr. Chen," Lin Rou nodded.</p>
<p>After asking Lin Rou to find Zhang Yida, Chen Xu picked up the documents on his desk and reviewed the relevant exhibition zones and other details, gaining a general idea.</p>
<p>The exhibition area was large, offering a lot of room for maneuver.</p>
<p>However, there were two games Chen Xu did not plan to bring to this expo.</p>
<p>"Mirror (Game)", a very harmonious and lovely game, and currently the highest-rated game among Chen Xu's players, still couldn't be shown at the expo.</p>
<p>Additionally, Chen Xu did not plan to bring "Outlast" to the expo.</p>
<p>There was no way around it; the theme and background were just too gloomy.</p>
<p>He couldn't possibly decorate the "Outlast" exhibition area to look like an asylum, could he?</p>
<p>More importantly, it was broad daylight, and with so many people, it wouldn't scare the players anyway.</p>
<p>If it couldn't scare players, wouldn't that betray its horror game genre?</p>
<p>However, merely showcasing "Undertale," "To the Moon," and "Overcooked" would be a bit monotonous.</p>
<p>Just then, Chen Xu had been pondering what kind of games to develop next, and now he had some ideas.</p>
<p>Two months was too short to complete medium-sized or larger games.</p>
<p>However, during this period, he could make two smaller-scale games.</p>
<p>This would align perfectly with the direction of the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>Time was a bit tight, but compared to before the New Year, Nebula Games' team had expanded further.</p>
<p>If they rushed, they could still make it.</p>
<p>Besides these two games, Chen Xu was also preparing to bring a surprise to players at this game expo.</p>
<p>With little time, Chen Xu began writing design documents once he made his decision.</p>
<p>Of these two games, one would have a relatively simple structure, only requiring art assets and voice acting to be completed.</p>
<p>The other would be slightly more complex, requiring team collaboration.</p>
<p>However, the workload was not huge.</p>
<p>Finally, he also decided to bring a surprise to players at this expo.</p>
<p>But given the time constraint, even a DEMO might not be possible, let alone a full game.</p>
<p>But Chen Xu wasn't worried.</p>
<p>After all, there was something called a promotional trailer; he could start by painting this delicious "big pie" for the players.</p>
<p>If asked, the answer would always be: "It's almost done."</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>While he was drafting the design concept, the official staff of the game expo also contacted Chen Xu.</p>
<p>After all, Nebula Games needed to provide a plan for the booth layout.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if there was a need for performances like cosers, the expo could help arrange the contact.</p>
<p>Of course, contacting the relevant talent agencies himself was also fine.</p>
<p>Since the event itself was held in Modu, Chen Xu took some time off to visit the venue and assess the actual situation before making a decision.</p>
<p>After all, since he had decided to participate in this expo, he definitely wanted to do his best.</p>
<p>Moreover, the gameplay Expo had a very high popularity in the country, making it an excellent opportunity for exposure and promotion.</p>
<p>"Zones Five and Seven next to Zone Six are TengHua Games' and NetDragon's exhibition areas?"</p>
<p>At the expo site, many staff members were busy.</p>
<p>They were arranging various posters and installing relevant equipment.</p>
<p>"Not entirely, it's just that both companies have many games participating and many studios under their wing," the staff member accompanying Chen Xu explained with a smile.</p>
<p>Chen Xu nodded, indicating he understood.</p>
<p>Game developers of TengHua Games' and NetDragon's caliber naturally wouldn't have just one studio.</p>
<p>Their acquired game studios, when participating in the expo, also represented them.</p>
<p>"I have a good grasp of the specific situation now. I'll provide you with a detailed plan by Wednesday," Chen Xu said.</p>
<p>"Alright. Also, Mr. Chen, do you have any coser requirements? Do you need us to help connect and select them, or will you find a talent agency yourselves?" the staff member responded.</p>
<p>"Please help us connect with them through the expo; it saves some trouble," Chen Xu said after some thought.</p>
<p>"In that case, Mr. Chen, do you have any strict requirements for the cosers?" the staff member inquired.</p>
<p>After all, cosers definitely needed to match the game's character image.</p>
<p>For example, if a character was a loli, you couldn't possibly ask an older, mature woman to cosplay her.</p>
<p>"Hmm... I don't really have strict requirements. Gender is not limited, but there's one thing: they need to have a bit more stamina, not be too weak," Chen Xu pondered and said.</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu's words, the enthusiastic staff member looked completely bewildered.</p>
<p>Wha... what the heck!</p>
<p>Did he mishear?</p>
<p>Gender not limited, but good stamina?</p>
<p>Demanding girls, then asking for them to be fairer, bigger, taller—these requirements were all understandable.</p>
<p>But "good stamina," what on earth was that about?</p>
<p>Are you looking for cosers to stand at a booth, or people to help you move house?</p>
