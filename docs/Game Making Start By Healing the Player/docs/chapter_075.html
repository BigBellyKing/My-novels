                <p>Chapter 75: Gameplay Expo</p>
<p>"Come in."</p>
<p>After receiving the response, the office door opened, and Lin Rou, the assistant previously recruited, walked in holding a document toward Chen Xu.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, the gameplay Expo has sent us an invitation, asking whether we'd like to participate in this year's gameplay Expo. Here is the area division plan for the exhibition venue," Lin Rou said, handing Chen Xu a venue map.</p>
<p>Chen Xu took the materials from Lin Rou and glanced through them.</p>
<p>It was a simple file showing a visual rendering of the venue layout.</p>
<p>According to the data, the exhibition spanned a total of 50,000 square meters, divided into seven展区 (sectors).</p>
<p>Nebula Games had been invited to Sector 6, which was designated for independent games.</p>
<p>Nebula Games would have approximately 500 square meters of exhibition space.</p>
<p>That was already quite large—among independent game exhibitors, they would be taking first place.</p>
<p>To be honest, Chen Xu hadn't paid much attention to exhibitions like this in the Parallel World.</p>
<p>Without immediately replying to Lin Rou, Chen Xu searched online to get a better understanding.</p>
<p>After a while, he had a rough idea.</p>
<p>In the Parallel World, just like in his previous life, there were various types of exhibitions.</p>
<p>However, gameplay Expo was slightly different from regular exhibitions.</p>
<p>Unlike purely commercial events, this one had sponsors not only from industry giants like NetDragon and TengHua, but also a rather unique participant—Game Department.</p>
<p>In short, the expo carried a semi-official tone, with its slogan and direction focused on "promoting the prosperity and development of the domestic gaming industry."</p>
<p>The venue changed each year, and this year it was held in Modu.</p>
<p>It would take place in early May.</p>
<p>There were still about two months left before the event.</p>
<p>The exhibition would run for five days.</p>
<p>As for why the invitation came so late, it was mainly because the event was entirely non-commercial.</p>
<p>In simple terms, game developers were invited over two months in advance.</p>
<p>If you wanted to attend, you registered.</p>
<p>If not, other developers would take your place.</p>
<p>As for what kind of impact you'd make at the exhibition—whether revealing a new game or simply building familiarity with players—that was entirely up to the game developers themselves.</p>
<p>The expo provided the stage. What you did on it was your own business.</p>
<p>"I understand now. Reply to the organizers that we'll participate. Also, talk to Zhang Yida and have him prepare a plan for this exhibition," Chen Xu said to Lin Rou.</p>
<p>"Understood, Mr. Chen," Lin Rou replied with a nod.</p>
<p>After sending Lin Rou to speak with Zhang Yida, Chen Xu picked up the documents on his desk and reviewed the details about the assigned展区 and other related information, gaining a clearer idea in his mind.</p>
<p>The展区 space was large, offering plenty of room for creative operations.</p>
<p>However, there were two games Chen Xu had no intention of bringing to this exhibition.</p>
<p><em>Mirror (Game)</em>, a remarkably harmonious and heartwarming title—and currently the highest-rated game among Chen Xu's portfolio—would not be making an appearance at the expo.</p>
<p>Additionally, Chen Xu had no plans to bring <em>Outlast</em> to the exhibition either.</p>
<p>It couldn't be helped; the theme and setting were simply too grim.</p>
<p>Surely they couldn't renovate the <em>Outlast</em> exhibition area to resemble an asylum?</p>
<p>More importantly, during the daytime with so many people around, it wouldn't even scare players.</p>
<p>If it didn't scare anyone, wouldn't that betray its identity as a horror game?</p>
<p>Still, displaying only <em>Undertale</em>, <em>To the Moon</em>, and <em>Overcooked</em> would feel a bit monotonous.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Chen Xu had been pondering what kind of game to develop next, and now he had some ideas.</p>
<p>With only two months, developing anything medium-sized or larger was out of the question.</p>
<p>However, he could still create two smaller-scale games within this timeframe.</p>
<p>This would also align perfectly with Nebula Games Platform's direction.</p>
<p>The schedule was tight, but compared to before the Lunar New Year, the Nebula Games team had grown significantly in size.</p>
<p>With some effort, they could make it in time.</p>
<p>Besides these two new games, Chen Xu also planned to bring a surprise for players at this gaming expo.</p>
<p>With limited time, Chen Xu began drafting design documents immediately after making his decisions.</p>
<p>One of the two games would have a simple structure—requiring only Art output for materials, followed by Voice acting to complete.</p>
<p>The other would be slightly more complex, requiring team collaboration.</p>
<p>Still, the workload wasn't substantial.</p>
<p>Although Chen Xu intended to surprise players at the expo, time was too short.</p>
<p>Even a demo might not be feasible to finish.</p>
<p>But Chen Xu wasn't worried.</p>
<p>After all, there was such a thing as a promotional teaser.</p>
<p>He could draw a delicious-looking pie for the players first.</p>
<p>When asked, he could simply say it was almost ready.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>While drafting the design concept drafts, the official staff from the gameplay Expo contacted Chen Xu.</p>
<p>After all, the layout of the展区 had to be proposed by Nebula Games.</p>
<p>Additionally, if needed, the expo staff could assist in arranging performances such as cosers.</p>
<p>Of course, developers were also free to contact talent agencies directly.</p>
<p>Since the venue was located in Modu, Chen Xu took a break to visit the site in person before making final decisions.</p>
<p>After all, since he had decided to participate, he wanted to do it right.</p>
<p>Moreover, the gameplay Expo was extremely popular domestically, making it a fantastic opportunity for exposure and promotion.</p>
<p>"Are Sector 5 and Sector 7 next to our Sector 6 occupied by TengHua and NetDragon?" Chen Xu asked.</p>
<p>At the exhibition site, numerous staff members were busy setting up posters and installing equipment.</p>
<p>"Not entirely. They're just exhibiting more games, and they have many affiliated studios," the staff member guiding Chen Xu explained with a smile.</p>
<p>Chen Xu nodded, indicating he understood.</p>
<p>Game developers at the level of TengHua and NetDragon naturally wouldn't have just one studio.</p>
<p>Their acquired game studios would also represent them at the expo.</p>
<p>"I've got a general idea of the situation. I'll send you a detailed plan by Wednesday," Chen Xu said.</p>
<p>"Great. Also, Mr. Chen, do you have any coser requirements? Would you like us to help contact and select them, or will you arrange it through your own agency?" the staff asked.</p>
<p>"Let the expo help with the arrangements. Saves us some trouble," Chen Xu replied after a moment of thought.</p>
<p>"Understood, Mr. Chen. Do you have any specific requirements for the cosers?" the staff inquired.</p>
<p>After all, cosers needed to match the characters from the games.</p>
<p>For example, if a character was a cute little girl, you couldn't have a mature woman portraying her.</p>
<p>"Hmm... Not really any strict requirements. Gender doesn't matter, but there is one thing—good physical stamina. They shouldn't be too frail," Chen Xu said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Hearing this, the enthusiastic staff member looked completely bewildered.</p>
<p>Wha... What?</p>
<p>Did he hear that right?</p>
<p>No gender restrictions, but must have good stamina?</p>
<p>He could understand requests for girls with fair skin, bigger figures, or longer legs.</p>
<p>But good stamina? What was this, a coser Showcase or a moving crew?</p>
