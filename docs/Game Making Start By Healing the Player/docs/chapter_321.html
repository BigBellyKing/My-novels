<p>Chapter 320: So Much Money, So Much Freedom! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games' office, Chen Xu was still discussing with everyone a detailed aspect of the development of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>.</p>
<p>The overall framework hadn't been thoroughly explained yet.</p>
<p>But even in terms of details, a lot could already be achieved.</p>
<p>Especially the decision to dedicate massive resources to render a single map,</p>
<p>providing players with a cinematic experience.</p>
<p>The pursuit here was naturally an ultimate visual effect.</p>
<p>For competitive multiplayer modes, such extreme visuals might not be what most players seek.</p>
<p>But in a single-player story, an ultimate visual experience would undoubtedly draw players deeper into the narrative.</p>
<p>This was beyond doubt.</p>
<p>"As for the physics engine, the Game Department hasn't delivered the development prototype yet, but I've already gathered most of the relevant data."</p>
<p>"Although it's already extremely powerful compared to current VR performance, there are still many details that require manual intervention."</p>
<p>"When glass or walls in a room get shattered by explosions, we need to create very special effects."</p>
<p>With Chen Xu's various explanations, everyone present was stunned.</p>
<p>So many details!</p>
<p>"But Mr. Chen, considering the specifications of the new VR device, wouldn't such a complex and massive scene be difficult to achieve?" Qin Yi raised a question.</p>
<p>It wasn't that they couldn't do it, but by current device standards, it would be hard to handle.</p>
<p>"We're going to push the VR device's hardware capabilities to the limit within a single level," Chen Xu said.</p>
<p>"But then the game might feel fragmented, requiring players to endure long loading times," Qin Yi continued.</p>
<p>"Use CG," Chen Xu glanced at Qin Yi, replying succinctly.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, Qin Yi immediately understood.</p>
<p>Wow, truly a simple and crude method!</p>
<p>How do you make players unaware of loading, ensuring a seamless, silky-smooth experience?</p>
<p>The answer was simple: replace the loading screen with a CGI cutscene, and ensure the CG sequence is longer than the actual loading time.</p>
<p>This was an extremely simple and crude approach.</p>
<p>Yet very few game developers bothered to do it.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it didn't significantly enhance the overall game quality.</p>
<p>And it was expensive!</p>
<p>But for Chen Xu, he clearly understood the value of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>.</p>
<p>CG animation?</p>
<p>A minor expense. Money? No problem—so much money, so much freedom!</p>
<p>Moreover, compared to <em>Warcraft</em>, an RTS game that offered limited opportunities for subsequent revenue, <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, as an FPS, could incorporate numerous monetization elements—just like <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>.</p>
<p>Next came the sound effects for firearms, which would also be manually crafted.</p>
<p>For example, missile sounds would be recorded using snowmobiles, then processed and tuned.</p>
<p>Real-life sound effects often differed greatly from players' imaginations.</p>
<p>Just like war games—if the experience were as brutally tragic as a documentary, most players would lose interest.</p>
<p>After all, what many players wanted was their imagined version, not reality.</p>
<p>Like catgirls—players wanted the adorable, two-dimensional, sweet, vanilla, red bean, or coconut kind, not the grotesque versions from horror tales.</p>
<p>As for the feel of shooting firearms and physical actions in VR, Nebula Games originally had no experience in this area. But now, Chen Xu could only say: NetDragon, thank you.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>After finalizing certain development details of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> with the team, Chen Xu returned to his office to refine the game's subsequent content.</p>
<p>In Chen Xu's view, the Gameplay of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> was already quite mature.</p>
<p>Compared to current FPS games on the market, many of its designs were actually quite groundbreaking.</p>
<p>And when compared to the recently launched <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, they were entirely different genres with distinct player audiences.</p>
<p>First, the breath-to-heal mechanic—though not originally invented by the Call of Duty series.</p>
<p>The shield mechanic in <em>Halo</em> was the Embryonic Form of regenerating health through breathing, but it was Call of Duty that truly popularized the mechanic.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage of this system was keeping players' focus and rhythm constantly centered on combat.</p>
<p>After taking damage, the screen would shift into red or black-and-white hues depending on injury severity. But as long as the player didn't die instantly, a few seconds of disengaging from combat would allow health regeneration through deep breathing.</p>
<p>This kept players deeply immersed in the game experience while maintaining a fast-paced rhythm.</p>
<p>In typical FPS games, when injured, players would likely search for health packs.</p>
<p>This created a disconnect, breaking the tension and intensity of the story and Level Design.</p>
<p>But with breath-to-heal, players remained fully engaged in combat.</p>
<p>Additionally, there were multiplayer mode features, such as firearm customization—adding infrared sights, night vision goggles, and various attachments.</p>
<p>And Call of Duty's unique killstreak reward system: after achieving a kill streak, players could deploy high-tech items.</p>
<p>UAV drones that revealed enemy positions—essentially enabling wallhacks—pagers for targeted airstrikes, supply crates dropped from the sky, RPGs, flamethrowers, and more.</p>
<p>The reason <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> became so popular in Chen Xu's previous life wasn't just because other games were still rooted in World War settings, or because of its excellent story.</p>
<p>The wide array of modern weapons also attracted many players.</p>
<p>If the story elevated <em>Modern Warfare</em> to its peak, it was the multiplayer mode that turned it into an annual franchise.</p>
<p>High-intensity, fast-paced combat—this was the core philosophy of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, certain special maps where everyone crouched and hid, searched endlessly, and eventually got blown up by landmines, were exceptions.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> quickly entered an intensive development phase. As a VR game, its main difference from its previous life version was the sense of immersion.</p>
<p>The force feedback system inside the VR pods also required Chen Xu to personally calibrate every detail.</p>
<p>The VR feedback from gunfire, getting hit by bullets, explosions, climbing, jumping—each action had corresponding haptic feedback.</p>
<p>At the same time, every minute detail was meticulously handled.</p>
<p>Physical feedback from explosions and gunfire, destruction of environments—these were all critically important.</p>
<p>Chen Xu's sole purpose was to ensure that when players played the game, they truly felt like they had become characters like Soap or Roach.</p>
<p>Experiencing the story of Task Force 141.</p>
<p>Though the task was tedious, the entire team had already gained significant experience from developing <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>.</p>
<p>Chen Xu had also communicated with NetDragon.</p>
<p>They would provide technical support, and in return, Chen Xu would later offer them support in areas such as AI technology.</p>
<p>"Don't rush the progress. Let the people from NetDragon do more of the work—you and the tech department should learn as much as possible."</p>
<p>Inside the office, Chen Xu called Qin Yi in for work assignments.</p>
<p>Qin Yi gave a smile: "I understand, Mr. Chen."</p>
<p>Chen Xu nodded with a smile in return.</p>
