                <p>Chapter 871: Easy to See, Hard to Learn</p>
<p>The entire video wasn’t very long, only about four minutes, and that included a lot of slow-motion shots. As for the content, while it was billed as high-level play instruction, it was really just a simple demonstration—essentially, an idealized combo.</p>
<p>It featured Link’s Aerial Back A-attack combined with an aerial infinite combo using Remote Bombs, as well as flashy Chase Combos utilizing his Boomerang, Bow and Arrows, and Remote Bombs.</p>
<p>In actual combat, these aerial infinite combos are almost impossible to pull off unless the timing is absolutely perfect. As for the skill combination combos, they look incredibly flashy to players now, but after a bit more experimentation, players will realize they're not that difficult.</p>
<p>And in Smash Bros., even basic normal attacks (jabs) can cancel out Recovery Frames with Special Attacks, allowing for Seamless Combos.</p>
<p>However, most players currently didn't understand the intricacies, and they uniformly felt one thing: this was completely different from the Smash Bros. they were playing!</p>
<p>What surprised players even more was Link's strategy in the video.</p>
<p>Most players who had just started playing Smash Bros. tended to fight in the center of the Arena. They would only venture away from the center if they were knocked out, as the game’s design dictates that being knocked off-screen results in a loss.</p>
<p>Similarly, if a player falls off a cliff and can't recover, they also lose.</p>
<p>Therefore, only the very center of the Arena provided a sense of security.</p>
<p>Because of this, combined with the Percentage Meter system, a Smash Bros. match typically lasted four or five minutes, sometimes even longer. Compared to the 1-3 minute duration of traditional Fighting Games, Smash Bros. matches were longer, yet not slow-paced. On the contrary, Smash Bros.' unique skill design made the game intense from start to finish.</p>
<p>But in this video, Link showed many players an alternative approach: shifting the battlefield from the center of the Arena to the edge of the cliff.</p>
<p>Most of Link's executions in the video took place at the edge of the Arena.</p>
<p>He even actively jumped off the stage to attack opponents attempting to recover, then used his Double Jump and Up Special (a move with significant recovery distance) to return to the Arena. To all players, it felt incredibly: flashy!</p>
<p>Especially when an opponent was knocked off-stage and tried to recover, Link would proactively jump out, successfully land a downward attack, and most likely, the opponent would plummet into the abyss like a meteor. The visual effects were absolutely maxed out.</p>
<p>Soon, this video sparked widespread discussion within the player community.</p>
<p>Even some casual players, who had no interest in honing skills, still clicked on this short video. While many casual players weren't keen on delving into Smash Bros. techniques, they still wanted to understand what kind of tricks the game offered.</p>
<p>It was like watching a DOTA tournament. Even if they couldn't perform like professional players, watching for entertainment was perfectly fine.</p>
<p>So, even though they didn't know how strong the Link in the video truly was, his flashy combos alone were enough to generate eager discussion among players.</p>
<p>“Damn it, damn it, is that even human? An Infinite Combo? Bowser executed at 70%?!”</p>
<p>“What the heck, fighting at the edge of the cliff? I only ever dared to fight in the center of the Arena.”</p>
<p>“Why did Link in the video execute Bowser at 70%? Every time I fight Heavyweight Characters like him, I have to get them to almost 200% before they get knocked off.”</p>
<p>“This Link is totally different from the Link I play! He's so cool and handsome!”</p>
<p>“And the Reads, the execution, and the combination of skills are just too perfect!”</p>
<p>“Throwing the Remote Bomb early, then knocking them up, then detonating the bomb into a combo—I’m dumbfounded!”</p>
<p>“F*ck, why add On-screen Instructions to the video? Is this something I can even Learn?”</p>
<p>“Cliff Chase! This is truly High-Level Play! Say no more, I'm going to practice!”</p>
<p>“So that’s how it is! Understood! I’ve got it!”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mr. Chen, I’ve Learned Nothing!”</p>
<p>This short video, just a few minutes long, immediately ignited frantic discussion among players. Before this, a small group of people had thought Smash Bros. didn't have much depth, but after watching it, they were utterly overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Because Smash Bros. operates on a completely different concept than traditional Fighting Games.</p>
<p>If you approach Smash Bros. with the mindset of a traditional Fighting Game, it seems simple. But if you deep dive into Smash Bros.'s mechanics, you'll find its advanced content is monstrously complex.</p>
<p>In traditional Fighting Games, such combos are actually very difficult to perform, as the game's hit detection makes such visually pleasing Chase Combos almost impossible.</p>
<p>But Smash Bros. is different. Its strong air control and knockback mechanics make the game feel like a Character Action Game.</p>
<p>Regular combos become standard attacks, but in this unique mode, Chase Combos become High-Level Play.</p>
<p>Especially the Environmental Kills at the edge of the stage, which showed many Fighting Game experts a completely different style of Fighting Game.</p>
<p>Link's Remote Bomb recovery also stunned many players. The principle, when explained, is simple; some FPS Games have similar operations, such as Grenade Jumps, Rocket Jumps, and so on.</p>
<p>However, in a Character Action Game like Smash Bros., the visual effect presented is entirely different.</p>
<p>The immediate result of this video was that countless players chose Link in Smash Bros.' matchmaking.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>“Old Zhang, Old Zhang, Log In! My Master Sword is Eagerly Waiting!” Song Ren, who had also finished the video and already performed Mental Training, saw Zhang Yi’s name light up in his friends list and immediately called out.</p>
<p>“Hehe, you noob, Got Carried Away Watching Highlight Reels, didn't you? Don’t you have any self-awareness?” Zhang Yi chuckled, but didn't delay, logging into Smash Bros. immediately and skillfully Sent an Invite to Song Ren.</p>
<p>1v1, no items, starter stage. He also opened a spectator interface and pulled Wang Han in.</p>
<p>“Who lost the first duel to me?” Song Ren asked proudly.</p>
<p>“Get Real! That's because you played two hours more than me, and our current win rates are 53% to 47%. Tell me loudly, who has 53%?” Zhang Yi retorted.</p>
<p>“I don’t care, you Got the First Kill on me.” Song Ren huffed.</p>
<p>“Old Song, what Audacious Remarks are those!” Wang Han, who was spectating, felt somewhat ‘offended’ and couldn't help but complain.</p>
<p>“Cough cough, don't mind those… Damn it, Old Zhang, didn't you say I had no self-awareness? What's the meaning of you picking Link?” Song Ren was about to say something, but seeing Zhang Yi Instantly Picked Link, he couldn't hold back.</p>
<p>“I said you had no self-awareness, but I didn't say I had any. Stop talking nonsense, pick your Link, let's Compete for Supremacy!”</p>
