                <p>Chapter 888: Well Done, Don't Do It Next Time</p>
<p>One month after the release of next-gen VR gaming pods, most players had already completed Persona.</p>
<p>Whether they liked it or not, players shared a common understanding of the game: it was excellent.</p>
<p>Especially with the relaxing and more immersive experience brought by next-gen VR, Persona's performance left players extremely satisfied.</p>
<p>Moreover, many elements were not breakthroughs in gameplay but rather in interactive technology.</p>
<p>For example, the experience provided by performance feedback in the VR gaming pods.</p>
<p>During this period, games from other domestic developers were also successively launched to enrich the next-gen VR game lineup.</p>
<p>Several of these escort titles were of outstanding quality, and even the generally decent games offered players different kinds of enjoyment through the unique next-gen VR experience.</p>
<p>This also infinitely raised players' expectations.</p>
<p>Until Nebula Games and Chen Xu delivered brand-new news two weeks later.</p>
<p>'By popular demand, the next-gen version of Resident Evil is now online. Players who own the game can log into the next-gen Nebula Games Store to update and download it, with a 50% off promotion also beginning.'</p>
<p>'The next-gen version of Bloodborne will be updated in mid-next month. Stay Tuned!'</p>
<p>'The brand-new wuxia title Fate Seeker will officially launch on the 28th. Follow in the footsteps of Zhuge Yu, Bao Zheng, and others to thwart the Anti-Heaven Alliance's conspiracy.'</p>
<p>'Additionally, Nebula Games' next-gen titles now support olfactory simulation mode. Players can enable the adaptation in the system settings menu.'</p>
<p>Four major announcements were made in a row, but the first two immediately sent players' blood pressure soaring, giving them a feeling akin to a myocardial infarction.</p>
<p>The good news was that the next-gen VR remake was already online, and not only was it launched, but it came with a 'buy one, get one free' deal.</p>
<p>However, the bad news was the names of these two games: one was Resident Evil, and the other was Bloodborne.</p>
<p>Outlast, Silent Hill, Resident Evil—when all three games were presented to players, with no option to choose the village from Ethan's visit, the amiable Baker family became the best choice. After all, the DLC at least had Joe Baker, the 'Iron Fist Unrivaled'.</p>
<p>As for the 'buy one, get one free' Bloodborne, most people weren't too concerned about the 'suffering' aspect anymore.</p>
<p>After all, it wasn't a new Souls-like game, but an old one.</p>
<p>All sorts of guides were already rampant.</p>
<p>Between the Cleric Beast, weak to fire, and Father Gascoigne, the God of War of stairs and tombstones, unless someone hadn't played Bloodborne and didn't look at guides, the 'suffering threshold' it imposed wouldn't be too high.</p>
<p>But the crucial point was the visual effects!</p>
<p>Bloodborne, under VR, would definitely be no less terrifying than a horror game.</p>
<p>Just thinking about the monsters in the game that made their SAN points plummet sent shivers down many players' spines.</p>
<p>As for the other two announcements, they allowed many players to breathe a sigh of relief and lower their blood pressure.</p>
<p>Fate Seeker, a wuxia game set against the backdrop of The Three Heroes and Five Gallants, had long been anticipated by many players. So, while excited by the launch news, they weren't surprised.</p>
<p>The only real surprise was the last announcement: the game would support an olfactory simulation system.</p>
<p>This new feature was a component built into the next-gen VR gaming pods.</p>
<p>However, for most players, it was still quite unfamiliar; some had even almost forgotten about this feature.</p>
<p>Although it was touted as a highlight when the gaming pods were released,</p>
<p>Aside from the simulation software pre-installed in the pods, games themselves didn't support it.</p>
<p>Naturally, players didn't have much interest in it.</p>
<p>At most, it was a novelty at the very beginning.</p>
<p>But now that a game supported it, things were different.</p>
<p>Imagine galloping across the prairies in the Western world of Red Dead Redemption, inhaling the fragrance of fresh grass.</p>
<p>In The Legend of Zelda, Link places beef on a grill, and the aroma of meat wafts out with the dripping juices.</p>
<p>In Uncharted, when Nathan pilots a boat across the ocean, the natural scents carried by the sea breeze.</p>
<p>How wonderful, how poetic!</p>
<p>These were the experiences imagined in countless players' minds.</p>
<p>How amazing?</p>
<p>How immersive?</p>
<p>Simply captivating!</p>
<p>However, reality was quite harsh.</p>
<p>This time, Chen Xu updated the olfactory system partly because the Game Department had also updated its technology, allowing more scents to be simulated. On the other hand, as escort titles, the Game Department had also communicated with Nebula Games.</p>
<p>After all, the olfactory system was a major feature of the next-gen experience, so how could it not be included?</p>
<p>Whether players used it or not, it had to be done!</p>
<p>Subtle scents still couldn't be simulated perfectly.</p>
<p>But the games chosen this time were incredibly supportive of this update!</p>
<p>With the update of the new system, players entering Persona didn't feel much change.</p>
<p>The fragrance of fresh grass, while sounding pleasant in written descriptions, was actually a bit strong in reality.</p>
<p>Anyone who has seen masked workers mowing grass on the roadside knows that while the scent might seem good at first sniff, too much of it can blow your mind away.</p>
<p>Of course, in the game, these simulated scents were definitely specially blended.</p>
<p>However, compared to Persona's turn-based and progression-based gameplay, most players who re-entered the game solely to experience the next-gen olfactory feature were actually not very satisfied.</p>
<p>Because it didn't provide that immersive sense of presence.</p>
<p>That is, until they launched the next-gen Resident Evil.</p>
<p>Most players who had already played it, only wanting to experience the next-gen feel, skipped the opening cutscene with Ethan and his wife Mia.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the Baker farm, once filled with blood and tears, all players fell silent.</p>
<p>Song Ren, who had immediately downloaded the game to experience the next-gen feel, stood motionless on the small path.</p>
<p>If someone had x-ray vision, they would notice Song Ren's extremely subtle expression at that moment.</p>
<p>The decaying flesh emitted an indescribable stench, and the dried bloodstains still left a faint metallic smell in the air.</p>
<p>And when he reached the door of the house, the foul odor from the path indeed lessened, but the musty smell emanating from the wooden house due to prolonged neglect, combined with the unusual stench from the living room, made Song Ren feel like retching.</p>
<p>Having played Resident Evil, he naturally knew exactly what those smells were.</p>
<p>From the unlucky TV producer who came here years ago, to the poop-like food in the microwave and refrigerator.</p>
<p>Thinking about the scene where the family later eats harmoniously, Song Ren quietly opened the system settings menu and turned off the olfactory simulation.</p>
<p>With that thing on, he didn't even dare to take a deep breath to relieve his mental stress.</p>
<p>Quietly exiting the game, Song Ren then logged onto the official Weibo accounts of the Game Department and Nebula Games, posting an official Weibo message.</p>
<p>'The olfactory system is very well done, and the sense of immersion in the game is very strong, so please don't do it next time.'</p>
<p>At that moment, Song Ren was genuinely worried. With the advancement of technology, would there be little balls in the future with many small holes, tied with two red strings, that could be put in one's mouth to simulate tastes?</p>
<p>If the game simulated the taste of whatever you ate, how creepy would that be!</p>
