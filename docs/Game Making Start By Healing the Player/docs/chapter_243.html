<h3>Chapter 242: The Difficulty is Just Right, Perfectly Balanced! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</h3>
<p>Time passed day by day. During this period, numerous games launched their promotional campaigns.</p>
<p>Even the Channel Alliance began promoting certain games.</p>
<p>However, this had little impact on Nebula Games.</p>
<p>After all, Chen Xu had just recently announced a wealth of information about <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>.</p>
<p>At this stage, both the so-called Channel Alliance and Nebula Games clearly understood this was a war of attrition.</p>
<p>Victory wouldn’t be decided quickly. It all came down to releasing game after game, steadily increasing players’ attention, spending, and loyalty toward their respective platforms.</p>
<p>While online communities buzzed with discussions about the latest popular games,</p>
<p>Inside the Nebula Games office,</p>
<p>Chen Xu was finalizing future content plans for <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> with Qin Yi and the team.</p>
<p>Game development was progressing smoothly. Thanks to prior experience developing <em>Dark Souls</em>, many challenges were no longer difficult.</p>
<p>Moreover, compared to before, Nebula Games Platform’s transformation had allowed the team size to grow further.</p>
<p>Now, employees joining Chen Xu’s team were almost exclusively industry elites.</p>
<p>Under Chen Xu’s leadership, the game development speed had naturally become vastly different from the past.</p>
<p>The game’s overall framework was essentially complete. A massive amount of art assets had already been reviewed and approved.</p>
<p>What remained were primarily weapon-specific actions, boss feedback mechanics, numerical balancing, and fine-tuning details.</p>
<p>"The appearance of third-party creatures shouldn’t be too frequent. It’s one of the game’s selling points, but not the core aspect."</p>
<p>Sitting at his desk, Chen Xu observed the scene on-screen.</p>
<p>In the middle of battling Diablos, he was suddenly interrupted by a Barroth barging in.</p>
<p>Although the Barroth was instantly crushed—had Diablos been carnivorous, not even bones would’ve remained—</p>
<p>In ten test runs, Barroth had appeared five times. That’s a fifty percent chance.</p>
<p>Such a high probability was simply too much.</p>
<p>The game world was a continuous open-world environment. Zones were separated by narrow tunnels, rushing rivers, and steep cliffs, forming distinct regions. Meanwhile, the entire ecosystem would behave dynamically.</p>
<p>But too high a probability wasn’t desirable.</p>
<p>"Appearing occasionally can surprise players, but appearing constantly turns surprise into annoyance. Reduce the chance significantly. You can reference the Murlocs vs. pigs battle easter egg in <em>Don't Starve</em> as a reference," Chen Xu explained to the nearby employees, pointing out certain shortcomings in the game.</p>
<p>"Hmm… Bazelgeuse is an exception, though. Given its ecological behavior of roaming across the New World in search of prey, its appearances should naturally be more frequent," Chen Xu added.</p>
<p>"Then Mr. Chen, should we adjust the difficulty later on?" Qin Yi asked tentatively.</p>
<p>Having worked on monster action design, they were well aware of the game’s difficulty.</p>
<p>On the surface, the game seemed simple, but in reality, it was extremely hardcore.</p>
<p>Especially when players first encountered monsters like Diablos.</p>
<p>Frequent Dragon Charges, tough scales, massive damage, and various roars that could stun you—</p>
<p>It was incredibly frustrating.</p>
<p>Not to mention the weapons, which looked flashy and cool,</p>
<p>But mastering them required serious practice.</p>
<p>If you jumped in with zero experience, you’d likely end up with Great Sword’s Level 3 Charged Slash swinging at air, Charge Blade’s Super Amped Element Discharge hacking the ground, Long Sword’s Foresight Slash never landing its 'ding,' and Hammer users just foot-trimming.</p>
<p>Actually, new players probably wouldn’t even execute a Super Amped Element Discharge—they’d just swing wildly at random.</p>
<p>As a result, Hunters’ daily routine would often devolve into being carted three times in a row back to camp.</p>
<p>"Adjust what? The difficulty is perfectly balanced—just right! Look how easily you can deal with Great Jagras, and Kulu-Ya-Ku is a walk in the park. Compared to <em>Dark Souls</em>, this is far more humane, gradually progressing from easy to Hardened. Isn’t that completely normal?" Chen Xu said with a cheerful grin.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu’s words, Qin Yi was momentarily speechless.</p>
<p>Chen Xu couldn’t help but chuckle.</p>
<p>In reality, the difficulty of <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> had indeed been significantly reduced.</p>
<p>The original <em>Monster Hunter</em> series was notoriously difficult.</p>
<p>But <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> struck just the right balance.</p>
<p>By following the main quest and occasionally grinding gear, players could generally only achieve one-shot kills by the time they reached Nergigante.</p>
<p>Throughout the journey, healing items, armor, traps, and Palicos provided ample support, greatly reducing the difficulty.</p>
<p>There were even many cheese strategies available in the game.</p>
<p>Of course, these required players to have a basic understanding of <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>’s systems.</p>
<p>Without that understanding…</p>
<p>Great Sword’s charge attacks were the romance of men. Charge Blade’s Super Amped Element Discharge was pure damage output. Long Sword was cool, Palicos were cute—what else mattered?</p>
<p>"If all else fails, isn’t there the Team Up system? Players can just team up and fight monsters together," Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Seeing Chen Xu’s cheerful expression, Qin Yi and the others nearby were utterly speechless.</p>
<p>Seriously, they believed him!</p>
<p>Team up to fight monsters!?</p>
<p>As a cooperative hunting game, <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> could certainly showcase a unique charm.</p>
<p>In most games, teaming up drastically reduced difficulty.</p>
<p>But <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> was different. For rookie players, multiplayer hunts actually increased the difficulty!</p>
<p>Although there was no friendly fire, attacking teammates still caused flinch/stun.</p>
<p>During a Dragon Charge, the Dual Blades-wielding teammate beside you suddenly unleashes Demon Dance.</p>
<p>Stunned, you watch helplessly as the Dragon Charge turns into a carting.</p>
<p>You’re executing a Rising Slash with your Long Sword to sever a tail, already picturing the Elder Dragon writhing in pain—</p>
<p>Then, out of nowhere, a Level 3 Charged Hammer strike smacks you in the face.</p>
<p>The most dangerous part of cooperative hunting isn’t the boss—it’s the teammate standing next to you.</p>
<p>Dual Blades foot-trimming and back-scrubbing, all white damage numbers, spinning and jumping straight into a cart.</p>
<p>Protect the Elder Dragon in front of you. Attack the teammate beside you.</p>
<p>That’s the daily reality of Hunters teaming up!</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Time continued to pass.</p>
<p>One after another, many games began their warm-up promotions.</p>
<p>In the industry, numerous designers discussed the current wave of gaming hype.</p>
<p>"Have you guys been following the recent few games? They seem to be gaining a lot of popularity."</p>
<p>"Of course. NetDragon, TengHua, and even the Channel Alliance haven’t said much, but it’s obvious they’re cooperating."</p>
<p>"Targeting Chen Xu? Planning to counter <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>?"</p>
<p>"Unlikely. Probably just testing. Besides, these games have decent quality, but nothing particularly unique."</p>
<p>"Still, <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> is a hunting game—it’s a relatively niche theme!"</p>
<p>"Exactly. It’s a test. If <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> underperforms, the Channel Alliance will definitely jump in. But if it succeeds, they’ll just feign death."</p>
<p>"Though come to think of it, Chen Xu hasn’t reacted much lately. No news about <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>—feels kind of low-key."</p>
<p>"Development’s been going on for a while. It’s probably nearing completion. Honestly, I really hope Chen Xu succeeds. Nebula Games Platform has truly reshaped the domestic dominance of traditional channels."</p>
<p>Many industry designers were chatting about this.</p>
<p>As for the players, they were growing increasingly impatient.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Previously, leaks about <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> popped up every few days.</p>
<p>But what now?</p>
<p>One game after another had started their promotions.</p>
<p>Why was Nebula Games still silent?</p>
<p>Could it be they only made a folder?</p>
<p>While players kept @-mentioning Chen Xu’s official Weibo account and flooded forum communities discussing <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>’s progress,</p>
<p>Finally, Chen Xu and Nebula Games’ official Weibo account dropped new news about <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>.</p>
<p>And they just announced something that excited many players.</p>
