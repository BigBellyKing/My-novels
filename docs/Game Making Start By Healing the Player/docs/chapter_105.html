<h1>Chapter 105: Tears</h1>
<p>After the reunion of Carl's family of three, the screen faded into a brief black screen.</p>
<p>【Mary, who had heard nothing about Emile for so long, finally received a letter from her father weeks later.】</p>
<p>A sorrowful BGM slowly began to play, and the camera shifted to Emile's prison cell.</p>
<p>The cell door opened, and an officer walked in, telling Emile that the time had come.</p>
<p>Emile, dressed in tattered clothes, wore a pair of shackles on his feet.</p>
<p>Without any prompts, he could only continue moving forward.</p>
<p>At this moment, Liuliu in front of the computer felt a terrible suspicion forming in her heart.</p>
<p>Along the path forward, none of the soldiers showed contempt toward Emile.</p>
<p>As Emile passed by, they saluted, removed their hats, or turned their heads away, unwilling to look at him.</p>
<p>Even the soldiers escorting Emile would not grow impatient when the player made Emile pause—they would simply stop and wait silently in place.</p>
<p>There was no violence, no shoving—just quiet, respectful waiting.</p>
<p>Accompanied by a melancholic piano melody, Emile's narration began softly, matching his footsteps.</p>
<p>【My dearest Mary, for me, the war has ended. I have no regrets in my heart. I have witnessed too many horrors.】</p>
<p>【I only hope fate treats you more kindly.】</p>
<p>【Though our days alive were so brief, my entire life has been filled with happiness—I can only be grateful.】</p>
<p>【I have been blessed with so much, especially for Heaven sending you into my life.】</p>
<p>【This letter will be my last.】</p>
<p>【I have been found guilty by a military tribunal for killing an officer.】</p>
<p>【Although I never intended to kill him.】</p>
<p>【War drives men to madness.】</p>
<p>【Though I have disappointed Carl, I know my sacrifice was not in vain.】</p>
<p>As Emile advanced, soldier after soldier removed their hats in salute.</p>
<p>Freddie was among them. Watching Emile, who was about to walk to the execution ground, he took off his hat, his face filled with sorrow.</p>
<p>Memories of the past resurfaced one by one.</p>
<p>The dog, Anna, Carl, and his daughter and grandson.</p>
<p>【I fought for my country and for my freedom. I upheld my dignity.】</p>
<p>【Since fate has led us to part here, in life and death,】</p>
<p>【I can only pray we will reunite in Heaven.】</p>
<p>【Please continue to pray for me.】</p>
<p>【Forever loving you—Father】</p>
<p>Standing before the execution post, Emile's face showed only calmness—no fear.</p>
<p>The screen gradually faded into darkness.</p>
<p>‘Bang!’ A gunshot rang out, followed by the sound of a body collapsing to the ground.</p>
<p>The next moment, a somber melody began playing, and the scene shifted to a graveyard.</p>
<p>Under the setting sun, endless wooden crosses stretched into the distance. The French flag fluttered in the wind far away.</p>
<p>【Though their bodies have long turned to dirt, they live on forever in people's hearts.】</p>
<p>【We must cherish these memories. We must not forget.】</p>
<p>Before Emile's grave, the dog, Carl, Mary, and their son stood quietly together.</p>
<p>With this, the game officially came to an end.</p>
<p>Liuliu, sitting in front of her computer, was now completely in tears.</p>
<p>Her eyes red, she stared at the ending scene on the screen and gently wiped her face with a tissue from the side.</p>
<p>"Emile... Emile never knew until his last breath that Carl had actually survived. He still believed he had failed Carl," Liuliu said, her voice slightly choked.</p>
<p>She wasn't unfamiliar with tragic games.</p>
<p>In fact, just last year, <em>To the Moon</em> had presented countless players with a heartbreaking yet beautiful love story.</p>
<p>But the core of <em>To the Moon</em> was fundamentally different from <em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em>.</p>
<p>To describe it in one word: heavy/somber.</p>
<p>There were no overtly emotional scenes designed to manipulate players' feelings. Instead, it was like boiling a frog in warm water—gradually, through subtle buildup, it shattered the player's most vulnerable emotions.</p>
<p>What it showcased was too cruel, even oppressive to the heart.</p>
<p>In Emile's final words, there was no complaint about his fate.</p>
<p>Only love for his family, and no regrets about his life.</p>
<p>Unlike grand-scale war games, <em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em> didn't rely on flashy content.</p>
<p>It didn't use hyper-realistic graphics to depict the brutality of war.</p>
<p>Instead, it brought players close to families torn apart by war, and to those who had suffered under its weight.</p>
<p>And this approach delivered an impact far stronger than any visual spectacle.</p>
<p>Emile was merely a microcosm of countless such individuals.</p>
<p>In fact, one could even say Emile and Carl were among the lucky ones in the game.</p>
<p>And precisely because of that, the cruelty of war felt even more intense, and the weight even more unbearable.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>It wasn't just Liuliu—every player who had Cleared the Game was left in tears.</p>
<p>Because within the game, there were simply too many moments that struck straight at their emotional core.</p>
<p>One moment, Emile had just become friends with a German officer; the next, that officer was blown to pieces.</p>
<p>The search-and-rescue dog had just reunited with his former owner—then the owner was killed in an explosion.</p>
<p>Carl's family of three had just been reunited—only for Emile to be led to the execution ground.</p>
<p>There were countless such moments—scenes that warmed your heart one second, then stabbed a knife into it the next.</p>
<p>It wasn't just the story, but the game's overall presentation.</p>
<p><em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em> wasn't a large-scale game by any means—the entire playtime was only about three hours.</p>
<p>In terms of sales, it didn't start strong. After all, it was a small-scale title, and one entered in the Game Design Competition, so many players were still waiting and watching.</p>
<p>But its rating shot straight through the roof—reaching an astonishing 9.8 out of 10.</p>
<p>Thanks to this sky-high score, <em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em> quickly spread like wildfire among players.</p>
<p>Player reviews and related topics multiplied rapidly.</p>
<p>"Chen Xu always knows how to trick us! This game showed us once again what a Warrior of Love truly is. He promised a heartwarming experience, but after playing it, I was completely bewildered!"</p>
<p>"I really wanted to punch Chen Xu, but I have to admit—by the end, I was in tears. The ending was truly moving!"</p>
<p>"At first, I was skeptical—how could such a small game convey anti-war messages? But I have to say, Chen Xu pulled it off!"</p>
<p>"There has never been a good war, nor a bad peace!"</p>
<p>"The game truly has valiant hearts, but unlike the alternative English subtitle 'The Great War,' this war—born from politics and greed—can never be called 'great' in any sense!"</p>
<p>Of course, there were also some players who disliked this mode. After all, tastes differ greatly—what pleases one person may not please another.</p>
<p>Chen Xu couldn't possibly create a game that covers every aspect and satisfies every player's preferences.</p>
<p>But compared to the divided opinions among players, gaming media across the industry gave the game uniformly glowing reviews.</p>
<p>(One more chapter coming later—show some love and give recommendation votes and Monthly Pass to this author who's never seen the world, sob sob...)</p>
