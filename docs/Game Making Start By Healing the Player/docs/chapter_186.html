                <p>Chapter 185: A Scene from a Massive Disaster Film (Fifth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>After <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em> launched,</p>
<p>Countless Dark Souls players rushed in to witness the epic tale of the Age of First Fire.</p>
<p>Before even entering the game, players mentally pictured themselves wielding a sword and shield, carrying a greatsword on their back,</p>
<p>clashing with ancient monarchs like Sun King Gwyn, Gravelord Nito, and the Witch of Izalith—showing them what it truly meant to be a Bearer of the Flame!</p>
<p>The gods? Nothing special!</p>
<p>Yet the moment they entered the game, these players were immediately subjected to all manner of thrashings.</p>
<p>First, the Asylum Demon delivered a stern warning to countless players.</p>
<p>Then, upon arriving at Firelink Shrine, many mistakenly wandered into the Catacombs or New Londo Ruins.</p>
<p>Some even ventured so far as to ignite a bonfire deep within the Catacombs,</p>
<p>only to tragically discover one horrifying truth—they couldn’t go back!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, players who reached the Undead Asylum outside the city fared no better.</p>
<p>Black Knights, Javier, Wyvern Bridge—</p>
<p>each taught them exactly what it meant to be Undead!</p>
<p>Instantly, regardless of borders or time zones, every major game forum across the globe was flooded with players’ tearful complaints.</p>
<p>Though languages differed and phrasing varied, one core sentiment rang universally true:</p>
<p>"This prequel is freaking hard!"</p>
<p>After being tormented, countless players cried out in despair.</p>
<p>Even though they had mentally prepared themselves,</p>
<p>once inside the game, they instantly understood what it meant—there’s always a higher mountain, a wider sky.</p>
<p>This difficulty, these routines, were even more brutal than the original <em>Dark Souls</em>!</p>
<p>The Bearer of the Flame who stepped into Lordran full of ambition</p>
<p>quickly learned what truly makes a sequel.</p>
<p>Familiar graphics? Familiar story? Familiar combat system?</p>
<p>Dead wrong! A true sequel is only worthy when, upon playing, you feel that stirring deep within your soul.</p>
<p>And without a doubt, <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em> delivered exactly that.</p>
<p>This brutally惨 death experience? It’s pure nostalgia, deeply familiar.</p>
<p>It instantly brought back that old feeling—being tortured until you were practically dead and back again.</p>
<p>The suffering countless players endured in the world of <em>Dark Souls</em>...</p>
<p>was nothing short of a massive disaster film, with no repeats.</p>
<p>Almost every scene bore the mark of their torment.</p>
<p>…………………</p>
<p>One player who accidentally wandered into the Valley of Drakes lost all sense of direction. When he finally spotted a giant dragon—long dead and already rotting—he smiled in relief.</p>
<p>Beside the dragon’s head lay two items glowing with white light.</p>
<p>After cautiously scanning the area to confirm no sky-falling traps,</p>
<p>the player grinned: "Wonder what great loot I’ll get!"</p>
<p>Full of joy, he ran toward the items—only for the dragon’s corpse to suddenly move.</p>
<p>With a violent head swing, it launched him into the air, then spat a thick glob of mucus, sending him straight back to the bonfire.</p>
<p>"What the hell!? The body’s rotting—how is this thing still alive!?"</p>
<p>Staring at the familiar three words on screen, the player’s Mindset shattered.</p>
<p>…………………</p>
<p>Returning from the water channel to Lower Undead Burg, a player who had previously teamed up with Solaire to defeat the Gargoyle Demon was brimming with excitement.</p>
<p>Clad in majestic knight armor, he stepped through the white fog gate.</p>
<p>Another thrilling BOSS battle was about to begin.</p>
<p>Amidst the collapsed ruins, the BOSS came into view—a fearsome Goat Head Demon, towering and imposing.</p>
<p>"Bring it on! Let’s see who’s stronger—this goat or the Taurus Demon I fought earlier!"</p>
<p>The player charged in, full of battle spirit.</p>
<p>The next moment, a fierce sound rang in his ears.</p>
<p>‘Woof! Woof! Woof!’</p>
<p>Alongside the charging goat came two crimson dogs.</p>
<p>"Damn it! What’s this? You’ve got backup!?!"</p>
<p>"What the hell? Why are these dogs so damn fierce!?"</p>
<p>"False advertising! Selling dog meat under a goat’s name!"</p>
<p>Staring at the words 【YOU DIED】 on the screen, the player was stunned.</p>
<p>Wasn’t this BOSS supposed to be a goat monster?! Why are there two dogs?! And why are they so damn vicious!?</p>
<p>Is it possible... the dogs are actually the real BOSS?</p>
<p>…………………</p>
<p>Beyond this, nearly every scene in <em>Dark Souls</em> was insane and depraved.</p>
<p>Take the infamous Blighttown, hailed by countless players as rivaling—or even surpassing—Farron Keep in difficulty.</p>
<p>In Blighttown, visibility was extremely low.</p>
<p>The vertical layout was massive, and players easily lost their way. Progress required items like the Sunlight Maggot just to see properly.</p>
<p>Every monster here was poisonous, and Blighttown’s mosquitoes were modeled so small that many players couldn’t even hit them.</p>
<p>Once poisoned, health drained as if from a severed artery—unstoppable. Without the Spider Shield and Antidote, passing through Blighttown was nothing short of hellish.</p>
<p>And in the lower levels, countless dogs roamed, paired with Blowdart Snipers on the second floor—utterly merciless.</p>
<p>There were also grotesque monsters—lunatics wielding corpses as weapons, Fatty the Mace-Poop Monster, giant maggots, mosquitoes, and Mad Dogs. The entire map felt oppressive and suffocating.</p>
<p>But here’s the kicker—Blighttown was only the beginning.</p>
<p>On the pillars of Anor Londo, a narrow path like a log bridge stretched across.</p>
<p>But from the rooftops of distant high-rises, two archers aimed at you and fired.</p>
<p>Well, “archers” is generous—what they shot weren’t arrows, but javelins.</p>
<p>High damage was one thing, but the real danger lay in the extreme height above the ground.</p>
<p>Without Black Iron Leggings, a single hit would send you flying into the abyss. Even with the armor, the impact was explosive.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Sen’s Fortress featured deadly traps—blade pendulums, spike-filled elevators, and narrow bridges under giant axes.</p>
<p>In the Great Hollow, one-punch mushroom men and the boss battle against the Table-Clearing Master, the Bed of Chaos, presented not just a challenge against the BOSS, but the constant threat of Environmental Kill.</p>
<p>The ground was riddled with cracks—step wrong and you’d fall to instant death. Meanwhile, the BOSS would use its massive hands to sweep enemies off like debris.</p>
<p>Even the player’s first destination, Undead Burg, was filled with malice.</p>
<p>Ambushing Black Knights, the insane Wyvern Bridge.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the Church District, the stairway corners and great hall swarmed with Hollow Blademasters—teaching players the true meaning of despair.</p>
<p>If the Hollow Blademasters weren’t bad enough, the worst part was that some of them had allies casting buffs.</p>
<p>Combined with the fact that bonfires couldn’t teleport players before obtaining the Lordvessel, countless players were pushed to the brink of collapse.</p>
<p>Though the game offered many shortcuts, you needed the skill to reach them.</p>
<p>No one could forget the sheer mental agony of the short journey from Blighttown back to Firelink Shrine.</p>
