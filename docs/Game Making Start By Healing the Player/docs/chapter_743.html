<p>Chapter 742: The False God of War and the True God of War</p>
<p>He wasn't sure if it was an illusion, but he felt that this son seemed to be even fiercer than Kratos.</p>
<p>This feeling became even stronger, especially as the game's story progressed, gradually strengthening Atreus's weapons and skills, and learning new arrows.</p>
<p>Before heading up the mountain path, a burst of Black Breath blocked their way. According to the Forest Witch, Kratos and Atreus understood that to pass this dark magic, they would have to travel to Alfheim, the Realm of Light Elves, to find the World Light to illuminate the path ahead.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of the mysterious Forest Witch, Kratos and Atreus used the World Tree to travel to Alfheim, the capital of the Elves.</p>
<p>However, it was different from what they had imagined, just like other places outside the Nine Realms.</p>
<p>In the Elf Realm, there were Undead Soldiers that seemed to appear out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Alfheim was also embroiled in war, with the Light Elves being invaded and massacred by the Dark Elves. Here, the game's difficulty increased once again.</p>
<p>Compared to the Undead Soldiers, these Dark Elves, who could fly at extremely fast speeds, were much harder to deal with.</p>
<p>At the same time, these Dark Elves also had blocking skills; when Kratos swung his Leviathan Axe, he would sometimes be parried by the Dark Elves. Furthermore, the Dark Elves were logically divided into melee and ranged mages based on their Class.</p>
<p>As for the BOSS battle in this map, Zhang Yi found it very challenging. A monster named Rock Ancient Ghoul was covered in stone, making it immune to damage, with only its chest core as a weak point.</p>
<p>Compared to Kratos, Atreus, who had already upgraded his arrow skills to have a very short cooldown, was almost a mobile artillery platform.</p>
<p>Kratos activated Spartan Rage and worked himself to exhaustion to take down a special Dark Elf with horns on its head.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi looked at Kratos, who was panting heavily after the battle, then at Atreus, who seemed completely unfazed.</p>
<p>He just felt something was off.</p>
<p>Although the combat was very engaging and exhilarating.</p>
<p>Kratos's punches landed with impact, and the feedback of the axe hitting monsters was excellent.</p>
<p>But judging by his performance, Kratos would be panting and clutching his back after just dealing with one or two Dark Elves.</p>
<p>And earlier, when pushing the giant millstone, Atreus even worried if Kratos had hurt his back.</p>
<p>Could Kratos still be considered the God of War?</p>
<p>He was practically an aged old man! And an illiterate one at that.</p>
<p>And if easy mode was like this, how terrifying would God of War difficulty be?</p>
<p>He probably could only keep his distance and rely on throwing his axe for damage, right?</p>
<p>Zhang Yi grumbled inwardly.</p>
<p>Just then, Kratos and Atreus arrived at the light pillar formed by the World Light.</p>
<p>Kratos handed his axe to Atreus, then entered the light pillar.</p>
<p>Upon entering, Kratos fell into an illusion.</p>
<p>The scenes that appeared were the path Kratos and Atreus had traveled so far.</p>
<p>During this, Kratos heard conversations between Atreus and his deceased wife.</p>
<p>It was also here that Zhang Yi understood some of Atreus's inner thoughts, for example, his extremely complex feelings towards Kratos, his biological father.</p>
<p>On one hand, he indeed loved his father, but on the other, he resented him because of Kratos's past actions.</p>
<p>In the illusion, Kratos kept moving forward, finally pushing open a door and arriving at a broken bridge.</p>
<p>In front, in a place filled with light, Kratos seemed to see his wife, Laufey. He raised his left hand, slowly walking forward, wanting to approach.</p>
<p>But just then, a pair of hands appeared behind Kratos, pulling him out of the illusion.</p>
<p>'Wait! Come back! No... No!'</p>
<p>Kratos shouted loudly, trying to stop it all.</p>
<p>But the next moment, he was pulled out of the illusion and fell heavily into the temple.</p>
<p>'What did you do? Why would you do that!'</p>
<p>Looking at Atreus, who was beside him with a concerned expression, Kratos, pulled from the illusion, questioned Atreus with a face full of fury.</p>
<p>Facing Kratos's anger, Atreus's emotions also became agitated. His voice revealed his panic and fear of being abandoned.</p>
<p>'I saved you! You were stuck in there. I kept waiting and waiting, but you didn't come out... That's why I pulled you out!'</p>
<p>'Boy, I was only in there... for a moment.'</p>
<p>'No way! You were in there for a very, very long time! I didn't know what to do! You abandoned me! For the second time! Why don't you care about me?'</p>
<p>'I...'</p>
<p>Kratos looked at the World Light in his hand and fell silent.</p>
<p>And Zhang Yi also fell into silence.</p>
<p>Unlike Kratos, Zhang Yi now had only one thought.</p>
<p>Who the hell is the real God of War?</p>
<p>Looking at the countless Dark Elf corpses around, Zhang Yi felt his perception severely challenged.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi had fought these dead Dark Elves before.</p>
<p>They were elite mobs, and he had used all his strength to kill several of them.</p>
<p>After the battle, Kratos would still be panting, and Zhang Yi would smash pots and jars everywhere, hoping to find green souls to replenish his health.</p>
<p>But now, Atreus, with Kratos's axe, had single-handedly cut down hundreds of them?</p>
<p>You're the God of War, aren't you?</p>
<p>Especially with the subsequent developments, Zhang Yi was left speechless.</p>
<p>After collecting the World Light, Kratos imbued the light into Atreus's bow.</p>
<p>From then on, Atreus learned a new ability: transforming arrows into light-elemental ones.</p>
<p>This made the bow's attack power even higher, and it was particularly effective against these Dark Elves.</p>
<p>Two hits would instantly stagger a Dark Elf.</p>
<p>At this point, Kratos only needed to go up and 'mow down' enemies with QTEs.</p>
<p>Unaccountably, Zhang Yi felt a long-lost sense of 'mowing down' enemies again.</p>
<p>But the crucial point was that the roles were all wrong!</p>
<p>Shouldn't Kratos be showing off to his son, carrying him to victory?</p>
<p>Why was Kratos, earlier, fighting a group of Dark Elves alone, having to activate Spartan Rage and get exhausted?</p>
<p>But now, Atreus could shoot two arrows casually and allow Kratos to 'mow down' enemies?</p>
<p>The game's content was still similar to before.</p>
<p>Combat interspersed with puzzle elements as a调剂.</p>
<p>But with Atreus's previous impressive feat of cutting down hundreds of Dark Elves, and with his new abilities, Atreus's damage and utility were completely maxed out.</p>
<p>Coupled with Kratos's constant questions and actions, Zhang Yi always felt the game was strange.</p>
<p>Especially when combined with some puzzle-solving content.</p>
<p>When they encountered climbing areas, Atreus rode on Kratos's back; when they needed to move crystals and stone-like objects, Kratos had to do it; when they encountered places he didn't understand, Kratos had to yell 'boy'.</p>
<p>Looking at it now, it felt like Kratos was just a porter and a mount, and also like Liu Grandma entering the Grand View Garden, needing his son, who had seen it all, to introduce things.</p>
<p>As for the health bar, it was utterly embarrassing; activating Spartan Rage was powerful, but it only lasted for three seconds, like a 'true man' with short-lived vigor.</p>
<p>Let's revisit the images of this father and son.</p>
<p>Kratos: Unwashable dark history, slightly weary eyes, faded cheap tattoos, impatient tone, illiterate, embarrassing health cap.</p>
<p>Atreus: Noble bloodline, resolute eyes, shooting speed of four arrows per second, skilled in conversation and proficient in eight languages, cold-resistant leather armor, an unlimited health bar.</p>
<p>This game is clearly about the God of War and his aged, illiterate old father!</p>
