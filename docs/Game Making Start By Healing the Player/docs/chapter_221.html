                <p>Chapter 220: Is This the Game We've Been Playing? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>After watching this official Weibo post, the comment section beneath the video and the player community forum instantly erupted.</p>
<p>Countless players went mad reposting it and leaving comments to express their inner excitement.</p>
<p>"Tell me this isn't real! This has to be CGI animation!"</p>
<p>"So this was actually made in Minecraft?"</p>
<p>"Damn it! This is freaking awesome! If this is possible, does that mean other buildings could also be replicated in Minecraft?"</p>
<p>"I'm impressed! This feels nothing like the game I've been playing!"</p>
<p>"I suddenly want to go online and try it out—why wasn't this shown before the Early Access trial?"</p>
<p>"Exactly! I'm suddenly interested in this game again! I'm sure if this had been released before the trial, I definitely wouldn't have made the dark room!"</p>
<p>"Pfft, it's nothing special. Given a hundred years, we could build it too!"</p>
<p>"Please don't use the word 'we'—I'm pretty sure I couldn't build it at all!"</p>
<p>"All I can say is: Holy smokes!"</p>
<p>"Awesome, plain and simple! But this couldn't have been made by just one person, right?"</p>
<p>"Of course there were multiple people involved! If it were just one person, the workload would be insane. Didn't you see the fast-cut video at the end? Clearly, this was a collaboration!"</p>
<p>"The workload is massive and requires teamwork, but what about smaller-scale projects?"</p>
<p>"Is this still the pixel game I know? It looks better than some blockbusters!"</p>
<p>"Exactly!"</p>
<p>Although Minecraft itself is a pixel game, that doesn't mean it's ugly.</p>
<p>On the contrary, unlike in his previous life, Chen Xu's developed version of Minecraft did not cut corners in the art aspect.</p>
<p>There was no cost control involved—pixels were merely an art adjustment made specifically for the gameplay.</p>
<p>The modeling and lighting and shadows in the game were all top-tier.</p>
<p>When looking at a single block, it might be hard to appreciate this.</p>
<p>But when used to construct large structures and building complexes, that sense instantly emerges.</p>
<p>This left countless online players utterly shocked after watching the video.</p>
<p>In most people's minds, Minecraft was supposed to be just a simple block-building game, perhaps with survival elements added in.</p>
<p>These aspects had already been experienced during the earlier Early Access trial.</p>
<p>Nothing particularly surprising.</p>
<p>Although in that trial, some players had built relatively nice Regular small houses, it didn't bring much sense of shock or anticipation.</p>
<p>After all, the trial was too short to truly reveal the game's potential.</p>
<p>But this new wave of video content was completely different.</p>
<p>What on earth is this?!</p>
<p>They actually recreated Along the River During the Qingming Festival inside the game?!</p>
<p>Is this even the same game they knew?!</p>
<p>It wasn't just casual onlookers—game designers within the gaming industry were also stunned after seeing Minecraft's promotional video.</p>
<p>A block-building game can actually be like this?!</p>
<p>Chen Xu had already established a complete promotional model for Minecraft.</p>
<p>Everything before was merely warm-up promotion. Now, the real promotion for Minecraft had begun.</p>
<p>With players shocked and Nebula Games rolling out various promotional channels, many industry designers noticed Minecraft's popularity skyrocketing.</p>
<p>It quickly broke out of its niche and even climbed to the trending search list on the official Weibo account.</p>
<p>The Game Department's official account even reposted it that very day.</p>
<p>Not only did gaming media repost it, but numerous unrelated media outlets also shared it.</p>
<p>The view count of the promotional video surged rapidly, reaching 15 million views in just one day.</p>
<p>Before this, other games had broken out of their niches, but those cases had little to do with the games themselves.</p>
<p>But Minecraft was completely different.</p>
<p>The main focus of media coverage was the recreation of Along the River During the Qingming Festival within the game.</p>
<p>Centered on the entry point of promoting traditional culture, the key point was that this recreation was itself a core gameplay element of Minecraft.</p>
<p>As a result, even people who had never played the game knew about a game capable of recreating the thousand-year-old Along the River During the Qingming Festival.</p>
<p>This also sparked people's imagination—since Along the River During the Qingming Festival could be replicated, what about other buildings and scenes?</p>
<p>In fact, they didn't have to wait long.</p>
<p>Because just three days after the initial promotional video was released, Chen Xu uploaded another video on the official Weibo account.</p>
<p>This time, the scene showcased was the legendary Forbidden City.</p>
<p>Having already experienced the awe of Along the River During the Qingming Festival, players were even more excited this time.</p>
<p>They eagerly clicked into the video.</p>
<p>And what they saw didn't disappoint.</p>
<p>Raindrops fell from a gloomy sky, lightly hitting the Forbidden City's city walls.</p>
<p>The camera slowly moved toward the city gate, revealing tranquil forests and pavilions, magnificent and resplendent glazed roof tiles.</p>
<p>White jade stairs and nine-dragon reliefs, ponds and stone bridges in the backyard.</p>
<p>Red columns, golden glazed tiles...</p>
<p>One by one, these elements revealed to players just how extremely magnificent this structure looked within Minecraft.</p>
<p>The previous buzz around Along the River During the Qingming Festival hadn't even cooled down yet.</p>
<p>Now, the release of the 'Forbidden City' was like adding fuel to the fire.</p>
<p>It caused Minecraft's popularity to skyrocket instantly.</p>
<p>Every game designer in the entire gaming industry was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this was Chen Xu's promotional method.</p>
<p>More importantly, this kind of promotion was something they couldn't possibly replicate.</p>
<p>Because it was a unique characteristic of Minecraft itself!</p>
<p>And with the added bonus of promoting traditional culture, it achieved a full-scale breakout.</p>
<p>Meng Zuo, who had been closely following Minecraft, finally understood what Chen Xu had meant earlier.</p>
<p>With a stunt like this, who could possibly compete with you in terms of popularity!?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the project office for Voyage, Zhu Yi found himself in a dilemma.</p>
<p>If he pushed forward, Minecraft's popularity was simply incredible.</p>
<p>Voyage's upcoming launch was completely overshadowed. Aside from the players who had been following it all along, it couldn't make any waves.</p>
<p>But if he pulled back, the embarrassment wasn't really the issue.</p>
<p>After all, if good sales were achieved, a little embarrassment didn't matter.</p>
<p>The real problem was that the promotion had already gone this far.</p>
<p>Withdrawing now would mean a huge loss, and subsequently, they wouldn't receive any decent recommendation resources.</p>
<p>"It's not necessarily doomed. Although Minecraft's recreation of Along the River During the Qingming Festival and the Forbidden City is indeed shocking, isn't it still just block-building gameplay? Relying solely on this one gameplay element, even if the current popularity is high, Voyage's content might still win!" Zhu Yi comforted himself internally.</p>
<p>However, three days later, when Chen Xu once again released a new video on the official Weibo account, his illusion was completely shattered.</p>
<p>Two updates first, the rest later.</p>
