<p>Chapter 272: Is Your Game Made of Gold? (Fifth Update, Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Regarding the two crossovers between Monster Hunter: World and Minecraft.</p>
<p>Essentially, within the gaming industry—whether players or industry designers—everyone already has a speculation.</p>
<p>That is, Nebula Games is definitely developing a new game.</p>
<p>The remaining question is what type of game it will be.</p>
<p>As for the theme, that doesn't require much thought.</p>
<p>Judging from the Kingdom of Lordaeron, combined with monsters like the Frost Dragon and Chimera, as well as the weapon appearances created through the crossover,</p>
<p>it's clear this will be a fantasy-themed game.</p>
<p>As for the genre, it really only comes down to a few options.</p>
<p>First, FPS can be ruled out immediately—it just doesn't seem plausible at all.</p>
<p>Beyond that, both industry designers and players generally believe it will either be an RPG or an action-adventure game.</p>
<p>Meaning either something like Dark Souls or something like Monster Hunter: World.</p>
<p>After all, judging from the blockbusters they've released so far, Nebula Games has proven highly skilled in both areas.</p>
<p>Moreover, both in Dark Souls and Monster Hunter: World, Nebula Games has demonstrated extraordinary strength in the action game and RPG domains.</p>
<p>What remains a concern for players is whether Chen Xu will pour his passion into this game.</p>
<p>After all, Chen Xu's past creations have been truly impactful.</p>
<p>And also quite agonizing.</p>
<p>Because with most games, if you add too many gimmicks, well, you can just choose not to play.</p>
<p>But Chen Xu's games are different.</p>
<p>They make you suffer, yet at the same time, they make you feel incredible.</p>
<p>This conflicting experience makes players both fearful and addicted.</p>
<p>They shout 'Go away!' 'Won't buy!' 'Won't play!'—yet their hands reach for their wallets, somehow unable to stop.</p>
<p>During this period, Chen Xu hadn't been idle either.</p>
<p>The development plan was progressing steadily.</p>
<p>As for the CGI, Chen Xu once again hired the same company that had previously produced the cutscene promotional animations for Dark Souls.</p>
<p>Their technical skill had already been approved by Chen Xu, and truthfully, CGI is mostly about spending money.</p>
<p>Domestically, as long as you're willing to spend, the results can even surpass overseas productions.</p>
<p>And naturally, Chen Xu was more than willing to invest heavily in Warcraft.</p>
<p>After several rounds of negotiation, Nebula Games' investment in the Warcraft CGI animation reached a nine-digit figure starting with the number 4.</p>
<p>Of course, the settlement unit was RMB.</p>
<p>Besides that, the modeling materials handled by Ruan Ningxue and outsourced teams were already mostly completed.</p>
<p>They were extremely exquisite. Chen Xu also added a special feature:</p>
<p>Close-up Setting—the in-game camera defaults to this.</p>
<p>Later, once the Map Editor is opened, players can adjust the camera based on their needs, including for the built-in campaigns.</p>
<p>However, in RTS battles, the camera will be fixed—only zooming in is allowed, not zooming out—mainly for fairness.</p>
<p>With the added close-up camera, players can click to switch and view the in-game modeling up close.</p>
<p>For an RTS game, there's actually no need to make the models so detailed, unlike RPGs.</p>
<p>Yet Chen Xu decided to pursue excellence. Not necessarily to rival traditional RPGs or linear game-type games,</p>
<p>but at least within the RTS genre, Chen Xu dared to claim that globally, currently, no game could match Warcraft in graphics and modeling.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, naturally, players deserved a better, more direct sensory experience.</p>
<p>Of course, for unit types with slightly bold and revealing outfits—like the Human Sorceress and Elf Archer—underwear pants were included.</p>
<p>In addition, Chen Xu made some minor adjustments to the campaign.</p>
<p>Because the original campaign was still quite difficult for clumsy players. Many players even used invincibility cheat codes like 'whosyourdaddy' to simply Basic Attack their way through.</p>
<p>Of course, Chen Xu kept all these cheat codes, since they were a necessity for some players.</p>
<p>When facing 'madness-inducing enemies,' people always needed some cheat codes to save face.</p>
<p>Using 'who's your daddy' might be excessive, but using 'greedisgood 99999' to give yourself a little extra wood and gold—surely that wasn't too unreasonable?</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Days passed. Just as the topics sparked by the content in Minecraft and Monster Hunter: World began to gradually cool down,</p>
<p>Chen Xu and Nebula Games' official Weibo account finally moved.</p>
<p>The content left countless players and industry designers shocked and bewildered.</p>
<p>'Reefining RTS, development cost exceeds 700 million, upcoming fantasy blockbuster Warcraft launching soon!'</p>
<p>A simple sentence, accompanied by several concept artworks.</p>
<p>Tyrande Whisperwind riding Dromarch the White Tiger, Arthas as a Paladin, Tauren Chieftain Cairne Bloodhoof carrying a totem and wielding a Runic Spear, the Frost Dragon spreading its wings.</p>
<p>As Chen Xu's official Weibo post went live, it instantly attracted massive attention.</p>
<p>After all, the content from Monster Hunter: World and Minecraft had already captured the interest and focus of many players.</p>
<p>Many had been speculating whether Chen Xu had a new project, and if so, what kind.</p>
<p>But now, the information revealed in this message instantly left countless players dumbfounded.</p>
<p>'Redefine RTS,' 'RTS,' 'development cost exceeds 700 million'?</p>
<p>What!?</p>
<p>The combination of these keywords immediately caused the热度 to explode.</p>
<p>'Damn it! Mr. Chen has a new game again?!'</p>
<p>'It's actually RTS—did I read that right?!'</p>
<p>'These concept artworks are actually something! This Elf Girl riding the white tiger is so beautiful—nom nom!'</p>
<p>'Redefining RTS? 700 million cost? Are you just bragging?'</p>
<p>'Did I read this wrong? RTS and development cost over 700 million?'</p>
<p>Accompanied by Chen Xu's Weibo post, the entire gaming industry—players and designers alike—erupted into excitement.</p>
<p>Chen Xu's new game had actually become an insignificant point.</p>
<p>The real key points were the keywords that followed.</p>
<p>'Redefine RTS'—Chen Xu actually dared to say that!?</p>
<p>After all, although RTS wasn't exactly niche and was relatively simple, it was definitely not easy to make.</p>
<p>Player reactions weren't that intense, mainly because Nebula Games and Chen Xu's previous reputation had built trust.</p>
<p>Although Chen Xu always gave them 'shocks,' there were never lacks of joys.</p>
<p>And as for development costs, players didn't really care much. They cared whether the game was fun or not.</p>
<p>But judging from the current situation, clearly players had already gotten used to it—this was just another one of Chen Xu's pie-in-the-sky promises.</p>
<p>For players, they mostly discussed why Chen Xu would make an RTS, since they had assumed it would be an RPG or action game.</p>
<p>But for the gaming industry, it felt somewhat absurd.</p>
<p>Not because Chen Xu was making an RTS game, but because of the cost announcement.</p>
<p>Generally, during game development, companies sometimes disclose costs for promotional purposes—some true, some false.</p>
<p>But Nebula Games' announced cost for Warcraft was simply too outrageous?</p>
<p>An RTS game—publicly announcing a development cost of 700 million?</p>
<p>If you said project cost, fine—that could include marketing and other expenses later on.</p>
<p>But development alone costing over 700 million?</p>
<p>Is your game made of gold?</p>
<p>However, some perceptive designers noticed the deeper implications behind Chen Xu's RTS.</p>
