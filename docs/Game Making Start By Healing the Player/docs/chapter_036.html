                <h1>Chapter 36: The Truth About to Be Unveiled</h1>
<p>As the game progressed bit by bit, Dong Zhen began to feel somewhat uneasy.</p>
<p>But Dr. Neil and Dr. Eva were still striving hard to make Johnny's dream of becoming an astronaut and landing on the moon come true.</p>
<p>After all, in real life, they had already signed the contract.</p>
<p>No matter what, they had to help Johnny fulfill this dream.</p>
<p>Time continued to advance, and now it reached Johnny's high school years. From Johnny's words, they learned why he liked Liva.</p>
<p>Because Johnny felt that Liva was special.</p>
<p>Here, Johnny appeared somewhat selfish, to the point that even his best friend Nicolas criticized him.</p>
<p>‘Silently sympathize with Liva!’</p>
<p>‘Suddenly find Johnny so annoying!’</p>
<p>‘+1, selfish jerk!’</p>
<p>‘But I feel something seems off—maybe there will be a twist later?’</p>
<p>The bullet comments in Dong Zhen's live stream room kept exchanging opinions.</p>
<p>But at this moment, Dong Zhen’s attention was no longer on the comments. He had been completely absorbed by the game’s story.</p>
<p>Indeed, Johnny’s behavior in this segment was extremely selfish—even detestable.</p>
<p>Yet Dong Zhen couldn’t shake the feeling that something here was off.</p>
<p>Admittedly, this explanation could account for why Liva kept folding origami bunnies.</p>
<p>But Dong Zhen still found it somewhat forced. What exactly was wrong?</p>
<p>Time continued forward, now arriving at Johnny’s teenage years.</p>
<p>At home, Johnny headed out to school, but his mother didn’t address him as Johnny—she called him Joey.</p>
<p>Using football as a medium, Dr. Eva and Dr. Neil advanced once again.</p>
<p>But what followed was completely different.</p>
<p>Dong Zhen leaned slightly forward in front of the computer, his eyes wide open.</p>
<p>On the screen appeared a vast expanse of white. Within this memory, Dr. Neil and Dr. Eva could even smell the stench of dead animals.</p>
<p>Before Johnny’s next memory segment, there was only emptiness.</p>
<p>This meant that a part of Johnny’s childhood memories was damaged.</p>
<p>And within this damaged memory, there seemed to be the bloody scent of dead animals.</p>
<p>Unable to proceed, Dr. Neil and Dr. Eva decided to stick to their original plan.</p>
<p>They would implant the dream of becoming an astronaut into Johnny. Then, through the special machine, Johnny could continuously move toward this goal.</p>
<p>However, clearly, the players were not happy with Dr. Eva and Dr. Neil’s approach.</p>
<p>‘What the heck, how come the memory is damaged? You haven’t even figured out what happened in Johnny’s childhood yet!’</p>
<p>‘How can you act like this?’</p>
<p>Dong Zhen looked dissatisfied. Compared to going to the moon, he was now far more curious about the secret behind it all.</p>
<p>Based on the game’s current progression, he had a premonition—every puzzle so far would be solved in Johnny’s childhood.</p>
<p>But these two damn doctors, resorting to any means necessary, focusing only on superficial fixes—what the hell was their intention?</p>
<p>Yet, contrary to the two doctors’ expectations, an accident occurred again.</p>
<p>No matter how much Dr. Neil and Dr. Eva tried to guide and hint to Johnny—</p>
<p>Adding astronomy courses in his elementary and middle school years, changing the movies Johnny watched at the cinema to space-themed films—</p>
<p>Every effort constantly suggested that Johnny should become an astronaut.</p>
<p>Yet none of it changed Johnny’s subsequent memories.</p>
<p>In fact, Johnny showed absolutely no interest in going to the moon.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the two doctors in the game—players were equally bewildering.</p>
<p>In Johnny’s subconscious, there wasn’t even a trace of desire to go to the moon.</p>
<p>But then why was visiting the moon Johnny’s final dying wish?</p>
<p>What on the moon was attracting him?</p>
<p>Time was running out. Johnny’s body could not hold on much longer.</p>
<p>If they wanted to fulfill Johnny’s wish, then those missing childhood memories might be crucial.</p>
<p>Dr. Neil consulted the company, asking why this situation had occurred.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dr. Eva analyzed why implanting memories into Johnny failed to change his true intentions.</p>
<p>If the machine wasn’t malfunctioning, then clearly, going to the moon was secondary for Johnny.</p>
<p>There must be a more significant factor that had altered Johnny’s desires.</p>
<p>And Liva played a vital role in Johnny’s life.</p>
<p>They had been together since high school.</p>
<p>But what exactly was the key element that caused Johnny’s desires to change?</p>
<p>While Eva was pondering, Neil received the results.</p>
<p>Johnny’s memory loss was due to his having taken massive amounts of Beta-blockers as a child.</p>
<p>Propranolol, a type of Beta-blocker, was believed to prevent the brain’s proteins from re-storing memories in their original form.</p>
<p>In other words, Johnny’s missing childhood memories were not erased, but hidden and suppressed due to his childhood use of large quantities of Beta-blockers.</p>
<p>However, this didn’t mean the memories were completely gone—merely buried.</p>
<p>Therefore, to use the machine to further explore Johnny’s childhood, a medium would be required.</p>
<p>At this moment, Dong Zhen had an idea.</p>
<p>“Blood smell, the stench of rotting corpses? Wait—didn’t the doctor run over a squirrel at the beginning!? Could the squirrel’s scent serve as the medium!”</p>
<p>Seeing the in-game hint, Dong Zhen immediately understood.</p>
<p>It was all planned from the start!</p>
<p>‘So that’s it—the squirrel was important right from the beginning!’</p>
<p>‘You could say this squirrel died for a purpose! It was destined to die! Thank you, noble squirrel, for your outstanding contributions.’</p>
<p>As Dong Zhen spoke, he controlled the in-game character to the roadside to collect the squirrel’s scent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the live stream room’s bullet comments flooded in.</p>
<p>‘Squirrel: Oh, thank you very much!’</p>
<p>‘One of the most tragic characters: the squirrel!’</p>
<p>But beyond the joking comments, most viewers shared Dong Zhen’s sentiment.</p>
<p>Anticipation and curiosity filled them—what would Johnny’s childhood memories reveal next?</p>
<p>Amid the live stream’s chorus of urging comments,</p>
<p>Dong Zhen used the scent as a medium and successfully entered the chaotic segment of Johnny’s past.</p>
<p>It was an extremely chaotic memory, with various time points overlapping.</p>
<p>On the street, multiple young Johnnies could be seen.</p>
<p>Among them, Dong Zhen noticed a young Johnny playing with a football.</p>
<p>This football was one of the previous mediums.</p>
<p>The two doctors searched the town everywhere but found nothing.</p>
<p>At that moment, Johnny’s mother finished talking with someone and prepared to start the car and leave.</p>
<p>But no one noticed—‘Little Johnny’ was chasing his football and had moved behind the car.</p>
<p>The car started. With a ‘bang,’ ‘Little Johnny’ was struck and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>What happened? Did Little Johnny get hit by a car?</p>
<p>Was this the reason for his memory loss?</p>
<p>But wasn’t it said that he had taken excessive Beta-blockers?</p>
<p>Confused, Dong Zhen, like the two doctors in the game, assumed the one hit was Johnny.</p>
<p>But the next moment, the real Johnny appeared.</p>
<p>Instantly, previous confusion was resolved!</p>
