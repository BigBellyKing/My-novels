                <p>Chapter 121: Turns out I'm the Melon/Vegetable!</p>
<p>Chapter 121: Turns out I'm the Melon/Vegetable!</p>
<p>"You've been watching for so long, are your hands itching to play?"</p>
<p>Resurrecting at the bonfire, Zhang Yi looked at Wang Han, who was tidying up grape skins beside him.</p>
<p>Hearing Zhang Yi, Wang Han glanced at the game screen and said without hesitation, "My hands are itching, but my skin isn't!"</p>
<p>Sighing, Zhang Yi continued to control his game character and explore.</p>
<p>Entering the scene of the High Wall of Lothric, the map was much more complex compared to the previous Firelink Shrine and Cemetery of Ash.</p>
<p>And because there was no map, he had no idea where to go.</p>
<p>Of course, there was an even more important reason: his gaming experience here could truly be described as 'cutting melons and vegetables'.</p>
<p>Well... he was the melon/vegetable.</p>
<p>At the High Wall of Lothric, apart from the Hollow Soldier mobs kneeling like pilgrims who wouldn't resist, almost every other mob had the ability to kill him.</p>
<p>And the most crucial point was that if these mobs were like the Crystal Lizard, the Uchigatana Guy, or Gundyr the Ash on first encounter, where he could just overpower them with sheer personal strength, it would be fine.</p>
<p>The problem was that the mobs here were basically all without martial ethics.</p>
<p>He often encountered a mob swinging a short sword around a corner, launching a combo attack that could instantly kill him if his health wasn't full.</p>
<p>Secondly, he might accidentally attract two or three monsters, and when they ganged up on him, Zhang Yi even felt it was harder than fighting Gundyr the Ash, though he wasn't sure if it was just his imagination.</p>
<p>Especially one monster resembling a Hollow Hound, which was agile and had high attack power.</p>
<p>Moreover, there were some mobs with Fire Crossbows hiding in crevices in the walls, staying perfectly still as he passed by.</p>
<p>Once he went below and engaged other monsters, they would start shooting arrows at him from behind.</p>
<p>There were also mobs hiding behind boxes; if he wasn't careful and exposed his back, these mobs would even backstab him.</p>
<p>An ARPG game actually gave Zhang Yi the same feeling he had when playing Outlast, because you never knew what traps lay ahead.</p>
<p>Of course, if it was just that, it would be fine.</p>
<p>Because these unfair monsters were basically weaklings.</p>
<p>In a one-on-one fight, as long as he wasn't too reckless, they were easily dealt with.</p>
<p>However, as he explored the High Wall of Lothric, Zhang Yi encountered some tough opponents.</p>
<p>On the way, in a corridor leading to a sentry tower, he encountered a Lothric Knight wielding a sword and shield.</p>
<p>This character had also appeared in the promotional trailer, but only as a background element, specifically to show how mobs could be parried and executed.</p>
<p>"Finally, a monster that can face me head-on, and it's a 1v1!"</p>
<p>Looking at the Lothric Knight before him, Zhang Yi was so excited that tears welled up in his eyes.</p>
<p>"Come on, let's have an evenly matched fight!"</p>
<p>When two brave foes meet on a narrow path, the braver one wins. Zhang Yi felt his blood boiling.</p>
<p>He had always been outnumbered, always faced unfair tactics; now he could finally have a 1v1 showdown.</p>
<p>The Lothric Knight in front of him clearly noticed Zhang Yi and took up its stance.</p>
<p>He advanced, it retreated; they probed each other.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, Zhang Yi's footsteps slowly led him into the dark and dingy sentry tower.</p>
<p>Just then, a 'crunch' of a breaking box sounded.</p>
<p>A mob with a dagger jumped out from nowhere and immediately backstabbed him.</p>
<p>'Thud!'</p>
<p>Blood splattered, the unfair mob kicked him, making him stumble. Just as he stood up, the Lothric Knight delivered a swift slash.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, deceased!</p>
<p>"You promised a 1v1, but you secretly called for backup!" Zhang Yi was completely stunned!</p>
<p>"You stay right there! Don't you dare run!" Zhang Yi spat fiercely before resurrecting at the nearest bonfire.</p>
<p>Returning once more, this time he was smarter. He first performed several rolls to evade the Lothric Knight, found the mob that had ambushed him earlier in the dark sentry tower, killed it, and then finally faced the Lothric Knight.</p>
<p>"I'll use you to practice my parrying! Let me show you what a Firelinking Hero is made of!"</p>
<p>Zhang Yi held up his shield, drew aggro, and stood still, ready to train his parrying technique.</p>
<p>First parry attempt: one Estus Flask down.</p>
<p>Second parry attempt: two Estus Flasks down.</p>
<p>The third time, sensing something was wrong, Zhang Yi didn't choose to parry. Instead, he prepared to hold his shield and wait for the Lothric Knight to finish its attack before counterattacking.</p>
<p>But facing Zhang Yi, who was holding his shield, the Lothric Knight directly slammed its own shield into him.</p>
<p>With that single ram, his stamina bar was instantly depleted like a damaged health bar, and his character fell into a state of flinch due to insufficient stamina.</p>
<p>The Lothric Knight in front calmly unleashed a combo attack, emptying his health bar and giving Zhang Yi another Chinese lesson, reviewing those three characters.</p>
<p>"Why do I always feel like the mobs I encounter after fighting Gundyr the Ash deal similar damage to him?" Zhang Yi fell silent after resurrecting at the bonfire.</p>
<p>Originally, he thought Gundyr the Ash would be the tough one, but the Crystal Lizard, the Uchigatana Guy, and even this Lothric Knight, all felt incredibly fierce!</p>
<p>"Maybe it's a game feature?" Wang Han said from beside him.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Zhang Yi was speechless.</p>
<p>Entering the High Wall of Lothric, he encountered an even greater variety of monsters.</p>
<p>Now he could completely confirm one thing.</p>
<p>This was definitely a very difficult game.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi even felt that traveling in this game was a bit harder than fighting bosses.</p>
<p>He had confirmed with his eyes: these were monsters he couldn't afford to provoke.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi decided to temporarily bypass the Lothric Knight and continue exploring other areas.</p>
<p>Besides that, on a bridge full of monsters, Zhang Yi was about to lure them one by one to clear them out when a wyvern descended from the sky and immediately breathed fire directly onto the bridge.</p>
<p>Just like the other monsters on the bridge, Zhang Yi once again learned how to write 'You Died'.</p>
<p>After enduring the Ninety-nine Eighty-one Tribulations, using experience gained from death, Zhang Yi finally entered the sentry tower room.</p>
<p>However, what made Zhang Yi a bit strange was that there were no monsters inside this sentry tower.</p>
<p>And surprisingly, there was even a treasure chest in the corner downstairs.</p>
<p>"A treasure chest!" Getting closer, Zhang Yi saw the "open" interaction prompt appear on the screen, his face filled with pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>"Finally, I can change my equipment!?"</p>
<p>"After all, in typical ARPGs, treasure chests are synonymous with good equipment!"</p>
<p>Looking at the treasure chest in front of him, Zhang Yi felt utterly delighted.</p>
<p>He pressed the interaction button, but the subsequent scene startled Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>It didn't contain any great treasures. Upon opening, the top and bottom of the chest's mouth were filled with sharp teeth.</p>
<p>At the same time, a long tongue and a pair of hands stretched out from inside, grabbing his character.</p>
<p>"What the heck is this!"</p>
<p>Zhang Yi shivered in fright, almost throwing the mouse in his hand.</p>
<p>He watched as the sharp teeth of the treasure chest ferociously bit at his character's head.</p>
<p>Immediately, blood splattered. The character in the game struggled continuously, but its health bar instantly bottomed out as if it had vanished.</p>
<p>After struggling for a moment, it finally fell silent.</p>
<p>The game screen also plunged into darkness.</p>
<p>Those three familiar blood-red characters reappeared in the center of the screen.</p>
<p>"What the heck! This treasure chest is a trap!" Zhang Yi's eyes widened, utterly bewildered.</p>
<p>However, after resurrecting at the bonfire, he soon prepared to go back again, not just to retrieve his souls but also for revenge!</p>
<p>And based on previous experience, this kind of ambushing monster should be quite weak.</p>
<p>Returning to the treasure chest room, thirty seconds later...</p>
<p>In the cramped room, Zhang Yi watched his character being embraced by the Mimic and then shoved into its mouth, and he put down his mouse.</p>
<p>Patting his chest lightly, he told himself this wasn't giving up; it was a gentleman's revenge, which is never too late.</p>
<p>Just like with the previous shortcuts, the Uchigatana Guy, and the Lothric Knight.</p>
<p>Dying a few more times to figure out the opponent's attack patterns, and then easily dealing with them, but it wasn't necessary.</p>
<p>But the frustration in his chest still made him quietly shut down his computer.</p>
<p>He felt he should stop playing for the day. If he continued, he was a little worried something might happen to his newly bought keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>Just then, Zhang Yi's phone on the table rang.</p>
<p>He glanced at it; it was a message from his old acquaintance, Song Ren.</p>
<p>'Old Zhang, how are you spending the National Day holiday? I'm completely screwed. Just checked into the hotel. This boss is a real idiot! Which company sends people on business trips during National Day?'</p>
<p>Looking at the message, Zhang Yi replied: "I'm playing a game. That 'Dark Souls' we saw at the exhibition launched today. Have you played it?"</p>
<p>In less than two seconds, the other side quickly sent a message: 'Not yet. By the way, is this game fun? If it's not, I won't buy it.'</p>
<p>Seeing this message, Zhang Yi instantly remembered why he played Outlast back then, so he immediately replied: "A grand, epic story, top-notch graphics and sense of impact, and the gameplay experience can only be described in four words: easy as pie!"</p>
<p>That night, Zhang Yi, who had logged into his girlfriend Wang Han's Nebula Games account and specifically bought a copy of Dark Souls for her, couldn't help but laugh out loud at the message from Old Song.</p>
<p>The message was very simple: 'This is what you call easy as pie?'</p>
<p>Although it was just a text message, Zhang Yi could already imagine Song Ren's expression on the other side of the phone screen.</p>
<p>(Picking up the mended broken bowl, pitifully begging for monthly passes, recommendation votes...)</p>
