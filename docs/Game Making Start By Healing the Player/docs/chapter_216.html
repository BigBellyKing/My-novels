                <p>Chapter 215: Let's Change the Name, It's Embarrassing (Seventh Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>"What's going on? Why is it getting dark so fast?"</p>
<p>Wang Han, still diligently chopping wood and immersed in her upcoming building fantasy, hadn't noticed at all that the in-game sky had already shifted from day to dusk.</p>
<p>"Doomed! The house isn't built yet, and I haven't even found Hex!"</p>
<p>Looking at the darkening sky, Wang Han was taken aback.</p>
<p>She hadn't even chopped that much—only about sixty logs.</p>
<p>Had ten minutes really passed so quickly?</p>
<p>The game's time system, just like in Don't Starve, was divided into day and night.</p>
<p>A full day lasted 20 minutes—10 minutes of daylight, 7 minutes of night, and the remaining 3 minutes for sunset.</p>
<p>She wasn't really fond of building here, but although structures could be dismantled later, it would be troublesome.</p>
<p>Yet if she didn't build, who knew what dangers the night might bring?</p>
<p>As Wang Han hesitated, the in-game sky continued to darken.</p>
<p>Unlike Don't Starve, where visibility drastically dropped at night and deadly threats lurked everywhere, Minecraft didn't have such harsh mechanics.</p>
<p>Instead, only white skeletons wielding Bow and Arrows and green zombies would appear.</p>
<p>Even though Minecraft was a pixel game with first-person and over-the-shoulder perspectives, the combination of the night atmosphere, eerie sounds of zombies and skeletons, created a terrifying experience.</p>
<p>"So what should I do now?! What should I do?! What can I do!" Wang Han screamed, spotting monsters charging toward her, and immediately started running.</p>
<p>But as she ran, she realized more and more creatures were trailing behind her.</p>
<p>She was like the locomotive of a train formation, pulling a massive horde.</p>
<p>Among them, a white skeleton archer kept shooting arrows at her.</p>
<p>Although she had crafted a Wooden Sword in her item inventory earlier, her experience with Don't Starve made her believe she stood no chance against these monsters—especially with so many of them.</p>
<p>And as she kept running, she encountered even more enemies along the way.</p>
<p>"Got it!"</p>
<p>Suddenly, Wang Han looked down at the ground beneath her feet and had an idea.</p>
<p>She pulled out a Hoe from her item inventory and began digging downward.</p>
<p>Three blocks deep was just enough for her to drop in, then she placed a dirt block above to seal the opening.</p>
<p>Instantly, the entire game screen turned black, leaving only the monsters' various bellowing sounds echoing through her headphones.</p>
<p>"Now I'm safe."</p>
<p>Hearing the monsters roar but unable to see them, Wang Han couldn't help but smile.</p>
<p>Now, all she had to do was wait for daylight and for the monsters to disappear.</p>
<p>She reached into her pocket, preparing to pull out her phone and browse some short videos.</p>
<p>Just then, the sound of a key turning in the front door echoed from the living room, followed by footsteps. Wang Han instinctively turned her head and saw Zhang Yi entering the room, holding a plastic bag. "Hey, didn't you say it would take over an hour?"</p>
<p>"Got lucky today—every light was green, no stops," Zhang Yi smiled, waving the plastic bag. "Brought you roasted duck rice. Eat it while it's hot, or the duck will get fishy when it cools down."</p>
<p>"Got it," Wang Han said, taking the roasted duck rice from Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>"Hey, is the computer broken!?" Zhang Yi suddenly noticed the monitor was completely black and was taken aback.</p>
<p>"Broken? I'm playing Minecraft!" Wang Han replied, peeling open the plastic bag.</p>
<p>"Then is it a bug? Why is the screen completely black?" Zhang Yi was confused.</p>
<p>How could you claim you were playing a game with a pitch-black screen?</p>
<p>"It's night outside in the game, and I'm being chased by monsters, so I'm hiding underground for now," Wang Han explained.</p>
<p>"But isn't this game about building houses? Why are you being chased by monsters?" Zhang Yi asked curiously.</p>
<p>"There are different modes. I'm playing Survival Mode—it's kind of like Don't Starve," Wang Han said.</p>
<p>"Ah, I see!" Zhang Yi nodded in understanding.</p>
<p>As they spoke, Wang Han switched the game's audio to the speaker.</p>
<p>The monster sounds from outside seemed to have vanished.</p>
<p>Still, for safety, Wang Han continued digging forward in the pitch-black hole for a while.</p>
<p>"Why don't you just break through the ceiling and get out? What are you doing in this dark hole?" Zhang Yi, sitting beside her, watched as Wang Han shoveled food into her mouth while seemingly digging something on the dark screen, puzzled.</p>
<p>"You haven't played this game—you wouldn't get it! What if the monsters are still waiting above? Digging forward like this is safer," Wang Han explained.</p>
<p>After digging about twenty blocks forward and saving up 20 dirt blocks in her item inventory, Wang Han finally broke through to the surface.</p>
<p>By then, daylight had finally arrived.</p>
<p>"The graphics aren't bad!" Zhang Yi commented, watching the game graphics.</p>
<p>"Just wait and see. First, I'll build a house for shelter, then find Hex to get wool and make beds," Wang Han said confidently, looking at the pile of wood and dirt she had gathered.</p>
<p>She had mentally trained for this.</p>
<p>She'd even used the building blocks toys from her childhood to practice in real life.</p>
<p>Now it was time to see the results.</p>
<p>Even though her current materials were limited to dirt and wood, it was enough.</p>
<p>Wood could be turned into planks and crafted into items like a crafting table and Wooden Door.</p>
<p>Although she was missing many materials needed for her dream 'Pink Fantasy Mansion,' building a simple wooden countryside-style house shouldn't be too hard.</p>
<p>"A place with mountains and water—perfect!" Wang Han deliberately picked a spot near a lake.</p>
<p>First, she crafted a crafting table, then made the Wooden Door and planks.</p>
<p>Then she began her construction project.</p>
<p>Beside her, Zhang Yi watched, chin resting on his hand.</p>
<p>First, the foundation: she dug up all the sand on the ground and replaced it with wood to outline the house's area.</p>
<p>Since wood was limited, she kept the area modest—just a one bedroom, one living room.</p>
<p>Next came the Wall (fence). She deliberately left a gap in the middle for the door. Not knowing how to build stairs, she simply placed two wood blocks to represent the threshold.</p>
<p>As she ate the roasted duck rice, savoring the tender duck and fragrant rice, it felt as if her Ren and Du meridians had been unblocked. Ideas surged through her mind, and the image of her house became crystal clear.</p>
<p>Since Survival Mode didn't allow flying like Creative Mode, after building high walls, Wang Han had to stack Block after Block beneath her feet to reach the top for roofing.</p>
<p>"Hmm, I'll leave a few holes here. I remember the recipe list mentioned glass—I'll save those for later. That way, when I lie in bed at night, I can watch the stars," Wang Han muttered to herself, deeply immersed in her grand infrastructure project.</p>
<p>"I'll put the crafting table in this corner, then add some decorations later to make my house beautiful."</p>
<p>With the final wood block placed, Wang Han finally felt a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>By then, the in-game sky had slowly transitioned from day to twilight.</p>
<p>"There's something I'm not sure if I should say, Master Builder Comrade Wang, but is your house going for a prison cell aesthetic?"</p>
<p>Looking at the structure before him, Zhang Yi couldn't help but comment.</p>
<p>The wooden house was a perfect cube. The crafting table in the corner looked just like a toilet.</p>
<p>And there wasn't even a bed inside.</p>
<p>The space meant for the door, with two wood blocks placed below as a threshold, now resembled a prison visiting window.</p>
<p>"Well… it does seem a bit different from what I imagined," Wang Han said, stepping out of the house and staring at the structure in silence.</p>
<p>In her vision, the wooden house should have been simple yet elegant, with artistic details evident in its craftsmanship.</p>
<p>But the actual house stood like a massive chimney, with the door area looking like a prison visiting window.</p>
<p>Inside, apart from the crafting table, there was nothing.</p>
<p>Even real prison cells had beds!</p>
<p>Coincidentally, night fell in the game, and it started to rain.</p>
<p>Raindrops trickled through the open skylight she had left.</p>
<p>Instinctively, Wang Han looked upward, jumped, and used the last few wood blocks she had to seal the gap.</p>
<p>Once sealed, the rain stopped, but the only light in the room now came from the visiting window-like opening.</p>
<p>The entire room was pitch black.</p>
<p>"Let's change the name. It's embarrassing."</p>
<p>Looking at Wang Han's in-game name 'Master Builder,' Zhang Yi said thoughtfully.</p>
