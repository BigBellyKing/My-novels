<p>Chapter 537: Players' Denunciation (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>The sudden wave of perfect scores caught FOW and Zeus somewhat off guard. According to their original plans, this year should have been their year of harvest. After all, <em>Wasteland 1978</em>'s previous performance had been truly dazzling. Zeus and FOW's initial intention was to hype it up, for instance, by suggesting that <em>Wasteland 1978</em> was likely a lock for this year's Game of the Year, a potential it indeed possessed given its quality. When its popularity surged again, they could also work on expanding <em>Wasteland 1978</em>'s IP, for example, by moving towards film and television adaptations. Of course, they wouldn't start the project immediately; it was more about generating buzz, then releasing actual content two or three years later. After all, film adaptation has both pros and cons for a game. The benefit, naturally, is that if it's good, it's the icing on the cake. The downside is that film adaptations are very difficult for games; a slight misstep can damage the game's IP itself. However, all of this was predicated on <em>Wasteland 1978</em> holding an absolute advantage.</p>
<p>But what happened now? <em>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</em> had received almost uniformly perfect scores? While it wasn't as exaggerated as <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> which almost no game media dared to give anything less than a perfect score, <em>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</em>'s score was still quite terrifying. Its global media aggregate score was 9.6 points. It might seem like only 0.3 points higher than <em>Wasteland 1978</em>, but this was across global media aggregate scores. This was already a significant difference. Recently, Alex's focus had been entirely on the subsequent operations of <em>Wasteland 1978</em>, so he didn't have direct knowledge of <em>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</em>'s quality. However, as a top-tier game designer himself, Alex was very clear about what perfect or near-perfect scores meant for a game. Firstly, it meant the game had gained recognition from mainstream gaming media and players, and had either achieved perfection in a certain field or pioneered a new one. Secondly, the game itself either brought significant innovation in gameplay or offered profound depth in its story. Moreover, as a designer in the gaming industry, Alex understood that so-called 'masterpieces' would only become rarer as gaming eras advanced. For instance, some early masterpieces, when viewed with current standards, weren't actually that fun to play. They were more about the breakthroughs they brought to the gaming industry at the time, such as games that charted new territory by establishing PC 3D gaming and VR game control modes, camera techniques, and so on. Or games that pioneered ancient genres like FPS and RPG, which even new-generation players might not have heard of. After all, game design concepts and standards are constantly improving. When people say older games are more classic and excellent, it's often referring to their settings, stories, and gameplay frameworks. Few players would discuss them from the broader perspective of overall visuals and such details, as these are advancements driven by technology and accumulated industry experience, and later generations are bound to surpass their predecessors. But this time, <em>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</em>, a game aimed at all players and media, had once again received a near-perfect score? Alex, who had initially believed <em>Wasteland 1978</em> had a 99% chance of winning Game of the Year, suddenly recalled an Eastern idiom he once heard: 'If Zhou Yu was born, why must Zhuge Liang also be born?' Since he had already developed <em>Wasteland 1978</em> this year, why did Nebula Games have to develop <em>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</em>? As he lamented, Alex also opened the Huanyu VR in his office, contributing to <em>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</em>'s sales, ready to see what made the game so good and if his defeat was truly undeserved.</p>

<p>While FOW and Alex were feeling depressed, Chen Xu at Nebula Games was also feeling rather down. Mainly because players' attention had once again turned to him. In <em>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</em>, the biggest feature was its moral dilemma, trolley problem-style choices. There were no choices that satisfied everyone; there was always some regret. For instance, in the Bloody Baron's story, while the Baron's family, from a character design perspective, wasn't particularly good — the ranking of their nastiness would probably be daughter &gt; Anna &gt; Baron. However, in the game, the Baron was ultimately a victim. Moreover, after the Baron left and the sergeant managed Crow's Perch, the poor villagers suffered even more, with instances of women being forcibly taken. It was clear that when the Baron was still around, the villagers' lives were actually better. This led many players to prefer keeping the Baron alive, at least offering a glimmer of hope. Yet, such an ending came at the cost of innocent war orphans' lives, a dilemma that left many players incredibly conflicted. Not to mention the series of side quests that followed, or the eventual choice between Triss and Yennefer. Although the game didn't deliver too many heartbreaking moments, the only truly poignant one was the sacrifice of old Vesemir. As for Crach an Craite, the old jarl of the Skellige Isles who helped Geralt, the White Wolf, he met a tragic end, split by Eredin's blade. However, his role was minor and came late in the game, so most players didn't have a strong impression of him. Most other important supporting characters could avoid tragic endings through quests and correct choices, but the dilemma-style decisions still led many players to 'denounce' Chen Xu on the official Weibo account. However, what brought Chen Xu some comfort was that besides the denunciations, quite a few people also stood by him and spoke up for him. Never mind the proportion, as long as there were some, that's what mattered! But as the denunciations continued, some players' focus gradually shifted: they realized Chen Xu's games were subtly moving towards a more 'grim' direction.</p>
<p>'Everyone stop denouncing Mr. Chen, is the Warrior of Love just messing with us? What I'm more worried about is that Mr. Chen's game style is getting increasingly grim!'</p>
<p>'Holy cow, now that you mention it, it really seems that way!'</p>
<p>'Thinking about it, it's true! In <em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>Bloodborne</em>, and even <em>Hades</em> in between, the monsters are all bizarre, and now in <em>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</em>, we have Daywraiths, Niegui, and Water Hags – they've all shown up!'</p>
<p>'It was fine before, but now that it's been said, I'm actually a bit scared. Before, some enemies in Mr. Chen's games could be somewhat rushed, but now it's all demons and monsters!'</p>
<p>Players online were discussing animatedly, but to their surprise, Chen Xu actually gave them a feedback reply.</p>
