<p>Chapter 24 It's Clearly the Love of the Players! (Please Recommend, Add to Favorites, and Vote for Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>Jiang Ping still hadn't recovered from the Genocide Ending after all this time.</p>
<p>He only vaguely understood the game's story.</p>
<p>But that didn't matter. What mattered was that right now, he felt truly oppressive.</p>
<p>The Genocide Ending had made him feel terribly miserable.</p>
<p>Yes, he regretted it.</p>
<p>Just like when he played Mirror (Game), at first he was enthusiastic, but soon grew bored and started regretting why he had ever opened the game again.</p>
<p>Now, after clearing the Genocide Route of Undertale, he felt exactly the same.</p>
<p>No matter what, having experienced the Genocide Ending, he deeply regretted it.</p>
<p>He missed the scenes from the Pacifist Mode—the laughter shared with friends, Undyne burning down the kitchen, Papyrus telling terrible jokes, and eating pie made by Toriel.</p>
<p>"Let me play through a perfect save file, and give this game a proper ending."</p>
<p>Recalling everything, Jiang Ping took a deep breath and reopened the game.</p>
<p>He wanted to play through the perfect Pacifist Ending once again.</p>
<p>With prior experience, Jiang Ping was now extremely skilled.</p>
<p>He remembered many of the monsters and simply chose the correct dialogue options.</p>
<p>Finally defeating Asriel and watching the sunset, a faint smile appeared on Jiang Ping's face.</p>
<p>No matter what, it was all over now.</p>
<p>Yet in the next moment, the scene in the game froze him completely.</p>
<p>It was a pitch-black night. The protagonist was sleeping in his room.</p>
<p>At that moment, the door gently creaked open. Toriel entered carrying a cream cinnamon pie, placing it quietly on the floor before closing the door and leaving.</p>
<p>It seemed incredibly warm and tender. But the next second, the protagonist, who had seemed fast asleep, suddenly sat up in bed.</p>
<p>It was Chara's face—twisted with a sinister and evil expression.</p>
<p>Then, the earphones delivered that grotesque, malicious laughter.</p>
<p>Leaving the room, a black-and-white photograph appeared—showing the protagonist together with his friends from the Underground.</p>
<p>But now, except for the protagonist, every other person in the photo had a blood-red X marked over their heads.</p>
<p>Then the game screen vanished.</p>
<p>Sitting in front of his computer, Jiang Ping's eyes widened.</p>
<p>Previously, he had only read some guides on how to unlock the Genocide Ending. Now, at last, he understood why the author of one post had warned: "It's recommended not to play the Genocide Ending, or you'll regret it."</p>
<p>He finally grasped the meaning behind some of the otherwise cryptic phrases in the positive reviews he had read before.</p>
<p>[When did this world become yours to control?]</p>
<p>Chara's words seemed to echo in his ears once again.</p>
<p>Jiang Ping stared blankly at the Undertale interface on the screen.</p>
<p>He had finally sensed the deep intention of this game—no, perhaps it was better described as 'malice'!</p>
<p>Like most games, you hurt the monsters in the game, then delete the save file and start fresh, continuing to live harmoniously with the monsters as if nothing had ever happened?</p>
<p>Ha! What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Don't dream on!</p>
<p>Just like a mirror, once shattered, even if glued back together perfectly, cracks will always remain.</p>
<p>Since you've already chosen to slaughter those monsters, how could the game possibly let you return to living peacefully with them?</p>
<p>In the stillness of the night, that previous 'bad' save file you deleted returns like a haunting ghost, tearing apart your self-righteous peace and happiness.</p>
<p>That eerie laughter at the end. The black-and-white photograph.</p>
<p>Though not a single word was spoken, Jiang Ping felt immense sarcasm—</p>
<p>Sarcasm directed at him, sitting there in front of the computer.</p>
<p>As if someone were holding a large horn right next to his ear, shouting:</p>
<p>"Stop pretending, you hypocrite!"</p>
<p>Could nothing be changed?</p>
<p>Jiang Ping stared at the closed game and pressed his lips together.</p>
<p>He logged into the Undertale-related gaming community.</p>
<p>Just as he expected, besides discussions about the game itself, characters, and story, there were numerous posts asking about the very issue he was facing.</p>
<p>"Veteran players, does anyone know how to return to the good ending?"</p>
<p>"Same here, massive regrets! My mischievous hands made me play the Genocide Ending. I regret it. I want to go back to the past!"</p>
<p>"Even though it feels like self-deception, I still want to go back!"</p>
<p>"I've tried deleting the game, re-registering an account, and buying it again with a new account—but it's completely useless!"</p>
<p>Reading through the flood of posts, Jiang Ping felt slightly better.</p>
<p>After all, he wasn't the only one.</p>
<p>Scrolling through countless threads, Jiang Ping finally found an accurate answer:</p>
<p>"The corrupted save file directly overwrites the cloud saves and system files. So you need to act on two fronts: reinstall the operating system and then register a new account to buy Undertale. That way, it'll be a completely fresh game. Of course, don't log in with your old account, or the system will detect it and revert to the corrupted save!"</p>
<p>So that's how it worked!</p>
<p>Jiang Ping finally understood and quickly made a decision.</p>
<p>Of course, he had no intention of reinstalling his system—his hard drive contained countless study materials from his teachers, some of which were no longer available online and couldn't be downloaded at full speed anymore.</p>
<p>Besides, he'd always used a single C drive without partitioning his hard disk.</p>
<p>So reinstallation was out of the question.</p>
<p>Now that he understood the mechanism, he could simply buy the game again on another computer.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>In the office of Nebula Games, Yang Xin was beaming with excitement.</p>
<p>"It's broken 500,000! And it's been less than half a month!"</p>
<p>On the computer in front of Yang Xin, the cumulative sales of Undertale across various game stores were displayed.</p>
<p>After its reputation exploded, major platforms had basically placed Undertale on their homepage recommendation leaderboards.</p>
<p>As for the official platform, due to its big-data-driven recommendation system and relatively low efficiency, even if it eventually got recommended, it would likely be next week.</p>
<p>Currently, of the 500,000 sales, about seventy percent came from third-party platforms.</p>
<p>"However, it seems quite a few players have actually contributed a second purchase," Chen Xu said, looking at the backend data with surprise.</p>
<p>He noticed that many purchase records indicated that Undertale was the first game ever bought by those accounts.</p>
<p>"Yeah, many players, out of curiosity, played the Genocide Ending and then, to ease their conscience, chose to buy a second copy," Yang Xin explained, clearly more invested in this game than Chen Xu.</p>
<p>"Isn't that just burying your head in the sand?" Ruan Ningxue interjected from the side.</p>
<p>"How is that burying your head in the sand? It's clearly the players' deep love for our game," Chen Xu mused, then summarized.</p>
<p>"Let's announce the sales figures first and add more fuel to the game's popularity."</p>
<p>As he spoke, Chen Xu logged into his official Weibo account.</p>
<p>Thanks to previous promotions and the overwhelmingly positive reviews for Undertale, his official Weibo followers had finally surpassed 300,000.</p>
<p>Compared to the millions followed by famous game producers, it wasn't much, but it was at least a decent recognition.</p>
<p>More importantly, under the small lightning icon, there was finally a more detailed description:</p>
<p>'Game Producer, known for the work Undertale'</p>
<p>Previously, it only showed the small lightning and the five words: 'Game Producer'.</p>
<p>After all, although Mirror (Game) had explosive sales, its genre was special!</p>
