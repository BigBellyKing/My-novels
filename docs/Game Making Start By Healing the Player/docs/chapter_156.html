                <p>Chapter 155: Hyped Up Players (Fourth update for subscriptions, monthly passes)</p>
<p>Compared to the period right after its launch, the popularity of <em>It Takes Two</em> had already begun to decline. After all, <em>It Takes Two</em> itself didn't have much replay value. Unlike <em>Dark Souls</em> with its various playstyles, the core appeal of <em>It Takes Two</em> lay in its ingenious level designs. Once players had experienced the different level designs and item combinations, the novelty from the game itself, beyond playing with different partners, became difficult to recreate. Furthermore, during the period <em>It Takes Two</em> was online, many game developers had successively announced their upcoming plans. Similarly, some domestic agency companies introduced excellent overseas games from the previous year, all of which diverted many players' attention.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after Game Timespace released this exclusive interview, it still attracted considerable player attention. Game Timespace had made some edits to the content of the article. However, the main message was still conveyed. In particular, Chen Xu's self-declaration to players used the original quote: 'Every game is imbued with my love for players, and I have always been dedicated to bringing players games that can warm their hearts.' This interview was also translated into English and reprinted on overseas platforms. This was because, during this period, Target Software had successively published some smaller games previously developed by Nebula Games to overseas markets. So, anything related to Nebula Games was promoted by Target Software. Moreover, the influence of <em>Dark Souls</em> overseas had not yet completely waned. Chen Xu's exclusive interview still garnered attention from many overseas players. Especially upon seeing Chen Xu's words, many overseas players gave thumbs-up and discussed it enthusiastically in relevant forums and communities.</p>
<p>'I have to say, I'm already looking forward to this game designer's new work!'</p>
<p>'Yes, only with a heart full of love for players can such excellent games be made!'</p>
<p>'Yes, I heard that Target Software, the company distributing <em>Dark Souls</em>, is dedicated to bringing some of this designer's classic past works. I'm already excited!'</p>
<p>'I saw some videos on YouTube; it seems this designer recently released a new co-op game that looks very cheerful. I must say, I'm looking forward to other heartwarming works!'</p>
<p>'More importantly, the article seems to mention news about a <em>Dark Souls</em> sequel?'</p>
<p>'Really? That's amazing!'</p>
<p>While overseas players were filled with anticipation, domestic players, by contrast, had a different attitude.</p>
<p>'While <em>It Takes Two</em> is indeed very warm and cheerful, I still remain skeptical about Chen Xu's statement, okay?'</p>
<p>'Even though it sounds logical, why do I always feel like Chen Xu is just bluffing?'</p>
<p>'+1, I'll tentatively believe in the "love for players" part, but as for "warming hearts"... just listen and have a laugh!'</p>
<p>'Warrior of Love or whatever... it doesn't matter anymore, because Chen Xu's games will be bought regardless.'</p>
<p>'Don't listen to Chen Xu spouting nonsense. Warrior of Love, heartwarming games – just listen and laugh. Shouldn't the real core point of this article be that the <em>Dark Souls</em> sequel will be presented as a prequel?'</p>
<p>'Exactly, you're all off-topic! This is the core point!'</p>
<p>'Yeah, this time <em>Dark Souls</em>'s story can finally be completed, right?'</p>
<p>'Haha, then we'll see the faces of those Souls scholars and lore hunters, wondering who will be the loser and who will actually guess correctly!'</p>
<p>'Exactly, then the Souls scholars won't have to argue all day.'</p>
<p>'But why do I feel it's not that simple? The <em>Dark Souls</em> prequel might still have a fragmented narrative!'</p>
<p>'Stop talking about the story! The most crucial thing is the difficulty! Didn't Chen Xu say this would be a brand new and crazy adventure? And an even bigger surprise? It's probably a jumpscare!'</p>
<p>'What's there to be afraid of?! After suffering so many times, I'm mentally prepared to play again, it'll definitely be much better. Anyway, I can't wait, an eighth-playthrough Ashen One, reporting for duty!'</p>
<p>'Holy crap, eighth playthrough! I heard the eighth playthrough is super hard, I'm only on my third. Big shot, tell me more!'</p>
<p>'It's nothing much, just that when wearing Havel's Set, bosses hit me like I'm a little chick.'</p>
<p>With Game Timespace's interview article, players' enthusiasm was instantly ignited. Indeed, a portion of players believed Chen Xu's repeated mentions of "heartwarming." However, many veteran Nebula Games players and old fans of Chen Xu stated that not a single word could be believed. But most players weren't focused on whether Chen Xu's Warrior of Love persona was real or fake. They were concerned with the news mentioned in the article about a <em>Dark Souls</em> prequel. One must understand that during this period, fervent Dark Souls players constantly thought about news of a sequel. Many players even went to Chen Xu's official Weibo account every now and then to @-mention him. Regardless of whether they received a reply, they just wanted to make their stance clear first. Now, the news of the new work they had eagerly awaited had finally arrived! As for difficulty? Would they be scared?!</p>
<p>Compared to when it first launched, the gameplay of <em>Dark Souls</em> had largely been explored, and a large number of high-level players had emerged. Videos like flawless boss kills and speedruns were no longer uncommon. Online, there were more entertaining videos, such as unexpected occurrences in random mode, or videos playing on memes and researching lore, as well as hardcore challenge world speedruns and BOSS speed kill records. Therefore, most players were quite confident in themselves. After all, they weren't the confused Firelinkers they once were. "We're not afraid of your game being too difficult, we're only afraid of your game not being difficult enough." When the time comes, they would redeem themselves and show everyone what an excellent Firelinker truly was!</p>
<p>Facing the enthusiasm of countless players, Chen Xu did not remain silent this time. He directly logged into his official Weibo account and sent a message, accompanied by an image of a 'bonfire'. The official Weibo post was simple.</p>
<p>'Regarding the news of the <em>Dark Souls</em> sequel, it will be unveiled at the gameplay Expo. The new work's setting will be the distant Age of Fire, and it will also complement some story content. But one thing remains constant: it will definitely bring players a Firelinking journey that will haunt their dreams.'</p>
<p>As Chen Xu's official Weibo post went live, players completely hyped up. After all, this was considered official confirmation. Less than ten minutes after the message was sent, thousands of replies had already accumulated under the official Weibo post. Looking around, there was a huge pile of 'This fire can't be linked' memes. But despite their posts, these players were actually quite looking forward to it. One thing to remember: suffering can be addictive.</p>
