                <p>Chapter 115: This Damn Sense of Oppression!</p>
<p>Currently, Wang Han was positioned in a circular courtyard, with a cliff to the right and countless gravestones and lit candles to the left.</p>
<p>In the center stood Ash Judgment Gundyr, motionless like a stone statue.</p>
<p>But what truly attracted Wang Han wasn't any of that—it was the bloodstains on the ground.</p>
<p>Beside Ash Judgment Gundyr, Wang Han's view contained at least twenty or thirty bloodstains.</p>
<p>In Dark Souls, if players engage in online multiplayer, their data is automatically uploaded to the server.</p>
<p>One thing that differs from other games is that, aside from in-game messages, the scenes of a player's death are also randomly displayed in other players' worlds.</p>
<p>Of course, this is random—the highest priority is given to the most recently deceased player.</p>
<p>The reason so many bloodstains were placed near Ash Judgment Gundyr was precisely to comfort players.</p>
<p>To let them know that in this despair-filled world, they weren't fighting alone.</p>
<p>Being taught a lesson by Uncle Ashen Gundyr right after entering the game wasn't an experience unique to them.</p>
<p>The twenty or thirty bloodstains before Wang Han now meant that at least that many people had already fallen on this very ground.</p>
<p>"My god! How many people have died here?!" Wang Han's earlier sense of dread intensified.</p>
<p>Wang Han guided her in-game character '123' onto one of the bloodstains and pressed the interaction button.</p>
<p>Immediately, the bloodstain transformed into a red shadow that rolled across the ground twice before suddenly being impaled and launched into the air, then falling back down and writhing before collapsing.</p>
<p>She continued checking nearby bloodstains—each death scene was incredibly diverse.</p>
<p>Some were violently flung away, others seemed completely flattened, while some appeared to have been pierced straight through.</p>
<p>But one thing they all shared was that before dying, these shadows had desperately rolled around on the ground.</p>
<p>"Oh no… I feel like Ash Judgment Gundyr is actually really strong!"</p>
<p>Wang Han felt a chill creeping up her spine.</p>
<p>Beside her, Zhang Yi also sensed something was off, but he still spoke up analytically: "If you think that way, you've already fallen for it. Why can we only see the moment of death?"</p>
<p>"This is Chen Xu's scheme! He's manipulating players' perceptions, making them increasingly nervous. After all, the unknown is the most terrifying—just like in Outlast." Zhang Yi declared confidently.</p>
<p>Wang Han pondered: "So you're saying Ash Judgment Gundyr might actually be weak, and Chen Xu just designed it this way to create mystery?"</p>
<p>Zhang Yi shook his head: "No… I'm saying you should hurry up and start the BOSS fight. Once you die, switch to me."</p>
<p>"Get lost!" Wang Han was speechless.</p>
<p>With rising tension, Wang Han took a deep breath and guided her character forward to trigger the story.</p>
<p>On screen, her character strained her body, gripping the Coiled Sword embedded in Ash Judgment Gundyr's chest, and slowly began pulling it backward.</p>
<p>'Pssshhh…'</p>
<p>A stream of black blood gushed from Gundyr's chest as the Coiled Sword was gradually extracted.</p>
<p>The moment the sword was fully removed, the screen trembled. The figure that had been kneeling like a stone statue now rose, wielding his great halberd.</p>
<p>Wang Han had already seen Ash Judgment Gundyr during the previous online press conference video.</p>
<p>But watching a video and playing it yourself were two entirely different things.</p>
<p>The massive gray-white form stood up, towering over the in-game character '123'—three times its height combined.</p>
<p>Its colossal body blocked out the cold sunlight, creating an overwhelmingly震撼 effect.</p>
<p>As Gundyr rose, the game's grand background music swelled, accompanied by deep chanting, building an atmosphere of epicness that stirred Wang Han's emotions.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the screen, a long health bar appeared, along with the BOSS's name—Ash Judgment Gundyr.</p>
<p>This was only the first BOSS battle in the game, yet it already carried the same weight and tension usually reserved for final BOSS fights in other games.</p>
<p>In terms of atmosphere and rendering, Dark Souls was already nothing short of explosive!</p>
<p>"Now begins a life-or-death struggle! You shall not stop me from linking the fire!" Listening to the vast, grand background audio, Wang Han felt herself ignite, a sudden surge of drama filling her chest.</p>
<p>At that moment, the awakened Ash Judgment Gundyr launched his attack.</p>
<p>The massive figure took a step forward and charged.</p>
<p>Dust kicked up as the enormous halberd in Gundyr's hand swung effortlessly in a sweeping slash.</p>
<p>Instinctively, Wang Han rolled backward twice. With her small, fragile shield, she seriously doubted whether it could withstand a direct hit from Gundyr's halberd.</p>
<p>After seeing Zhang Yi's first death, she already understood the importance of the stamina bar.</p>
<p>If her stamina bar was emptied outright, her situation would become even more dangerous. Rolling seemed to offer a higher margin for error.</p>
<p>After his first sweeping slash, Gundyr pressed his advantage without pause, immediately following up with a jumping downward strike.</p>
<p>This time, Wang Han wasn't so lucky.</p>
<p>She was hit directly. Her health bar dropped as if a major artery had been severed—halved in an instant.</p>
<p>"My god! His attack power is way too high!" Wang Han was stunned.</p>
<p>Now she finally understood why all the previous death scenes showed frantic rolling followed by sudden death.</p>
<p>Was this BOSS really meant for beginners?</p>
<p>Rolling frantically on the ground, a question flashed through Wang Han's mind.</p>
<p>Earlier, when she watched Zhang Yi fight the Crystal Lizard, she could still offer commentary.</p>
<p>But watching and playing were two completely different things. Only now, after taking control herself, did she realize something felt off about this game.</p>
<p>The Crystal Lizard could be excused—after all, there was a 'Turn Back' warning right at the entrance.</p>
<p>But what about this Ash Judgment Gundyr?</p>
<p>This damn Sense of Oppression—why was it so intense?!</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>It was the Sense of Oppression!</p>
<p>For Wang Han, who was experiencing Dark Souls for the first time, this BOSS battle delivered nothing but overwhelming pressure.</p>
<p>The massive, imposing figure of Gundyr, swinging his halberd with wide, sweeping motions, exuded sheer dominance in every move.</p>
<p>Especially when the halberd struck the ground, the accompanying sound effects and rising dust Special Effects amplified the Sense of Oppression to its peak.</p>
<p>Facing Ash Judgment Gundyr, Wang Han spent nearly the entire time fleeing in panic.</p>
<p>In a brief moment of courage, she lunged forward during Gundyr's attack gap and landed a couple of hits. But due to insufficient stamina, she failed to perform consecutive rolls to Create Distance and was grazed by the halberd.</p>
<p>That single graze cost her half her health.</p>
<p>Her Fruit Pulp Orange Juice was now completely gone.</p>
<p>Out of items, out of options.</p>
<p>Looking at Gundyr, whose health had dropped by roughly one-tenth, then at her own character, down to a sliver of health, Wang Han made a decision.</p>
<p>She guided her character '123' forward in a brave charge.</p>
<p>She delivered a perfect set of massage and manipulation techniques directly to Gundyr's legs.</p>
<p>Actually, it dealt quite a bit of damage.</p>
<p>Two solid hits later, Ash Judgment Gundyr's health bar visibly dropped by another tenth.</p>
<p>But the next moment, Gundyr's halberd swung upward in a rising slash.</p>
<p>Her character flew into the air, accompanied by a pitiful "Errgh!"</p>
<p>Three words appeared in the center of the screen—</p>
<p>YOU DIED</p>
