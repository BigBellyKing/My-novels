<h2>Chapter 146: Game Experience (Second Update, Please Subscribe for Monthly Passes)</h2>
<p>As time progressed day by day, many players who had been following <em>It Takes Two</em> began to grow increasingly excited.</p>
<p>During this period, Nebula Games also carried out some pre-launch promotion to boost the game's popularity.</p>
<p>After all, in terms of scale, this was currently Nebula Games' second-largest title after <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>Although neither players nor industry professionals and gaming media following the game believed it could live up to the hype, promotional efforts were still necessary.</p>
<p>Moreover, the promotional budget for <em>It Takes Two</em> was significantly lower than that of last year’s <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>This was mainly because the gaming industry had recently lacked excellent releases, leaving players in a state of game drought—any title that appeared moderately impressive could attract considerable attention.</p>
<p>And with game media starved for big news, they eagerly reported on any game that looked promising.</p>
<p>Last year, Mr. Chen had swept the Annual Game Awards Event, and his new work naturally carried immense spotlight.</p>
<p>Combined, these factors meant that even though <em>It Takes Two</em> was a game with high entry barriers, it had already gained significant attention.</p>
<p>It was truly a case of perfect timing and favorable conditions.</p>
<p>As for human harmony, that naturally referred to Nebula Games’ loyal fanbase.</p>
<p>Unlike ordinary players, who remained skeptical about <em>It Takes Two</em>'s quality, Nebula Games and Chen Xu's fans had only one word in mind: Buy!</p>
<p>In a residential complex in the Imperial Capital, Wang Han was already fully prepared.</p>
<p>Two computers were logged into the Nebula Games Platform, waiting only for the game to unlock for purchase.</p>
<p>Beside her, Zhang Yi watched his girlfriend’s eager expression with a rather complicated look on his face.</p>
<p>He recalled the unequal treaty he had signed a year ago.</p>
<p>Because of a game called <em>Overcooked</em>, he had been doing the dishes for an entire year.</p>
<p>Still, despite that, he had absolutely no resistance toward any game released by Nebula Games.</p>
<p>Whether it was <em>Mirror (Game)</em>—a title only Nebula Games’ two-year-old fans would know—or last year’s <em>Dark Souls</em>, which had left him utterly stunned, he loved them all.</p>
<p>As for the game about to unlock, <em>It Takes Two</em>, truthfully, he was quite looking forward to it as well.</p>
<p>Judging from the promotional trailer, the gameplay content appeared extremely rich.</p>
<p>"It’s unlocked, it’s unlocked! This game is huge! It’s almost as big as <em>Dark Souls</em>!" The moment the game became available, Wang Han immediately purchased it, staring in surprise at the download interface that popped up.</p>
<p>While game size wasn’t necessarily an indicator of quality—and compression technology also played a role—</p>
<p><em>It Takes Two</em> and <em>Dark Souls</em> were both developed by Nebula Games, so compression technology differences were irrelevant.</p>
<p>There was only one explanation:</p>
<p>The scale of <em>It Takes Two</em> was definitely no smaller than that of <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>This realization instantly heightened Wang Han’s anticipation.</p>
<p>Beside her, Zhang Yi, after a brief moment of excitement, quickly snapped back to reality. Staring at the screen, he silently repeated a phrase in his mind:</p>
<p>‘Impulse is the devil!’</p>
<p>Absolutely no impulsiveness. He must not get Hyped Up while playing this game.</p>
<p>Otherwise, forget about dishes—he’d be doing laundry for the rest of his life!</p>
<p>Even though, based on all available information, <em>It Takes Two</em> was a completely different genre from last year’s <em>Overcooked</em>,</p>
<p>Mr. Chen’s reputation was well-established, and the official Weibo account had described the game in such mystical terms. Moreover, <em>It Takes Two</em> was a game that required two-player cooperation.</p>
<p>Every time he thought about this, Zhang Yi’s mind flashed back to how utterly Hyped Up he had been while playing <em>Overcooked</em>.</p>
<p>And how loudly he had promised to become the ultimate dish-washing man.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi silently repeated his mantra three more times. Then, Wang Han reminded him, "Hurry, the game finished downloading! Get in quickly—I’ll invite you right away."</p>
<p>"Alright, I’m coming," Zhang Yi replied, nodding as he entered the game.</p>
<p>After a brief Nebula Games Logo splash screen, the game’s visuals appeared.</p>
<p>The scene was set in a yard resembling a Farm.</p>
<p>Cody, stepping outside to take out the trash, was talking with May, who arrived by car holding a document folder.</p>
<p>The couple’s relationship had broken down, and they were about to divorce.</p>
<p>Even over minor daily matters, they complained and argued with each other, each feeling that the other couldn’t understand them or grasp how much inner pressure they were under.</p>
<p>They continued to quarrel in the yard.</p>
<p>On the windowsill, their daughter Rose watched them with a heartbroken expression, holding two doll figures and whispering her wish—clearly, she hoped her parents would stop fighting.</p>
<p>Then, the画面 froze.</p>
<p>On the frozen screen, the two dolls in Rose’s hands—one male, one female.</p>
<p>Cody was a clay doll, while May was a wooden doll.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi and Wang Han, having seen the promotional trailer, were not unfamiliar with them.</p>
<p>On this paused screen, the appearing UI choices clearly indicated they were meant to select their respective characters.</p>
<p>"Are these two characters different?" Wang Han asked curiously.</p>
<p>"Of course they are!" Zhang Yi jumped in.</p>
<p>"What’s the difference?" Wang Han asked.</p>
<p>"Haven’t you noticed? One’s male, one’s female. One’s clay, one’s wood," Zhang Yi said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>Wang Han gave Zhang Yi a Speechless look.</p>
<p>As if she didn’t know that?</p>
<p>Seeing her expression, Zhang Yi stopped fooling around and shared his speculation: "Didn’t Chen Xu’s official Weibo and the promotional trailer show this? The two characters have special abilities in the game and need to cooperate. I think the male and female characters have different special abilities."</p>
<p>"Ah, I see!" Wang Han exclaimed in understanding.</p>
<p>Still unsure about the exact nature of the characters’ special abilities, they chose according to gender.</p>
<p>Wang Han selected May, while Zhang Yi chose Cody.</p>
<p>After confirming their character choices, the game screen faded into a black screen.</p>
<p>After about one or two seconds, visuals and audio returned.</p>
<p>But the game didn’t immediately begin. Instead, a cutscene played.</p>
<p>In the living room, at the dining table, facing their daughter Rose,</p>
<p>Cody and May finally told Rose they were getting a divorce.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Rose appeared calm on the surface, simply taking her little elephant toy and returning to her room.</p>
<p>But the next moment, she grabbed the dolls representing her father and mother, climbed out the window, and went to the storage room.</p>
<p>Under the storage room table lay a red book titled <em>Book of Love</em>.</p>
<p>"Dr. Hakim, you have to help me... They have to stay together."</p>
<p>"Look, it says: [Love Requires Effort]. See?"</p>
<p>"You have to put in effort. You can’t just give up."</p>
<p>"Mom, Dad, I hope you can become friends again."</p>
<p>Tears fell from Rose’s eyes as she held the dolls representing May and Cody.</p>
<p>After a brief moment of darkness, the scene cut back to the two doll figures.</p>
<p>Cody and May, waking from their sleep, panicked to find themselves transformed into wooden and clay puppets.</p>
<p>At that moment, the personified <em>Book of Love</em>—Dr. Hakim—appeared, offering a brief explanation of the general situation.</p>
<p>Though seemingly explaining the circumstances to May and Cody, this was clearly aimed at the players sitting in front of their monitors, introducing them to the game.</p>
<p>"It feels just like watching an animated movie!" Wang Han exclaimed in admiration.</p>
<p>"Yeah, and the scenes around the game world are so精致 too," Zhang Yi nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Already immersed in the game, he looked around the environment in amazement.</p>
<p>In terms of visual presentation, <em>It Takes Two</em> wasn’t quite in the first tier.</p>
<p>But unlike realistic-style games, <em>It Takes Two</em> adopted a cartoon art style.</p>
<p>Combined with relatively detailed modeling, the surroundings became incredibly dreamlike.</p>
<p>Especially since the player controlled clay and puppet characters, the sensation of being shrunk down created a unique visual experience.</p>
<p>Wooden floors, table legs, and cardboard boxes</p>
<p>had all become enormous. This shift in spatial scale brought a sense of contrast and novelty, making the gameplay experience for every <em>It Takes Two</em> player feel incredibly engaging.</p>
