<h2>Chapter 22: A Double Triumph in Reputation and Sales</h2>
<p>As more and more players experienced Undertale, the game's data surged rapidly.</p>
<p>On numerous third-party game platforms, Undertale had already climbed onto featured recommendation charts.</p>
<p>Although Chen Xu, just like in his previous life, held a strong disdain for the channels in this Parallel World,</p>
<p>for the current situation, launching Undertale on these game platforms was clearly beneficial and harmless. "Money left unearned is for fools."</p>
<p>Even if he intended to reshape the landscape of the gaming industry, one unavoidable factor remained:</p>
<p>Capital.</p>
<p>Therefore, Chen Xu chose several third-party platforms willing to compromise.</p>
<p>Although Chen Xu was a newcomer in the gaming industry,</p>
<p>he differed from ordinary game designers.</p>
<p>First, Mirror (Game) guaranteed a solid baseline of sales; second, the hype from Zhong Mei had given Undertale built-in traffic.</p>
<p>Thus, some third-party channels were willing to lower their commission percentage.</p>
<p>This was also one of the reasons Chen Xu agreed to launch on these platforms.</p>
<p>Judging from the current results, Undertale's sales growth was truly impressive.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>While Chen Xu was monitoring Undertale's sales figures,</p>
<p>many game designers in the independent gaming community were also shaken by Undertale.</p>
<p>In a private group chat among independent game designers:</p>
<p>"Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! I can only use three 'Damn its!' to describe Undertale. Earlier, I thought Zhong Mei made sense—what good game could Chen Xu possibly make? But now, I can only say it's absolutely incredible!"</p>
<p>"What's going on? Is it really that exaggerated? Isn't this rating bought?"</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? How could it be bought? Maybe third-party sites, but try buying one on the official platform and see what happens."</p>
<p>"Right, stop spouting nonsense. Brought? Try grinding reviews on the official platform and show me! Want to get your designer status revoked and blacklisted?"</p>
<p>"I suggest those who haven't played it go try it. I was genuinely shocked—only 'unbelievable' can describe it!"</p>
<p>"Honestly, I was planning to release my new game next week, but now I think I'll need to polish it a bit longer."</p>
<p>"Is it really that good?"</p>
<p>"How should I put it… On the surface, it's just a Regular game, but it has several different endings. The first playthrough brings shock, the Pacifist Ending brings warmth, and the Genocide Ending left me in tears."</p>
<p>"I used to laugh when people said Mirror (Game) changed the Gentleman's Game scene, but I think Undertale might spark a wave of popularity for this kind of game mode!"</p>
<p>"Aren't you exaggerating? Are you saying it's establishing a new school of thought?"</p>
<p>"Establishing a new school might be too strong, but it's definitely popularizing and elevating the genre. I believe from now on, whenever this type of game is mentioned, Undertale will be an unavoidable name."</p>
<p>Amid the discussions, someone suddenly shared a public account article push in the group.</p>
<p>"Stop talking—check Chen Xu's official Weibo account!"</p>
<p>"Damn it! Is this even human?"</p>
<p>"Reputation and sales both thriving!?"</p>
<p>"Sales have already surpassed 100,000 in just three days? That's too exaggerated!"</p>
<p>Everyone clicked in and saw it was Chen Xu's official Weibo account.</p>
<p>A simple thank-you message, still related to Undertale.</p>
<p>'Thank you all for your support. Undertale's sales have surpassed 100,000, but I believe this is not the end!'</p>
<p>Chen Xu didn't hide these figures.</p>
<p>Firstly, it wasn't a big secret—within days, third-party research firms would likely announce similar data. Though not perfectly accurate, it wouldn't be far off.</p>
<p>Secondly, it was for promotion. With such positive reviews, revealing the numbers was clearly an excellent way to generate buzz.</p>
<p>As Chen Xu revealed the sales data, not only were the game designers following the situation shocked,</p>
<p>but also major media outlets paying attention.</p>
<p>A little-known mini-game, created by a designer previously known for Gentleman's Games, who had recently had a public spat with another designer—</p>
<p>this story was simply too hot a topic.</p>
<p>Moreover, Undertale's performance data was explosively impressive.</p>
<p>Previously, some gaming media dismissed Undertale as insignificant, but now their faces were thoroughly slapped.</p>
<p>As for ordinary players who had played the game, they had only one feeling:</p>
<p>Undertale's ratings and results were truly well-deserved.</p>
<p>The unforgettable characters in the game, especially the final ending, were profoundly moving.</p>
<p>Before playing this game, no player could have imagined a game could be made this way!</p>
<p>All players felt as though they were witnessing history.</p>
<p>Undertale might leave a brilliant mark in the history of independent games.</p>
<p>At the same time, other media outlets quickly followed up with news reports.</p>
<p>"Sales exceed 100,000 in 3 days! Rating as high as 9.9!"</p>
<p>"A masterpiece of independent gaming—a must-play for every player!"</p>
<p>"A special RPG that overturns players' understanding of the RPG genre!"</p>
<p>"Players: I was played by this game!"</p>
<p>"An unbelievable game! Unbelievable results!"</p>
<p>"The first playthrough brings shock, the second brings warmth, the third brings suffering, and the fourth brings reflection."</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Undertale had become popular. Initially, it was the praise from media and players.</p>
<p>Then it spread through the game designer circles, because Undertale's setting was completely different from any previous game.</p>
<p>Not only in story, but also in presentation.</p>
<p>For example, Flowey's dialogue felt as if he were speaking directly to the player through the screen.</p>
<p>Such design made every game designer feel as though a Skylight had been opened.</p>
<p>To be precise, in Chen Xu's previous life, Undertale wasn't a game heavily saturated with META elements.</p>
<p>Aside from the beginning and ending, the interruptions throughout mainly told the stories of in-game characters like Sans, Papyrus, and Undyne.</p>
<p>Precisely because of this, Undertale possessed a greater sense of immersion than typical META games.</p>
<p>Only when the game's ending secrets were revealed did players experience an extremely intense sense of shock.</p>
<p>And after each ending, there was also a hidden philosophical contemplation and self-reflection.</p>
<p>This was the greatest characteristic of META games.</p>
<p>In terms of META elements alone, Undertale was actually inferior to The Stanley Parable or Pony Island.</p>
<p>But in this Parallel World, the concept of META games hadn't even begun to sprout.</p>
<p>Undertale's existing META setting, combined with its story, delivered an impact to players that was infinitely stronger than in Chen Xu's previous life.</p>
<p>Especially as live streaming platforms and video platforms began showcasing content from Undertale to players, the fire was fueled even further, burning more intensely than ever.</p>
