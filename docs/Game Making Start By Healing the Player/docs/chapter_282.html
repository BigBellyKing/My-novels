<p>Chapter 281 Warcraft Craze (7th Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>A residential complex in the Imperial Capital.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, who had just retrieved a cardboard box from the storage locker, was beaming with excitement.</p>
<p>Today was the official release date of Warcraft, but unlike usual, he didn’t rush straight to his computer.</p>
<p>Because he had something more important to do.</p>
<p>"Damn, this is way too heavy! Nebula Games, couldn’t you have made it smaller?!"</p>
<p>After tearing off the delivery packaging from the storage locker, Zhang Yi was already at a loss.</p>
<p>Because he realized Nebula Games had been far too generous.</p>
<p>This Collector's Edition of Warcraft really was a massive metal box.</p>
<p>About 30-40 centimeters long and wide, 15 centimeters tall, with the pattern of Frostmourne printed on the front and an overall cold, dark color tone.</p>
<p>This thing completely exceeded his expectations.</p>
<p>"Where the hell am I supposed to hide this at home?" Zhang Yi frowned, staring at the Collector's Edition metal box in his hands.</p>
<p>"Just stuff it under the quilts in the wardrobe—the same place you always hide your money," came a familiar voice from behind.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, still holding the box, turned around and saw a familiar figure standing behind him.</p>
<p>"Ahem… Weren’t you supposed to be out buying groceries?" Zhang Yi coughed twice, trying to ease the awkwardness.</p>
<p>"How long could grocery shopping possibly take? Anyway, let’s go home. I know your little secrets too well. Hiding petty cash? Not even creative," Wang Han rolled her eyes and said irritably.</p>
<p>"Alright, hurry up and go home. I saw there’s some background story about Warcraft in the Collector’s Edition—I want to read up on it," Wang Han said, already walking ahead, even appearing slightly more eager than Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>Truthfully, she was genuinely addicted.</p>
<p>This Warcraft felt to her just like watching a drama series.</p>
<p>If it were just a regular RTS game, she wouldn’t be so hooked. But the story of Warcraft? That’s what really intrigued her!</p>
<p>Like, what would happen to Arthas later? And who exactly was that mysterious wizard who could transform into a Raven?</p>
<p>Back home, after plating the prepared dishes, Wang Han glanced at the clock—dinner was still a while away. She and Zhang Yi sat side by side in front of the computer. One of them opened the Nebula Games Platform and launched Warcraft, while the other carefully opened the Collector's Edition metal box.</p>
<p>"So that’s how it is! The Orcs weren’t originally from Azeroth!"</p>
<p>"The wizard is Medivh. The part about how he once had the chance to save humanity but abandoned his humanity—that was because he was influenced by Sargeras, and then helped build the Dark Portal, allowing the Orcs into Azeroth!"</p>
<p>As players who had purchased the Collector's Edition, Zhang Yi and Wang Han played the game while referencing the lore and setting materials included inside.</p>
<p>At the same time, enthusiastic players online uploaded the contents of the Collector's Edition onto the internet, spreading the knowledge to even more players.</p>
<p>In the Collector's Edition, Chen Xu didn’t reveal too much—only explaining why Humans and Orcs harbored such hatred, the origins of the Lich King Ner'zhul, and Medivh’s past, among other things.</p>
<p>But these few simple details were enough to make players truly feel just how vast the Warcraft worldview really was.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on major live streaming platforms, just like with Monster Hunter: World before it, Warcraft had sparked a massive wave of popularity.</p>
<p>On its launch day, streamers across all platforms simultaneously began playing Warcraft.</p>
<p>A huge number of players were captivated by the game’s CGI animation, outstanding story, and revolutionary Gameplay.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Under Medivh’s guidance, Thrall managed to restore Grom Hellscream’s consciousness through a ritual. Then, Thrall and Grom Hellscream traveled to Demonfall Canyon in Ashenvale, aiming to defeat Mannoroth, the sinister mastermind behind the scenes.</p>
<p>In battle, Thrall swung Doomhammer at Mannoroth with furious rage, but the demon’s power was so overwhelming that he easily defeated Thrall.</p>
<p>At this critical moment, Grom Hellscream let out a thunderous roar. Drawing strength from the demonic blood within him, he poured all his might into one final blow, swinging Gorehowl to shatter the demon’s chest plate and slice his evil heart into shreds.</p>
<p>Mannoroth, mortally wounded, exploded amidst erupting flames, leaving only the raging Grom Hellscream standing.</p>
<p>Amidst the swirling infernal fire, as Mannoroth perished, the deep red of Grom’s eyes—symbols of his bloodlust—gradually faded. The demonic blood boiling within the Orc’s body finally calmed, and the Orcs were forever freed from the demon’s curse, no longer slaves to their dark masters.</p>
<p>In his final moments, Grom Hellscream reclaimed his honor.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>"Traitor?"</p>
<p>"In truth, it is I who have been betrayed."</p>
<p>Accompanied by rumbling thunder, a shadowy, indistinct figure appeared on camera. The wings behind his back and the curved horns on his head revealed his identity—Illidan.</p>
<p>Dark clouds and howling winds churned violently.</p>
<p>The sea surged with monstrous waves, endlessly rolling.</p>
<p>"Even now, I am still hunted."</p>
<p>"Even now, I am still hated."</p>
<p>"But now, my sightless eyes can see visions beyond mortal comprehension!"</p>
<p>Illidan gazed into the distant horizon.</p>
<p>"Sometimes, the hand of fate must be seized by oneself!"</p>
<p>Amidst crashing thunder and churning seas, a sealed eye deep beneath the ocean slowly opened.</p>
<p>Countless Murlocs swam upward from the depths.</p>
<p>"At the cost of my eyes, I bring—destruction—upon those self-righteous fools!"</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>‘This Frozen Throne is mine, demon. Get away from it!’</p>
<p>‘Leave this world and never return. If you dare come back, I will be waiting…’</p>
<p>In a vast, snow-covered expanse, Arthas—now a Death Knight riding a Skeletal Warhorse—faced off against Illidan, who had taken on a demonic form.</p>
<p>‘I have sworn to destroy it, Arthas. This task must be completed!’ Illidan declared without hesitation, brandishing his twin blades, the Warglaives of Azzinoth.</p>
<p>Then began a fierce battle.</p>
<p>Frostmourne glowed with eerie light as the Lich King within the Frozen Throne infused Arthas with the power of ascension.</p>
<p>On the other side, Illidan spread his demonic wings, his body engulfed in blue-green flames.</p>
<p>The cinematic combat, like a blockbuster movie, left viewers breathless.</p>
<p>Finally, Arthas gained the upper hand. Illidan was pierced through the chest by Frostmourne.</p>
<p>Arthas ignored the gravely wounded Illidan, who lay bleeding purple blood on the ground.</p>
<p>Holding Frostmourne, he marched toward the towering Frozen Throne.</p>
<p>Chaotic whispers, indistinct and unintelligible, echoed around the Ice Prison that held the Lich King Ner'zhul.</p>
<p>Arthas, gripping Frostmourne, ascended the steps one by one.</p>
<p>‘Bring me the sword, so I may finally break free from this cursed imprisonment.’</p>
<p>Ner'zhul’s sinister whisper echoed in Arthas’s ears.</p>
<p>At last, standing before the throne, Arthas raised Frostmourne with both hands and struck the Ice Prison with full force.</p>
<p>Whispers. Roars. The screen plunged into brief darkness. Then the ice shattered, and a helmet slid down the steps, coming to rest at Arthas’s feet.</p>
<p>Arthas slowly bent down, picked up the helmet, and placed it upon his head.</p>
<p>‘Now, we are one.’</p>
<p>The scene instantly shifted. Arthas, clad in armor, sat upon the throne atop the Spirit Tower, one hand resting on Frostmourne, now plunged into the ground.</p>
<p>No background music—only dead silence. Then, the camera slowly pulled back, revealing the Icecrown Glacier and the massive Spirit Tower. Only then did a faint background audio begin to echo softly.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>After Warcraft’s release, many players who had originally come for the RTS Gameplay, after experiencing the single-player story and following its progression, completely ignored the multiplayer mode, instead becoming fully immersed in the story.</p>
<p>Because it was simply too brilliant.</p>
<p>The story alone had already excited countless players beyond measure.</p>
<p>And to top it off, Warcraft insanely used exquisite CG sequences throughout the entire game.</p>
<p>Especially with each character appearing in key events, players felt that each one had their own beliefs, burdens, and choices.</p>
<p>Online, characters like Grom Hellscream, Arthas, Illidan, Maiev Shadowsong, Sylvanas Windrunner, and Kael'thas had become unforgettable to players and had amassed huge fanbases.</p>
<p>Of course, there were also some controversial characters.</p>
<p>For example, Jaina, who helped the Orcs destroy most of her father Daelin’s military forces, ultimately leading to her father’s death at the hands of Rexxar.</p>
<p>Grand Marshal Garithos of The Alliance Corporation, who sent Kael'thas and the Blood Elves on a suicide mission and, upon learning they had received help from the Naga, immediately ordered their execution.</p>
<p>Maiev Shadowsong, who had bound her entire life’s meaning to Illidan, completely disregarding concepts of justice and evil.</p>
