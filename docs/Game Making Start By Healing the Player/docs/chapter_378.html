                <p>Chapter 377: Uniformly Perfect Scores (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Song Ren was exploring Saint Denis in Red Dead Redemption. This was already his second playthrough, as he hadn't been able to properly complete the side quests in his previous first playthrough.</p>
<p>Having cleared the game once, Song Ren now only wanted to properly explore this Western world. He didn't choose to continue using John Marston, the character who inherited all items, to explore the unknown Western world after the first playthrough. This was mainly because, compared to John Marston, Arthur Morgan evoked stronger emotions in Song Ren.</p>
<p>After all, he had controlled the man, Arthur, through dozens of hours of gameplay. From the sharpshooter Arthur at the beginning to his eventual journey of redemption after contracting tuberculosis. Arthur's story was simply too moving for players.</p>
<p>In fact, it wasn't just Song Ren; many players, after finishing the story once, would start a new save file, forever keeping the timeline before going to Saint Denis. They'd keep it at the story point before Sean's death. Everyone in the gang would still be as harmonious as ever, and Arthur would still be alive and well. Exploring the entire Western world at this point in time.</p>
<p>In Valentine's market, merchants hawking their wares were shouting. Nearby, construction workers were still building unfinished structures. The old veteran in Valentine still wanted to embrace everyone who passed by. The entire Western world was brought to life.</p>
<p>Of course, not all places were so beautiful. For example, if a player used John, they could find a place called Armadillo Town. The map of Red Dead Redemption is quite vast, and some areas are not covered by the main storyline. Thus, some areas require players to discover them actively, and Armadillo Town is one such place. It's a small town infected with Cholera, located in a desert, with yellow sand swirling in the air, and the entire town is eerily silent. Charred corpses can be seen everywhere, along with the rampant Howling Wolf Gang, and, of course, the incredibly desolate desert.</p>
<p>This location can also only be triggered and entered by John Marston. Many players discussed these undiscovered elements in Red Dead Redemption on the forums, as well as some plot hooks left by Chen Xu.</p>
<p>'Has anyone found that Armadillo Town? It seems to hold a lot of meaning, and there are no quests there. Maybe there will be new content in a sequel?'</p>
<p>'It's not impossible! Have you noticed that there's actually Mexican territory in the game, but there's an invisible wall? I don't know if it's just a texture or actual terrain you can step on!'</p>
<p>'Yeah, I also found a map not included in the story, Tumbleweed Town.'</p>
<p>'Holy cow, really? Now that you mention it, it feels like a sequel or DLC content isn't out of the question! You know, the Mexican Revolution is closely tied to the end of the Western era.'</p>
<p>'You're thinking too much; I remain skeptical.'</p>
<p>'Why skeptical? I think there definitely will be in the future. Armadillo Town, the unopened Mexico, and Agent Ross finding John's farm after the ending – it all clearly sets the stage for a后续 story!'</p>
<p>'To be honest, I hope there isn't any DLC or a sequel, because I have a hunch that if there is a sequel, we'll be fed more tragic storylines. What's the game's subtitle? Redemption! Arthur achieved redemption through his death. If there's a subsequent DLC story, it'll most likely be John Marston, so how will John achieve redemption?'</p>
<p>'Damn, now that you put it that way, I'm starting to feel a bit uneasy too.'</p>
<p>Countless players online were engaged in a heated discussion. After experiencing Red Dead Redemption, they were very concerned about whether the game would have a sequel.</p>
<p>And indeed, Chen Xu had buried many plot hooks in the game, including easter eggs and hints from his previous life. For example, Agent Ross finding Micah's corpse and, years later, discovering John's farm. Dutch leaving in the snowy mountains, Havier returning to Mexico, and Bill disappearing. The whereabouts of these Van der Linde gang members, who once stood by Dutch, were unknown.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sadie, Mary-Beth, Charles, and Pearson's future lives were already revealed within the story. It could be said that John Marston's story, combined with Arthur's, truly makes up the complete narrative of Red Dead Redemption.</p>
<p>It also puts a definitive end to the Western story. If the Western era during Arthur's time was already in decline, then the Western world during John's time was in utter decay. Chen Xu intends to bring these elements to players in future DLCs.</p>
<p>Of course, there's no rush, as the game has only recently been released. Even the game's online multiplayer mode hasn't officially launched yet.</p>
<p>As time progressed, the popularity of Red Dead Redemption continued to rise. Especially after the game's launch, major domestic and international media outlets unanimously gave it perfect scores.</p>
<p>Of course, some media gave scores like 9.5 or 9.7, but not a single outlet gave it below a 9.5 rating.</p>
<p>'The Most Perfect Western World: In terms of scale, Red Dead Redemption has created a vast and lifelike Western world, a blend of the old and new eras that is utterly captivating.'</p>
<p>'Perhaps there hadn't been any outstanding Western-themed games before, but with the release of this astonishing Western world game, Chen Xu has elevated the genre to an incredible height. This might only be the first step, but it has already become an indispensable classic.'</p>
<p>'Red Dead Redemption gave players an incredibly shocking feeling, just like Minecraft did back then; it also defined a whole new genre: 'open world.' Before this, I was curious about it.'</p>
<p>'But after playing, I understood what an open world truly is. This game even made me believe that this Western world genuinely exists, and that a group of people like Arthur Morgan truly lived in it.'</p>
<p>'Especially the character performances and the brilliant script made me feel like I was watching an amazing movie. Without a doubt, if you're interested in the Western genre, Red Dead Redemption is a game you absolutely cannot miss.'</p>
<p>The reviews from other authoritative game review media were largely similar, practically hyping Red Dead Redemption up to the sky.</p>
<p>However, for players who had truly played Red Dead Redemption and were deeply immersed in it, seeing these scores was not surprising. Instead, they felt it was a matter of course.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption is a game that truly deserves such praise.</p>
