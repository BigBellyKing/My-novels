                <p>Chapter 328: One Shot Red, Two Shots Gasping, Three Shots See the Famous Quote (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Zhang Yi grunted, controlling Soap to climb the ladder to the platform under Captain Price's urging.</p>
<p>He then swapped his firearm for an MP5 and four flashbangs.</p>
<p>In his headset, Captain Price's explanation of the CQB test content came through.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Yi himself wasn't paying too much attention.</p>
<p>"It's just a new player tutorial, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"What could I possibly not understand!?"</p>
<p>As Captain Price finished his introduction, the sound of "GO! GO! GO!" rang out.</p>
<p>Instantly, Zhang Yi sprinted forward.</p>
<p>Then... <em>splat</em>, he fell directly from the high steps on the second floor onto the ground.</p>
<p>[Hidden Achievement: Watch Your Step (0.0021%)]</p>
<p>Zhang Yi: ????</p>
<p>Looking at the gray death screen and the game interface reloading to the previous save point,</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was utterly bewildered.</p>
<p>"Wasn't that supposed to be a cool aerial drop!?"</p>
<p>"What the heck, I have to rappel down a rope?"</p>
<p>Looking at the interface with a prompt box instruction, Zhang Yi was speechless.</p>
<p>The only thing that brought him a little comfort was that when he earned this achievement, he was among that 0.0021%.</p>
<p>This meant that 0.0021% of players, just like him, didn't look where they were going and fell to their deaths.</p>
<p>After talking to Captain Price again and climbing back to the second floor, Zhang Yi took a deep breath.</p>
<p>This time, he was going to be serious!</p>
<p>Following Captain Price's "GO GO GO."</p>
<p>Zhang Yi immediately used the ascending/descending rope in front of him to fast-rope down.</p>
<p>At the same time, he switched his firearm to a pistol and shot through the steel plates representing enemies in front of him.</p>
<p>He ran down the stairs, shot through the raised steel plates, and used a flashbang when entering the room.</p>
<p>Following Captain Price's commands, Zhang Yi felt his speed was incredibly fast throughout.</p>
<p>However, looking at the final recorded score, it differed slightly from what he expected.</p>
<p>'25 seconds, alright.'</p>
<p>'I don't know how a rookie like you passed selection.'</p>
<p>'If you want to try again, climb back up the ladder.'</p>
<p>After the dialogue ended, a mission completion summary panel appeared before Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>It was 25 seconds, and that was even with an accuracy bonus of -3 seconds.</p>
<p>This meant he actually spent 28 seconds.</p>
<p>Especially the recommended difficulty below, which made him a little exasperated.</p>
<p>Recommended Difficulty: [Recruit]</p>
<p>There were four difficulty options in total.</p>
<p>Recruit, Regular, Hardened, and Veteran.</p>
<p>"How am I a recruit!?"</p>
<p>"This kind of rote memorization content can't be the basis for a veteran's combat experience. I want to play on Veteran!"</p>
<p>Zhang Yi's rebellious streak immediately flared up.</p>
<p>"You want me to play on Recruit difficulty?"</p>
<p>"Heh! I won't!"</p>
<p>"I'm going to choose Veteran difficulty!"</p>
<p>An FPS game, if the difficulty is too low, wouldn't it be too boring?</p>
<p>After selecting the difficulty, Zhang Yi triggered the subsequent cutscene that officially started the game.</p>
<p>'Bravo Team, intelligence for this operation comes from our Russian Federation informant.'</p>
<p>'The target item is on a cargo ship, which also has a security team in addition to the crew.'</p>
<p>On the electronic screen, the target cargo ship appeared, and Captain Price next to it arranged the operational guidelines before the mission.</p>
<p>'What are the operational orders?'</p>
<p>'No survivors!'</p>
<p>As Price's words fell, the game screen gradually faded to black.</p>
<p>Then, the sound of helicopter propellers spinning, thunder, and heavy rain came through the headset, mixed with the crashing waves below, instantly setting the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Fully armed SAS team members, under the cover of the rainy night, proceeded towards the target cargo ship in an armed helicopter.</p>
<p>Price, leaning by the doorway, cast his gaze outside the helicopter, brought the lit cigar in his hand to his lips, and took a deep drag.</p>
<p>'Weapons ready for fast-rope, GO, GO, GO!'</p>
<p>The still-burning cigar was tossed out the window by Price.</p>
<p>The next moment, Zhang Yi found he could control Soap in the game.</p>
<p>Under the cover of the heavy rain in the dark night, ropes were thrown from the helicopter, and the SAS team raided the target cruise ship in the Bering Strait!</p>
<p>They fast-roped from the helicopter onto the cargo ship/cruise ship.</p>
<p>Because of the cover of the heavy rain and it being late at night, the people on the cargo ship clearly hadn't noticed that a group of uninvited guests had already boarded.</p>
<p>Everyone's firearms were equipped with silencers. Following behind Price and the SAS team members, they used suppressed rifles to eliminate the enemies on duty inside the ship's cabin.</p>
<p>'Bridge deck clear!'</p>
<p>'Soap, move up!'</p>
<p>A nearby team member continued to remind Zhang Yi, who was still behind.</p>
<p>"This... this is the highest difficulty? It's too easy, isn't it? And the teammates have such flawless coordination!" Zhang Yi couldn't help but let out a scornful laugh.</p>
<p>"This is Veteran difficulty!?"</p>
<p>"Is this it? Is this it? Is this it?"</p>
<p>Three consecutive "Is this it?" questions.</p>
<p>From start to finish, the enemies didn't fire a single shot.</p>
<p>Moreover, for the first time, this game gave Zhang Yi a sense of being part of a team.</p>
<p>When he fired his weapon, his NPC companions would immediately provide covering fire, eliminating any enemies he missed.</p>
<p>The team members coordinated with each other, instantly taking control of the ship's cabin.</p>
<p>The teammates in front pushed forward, while those behind covered the rear.</p>
<p>Such tacit cooperation truly gave Zhang Yi the feeling of playing a high-tier match in Rainbow Six Siege.</p>
<p>And it was an experience he had never had before.</p>
<p>Because in his matches, his teammates were basically "pig teammates" with no coordination whatsoever.</p>
<p>Now, he finally felt something called tacit understanding!</p>
<p>Entering the dormitory inside the ship's cabin, Zhang Yi pulled out his suppressed pistol and, with the SAS team members beside him, eliminated the sleeping enemies.</p>
<p>Along the way, crossing the deck, the team members were also communicating with Captain Price.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the bow, it was clear that the previous commotion had alerted the enemies to their presence.</p>
<p>A group of armed guards stood on the second floor, laying down suppressive fire on them.</p>
<p>'Enemies on the second floor, Iron Hammer 2-4, enemies on the second floor, they're yours.'</p>
<p>'Received!'</p>
<p>In the team comms, Captain Price ordered the armed helicopter that had brought them there.</p>
<p>He clearly intended for the armed helicopter to deal with the enemies occupying advantageous positions on the second floor.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zhang Yi directly charged out with his gun.</p>
<p>"Who needs an armed helicopter?"</p>
<p>"Why use an ox-cleaver to kill a chicken?"</p>
<p>"Veteran difficulty is nothing more than this!"</p>
<p>"Let me take down this ship's cabin alone, so you, Price, know that Soap isn't a rookie!"</p>
<p>"But a battle-hardened veteran!"</p>
<p>But the moment he rushed out of cover.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi experienced what a hail of bullets and explosions felt like.</p>
<p>One shot hit his chest, and the feedback from Huanyu VR brought a strong sense of immersion.</p>
<p>The screen turned red.</p>
<p>A second shot hit his chest, still with a very realistic feedback.</p>
<p>Soap gasped for breath.</p>
<p>A third shot still hit his chest, but this time there was no feedback.</p>
<p>Because the screen went gray, a famous quote appeared before his eyes.</p>
<p>[Humanity must put an end to war, or war will put an end to humanity. —John F. Kennedy]</p>
