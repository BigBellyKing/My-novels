<h2>Chapter 219: Along the River During the Qingming Festival (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</h2>
<p>With the Early Access trial of Minecraft concluded, online players held diverse opinions about this game.</p>
<p>Some found the game somewhat interesting, especially its novel block-based building gameplay, which felt quite fresh.</p>
<p>However, many players still had no idea how Minecraft was actually meant to be played.</p>
<p>Because the entire game seemed to lack any clear objective.</p>
<p>In Don't Starve, players had to gradually develop themselves just to survive.</p>
<p>For instance, in Don't Starve, if a player didn’t quickly collect resources, they would almost certainly die during the first dog attack.</p>
<p>Moreover, with seasonal changes, besides the dogs, powerful bosses would also appear.</p>
<p>Survival in Don't Starve was never easy—even in the simplest mode.</p>
<p>Yet in Minecraft, many players felt staying alive was ridiculously simple.</p>
<p>The most dangerous time in the game was at night.</p>
<p>But unlike in Don't Starve, where players had to huddle beside a campfire for safety,</p>
<p>the nighttime atmosphere in Minecraft, while slightly eerie,</p>
<p>was far easier to endure.</p>
<p>Dig a hole, bury yourself, count to five—no need for beds. Wait seven minutes, and daylight arrives, instantly removing the danger.</p>
<p>And as for hunger? Cows, sheep, and chickens—</p>
<p>these creatures were abundant in Minecraft.</p>
<p>If surviving in Don't Starve felt like a luxury,</p>
<p>in Minecraft, it was practically effortless.</p>
<p>Of course, higher difficulty settings were another matter entirely.</p>
<p>As long as players didn’t deliberately seek death, survival was guaranteed.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, many players were utterly confused about what the core appeal of Minecraft truly was.</p>
<p>This was precisely why Chen Xu had added extensive beginner tutorials to the game.</p>
<p>Because players in this Parallel World had no prior concept of sandbox games, let alone open-world experiences.</p>
<p>Thus, Chen Xu needed to guide them, helping them understand exactly where the game’s charm and unique features lay.</p>
<p>Once they understood, that was when players could truly unleash their creativity.</p>
<p>While the industry debated Minecraft’s lukewarm reception,</p>
<p>Chen Xu and Nebula Games finally made their move.</p>
<p>Multiple domestic gaming media portals simultaneously published a series of articles and news posts:</p>
<p>"In Minecraft, You Can Actually Visit Bianjing, the Capital of the Northern Song Dynasty!"</p>
<p>"Is This Really Just a Pixel Game?"</p>
<p>"How to Recreate 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' in Minecraft!"</p>
<p>Chen Xu, of course, had never intended to sit idle on promotion—he’d planned this all along.</p>
<p>Instantly, the topic surrounding Minecraft exploded online.</p>
<p>Designers and players across the industry were drawn in.</p>
<p>But what followed was widespread bewilderment.</p>
<p>Along the River During the Qingming Festival?</p>
<p>What did Along the River During the Qingming Festival have to do with Minecraft?</p>
<p>Did Nebula Games really use building blocks to recreate the entire scroll painting in Minecraft?</p>
<p>Players looked bewildered, completely unsure of what was going on.</p>
<p>Whether they’d played the game or not, after seeing these headlines, curiosity drove them to click the video links embedded in the articles.</p>
<p>The video opened with a line of text: 'This footage is from actual in-game gameplay. All structures shown can be recreated within the game...'</p>
<p>At first, players didn’t react much to this statement.</p>
<p>But the moment the video began, every single viewer was stunned.</p>
<p>"Damn it! My roommate just asked why I'm kneeling in front of my computer!"</p>
<p>"Is this a pixel game? Is this seriously a pixel game? Is this really the same pixel game I played a few days ago?"</p>
<p>"Ah Wei died! This graphics—Chen Xu, don’t lie to me, this has to be CGI, right!?"</p>
<p>"Damn it! It’s really Along the River During the Qingming Festival! I thought you were just referencing the painting, but you actually rebuilt the entire city of Bianjing!?"</p>
<p>Countless players who clicked on the video were immediately mesmerized by what they saw.</p>
<p>No one could believe their eyes.</p>
<p>For those who hadn’t played Minecraft, it was shocking enough.</p>
<p>But for those who had, the experience was overwhelming—both thrilling and bewildering.</p>
<p>How could this possibly be the same game they had played before?</p>
<p>The video opened with a hazy drizzle.</p>
<p>As raindrops fell to the ground, it felt as though one were crossing a thousand years of time, returning to the banks of the Bian River in ancient times.</p>
<p>Under the overcast, drizzling sky, rain fell gently onto the empty streets of Bianliang.</p>
<p>As if hinting at the hidden perils beneath the city’s bustling prosperity.</p>
<p>Soothing background audio began to play. Then, the camera slowly ascended, revealing the entirety of Bianliang and the Bian River in one sweeping view.</p>
<p>The camera gradually zoomed in on the city’s buildings, allowing viewers to clearly see the structures lining the streets and alleys, including temples and pavilions.</p>
<p>The view passed through streets, canals, elevated pavilions, and fields. Gradually, the rain ceased.</p>
<p>The sun began to rise, its light spilling across the streets of Bianliang.</p>
<p>Gradually, the sounds of laughter and chatter filled the air as countless citizens appeared on the streets of Bianjing.</p>
<p>Then, the video’s perspective shifted with the camera.</p>
<p>Merchants selling goods in bustling alleys, tourists wandering about.</p>
<p>Boats traveling up and down the canal—carrying poets, merchants, and high-ranking officials.</p>
<p>Along the roads outside Bianliang, traders led oxen and horses.</p>
<p>In the fields, farmers toiled while children played.</p>
<p>As time progressed, Bianliang slowly transitioned into night.</p>
<p>Painted pleasure boats docked in the center of the Bian River, while countless Kongming lanterns floated in the sky.</p>
<p>Then, the video gradually faded into darkness, the gentle music slowly fading away.</p>
<p>Afterward, a making-of footage segment appeared.</p>
<p>Using fast-forwarded clips, it showed how the recreation of Along the River During the Qingming Festival was constructed piece by piece.</p>
<p>From nothing to completion, it demonstrated that players could recreate everything shown in the game if they wished.</p>
<p>Moreover, the lighting and shadows in the recreation of Along the River During the Qingming Festival were not achieved through post-production rendering.</p>
<p>Instead, they were entirely created using the game’s existing lighting and shadow effects.</p>
<p>Although post-rendering would have enhanced visual quality, it would have felt less authentic to regular players.</p>
<p>It would be like posting a beauty-filtered one with full makeup when you promised a bare-faced picture—it would feel like deception!</p>
<p>Yet even so, the 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' built purely within Minecraft had already completely stunned the players.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in this demonstration, Chen Xu employed a brand-new technology.</p>
<p>The AI visual enhancement technology that Galaxy Smart Tech had been developing.</p>
<p>The tool used last year had finally completed its final countdown.</p>
<p>Zhong Yue’s team had already filed relevant patents for this latest technology.</p>
<p>In Minecraft—or rather, in this demonstration of Along the River During the Qingming Festival—Chen Xu used it for the first time.</p>
<p>In terms of results, it fully met Chen Xu’s expectations.</p>
<p>However, in terms of current optimizations, running the latest AI technology consumed considerable resources.</p>
<p>It demanded high computer specifications, so Chen Xu had instructed Qin Yi and the team at Nebula Games to continue refining the optimizations.</p>
<p>But for players watching the video, they couldn’t perceive any of these technical limitations yet.</p>
