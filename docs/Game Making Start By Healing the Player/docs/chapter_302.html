                <p>Chapter 301: Rainbow Six Siege (6th update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu's words, Meng Zuo, sitting there, looked dumbfounded.</p>
<p>The game background and gameplay were already complete? Although it was just a rough idea, he already felt incredibly excited listening to it. Without a doubt, this was a game completely different from ordinary FPS games. This would definitely be a more hardcore game.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, so-called counter-terrorism games in the industry are mostly centered around firearms. And the so-called tactics revolve around throwables. Combined with map characteristics, throwables include flashbangs, incendiary grenades, and smoke grenades. But essentially, these games still compete on marksmanship.</p>
<p>However, judging from the game content Chen Xu had just described, as a game designer, Meng Zuo could clearly understand Chen Xu's intention. That is, this yet-unnamed game would be a tactics-focused game.</p>
<p>"But balance will be a relatively important core aspect. After all, even though we're making it specifically for the military, we still need to consider the player market," Meng Zuo said to Chen Xu.</p>
<p>This was also a crucial core point. As a game whose selling point was counter-terrorism content, and judging by its gameplay, it would clearly be a multiplayer versus game. In that case, balance would inevitably be a core issue that couldn't be avoided.</p>
<p>If provided to the military, it could lean towards unlimited realism. For example, if hit by a single shot, one would essentially lose the ability to move, or be incapacitated. This is because it considers real-world situations, and a version specifically for the military clearly requires realism. But for players, it couldn't be like that. After all, players experience a game, not so-called reality.</p>
<p>In fact, players are very contradictory in this regard. On one hand, players shout about wanting realism! "I want enough realism!" But if you truly listen to players and make a game incredibly close to reality, then basically only one outcome awaits you. Either it flops spectacularly, or it becomes a very, very niche game. Because in competitive games like this, players pursue the positive feedback of kills and victories. If the game is set so that one shot incapacitates a person, then what the heck would players play?</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I've already considered this. You'll understand when the time comes, Teacher Meng," Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Seeing Chen Xu's confidence, Meng Zuo nodded.</p>
<p>"Regarding the relevant procedures, Mr. Chen, please have someone coordinate with me. I'll handle the Game Department directly," Meng Zuo told Chen Xu. It was clear that since Chen Xu had said this, he already had a general idea for this unnamed game. Meng Zuo would simply run errands, applying to the Game Department and arranging for the VR development machine and permissions. As for the game design draft, Chen Xu could complete it himself. After all, Nebula Games was leading this game. As for him leading it? He wasn't sure if Nebula Games and Chen Xu would agree, but NetDragon certainly wouldn't. He had a very clear understanding of his "status in the industry." Moreover, Chen Xu was well-known in the gaming industry; honestly, his games in recent years had been a mix of good and bad. If he could "lie down and win" this time, that would be excellent.</p>
<p>After their discussion, Meng Zuo left Nebula Games, and Chen Xu opened his computer, preparing to write the concept drafts.</p>
<p>For Chen Xu, there were actually many options for FPS games. Many excellent FPS games from his previous life each had their own advantages. For example, "Battlefield," "COD," and even games like "PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds" and "Arma." If realism was the goal, then Arma was clearly the most suitable. But if it was about fun, then Battlefield, COD, and PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds each represented their own unique gameplay: large-scale battlefields, pure and exhilarating "bang bang bang" shooting, and Battle Royale. However, Chen Xu ultimately rejected all these games.</p>
<p>There were three main reasons. The first reason was that they weren't very suitable for military training. Among them, COD was the least aligned with the core objective. Next, Battlefield and PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds: Battlefield tested battlefield atmosphere and coordination. But the key is that in this day and age, even warfare wouldn't be quite like it is in Battlefield. As for PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, it touched upon a bit of everything but wasn't particularly refined in any single aspect. Arma, on the other hand, was quite suitable for realistic training. But the crucial point was that this game also had to face the player market. With Arma's gameplay experience of traveling for half an hour and possibly dying without even seeing an enemy, Chen Xu could only say that making it into a VR version would be too risky.</p>
<p>On the other hand, whether it was Battlefield, COD, or PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, all were sales monsters. NetDragon was only a temporary partner, not an insider. So, for Chen Xu, a special game became the primary target.</p>
<p>In his previous life, it was Ubisoft's "Rainbow Six Siege." One could say that Siege's path to success was quite bumpy. Initially, Rainbow Six Siege not only failed to become a hit but also garnered countless criticisms. The main reasons, besides Ubisoft's characteristic "potato servers" and bugs (their local specialties), were what dissatisfied players the most: the Rainbow Six series itself was based on a Tom Clancy counter-terrorism novel, and naturally, like COD, it didn't shy away from "demonization of Russians." Of course, that wasn't important. What was important was that early Rainbow Six wasn't a multiplayer versus FPS game; it was a tactics-oriented game, or more accurately, a strategy-type game.</p>
<p>As for Siege, early special operations were more of a gimmick. Coupled with the removal of single-player levels, it directly caused a player uproar, ultimately leading to very dismal launch sales and almost a spectacular flop. But in the end, Ubisoft, affectionately known by players as "Ubisoft, my big brother forever," chose not to abandon the game. Instead, they spent three years patching it up, refining various settings, and even went a year without any content updates, opting for a complete overhaul. This greatly improved the quality of "Rainbow Six Siege," and it was also the year many players in his previous life "got into the game."</p>
<p>Of course, Ubisoft's subsequent handling of Rainbow Six Siege wasn't without its criticisms from players. For example, Ubisoft overly focused on esports-ification, and all changes were based on this. All realistic, common, and classic counter-terrorism maps were changed to a "balanced design of rooms and corridors." However, from a game design perspective, this was actually a beneficial change, as it made the game more balanced.</p>
<p>As for Chen Xu, he didn't need to worry too much about the game's settings. He just needed to optimize some details based on the settings of "Rainbow Six Siege" from his previous life, as the original version was already very mature. What Chen Xu was more concerned about was how to better present the content of "Rainbow Six" in VR, and the performance of the specialized military version.</p>
