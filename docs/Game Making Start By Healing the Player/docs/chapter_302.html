<p>Chapter 301: Rainbow Six Siege (6th Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu, Meng Zuo sitting on the side was completely dumbfounded.</p>
<p>The game's background and gameplay—were they already figured out?</p>
<p>Although it was only a rough idea, Meng Zuo already felt incredibly excited just from hearing it.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this was a game completely different from regular FPS titles.</p>
<p>This would definitely be a more hardcore experience.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, so-called counter-terrorism games in the industry were mostly centered around firearms.</p>
<p>And the so-called tactics usually revolved around throwable items.</p>
<p>Combined with map layouts, these included flashbangs, incendiary grenades, and smoke grenades.</p>
<p>But essentially, these games still came down to marksmanship.</p>
<p>However, from what Chen Xu had just described, as a Game Designer, Meng Zuo could clearly grasp Chen Xu's intention.</p>
<p>This unnamed game would be one where Tactics were the Core Aspect.</p>
<p>"But balance will be a crucial core point. Even though we're aiming to develop this for military use, we still need to consider the player market," Meng Zuo said to Chen Xu.</p>
<p>This was another critical issue.</p>
<p>As a game whose selling point was counter-terrorism operations, and judging from the gameplay, this was clearly going to be a multiplayer versus game.</p>
<p>Balance would inevitably become a core challenge that couldn't be avoided.</p>
<p>If developed solely for military use, it could lean toward unrestricted realism.</p>
<p>For example, getting hit by a single bullet would completely incapacitate a person, or even render them out of action.</p>
<p>That was because it considered real-world scenarios, and a version made exclusively for military training clearly required authenticity.</p>
<p>But players couldn't be treated the same way.</p>
<p>After all, players were there for the game experience, not for realism.</p>
<p>Players were actually quite contradictory in this regard.</p>
<p>On one hand, they shouted that they wanted realism!</p>
<p>We want maximum realism!</p>
<p>Yet when you actually listened to them and made a game extremely close to real life, there was only one likely outcome.</p>
<p>Either it flopped completely, or it became an extremely niche title.</p>
<p>Because in competitive games, players sought the positive feedback from kills and victories.</p>
<p>If the game was set up so that getting shot once meant you were out, what was the point of playing?</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I've already considered this. You'll understand once we get into it," Chen Xu said with a confident smile.</p>
<p>Seeing Chen Xu's confident demeanor, Meng Zuo nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>"As for the necessary procedures, Mr. Chen, just assign someone to coordinate with me. I'll handle the Game Department paperwork directly," Meng Zuo told Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Clearly, since Chen Xu had said this, he already had a rough idea for this unnamed game.</p>
<p>Meng Zuo's role would simply be to run the errands—submitting applications at the Game Department and setting up access to the VR development machine and permissions.</p>
<p>As for the game design draft, let Chen Xu handle it himself.</p>
<p>After all, this project was led by Nebula Games.</p>
<p>Would he be the one leading it?</p>
<p>He wasn't sure whether Nebula Games or Chen Xu would agree, but one thing was certain—NetDragon definitely wouldn't.</p>
<p>He had a very clear understanding of his own status in the industry.</p>
<p>Besides, Chen Xu already had a well-known reputation in the gaming industry. Truth be told, Chen's games over the past few years had their highs and lows.</p>
<p>If he could just lie down and win this time, that would be fantastic.</p>
<p>After some discussion, Meng Zuo left Nebula Games, while Chen Xu turned on his computer, ready to begin drafting the concept document.</p>
<p>For Chen Xu, there were actually many options when it came to FPS games. Many quality titles from his previous life each had their own strengths.</p>
<p>For example, 'Battlefield,' 'Call of Duty,' and even games like 'PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds' and 'Arma'.</p>
<p>If realism was the goal, Arma was clearly the most suitable.</p>
<p>If fun was the priority, Battlefield, COD, and PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds each represented unique gameplay styles.</p>
<p>Large-scale battlefields, pure and exhilarating "Bang Bang Bang," and Battle Royale.</p>
<p>But in the end, Chen Xu rejected all of them.</p>
<p>There were mainly three reasons.</p>
<p>The first was that they weren't very suitable for military training.</p>
<p>Among them, COD was the least aligned with the core concept.</p>
<p>Next, Battlefield and PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds—Battlefield tested battlefield atmosphere and team coordination.</p>
<p>But the key was, even in modern warfare, actual combat wouldn't resemble Battlefield's scenarios.</p>
<p>As for PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, it touched on many aspects, but didn't excel in any.</p>
<p>As for Arma, in terms of realistic training, it was indeed a good fit.</p>
<p>But the issue was that this game also needed to target the player market. With Arma's gameplay—where you might spend half an hour traveling only to die before even seeing an enemy—Chen Xu felt that making a VR version would be far too risky.</p>
<p>Another reason was that Battlefield, COD, and PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds were all sales monsters.</p>
<p>NetDragon was only a temporary partner, not one of their own.</p>
<p>Thus, for Chen Xu, a particularly distinctive game became the top choice.</p>
<p>'Rainbow Six Siege' from Ubisoft, from his previous life.</p>
<p>The success of Rainbow Six Siege had been quite rocky.</p>
<p>Initially, Rainbow Six Siege didn't become wildly popular. Instead, it attracted countless criticisms.</p>
<p>The main reasons, aside from Ubisoft's signature 'potato servers' and bugs—its two notorious 'local specialties'—</p>
<p>was that players were most dissatisfied with the game's departure from its roots.</p>
<p>Originally, the Rainbow Six series was based on Tom Clancy's counter-terrorism novels, and like COD, often featured anti-Russian themes.</p>
<p>But that wasn't important. What mattered was that the early Rainbow Six titles weren't multiplayer FPS games, but rather tactical experiences—more accurately described as strategy-type games.</p>
<p>In Siege, the early 'Special Operations' concept was mostly a selling point, and the removal of single-player levels caused player outrage, resulting in a disastrously poor launch that nearly led to the game's cancellation.</p>
<p>Yet in the end, Ubisoft—affectionately known as "my big brother forever" by players—didn't abandon the game. Instead, they spent three years fixing it, refining various settings, and even went a full year without new content, focusing entirely on a complete overhaul.</p>
<p>This dramatically improved the quality of 'Rainbow Six Siege,' and that year marked when many players from Chen Xu's previous life first got into the game.</p>
<p>Of course, Ubisoft's later decisions regarding Rainbow Six Siege weren't without criticism.</p>
<p>For example, their excessive focus on esports-ification meant all modifications were made with competitive play in mind.</p>
<p>All authentic, realistic, and classic counter-terrorism maps were redesigned into the balanced 'rooms and corridors' layout.</p>
<p>But from a game design perspective, this was actually a positive change.</p>
<p>It made the game much more balanced.</p>
<p>For Chen Xu, however, the game's setting didn't need too much attention.</p>
<p>He could simply make minor optimizations based on the original 'Rainbow Six Siege' design, as the original was already highly mature.</p>
<p>What concerned Chen Xu more was how to better showcase the content of 'Rainbow Six' in VR, and how the specialized military version would perform.</p>
