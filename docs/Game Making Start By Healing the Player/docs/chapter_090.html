<p>Chapter 90: Sensation</p>
<p>On the day <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Sanguosha</em> launched on the Nebula Games Platform,</p>
<p>Countless players immediately began downloading them.</p>
<p>Among them, <em>Sanguosha</em> was a free-to-play game—why wouldn't you download it?</p>
<p>And while <em>Fall Guys</em> was a buy-to-play paid game, its adorable cartoon style and highly entertaining gameplay mode made it highly anticipated by many players. But there was another crucial factor:</p>
<p>During the gameplay Expo, <em>Fall Guys</em> had offered a free trial period—albeit only for one day.</p>
<p>But still, it was free to play!</p>
<p>Whether it suited you or not, you could download and try it first.</p>
<p>If it was fun, then buying it outright was no issue.</p>
<p>Moreover, based on the previous case of <em>Overcooked</em>, games developed by Nebula Games and sold on their own platform often came with certain discounts.</p>
<p>Also, judging by the level design of <em>Fall Guys</em>, many players had already speculated that the game would very likely support the Workshop (modding platform) in the subsequent work.</p>
<p>Compared to the Steam platform in Chen Xu's previous life, the Workshop introduced by the Nebula Games Platform hadn't yet caused a major sensation within the gaming industry.</p>
<p>The main reason was that such a feature wasn't solely dependent on the platform's willingness—it required active participation from both players and developers.</p>
<p>However, for players who had already experienced the joy of the Workshop, they were extremely excited.</p>
<p>Currently, <em>Overcooked</em> on the Nebula Games Platform still reached peak concurrent players of 100,000 daily, a figure largely attributed to the Workshop.</p>
<p>Although other platforms also allowed <em>Overcooked</em> mod usage, the process was somewhat cumbersome.</p>
<p>Soon, the first-day download numbers for <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Sanguosha</em> were revealed.</p>
<p><em>Sanguosha</em> surpassed 1.2 million downloads, while <em>Fall Guys</em> reached a staggering 3.1 million.</p>
<p>This data stunned numerous professionals within the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Although <em>Sanguosha</em> was permanently free and <em>Fall Guys</em> offered a one-day free trial, combined with the existing popularity from the gameplay Expo,</p>
<p>Such figures were still far beyond what many had anticipated.</p>
<p>More importantly, this was solely based on the Nebula Games Platform!</p>
<p>This brought millions of new users to the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>Although the retention rate of these users would likely be discounted significantly,</p>
<p>The sheer number was still terrifying.</p>
<p>Compared to NetDragon and TengHua, or even the official game store with hundreds of millions of users, and secondary channel providers with tens of millions, Nebula Games' numbers naturally couldn't compete.</p>
<p>But for an independent game platform to achieve such a user count was nothing short of incredible!</p>
<p>Moreover, judging from current data, the potential of both <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Sanguosha</em> had clearly not been exhausted—they were still rising.</p>
<p>Now it remained to be seen just how far they could go.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>The data from <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em> naturally made many game designers envious.</p>
<p>On various forums for industry designers, aside from those expressing amazement and optimism, there were also some designers expressing skepticism.</p>
<p>'It's still too early to say <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Sanguosha</em> are successful, isn't it?'</p>
<p>'Yeah, although they have considerable热度 and topic appeal, <em>Sanguosha</em> is free, with its main revenue relying on in-app purchases. And <em>Fall Guys</em> is only offering a one-day free trial—its actual sales are still unknown.'</p>
<p>'Exactly. Success ultimately depends on two key factors: retention rate and payment data. Declaring them as hits right now is too hasty.'</p>
<p>'Right. If just one of these metrics underperforms, both games will still become unpopular.'</p>
<p>However, such designers were definitely not the mainstream.</p>
<p>There will always be those who wish for others to fail, or who take greater joy in seeing others stumble and fall than in their own success.</p>
<p>As for the direct audience—the ordinary players—their mindset was completely different.</p>
<p>They found these two games fresh and entertaining.</p>
<p>As recently popular games, after Chen Xu opened access, many streamers on major live streaming platforms chose to broadcast <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Sanguosha</em>.</p>
<p>However, <em>Fall Guys</em> completely overshadowed <em>Sanguosha</em> in a dominant fashion.</p>
<p>From a player's perspective, both <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em> had their unique characteristics—after all, they were fundamentally different genres, making it hard to judge which was better.</p>
<p>But for streamers and video creators, there was a significant difference:</p>
<p><em>Fall Guys</em> had far superior entertainment value for viewers compared to <em>Sanguosha</em>.</p>
<p>As a result, major live streaming platforms and video websites were flooded with <em>Fall Guys</em> streams and videos.</p>
<p>Both players and streamers, as well as video creators, discovered a shared characteristic:</p>
<p>Playing <em>Fall Guys</em> was genuinely much more fun.</p>
<p>Although the game did have its fair share of frustration-inducing moments.</p>
<p>For example, some players chose not to be nice, using mischievous tactics to grab and block others right before the finish line, eliminating them.</p>
<p>In those moments, the adorable Fall Guys instantly transformed into Grabbers.</p>
<p>But unlike <em>Overcooked</em>, where such actions often led to heated arguments, <em>Fall Guys</em> players tended to unite against external chaos.</p>
<p>This resulted in a completely different atmosphere—even when frustrating, the mood remained joyful.</p>
<p>This variety show obstacle course-style game was currently one-of-a-kind,</p>
<p>Offering players a refreshingly new experience.</p>
<p>Online, laughter and joy could be found everywhere.</p>
<p>In various <em>Fall Guys</em> community forums, most posts were social in nature,</p>
<p>With players seeking teammates to play and voice chat with together.</p>
<p>The initial impression the game gave players was simply too delightful.</p>
<p>As for <em>Sanguosha</em>, although in terms of热度 it seemed to be completely overshadowed by <em>Fall Guys</em>,</p>
<p>The community forums were instead filled with all kinds of strategy guides.</p>
<p>The reason was simple: everyone was still learning how to play, and <em>Sanguosha</em> was inherently deeper in content.</p>
<p>Thus, guides analyzing card effects and general Skills were particularly popular among players.</p>
<p>Of course, there were also some entertaining sharing posts.</p>
<p>The game had only just launched on the Nebula Games Platform,</p>
<p>Yet numerous infamous moments had already emerged.</p>
<p>'I want to ask—could it be because I didn't buy a <em>Sanguosha</em> skin that the system is targeting me? Why can't my Zhen Ji see black cards, and why doesn't my Da Qiao have any diamond suit cards?'</p>
<p>'What's that? My Zhuge Liang used Lightning and Observe Stars to strike myself—how much unluckier can I get?'</p>
<p>'Oh, come on. At least your generals can trigger their Skills. I played as Sun Shangxiang with four female generals on the field, and didn't draw a single weapon card the entire game—I basically played as a blank slate!'</p>
<p>Online, whether it was <em>Sanguosha</em> or <em>Fall Guys</em> players, everyone was chatting enthusiastically.</p>
<p>For a time, the player community was filled with joy and excitement.</p>
<p>Under Chen Xu's official Weibo account, many players also left comments, admitting they had misjudged him and praising him as the true Warrior of Love.</p>
<p>Although both games had their frustrating, blood-pressure-raising moments, most situations remained cheerful and entertaining.</p>
<p>Some players even remarked that if <em>Fall Guys</em> had been released just before Valentine's Day, it would have been even more perfect.</p>
