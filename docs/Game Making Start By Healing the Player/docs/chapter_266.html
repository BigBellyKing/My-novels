                <p>Chapter 265: System Fully Upgraded (Fifth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>In the Wildspire Waste's Diablos's Den.</p>
<p>Accompanied by a wail, the Diablos collapsed and died.</p>
<p>Song Ren couldn't help but burst out laughing: "Satisfying! Just a mere Diablos! Super weak!"</p>
<p>Looking at the Diablos's corpse on the ground, Song Ren couldn't resist taking a photo and posting it on his WeChat Moments.</p>
<p>Two minutes later, Zhang Yi sent a message: "Damn it, Old Song, why did you switch to Gunlance? Weren't you determined to be an Azure Star Long Sword user?"</p>
<p>"What Long Sword? I don't understand what you're talking about? Besides, I'm thinking about the team. Didn't you all say Long Sword users easily cause friendly fire? So I switched." Song Ren engaged in a wave of selective amnesia.</p>
<p>Although the Long Sword was indeed very cool, when facing the rampaging Diablos, he still chose to abandon his faith.</p>
<p>This was true not only for Song Ren but also for many other players who were stuck on a level/quest.</p>
<p>They all joined these "cheese" methods, thoroughly enjoying the pleasure of bypassing the difficulty.</p>
<p>And after these players defeated the Diablos and Rathalos using "cheese" methods, they didn't feel bored. On the contrary, they were filled with confidence.</p>
<p>They couldn't wait to challenge even stronger monsters later on.</p>
<p>Even some of the previous comments resurfaced.</p>
<p>"The difficulty of Monster Hunter: World is underperforming!"</p>
<p>"Gunlance and Light Bowgun aren't just 'cheesing' anymore, it's practically dropping out of school!"</p>
<p>Facing these overconfident players, Chen Xu chuckled.</p>
<p>"Healed the wound, forgot the pain," he thought. "When you face Deviljho, Meimeizi, Kirin, and Lunastra, I hope you can still smile."</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>While players happily hunted in the New World, Chen Xu also opened his system, something he hadn't done in a long time.</p>
<p>He hadn't done a gacha pull in ages, and this time Chen Xu was genuinely excited.</p>
<p>After all, since Minecraft launched, his points hadn't moved.</p>
<p>The points generated by Minecraft must be enormous.</p>
<p>With some excitement, Chen Xu opened the system.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions... nine digits, converted into gacha pulls.</p>
<p>Good heavens, he had accumulated nearly two thousand draws.</p>
<p>He had never been so wealthy!</p>
<p>Chen Xu was now very familiar with the gacha pull process.</p>
<p>He started pulling directly, beginning with 500 draws.</p>
<p>Chen Xu didn't even bother looking at the golden light. After 500 draws, he quickly scanned the results.</p>
<p>There were no golden items, but he did spot a purple item.</p>
<p>'Keyboard Spewing Milk Card (Self-Use Only): After use, allows you to perform incredible operations in the game accompanied by a commentator's prophecy, bringing a large amount of positive attention to the game. (Sometimes, milk spewing from the keyboard isn't necessarily a bad thing)'</p>
<p>What the heck!?</p>
<p>Keyboard spewing milk, is this for others to jinx him?</p>
<p>And the effect doesn't seem very powerful!</p>
<p>Bringing a large amount of positive attention? He wasn't short on promotional funds now.</p>
<p>After a quick glance, Chen Xu tossed it aside.</p>
<p>Then, he noticed a more interesting item.</p>
<p>'Self-Service Shop Key *1: Can open the shop to purchase specified items.'</p>
<p>Able to open a shop to actively purchase items?</p>
<p>Does that mean similar items like the golden cards from the AI performance could be bought directly?</p>
<p>Looking at the key item, Chen Xu noticed a preview option next to it.</p>
<p>He tried clicking it, and a large array of items popped up before him.</p>
<p>However, after scanning through them, Chen Xu was a little disappointed.</p>
<p>There were no items of golden quality or higher. There were quite a few purple items, similar to the 'Fear Converter' he obtained when making Outlast, and the 'Keyboard Spewing Milk Card' he just got, but their prices were not cheap, all starting with an eight-digit number of points.</p>
<p>Clearly, this stuff was definitely overpriced. After all, the Fear Converter only earned a few million points in total, and this was selling for an eight-digit price?</p>
<p>Even unscrupulous merchants aren't that outrageous!</p>
<p>Besides these, there were also Memory Capsules and common skill books, but each was priced at six digits.</p>
<p>"Too dark!" Chen Xu couldn't help but exclaim.</p>
<p>Then Chen Xu turned his gaze to the other skill books.</p>
<p>Some new ones appeared, but most were ones he had drawn before.</p>
<p>Item Design, Plot: 83 books.</p>
<p>Camera, Directing Professionalism, Psychology Professional Knowledge: 120 books.</p>
<p>Architecture, Art Concept Art, Action Special Effects: 171 books.</p>
<p>Music, Sound Effects: 79 books.</p>
<p>The rest were Memory Capsules.</p>
<p>"Use a batch first, and save the remaining points for a while longer."</p>
<p>While using the skill books, Chen Xu was also thinking.</p>
<p>But the next moment, a prompt appeared on the screen: "Current skill value meets promotion conditions, initiating Phase Two."</p>
<p>It even upgrades!?</p>
<p>Chen Xu was stunned. The system before him burst into colorful light, and a new UI interface appeared.</p>
<p>The Gashapon machine itself wasn't much different from before.</p>
<p>But why did the points for a draw increase to 1 million per pull?</p>
<p>'Entering Phase Two, previously acquired points remain valid.'</p>
<p>'In Phase Two, all acquired points, excluding Emotion Points, will be comprehensively referenced based on Industry Influence.'</p>
<p>What does that mean!?</p>
<p>Chen Xu stared blankly at the brand-new system for a long time, only understanding the situation after a bit of research.</p>
<p>Firstly, points still came from player emotions, just like before.</p>
<p>But the difference was the addition of an upper threshold: Industry Influence.</p>
<p>And "Industry Influence" referred to the positive changes brought to the gaming industry.</p>
<p>For example, new game types, or changes to existing industry rules.</p>
<p>Of course, it had to be positive. A typical negative example would be the Atari ET incident in his previous life, which led to the video game crash.</p>
<p>At the same time, the item shop also entered Phase Two.</p>
<p>Looking at his points, he tried a five-pull.</p>
<p>Chen Xu found that the items he drew were also different.</p>
<p>Directing Professionalism *1</p>
<p>Psychology Professional Knowledge *2</p>
<p>World Ancient Civilizations History (Ancient Greece) *1</p>
<p>World Ancient Civilizations History (Norse Era) *1</p>
<p>It wasn't limited to just art and music; it was a comprehensive improvement across the board.</p>
<p>But this influence!</p>
<p>"I should have pulled earlier!"</p>
<p>He was a step too late!</p>
<p>The establishment of the Nebula Games Platform was definitely a decision that brought massive influence.</p>
<p>After all, the era of "channels are king" in the gaming industry was directly broken.</p>
<p>Although the Channel Alliance, as well as TengHua and NetDragon, were still biding their time for a counterattack, to be honest, Chen Xu wasn't worried at all.</p>
<p>But now?</p>
<p>It's all gone!</p>
<p>Of course, he didn't know yet if it was limited to game-related influence, but even if it was, Monster Hunter could still earn a lot of influence.</p>
<p>And including previous games like Undertale, they all brought significant industry influence.</p>
<p>Even Mirror (Game) was like that, profoundly changing the previous situation of low-quality adult games for "Lewd Persons."</p>
<p>Making adult games bigger and stronger, creating new glories—that's also a kind of industry influence!</p>
<p>Despite this, the system update gave Chen Xu a new plan for the future development of the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>Isn't it just about bringing positive influence to the industry?</p>
<p>He'd start with a small test.</p>
<p>Looking at the brand-new system interface, Chen Xu thought for a moment and decided to save his points for now.</p>
<p>After all, with the system upgrade, although the items improved, inflation also occurred. His previously wealthy life suddenly became meager.</p>
<p>Moreover, with Chen Xu's current abilities, it was temporarily sufficient.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be too late to do gacha pulls later when there was a need. And the key he obtained, he checked, could still be used, and the items in the shop had also changed to Phase Two system items.</p>
<p>Of course, the prices made his heart tremble a bit.</p>
<p>He'd save up some more.</p>
