                <p>Chapter 207: The First Test DEMO (Sixth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>As time progressed, Chen Xu held several meetings with Qin Yi and others.</p>
<p>Further elaborating on the gameplay and core concepts of Minecraft.</p>
<p>Plans included releasing a mobile version, as well as a subsequent VR version.</p>
<p>But for now, the focus remained on the PC version.</p>
<p>After finalizing every aspect of Minecraft, the entire R&amp;D department inevitably entered a period of overtime work.</p>
<p>After all, time was extremely tight.</p>
<p>However, compared to the development of Minecraft, the two DLCs for Don't Starve were completed first after half a month.</p>
<p>The Reign of Giants and Shipwrecked versions introduced some brand-new creatures and gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p>In terms of content volume, these two versions weren't particularly extensive.</p>
<p>Combined with the existing game framework and the detailed design concept drafts provided by Chen Xu,</p>
<p>it didn't take much effort to complete.</p>
<p>New maps, monsters, and additional content</p>
<p>reignited players' passion for playing Don't Starve.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the gaming industry, apart from Don't Starve players delighted by the DLCs,</p>
<p>various developers and teams successively announced new projects involving sandbox games.</p>
<p>Including TengHua and NetDragon, studios under their banners also joined in.</p>
<p>They hadn't revealed much content, but judging from the materials released, the themes were incredibly diverse.</p>
<p>Chen Xu took some time to follow these developments, and many operations by these game developers and designers left him speechless.</p>
<p>For example, some teams directly copied the model of Don't Starve—same survival theme, only changing the art style and camera perspective, switching from a God's-eye view to third-person over-the-shoulder or first-person perspective, and then marketing it as a sandbox game.</p>
<p>This made Chen Xu speechless—not necessarily because they looked like terrible games at first glance, but because judging from their promotional content, these games leaned more toward pure survival with a slight hint of open-world elements. Yet, due to the current popularity of sandbox games, they simply labeled themselves as sandbox titles.</p>
<p>There were quite a few games like this. Others didn't follow Don't Starve's path but made minor innovations instead.</p>
<p>For instance, setting the game in the middle of the ocean, letting players play as pirates building their own ships, drifting across the sea, hunting legendary creatures, battling other pirates, and searching for treasure-filled islands from myths.</p>
<p>Others set the backdrop in a post-apocalyptic world, still focusing on survival but pitting players against zombies and mutated creatures.</p>
<p>Some turned it into an RPG, letting players take on the role of demigods, hunting down legendary monsters and ultimately aiming to defeat the Olympian gods.</p>
<p>Clearly, Don't Starve's success in showcasing the sandbox genre had inspired and sparked ideas for many designers in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>However, in Chen Xu's opinion, many of these games had absolutely nothing to do with the sandbox genre, yet all labeled themselves as such in their promotions.</p>
<p>It reminded him of the time in his previous life when Rockstar Games made GTA the benchmark for open-world games, leading to a flood of games—regardless of whether they were originally action-adventure, FPS, or RPGs—all branding themselves as open-world games, desperately trying to associate themselves with the open-world trend.</p>
<p>In various player community forums, many players were actively discussing.</p>
<p>'What the hell? I'm disgusted. How many of these have been announced this month? Another sandbox game?'</p>
<p>'My god, how many studios are working on sandbox games because Don't Starve popularized the genre?'</p>
<p>'But honestly, as someone who cares about graphics, I find these a bit more acceptable than Don't Starve.'</p>
<p>'The graphics do look nice, but we still don't know about the gameplay.'</p>
<p>Players grumbled on the forums.</p>
<p>But despite their complaints, aside from a few sandbox games that looked obviously poor from the initial project documents,</p>
<p>many of the announced projects attracted significant player attention and generated notable popularity.</p>
<p>Clearly, the sandbox game genre, being something entirely new, felt incredibly fresh to many players.</p>
<p>They might verbally complain about there being too many, saying 'I don't want this, I can't take it anymore,' but their actions told a different story—they were actively embracing it.</p>
<p>However, one thing was certain: among the numerous sandbox game projects riding this wave, some would inevitably fail and end up abandoned.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Chen Xu glanced at the ongoing discussions about the sandbox game trend in the gaming industry but didn't pay much attention.</p>
<p>His current main task remained completing Minecraft.</p>
<p>The full version of Minecraft clearly wouldn't be finished quickly.</p>
<p>However, a PC demo, intended for phased testing, had already been created.</p>
<p>This current DEMO lacked many features.</p>
<p>Not only were the tech elements in the game not implemented, but even the crafting system and similar components hadn't been added.</p>
<p>Simply put, this version was essentially a severely cut-down Creative Mode.</p>
<p>The game was extremely primitive. Currently, no art assets had been produced, and the UI hadn't been developed, so the entire game was a complete patchwork.</p>
<p>Elements from Don't Starve and Dark Souls (informal) could be spotted, making it look incredibly incongruous.</p>
<p>But Chen Xu didn't care much—these would be replaced later anyway.</p>
<p>After all, the initial DEMO of any game usually looked like this.</p>
<p>Entering the game, Chen Xu began testing.</p>
<p>He quickly loaded into the game. The character Steve wasn't Steve yet—he was just a block.</p>
<p>Well, a plain white block, without any pixel-defined facial features, looking rather eerie.</p>
<p>Controlling the in-game character, Chen Xu flew into the sky and took a brief tour.</p>
<p>Basic terrain like rivers, mountains, forests, and grasslands were generated using a randomized procedural generation logic.</p>
<p>Of course, 'random' didn't mean completely arbitrary—there was a coherent procedural generation logic in place.</p>
<p>True randomness could lead to generating a world with no water or one entirely covered by ocean with no land.</p>
<p>Although the probability was extremely, extremely low, it was still possible.</p>
<p>He exited and re-entered the game.</p>
<p>After repeating this process several times and observing carefully, Chen Xu gave a slight nod.</p>
<p>So far, he hadn't spotted any major issues.</p>
<p>Still, more sample testing would be required later.</p>
<p>As for the art assets:</p>
<p>The mainstream PC specifications among players in this Parallel World were significantly higher than in his previous life.</p>
<p>There was no need to worry about hardware requirements, so graphical fidelity could be pushed much higher.</p>
<p>After all, good visuals were an essential part of the player experience.</p>
<p>While preserving the game's core gameplay and characteristics, no player would say, 'I don't need garbage 4K—I prefer a very handsome 360P resolution with jagged graphics.'</p>
<p>'For the Art, make the blocks feel more textured, and ensure the textures for different materials are well done.'</p>
<p>'Also, unify the art style for special materials like lava, seawater, and regular blocks. Lighting is crucial too—consider how light sources like flames and the sun affect in-game materials, making them react more realistically, such as Glass and seawater.'</p>
<p>Chen Xu said to Ruan Ningxue.</p>
<p>No response—Ruan Ningxue simply nodded and noted down the key points.</p>
<p>'Alright, you all go ahead and get back to work. Qin Yi, stay behind. I'll explain the subsequent crafting system and technology system in detail. Then, we'll make a prototype DEMO for those parts.' Chen Xu turned to Qin Yi.</p>
