<p>Chapter 777: This is Heaven's Will!</p>
<p>Innumerable players who loved traditional RPGs, or who were drawn in by the artistic style of Nia, Pyra, and various Blades in the promotional materials for <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>, were collectively bewildered when they reached the Blade Bonding section.</p>
<p>Especially the Unlucky King players, who felt the endless malice of the game.</p>
<p>Can this world still be saved?</p>
<p>Why must they, the Unlucky King players, be persecuted?</p>
<p>Even in a single-player traditional RPG, they could feel the difference that luck brought.</p>
<p>For many players, this was a very vexing matter.</p>
<p>If you ask if you can still play without drawing an SSR Blade with a proper name? Of course you can. Even if you choose the Extreme difficulty, as long as you plan your team composition reasonably and carefully advance through the levels, it's playable. If all else fails, you can adjust the difficulty in the game and gradually work your way up from easy or normal mode. The game's story progression won't halt just because you didn't draw an SSR Blade.</p>
<p>But that's not the point.</p>
<p>The key lies in the in-game experience!</p>
<p>You Unlucky King players, how many Core Crystal ten-pulls have you done? It's the same old story! The Lucky King players have every right to say, 'What Blade am I carrying? I'm carrying KOS-MOS Re!' What kind of Blades are you carrying? You talk about experience, but with just these few Blades—Black Uncle, dark-skinned female Blade, and dark-skinned dog-like Blade—can they really provide an experience as a tank? No, they can't! If this continues, it'll be time to fight Malos, and then the game will end.</p>
<p>And we're not even talking about whether they're strong or not. When the battle music starts, apart from Pyra, who exudes a wife-like attribute, what other deformed characters are in the party? A bunch of Black Uncles and dark-skinned female Blades, it's painful just looking at them! What's more, they have to endure the pressure of other players showing off and posting screenshots in major community forums and game groups.</p>
<p>Looking at the dark-skinned female Blades and Black Uncles they've pulled, it makes them want to die!</p>
<p>For many players, finding ways to open boxes, even knowing it's a terrible game, they'd still curse while playing the arcade machine in Tora's house.</p>
<p>Or they'd explore every corner of maps like Gormott Province, opening every treasure chest they could. All for the sake of getting a few more Rare Crystals and Common Crystals, to then bond Blades. Although many players know that Core Crystals will definitely be farmable later in the game, and like many games, money and crystals might not be scarce in the late game.</p>
<p>But many players also understand one thing: the joy brought by content at different stages is different. In the early stage, pulling any named Blade from a Common Crystal might make them very happy and excited. But in the late game, even if they draw one, it might just be a cosmetic attachment, or it simply won't have that initial feeling. Plus, this is a single-player game, so there's no real pressure to keep up with other players' overall progress; at most, they just need to avoid consulting relevant information to prevent spoilers. Therefore, many players who value their first playthrough experience—specifically, Unlucky King players—after being able to freely bond Blades, chose not to continue the game's story. Instead, they opted to use various methods to pull a named Blade, hoping to make their subsequent adventure more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Song Ren in the game was still diligently farming crystals. He used the fastest method: skipping previously watched cutscenes and starting a new save file. And because he had explored once before, he was much more proficient after restarting. Skipping cutscenes allowed him to reach his current progress in about 15 minutes, yielding about 20 Common and Rare Crystals combined per attempt. This would normally be a rather tedious task, but having companions made it less so.</p>
<p>"Ah!! I'm sick of it, seven Black Uncles, nine dark-skinned female Blades, and five dark-skinned dog-like Blades!" Zhang Yi's collapsing voice came through the voice channel.</p>
<p>"Old Song, how many Black Uncles did you get? Tell me to make me feel better," Zhang Yi sighed after his lament.</p>
<p>"Get lost!" Song Ren's mouth twitched, looking at a warehouse full of Black Uncles and his last Rare Crystal in hand. He cursed, chose to bond, and as light erupted, Song Ren's eyes widened with surprise: "Haha! Old Zhang, take your time alone! Yours truly got a drop!"</p>
<p>"Damn you! You definitely got an ugly Blade!" Zhang Yi, on the other end of the line, exclaimed, unable to accept it.</p>
<p>"Hehe! But it's a beautiful girl!" Song Ren chuckled.</p>
<p>Without waiting for Zhang Yi to speak further, Song Ren looked at the beautiful girl Blade named 'Ying' that he had just pulled, who looked delicate and pitiful. He was incredibly excited. Although the description indicated she was a healer Blade, not his ideal damage-dealer, that wasn't the point. This was the first named Blade he had pulled, and a beautiful girl character at that! This was heaven's will!</p>
<p>Regardless of her strength, Song Ren had already decided: he would raise this beautiful girl character to the very end!</p>
<p>"Perfect!" Song Ren beamed, completely oblivious to the gravity of the situation.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>After successfully drawing the Blade he desired, Song Ren continued to progress through the game. As the story deepened, like most players, Song Ren became increasingly captivated by the plot.</p>
<p>One could say that <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>, setting aside its gaming attributes, is a classic shonen anime. It has playful humor, exhilarating passion, and poignant tears. Upon arriving at the Kingdom of Uraya, Rex encountered Vandham, a mercenary group uncle, who taught Rex many skills, such as Driver Combos.</p>
<p>However, from Song Ren's perspective, this uncle named Vandham was very likely a character destined to 'cool off' soon. As for why, it was because when the uncle first joined the party, Song Ren thought he was a main character, but then discovered in the Blade Bonding menu that he couldn't bond Blades with him. While Tora couldn't bond Blades, the story had explained it as Tora lacking talent. And although Vandham also offered an explanation, saying he was a brute who didn't bother with different Blade combinations, Song Ren felt it was a bit forced. Additionally, the chuuni big idiot Zeke they encountered along the way, judging by his appearance and his Blade Pandoria, seemed more like a main character, as did the tomboyish Mòrag they met earlier.</p>
<p>Compared to them, Uncle Vandham's easygoing personality, though appreciated by Song Ren, really lacked competitiveness! And subsequent plot points confirmed this. Uncle Vandham sacrificed himself to let the Aegis awaken due to Rex's distress, revealing its true personality: Mythra! As Rex blasted emotional BGM from a speaker, Malos, the antagonist, was predictably driven back. Although he had his suspicions, Song Ren had to admit that the story presentation in <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em> was truly outstanding.</p>
<p>The perfectly timed music stirred his emotions to the fullest.</p>
<p>Of course, as an experienced player, after the excitement subsided, Song Ren's focus shifted in another direction.</p>
<p>"Two personalities, one Mythra and one Pyra? Does this mean I have two wives!?"</p>
