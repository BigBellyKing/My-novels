                <p>Chapter 865: Direct Presentation</p>
<p>With the release of this nearly three-minute long promotional video, it immediately caused a huge stir among the player community, like a bomb dropped into a lake.</p>
<p>All the players were incredibly excited.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous video, which was more like an animated demonstration, this longer promotional animation, while not demonstrating the game's actual gameplay or core content, brought players the most direct surprise: the countless popular game characters appearing in it.</p>
<p>Ever since this project was first hinted at, it had garnered significant player attention. Aside from the initial surprise that Nebula Games was actually making a fighting game, the most intriguing aspect was that Nebula Games had managed to include characters from various major IPs into a single game. The crossovers between different characters and IPs, and what's more, not just limited to Nebula Games' own IP characters, truly astonished them.</p>
<p>Simple IP crossovers are not uncommon in the gaming circle. For instance, in World of Warcraft, there were Easter eggs featuring Cloud from Final Fantasy, Link from Breath of the Wild, and so on. However, these crossovers were merely Easter eggs, not part of the game's inherent content. As for actual game content, when Nebula Games was developing The Witcher: Wild Hunt and World of Warcraft, they did include monster hunting quests like Leshen and Frost Dragon in Monster Hunter: World. But these were not core content of the game, merely extra additions. This current action game, named Smash Bros., is clearly built around characters from various IPs, co-creating an entirely new game. The mere thought of all these classic characters, beloved by players, gathering together to fight in the same world, was enough to excite countless players.</p>
<p>‘So many familiar IP characters! This is explosive, I can't resist just these characters alone!’</p>
<p>‘Seriously, did you guys not notice the details? The video is packed with them! The Firelinker survived for one second on the ground with an invincible roll!’</p>
<p>‘LOL I noticed that too, the Firelinker used invincibility frames to dodge that attack, and Mario used a Super Star to dodge it.’</p>
<p>‘Looks like my great Link is still the best! Everyone else who lasted a second against that attack used invincibility skills, only my great Link blocked it with a shield before getting KO’d.’</p>
<p>‘But I wonder what the game’s background and story content will be like!’</p>
<p>‘A fighting game having a background and story? What the heck? Haven't you played fighting games before? The story is just the tutorial mode.’</p>
<p>‘That's not necessarily true, this is Nebula Games after all!’</p>
<p>‘Enough! Didn't you notice those eerie Master Hands? Could they be a metaphor for us players buying games until our hands are chopped off?’</p>
<p>‘You’re a real genius! So, if what you say is true, does that mean Gira, the mysterious mastermind, sealing all the heroes into plaster is a metaphor for collectible figures?’</p>
<p>‘It’s not impossible! So, if you truly love game characters, start by refusing to buy collectible figures. No buying, no killing! Every figure you buy means a character has been cruelly treated!’</p>
<p>‘You guys are too much! I don’t believe you’ll be able to resist buying them when the time comes!’</p>
<p>‘Of course I can resist, because I’m poor! (Righteous and confident.jpg)’</p>
<p>However, compared to the average player’s attention, industry media were more focused on another point: Nebula Games was actually going to hold an offline press conference. It’s worth noting that in the early days, when Nebula Games wasn’t as large, they would still hold offline press conferences for game promotion. But ever since Nebula Games rose to become a top-tier game developer, similar offline direct presentations rarely featured Chen Xu himself. For example, for the previous Elden Ring, Chen Xu only held an online direct presentation. Yet, for this Smash Bros. game, the direct presentation time was announced directly in the promotional trailer, and it seemed very likely that Chen Xu himself would host it, indicating how much importance he placed on this game. This truly made many players anticipate what kind of game it would be. After all, fighting games are indeed quite niche.</p>
<p>Although the previous promotional slogan from Nebula Games described it as an action game where players happily launch popular characters from various classic games, and even the official game website and advertising media consistently stated it was an action game, not a fighting game, players didn't pay much attention. This was because both players and industry media generally understood that this merely represented Nebula Games’ design philosophy; many games could fit such a description. For example, Souls-like games could be called level-driven, action games, or even gear-driven. If you wanted to, you could always find a reason.</p>
<p>On the day of the press conference, at Nebula Games' headquarters conference hall. This conference was incredibly hyped, as it marked Chen Xu's first offline direct presentation in many years. Major global gaming media flew in from distant lands, traveling across oceans, solely to experience this game called Smash Bros. firsthand. Additionally, Nebula Games' official website also launched a lottery event, inviting lucky players from around the world to attend the offline direct presentation, with Nebula Games covering their round-trip airfare.</p>
<p>Major video websites and live streaming platforms had also prepared brand new live stream rooms for this new game's press conference. On gaming forums, players eagerly awaited the start of the conference with immense anticipation.</p>
<p>Soon, the press conference officially began. Accompanied by the cheers of players throughout the venue, Chen Xu approached the large screen with a microphone, and a round of enthusiastic applause immediately erupted.</p>
<p>‘Thank you very much to all the players and media friends from around the world for attending and watching this Nebula Games Direct Presentation. I believe everyone is already aware of today’s presentation content.’</p>
<p>As Chen Xu's words fell, countless in-game real-world map scenes flashed across the large screen behind him. Firelink Shrine from Dark Souls. The Great Plateau from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Riverwood from The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Midgar from Final Fantasy. One classic scene after another was displayed before everyone. In addition, a series of classic IP characters like Link, Cloud, and the Undead appeared, most of the content flashing by before quickly switching.</p>
<p>The reporters and players present occasionally let out exclamations, and the bullet comments in all the live stream rooms were frantically flooding the screen.</p>
<p>‘Holy cow! The level of recreation is so high!’</p>
<p>‘How did they do this? They're clearly different art styles, but it doesn't feel out of place at all!’</p>
<p>Many players and industry media alike were amazed.</p>
<p>Scene after scene of game maps flashed by. The large screen behind Chen Xu plunged into darkness, then suddenly burst forth with light. The theme song 'Lifelight' resonated, and the Smash Bros. Logo appeared on the screen, once again eliciting cheers from the entire venue.</p>
<p>‘This is a unique action game, and here, I will briefly explain to everyone just how special it is!’</p>
<p>Looking at the crowd below, Chen Xu slowly began to speak, a brilliant smile on his face.</p>
