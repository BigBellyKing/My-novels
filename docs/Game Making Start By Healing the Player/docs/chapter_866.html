                <h2>Chapter 865: Direct Presentation</h2>
<h2>Chapter 865: Direct Presentation</h2>
<p>As the nearly three-minute-long promotional video came to an end, it immediately exploded like a bomb dropped into a lake, sending shockwaves through the player community.</p>
<p>All the players were extremely excited.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous short animated demonstration video,</p>
<p>this longer promotional animation, although it didn't showcase the game's gameplay or core content,</p>
<p>still delivered the most direct and stunning surprise to players.</p>
<p>That surprise was the countless popular game characters appearing in the game.</p>
<p>Ever since this project was first revealed, it had already attracted widespread attention from players.</p>
<p>On one hand, players were astonished that Nebula Games was actually making a fighting game.</p>
<p>But even more attention was focused on the fact that Nebula Games had gathered characters from various major IPs into a single game.</p>
<p>The crossover of different characters and the collaboration between IPs—</p>
<p>and not limited only to IP characters under Nebula Games—was truly mind-blowing.</p>
<p>Pure IP crossovers weren't rare in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>For example, in World of Warcraft, there were Easter eggs featuring Cloud and Aerith from Final Fantasy, and Link from Breath of the Wild.</p>
<p>But these crossovers were merely Easter eggs, not actual core game content.</p>
<p>Speaking of actual game content, when Nebula Games developed The Witcher: Wild Hunt and World of Warcraft, they added hunting quests for monsters like the Leshen and the Frost Dragon into Monster Hunter: World.</p>
<p>Yet these additions weren't central to the game's core—they were just bonus features.</p>
<p>But this new action game titled Super Smash Bros. was clearly built around characters from different IPs, creating an entirely new gaming experience.</p>
<p>All the classic characters cherished by players gathered together, fighting in the same world—just imagining it sent countless players into a frenzy.</p>
<p>'So many familiar IP characters! This is insane! Just seeing these characters is irresistible!'</p>
<p>'Hey, did you guys notice the details? The Undead used invincible rolling to survive on the ground for a full second!'</p>
<p>'LOL I noticed that too! The Undead dodged the attack with Invincibility Frames, and Mario used a Super Star to avoid it!'</p>
<p>'Looks like my big Link still reigns supreme! Everyone else who lasted a second used an invincibility skill, but my big Link blocked with a shield first before getting finished!'</p>
<p>'But I wonder what the game's background and story content will be like!'</p>
<p>'Fighting games don't need any background or story, come on! Haven't you played fighting games? The story is just the tutorial mode!'</p>
<p>'Not necessarily! This is Nebula Games we're talking about!'</p>
<p>'Don't say that! Haven't you noticed? Those eerie Master Hands—could they be a metaphor for us players cutting our hands off to buy the game?'</p>
<p>'You're a genius! If that's the case, then the mysterious幕后 villain Galeem at the end, sealing heroes into plaster—could that represent figurines?'</p>
<p>'It's not impossible! So if you truly love game characters, start by refusing to buy figurines. No purchase, no harm—every figurine you buy means another character has suffered cruelty!'</p>
<p>'You guys have gone too far! I don't believe you'll actually be able to restrain yourselves when the time comes!'</p>
<p>'Of course I can restrain myself—because I'm poor! (smug.jpg)'</p>
<p>However, while ordinary players focused on these aspects, the gaming media paid attention to something else entirely.</p>
<p>That was the fact that Nebula Games was actually holding an offline launch event.</p>
<p>Everyone knew that in the early days, when Nebula Games hadn't yet reached its current scale, they occasionally held offline events to promote their games.</p>
<p>But ever since Nebula Games rose to become a top-tier game developer, similar offline Direct Presentation Launch Events rarely featured Chen Xu in person.</p>
<p>For example, for Elden Ring, Chen Xu had only hosted an online Direct presentation.</p>
<p>Yet now, for this game Super Smash Bros., the promotional trailer directly announced the time of the Direct Presentation, and it seemed highly likely that Chen Xu himself would host it—clearly showing how much importance they placed on this game.</p>
<p>This genuinely made many players excited, wondering just what kind of game this truly was.</p>
<p>After all, fighting games were really too niche.</p>
<p>Although in previous promotional slogans, Nebula Games had described it as a fun action game where you joyfully knock back beloved characters from classic games—and even on the official website and through advertising media, they consistently referred to it as an action game rather than a fighting game—</p>
<p>it didn't really make players pay more attention.</p>
<p>Because both players and gaming media generally understood that this likely just reflected Nebula Games' design philosophy—many games could be labeled this way.</p>
<p>For example, Souls-like games could be described as level-driven, action games, or even gear-driven.</p>
<p>If you wanted to, you could always find a justification.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>On the day of the launch event, in the conference hall at Nebula Games' headquarters.</p>
<p>This launch event was incredibly popular—after all, it was the first time in many years that Chen Xu was hosting an offline Direct Presentation.</p>
<p>Major gaming media outlets from around the world had traveled long distances by plane across oceans just to experience this game Super Smash Bros. in person. Meanwhile, Nebula Games' official website had launched a lottery event, inviting lucky players from around the globe to attend the offline Direct Presentation, with Nebula Games covering round-trip airfare.</p>
<p>Major video websites and live streaming platforms had also prepared special live stream rooms for this new game launch.</p>
<p>On gaming forums, players eagerly waited for the launch event to begin.</p>
<p>Soon, the launch event officially started.</p>
<p>Amid thunderous cheers from the audience, Chen Xu stepped onto the stage, microphone in hand, and the hall erupted in enthusiastic applause.</p>
<p>'Thank you very much to players and media friends from around the world for coming to attend and watch this Nebula Games Direct Presentation. I believe everyone already has some idea about today's content.'</p>
<p>As Chen Xu finished speaking, the large screen behind him flashed with countless scenes of in-game footage.</p>
<p>The Firelink Shrine from Dark Souls.</p>
<p>The Great Plateau from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</p>
<p>Riverwood from The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.</p>
<p>Midgar from Final Fantasy.</p>
<p>One classic scene after another appeared before everyone's eyes.</p>
<p>In addition, characters like Link, Cloud, and the Undead appeared—most of them shown only briefly before quickly transitioning.</p>
<p>Reporters and players in the audience couldn't help but gasp in amazement from time to time.</p>
<p>Bullet comments in the various live stream rooms went wild with spam.</p>
<p>'Damn it! The recreation is so accurate!'</p>
<p>'How did they do this? The art styles are completely different, yet it doesn't feel immersion-breaking at all!'</p>
<p>Many players and gaming media were stunned in awe.</p>
<p>As scene after scene flashed by, the large screen behind Chen Xu went dark, then suddenly burst with light.</p>
<p>The theme song 'Lifelight' began to play, and the Super Smash Bros. Logo appeared on screen, triggering another round of cheers from the crowd.</p>
<p>'This is a unique action game. Here, I'll briefly explain just how special it really is!'</p>
<p>Looking at the audience, Chen Xu began to speak with a bright smile.</p>
