<p>Chapter 282: Steady, We Can Win (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>With the launch of Warcraft, the game's popularity skyrocketed.</p>
<p>After all, Warcraft was excellent in every aspect.</p>
<p>Whether it was graphics, story, or Gameplay, it gave players a sense of novelty and awe.</p>
<p>Alongside the rising popularity, sales figures were also climbing.</p>
<p>Especially overseas, Warcraft, though debuting a week later than in the domestic market, still caused quite a sensation.</p>
<p>The production quality was simply too superb—no RTS title, either overseas or domestic, had ever reached the level of Warcraft.</p>
<p>As for sales, Warcraft had already broken even within its first week.</p>
<p>Many designers in the gaming industry watched in astonishment and envy.</p>
<p>Of course, while they envied and were shocked, few designers or Game developers had the courage to attempt something similar.</p>
<p>After all, Warcraft had succeeded—but what if it had failed?</p>
<p>High risk, high reward, but the risk was simply too great. For many game developers, failure would mean utter ruin.</p>
<p>During the period following Warcraft's launch, the RTS market echoed with only one name.</p>
<p>Both players and media showered the game with praise.</p>
<p>Reviews from gaming media and player consensus alike remained around 9.5 out of 10.</p>

<p>'A Simple Analysis of Arthas's Character Transformation and Jaina's Mental Journey'</p>
<p>Countless news articles and online topics revolved around Warcraft.</p>
<p>Discussions covered its sales performance, game quality, and content.</p>
<p>For a time, Warcraft stood unmatched in popularity.</p>
<p>In stark contrast to Warcraft's triumph, Hero Entertainment's Human Wars appeared somewhat pitiful.</p>
<p>A week after Warcraft launched, Human Wars reluctantly released an update announcing a free overhaul.</p>
<p>Originally, this should have been good news.</p>
<p>Previously, Human Wars had promised a free overhaul, offering players improved visual presentation and updated content.</p>
<p>Considering Human Wars had been the top domestic RTS title before Warcraft's arrival, many players were excited and full of anticipation.</p>
<p>But that was before—now, the situation was entirely different.</p>
<p>Back then, everything was just words. No one could tell who was truly awesome and who was merely bragging.</p>
<p>But now, Warcraft's quality had been revealed.</p>
<p>In comparison, the visual improvements in Human Wars' overhaul looked downright pitiful.</p>
<p>Granted, it was a definite improvement over the old version, with noticeable refinements in details.</p>
<p>But the problem was, players' standards had already been raised significantly by Warcraft.</p>
<p>Not only were the CG animations superb, but the Modeling in Warcraft itself was also exquisite.</p>
<p>When faced with Human Wars' overhaul, most players instinctively compared it to Warcraft.</p>
<p>And that comparison sparked disaster.</p>
<p>"It's free, sure, but honestly, if you don't want to overhaul it, just don't."</p>
<p>"The higher the expectations, the greater the disappointment. What is this? Compared to Warcraft, it's nothing but deformed!"</p>
<p>"To be fair, Human Wars' overhaul is actually quite good. It embraces a nostalgic style—I felt that same excitement I had five years ago when I first played the game. Thanks, Human Wars, for bringing back childhood memories!"</p>
<p>"Seriously, just release a new version already. If you keep dragging this out, I think I'll never play Human Wars again."</p>
<p>"+1. Warcraft's multiplayer versus is super fun too! By the way, can someone please tell Human Wars: 'I can't go back, so don't look for me; I'm afraid Warcraft might misunderstand'?"</p>
<p>Online feedback poured in. Even fans of Human Wars had to admit that its quality had been utterly surpassed by Warcraft.</p>
<p>The reason players reacted so strongly was largely due to Human Wars' overly boastful attitude.</p>
<p>Many players had assumed Human Wars was preparing for an Imperial City PK against Warcraft.</p>
<p>Then Warcraft's quality emerged, delivering an overwhelming impression and subconsciously raising expectations for Human Wars.</p>
<p>But once Human Wars actually revealed its updates, those expectations crashed into the abyss.</p>
<p>Inside Hero Entertainment, Zhou Qi sat feeling utterly helpless.</p>
<p>Did he not know their quality was inferior?</p>
<p>But they had already done the work, and it was indeed an improvement. Could they really just stay silent and feigning death?</p>
<p>As for a full new version?</p>
<p>In RTS games, even a minor Numerical Design change could drastically impact game balance. Introducing new units required extensive testing—such changes couldn't be rushed!</p>
<p>"Human Wars feels like it's completely lost," sighed Yang Hong, President of Hero Entertainment, in his office.</p>
<p>On his desk stood a row of figurines: Tyrande Whisperwind, Sylvanas Windrunner, Illidan's fangirl Lady Vashj, and Maiev Shadowsong. Why no Jaina? Because he didn't like her.</p>
<p>Hearing Yang Hong's words, Zhou Qi glanced at the figurines on his desk, hesitating as if he wanted to speak.</p>
<p>Right now, he desperately wanted to shout, "We are ready to fight to the death, why do you surrender first, boss!"—even though he himself had registered an account on the Nebula Games Platform, purchased a copy of Warcraft, and logged over 30 hours of playtime.</p>
<p>"We've lost half the battle, but not completely," Zhou Qi said, taking a deep breath.</p>
<p>"Hmm?" Yang Hong turned to look at him.</p>
<p>Though he secretly played Warcraft himself, that didn't mean he didn't want to win.</p>
<p>After all, Warcraft was a competitor's game!</p>
<p>"In terms of quality, we're inferior. In story and Gameplay innovation, we're also behind..." Zhou Qi paused, slightly awkward. "But I'll say it again—balance is what matters most in RTS. Warcraft has only just launched. Players are still in the exploration phase, unfamiliar with its mechanics and Gameplay."</p>
<p>"Once players fully understand how the game works, balance issues will inevitably spark controversy. That will be Human Wars' opportunity! We must emphasize RTS's competitive nature and fairness!" Zhou Qi's voice grew stronger.</p>
<p>Yes, their quality couldn't match up.</p>
<p>Their Gameplay wasn't as innovative.</p>
<p>For ordinary players, Warcraft's attraction completely surpassed Human Wars.</p>
<p>But this was an RTS game!</p>
<p>And Human Wars had one major advantage: exceptional balance.</p>
<p>In the past, other RTS titles had attempted to challenge Human Wars' dominance.</p>
<p>Yet, in the end, Human Wars always emerged victorious. Why?</p>
<p>Because of its impeccable balance!</p>
<p>Though Warcraft was an incredibly dark horse, there was still a chance.</p>
<p>And once balance issues arose, fixing them would take time.</p>
<p>Especially in a richly mechanized RTS like Warcraft, where balance problems could trigger chain reactions across the entire system.</p>
<p>This gap period would be the critical window for Human Wars to turn defeat into victory.</p>
<p>Steady, We Can Win!</p>
