                <p>Chapter 513: Geralt of Rivia (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Though a small-scale game, <code>Hades</code>, launched after <code>Bloodborne</code>, with its exhilarating gameplay and action experience, has become a favorite among many players.</p>
<p>Especially the diverse playstyles and game content combinations have left many players astonished.</p>
<p>It could be said that <code>Hades</code> allowed players from all walks of life to experience its fun.</p>
<p>Similar to <code>Bloodborne</code>, if one is a novice, it's actually quite difficult to find enjoyment in the game.</p>
<p>But <code>Hades</code> is different.</p>
<p>As long as luck is good enough, and a player manages to assemble a powerful build, they don't need much skill to effortlessly achieve a <code>Musou</code> style of clearing. </p>
<p>And if luck isn't so good, it doesn't matter. For example, with the two guaranteed <code>tool hammers</code> and the choice of one out of three <code>Gods' Blessings</code>, players still have certain strategic combinations. </p>
<p>Even without luck or strategy, players can compensate with skill, constantly dodging the bullet-hell attacks unleashed by monsters in the game. Truly skilled masters can complete a run without taking any damage. </p>
<p>Of course, if you have neither skill, luck, nor strategy, the game also offers a <code>God Mode</code>.</p>
<p>Initially, many players thought <code>Hades</code> was a <code>grind-heavy</code>, <code>randomized</code> game.</p>
<p>But as players delved into the game's <code>story</code>, they quickly discovered something different.</p>
<p>Namely, the game's <code>plot</code> and character relationships were incredibly rich.</p>
<p>The simplest and most direct example is that, within the same save file, as the player progresses, almost every dialogue trigger with various <code>NPCs</code> is different.</p>
<p>Moreover, by gifting the appropriate <code>nectar</code> in the game and unlocking <code>favorability</code> with each character, players can trigger some special events.</p>
<p>Many players online were also discussing the <code>plot</code> and <code>NPC</code> content.</p>
<p>“By the way, does anyone know why Nyx fired Dusa? I just maxed out Dusa’s <code>favorability</code> and got her doll!”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, <code>bro</code> above, Dusa will be back in a couple of days, and she even got a promotion and a raise!”</p>
<p>“2333333, doesn’t anyone like Megaera? After maxing out her <code>favorability</code>, the <code>whip play</code> after <code>confessing</code> is simply irresistible!”</p>
<p>“There’s no <code>whip play</code>! That’s just your imagination!”</p>
<p>“So this game is great in every way, but my <code>liver</code> is almost gone! And the <code>plot</code> of this damn game, you can’t just clear it once, you have to clear it <code>N</code> times! Every time <code>Prince of the Underworld</code> meets his old mom, he can only get a tiny bit of information!”</p>
<p>“+1, I think Mr. Chen not only wants our <code>money</code>, but also our <code>lives</code> with this game! It’s too <code>grindy</code>!”</p>
<p>With the launch of <code>Hades</code>, it wasn't just players who were discussing it; many <code>industry designers</code> were also paying attention to this game.</p>
<p>Because this game was very different from Chen Xu’s previous developments.</p>
<p>Top-tier games like <code>Bloodborne</code> were difficult for many <code>industry designers</code> to learn from, even if they tried.</p>
<p>After all, it wasn't just about pure <code>design</code>; it was more about high-end <code>IT Technology</code> in games.</p>
<p>But <code>Hades</code> was different; it focused more on <code>Gameplay</code>, and it was inherently a <code>small-scale, low-cost game</code>.</p>
<p>Chen Xu’s previous works often combined gameplay direction with <code>industrial</code> production, but this time, many felt it was a return to the <code>Don't Starve</code> and <code>It Takes Two</code> model.</p>
<p>Many <code>game designers</code> online were also researching the content of this <code>randomized</code> gameplay.</p>
<p>However, for Chen Xu, he wasn’t overly concerned with this aspect, as the production of <code>Hades</code> was just a minor interlude.</p>
<p>On one hand, it was to fill a <code>game gap</code> on <code>Switch</code>; on the other hand, it was to look after the players’ well-being.</p>
<p>After all, having experienced the double blow of <code>Bloodborne</code> and <code>Resident Evil</code>, Chen Xu was quite concerned about players’ <code>mental health</code>.</p>
<p>That’s why he developed such a game to help players <code>de-stress</code>.</p>
<p>Yes, that was indeed his original intention.</p>
<p>As for any <code>negative impact</code>, that was another matter entirely.</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>In the <code>Nebula Games</code> <code>lounge</code>, <code>Yang Xin</code>, <code>Ruan Ningxue</code>, and a group of other <code>old employees</code> were all lounging in chairs, holding their <code>Switch</code> consoles.</p>
<p>But their expressions showed a myriad of emotions.</p>
<p><code>Ruan Ningxue</code> repeatedly entered rooms, mainly to <code>collect nectar</code> to unlock <code>NPC</code> <code>plot</code>.</p>
<p><code>Qin Yi</code> and <code>Meng Zuo</code> were researching various <code>routines</code> and combinations.</p>
<p>As for <code>Yang Xin</code>, she was looking despairingly at her deleted weapon effects.</p>
<p>Before the <code>Cerberus</code> on the fourth floor, the <code>shop</code> would randomly offer a special <code>hammer</code>.</p>
<p>This <code>hammer</code>’s effect was to delete one <code>skill</code> and randomly gain two special skills.</p>
<p>Originally, her <code>skill</code> set was a <code>cruel strike</code> and <code>rapid slash</code> <code>healing playstyle</code>. She wanted to be <code>greedy</code> because she felt that even with one less of <code>cruel strike</code> or <code>rapid slash</code>, clearing the <code>levels</code> wouldn't be a big problem.</p>
<p>If she could randomly get <code>super armor penetration</code>, her <code>damage</code> would <code>explode</code>!</p>
<p>As a result, <code>cruel strike</code> remained, but <code>rapid slash</code> turned into <code>super critical</code> and <code>double critical</code>.</p>
<p>These two were <code>special attack</code> playstyles, but she had been playing a <code>basic attack</code> playstyle all along.</p>
<p>At this point, her head felt a little dizzy; she had spent <code>money</code>, but her <code>combat prowess</code> had not increased, but actually decreased!</p>
<p>Two minutes later, amidst Hades’ taunts, <code>Yang Xin</code> silently turned off her <code>Switch</code>.</p>
<p>“Haha, Sister Xin, did you lose your gamble again?” <code>Ruan Ningxue</code> noticed <code>Yang Xin</code>’s actions and burst into laughter.</p>
<p>At the same time, <code>Qin Yi</code> and others also glanced over.</p>
<p>“No, I’m just a little tired of playing. And isn’t it better to use this time to read a book and supplement my knowledge?” <code>Yang Xin</code> said, quietly picking up a novel.</p>
<p><code>Ruan Ningxue</code> said nothing, just smirked at <code>Yang Xin</code>.</p>
<p>Holding the book and seeing <code>Ruan Ningxue</code> staring at her, <code>Yang Xin</code> finally couldn't sit still. Just as she was about to say something, she suddenly stood up as if she had seen a savior: “Mr. Chen, what do you have in your hand?”</p>
<p>Looking at <code>Chen Xu</code> walking over with a paper bag, <code>Yang Xin</code> was a little curious.</p>
<p>Not just <code>Yang Xin</code>, everyone else also put down what they were holding and gathered around.</p>
<p>“To supplement your knowledge. Call the people from the <code>screenwriting team</code> and <code>Art Team</code> too,” <code>Chen Xu</code> said with a smile.</p>
<p>Of course, not all employees were called, but some <code>core design</code> employees.</p>
<p>When everyone had arrived, <code>Chen Xu</code> took out the contents of the paper bag, which were all exquisitely packaged books.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, what are these? <code>Slavic Mythology</code>? <code>Vampires</code>? <code>A Compendium of Medieval Peasant Life</code>? <code>Ancient Norse Village Style</code>?” Everyone was a bit stunned looking at the books in <code>Chen Xu</code>’s hands.</p>
<p>But soon, everyone suddenly realized something.</p>
<p>This posture, could it be that he was going to develop a <code>new work</code>?</p>
<p>Seeing everyone’s expressions, <code>Chen Xu</code> didn’t keep them in suspense and nodded with a smile.</p>
<p>“A vast fantasy world, filled with countless strange creatures: immortal <code>High Vampires</code>, ferocious <code>Griffins</code>, xenophobic <code>Humans</code>, <code>sorcerers</code> with unique powers, as well as <code>elves</code> and <code>dwarves</code>, and so on.”</p>
<p>“The reason this world has so many different creatures is a peculiar natural phenomenon called the <code>Conjunction of the Spheres</code>. Different <code>worlds</code> would collide at specific times, causing many creatures from various <code>worlds</code> to cross over into one. </p>
<p><code>Humans</code>, with their powerful reproductive capabilities and adaptability to the environment, quickly became the most dominant <code>race</code> on the continent. However, because there were too many <code>monsters</code> in the world, <code>Witchers</code>, who hunt these monsters, were born. Unlike <code>sorcerers</code> who possess innate magical talent, <code>Witchers</code> are <code>humans</code> transformed by <code>magic potions</code>. They possess extraordinary <code>lifespan</code> and <code>perceptive abilities</code>, and can use <code>Signs</code> to briefly employ <code>magical powers</code>. <code>Witchers</code> carry two weapons: a <code>steel sword</code> and a <code>silver sword</code>, to deal with different <code>monsters</code> and <code>enemies</code>.</p>
<p><code>Witchers</code> belong to no country or faction, traveling the world and earning a living by <code>bounty hunting monsters</code>. Of course, just as <code>humans</code> are divided into different regions and countries, <code>Witchers</code> are also divided into different <code>schools</code> based on their areas of expertise. But one thing is common: <code>Witchers</code> are also ostracized and given cold shoulders due to their non-human characteristics. As for the story we will develop next, it will revolve around a <code>Wolf School Witcher</code> named <code>Geralt of Rivia</code>.”</p>
