<h2>Chapter 34: What Do the Paper Bunnies Represent?</h2>
<p>As Dong Zhen progressed, Johnny's memories shifted from old age to middle age.</p>
<p>Johnny stood by Liva's window. At this point, Liva was critically ill, the platypus plushie beside her on the bed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the floor was filled with countless origami bunnies.</p>
<p>"Just enough. Even after paying the surgery fees, the remaining money is exactly sufficient... So, don't worry," Johnny said to Liva.</p>
<p>But Liva just looked at Johnny: "A white lie... You think this is a white lie, right?"</p>
<p>"No, I've calculated it. I'm certain we have exactly..." Johnny tried to explain but was interrupted.</p>
<p>"Don't say it... I don't like it when you lie."</p>
<p>"I've calculated our assets. I understand the actual situation."</p>
<p>"Why do you want to persuade me to go against my own will?"</p>
<p>Liva looked deeply saddened.</p>
<p>Johnny, on the other hand, grew somewhat agitated: "We need that money for your medical expenses, Liva!"</p>
<p>"I understand that Anja is very important to you, but this... this is just too absurd!"</p>
<p>"I mean, she isn't even..."</p>
<p>Liva interrupted again: "Do you know what would make me happy?"</p>
<p>As Liva and Johnny conversed, Dong Zhen and the audience in the live stream room finally understood what Anja truly was.</p>
<p>From previous memory fragments, it was known from Johnny's words that Anja was something extremely important to Liva.</p>
<p>But what exactly it was remained completely unclear.</p>
<p>Initially, Dong Zhen guessed it was the platypus plushie, but now he had a new hypothesis.</p>
<p>The one named Anja was neither the platypus nor a person—it might be the lighthouse perched on the cliff.</p>
<p>Liva might have originally been curable, yet she insisted Johnny use the money meant for her treatment to build a house and watch over the lighthouse, claiming this would bring her happiness.</p>
<p>"What the heck? Are you throwing your life away? A house with a view of the lighthouse is more important than your life!?"</p>
<p>Dong Zhen felt his head filled with questions.</p>
<p>There were far too many doubts swirling in his mind.</p>
<p>At this moment in the game, Liva handed a paper bunny to Johnny.</p>
<p>It was that blue-and-yellow one, the one with two distinct colors.</p>
<p>"What is this?" Liva looked at Johnny, asking with hopeful eyes.</p>
<p>Johnny was slightly taken aback but still replied: "It's a bunny, just like the ones you've made before."</p>
<p>"And then?" Liva continued.</p>
<p>"Then... uh..." Johnny seemed at a loss: "Well, it's made of paper."</p>
<p>"Anything else?"</p>
<p>"Its body is yellow, and the other parts are blue."</p>
<p>"Good, anything else?"</p>
<p>Liva appeared extremely eager.</p>
<p>But Johnny had absolutely no idea what Liva was trying to convey, so he changed the subject, saying he had composed a song and wanted to play it for her.</p>
<p>That song was the earlier one—<em>To Liva</em>.</p>
<p>In response, Liva chuckled and teased him, saying the title was so cheesy.</p>
<p>The memory timeline advanced further. At this point, Johnny was deep in distress.</p>
<p>He faced a dilemma: should he treat Liva, or continue building the house by the lighthouse—Liva's heartfelt wish?</p>
<p>The Johnny in the game agonized over this decision, but Dong Zhen, the audience in the live stream room, and the characters Neil and Eva within the game all knew that in the end, Johnny followed Liva's wishes.</p>
<p>But why!?</p>
<p>From Johnny's conversations with his friends Isabelle and Nicolas, many crucial details emerged.</p>
<p>Anja was indeed the lighthouse on the cliff, just as Dong Zhen had suspected.</p>
<p>Moreover, this lighthouse was also the place where Liva and Johnny got married.</p>
<p>But it still made no sense!</p>
<p>Why was Liva so obsessed with this lighthouse?</p>
<p>Furthermore, from their dialogues, another key piece of information emerged:</p>
<p>Liva likely suffered from a certain illness, and the origami bunnies seemed to be a manifestation of her condition.</p>
<p>But why was Liva so fixated on that lighthouse?</p>
<p>And what did the paper bunnies truly signify?</p>
<p>"What the heck, I just can't figure it out!" Dong Zhen's face was full of confusion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, bullet comments in the live stream room kept flooding the screen.</p>
<p>"My monkey brain can't handle this."</p>
<p>"CPU overload!"</p>
<p>"Seriously, what do these paper bunnies symbolize?"</p>
<p>"This game feels seriously messed up!"</p>
<p>"Hurry up, bro, push the story forward!"</p>
<p>"+1, I feel like I know what happens next!"</p>
<p>Clearly, the audience in the live stream room was equally curious about the game's upcoming developments.</p>
<p>They all wanted to see how the game would ultimately provide answers to these questions.</p>
<p>With each advancement through the memories, Johnny and Liva grew progressively younger.</p>
<p>At one point, the two shared a romantic embrace beneath the lighthouse named Anja, their hearts filled with hope for the future.</p>
<p>Yet the one thing that remained puzzling was that Liva continued folding paper bunnies, repeatedly holding up the blue-and-yellow one to Johnny and asking: "What is this?"</p>
<p>Recalling that even when gravely ill, Liva kept pressing Johnny with this same question.</p>
<p>It only deepened the mystery.</p>
<p>"So, what do these bunnies represent!?"</p>
<p>"What the heck, I'm suffering!"</p>
<p>Dong Zhen scratched his head frantically, clearly tormented by curiosity.</p>
<p>And what kind of illness did Liva actually have?</p>
<p>Countless questions swirled in his mind.</p>
<p>Next, conversations with Nicolas and Isabelle revealed even more about Liva.</p>
<p>Isabelle, it turned out, suffered from the same illness as Liva.</p>
<p>This condition was the reason Liva's speech appeared so peculiar, even chaotic, making it difficult to grasp what she truly wanted to express.</p>
<p>"So Liva has a disorder that prevents her from clearly expressing herself, along with social impairments?"</p>
<p>Upon realizing this, Dong Zhen began speculating in his mind.</p>
<p>With this explanation, Liva's previous odd behaviors could now be understood.</p>
<p>Why she kept asking Johnny about the bunny, why she made Johnny throw sandbags toward Anja, then stood dangerously close to the cliff's edge to watch.</p>
<p>All of it made sense now.</p>
<p>Because Liva, suffering from a mental condition, couldn't clearly articulate her thoughts. She could only hint at her inner desires indirectly.</p>
<p>But understanding this only brought new questions.</p>
<p>What did the bunny truly represent? And why was Liva so deeply attached to the lighthouse named Anja, even willing to sacrifice her life for it?</p>
<p>Was it simply because it was the place where she and Johnny got married?</p>
<p>That still didn't add up!</p>
