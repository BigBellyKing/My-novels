                <h2>Chapter 59: The Sales of <em>Outlast</em></h2>
<p>On live streaming platforms, video platforms, and across major player communities, the popularity of <em>Outlast</em> continues to soar.</p>
<p>Even various media websites have gradually released their review scores for <em>Outlast</em>.</p>
<p>In terms of media reviews, the scores were uniformly around 8.5. Player reviews, on the other hand, averaged approximately 9.1.</p>
<p>This was actually the lowest score among the three games Nebula Games had developed so far.</p>
<p>Of course, <em>Mirror (Game)</em> wasn't included in this comparison.</p>
<p>However, in terms of popularity, <em>Outlast</em> was entirely different from the other two games.</p>
<p><em>Undertale</em> had the merit of pioneering the meta-game genre and could barely be considered a trailblazer, so its high popularity was understandable.</p>
<p><em>To the Moon</em> had attracted massive attention due to the Sci-Fi Game Design Competition.</p>
<p>Moreover, the earlier two games had also drawn significant online attention because of Chen Xu's public debates on the internet.</p>
<p>In contrast, if we set aside these factors, <em>Outlast</em> actually generated even more discussion topics, and it was also the fastest-spreading game among all of them.</p>
<p>Still, <em>Mirror (Game)</em> remained excluded—after all, the combat prowess of gentlemen was forever unknown.</p>
<p>But compared to the popularity of <em>Outlast</em>, its sales figures sparked heated discussions among many industry designers.</p>
<p>Only Chen Xu knew the true sales numbers of <em>Outlast</em>, but third-party institutions had also conducted their own statistics.</p>
<p>According to data released by these third-party institutions, <em>Outlast</em>, which had been launched for a week, had sold approximately 250,000 copies.</p>
<p>Judging purely by sales volume, this number was not low at all.</p>
<p>Before <em>Outlast</em>, the horror game with the highest weekly sales was an old IP, which had sold 120,000 copies weekly.</p>
<p>Of course, that game was priced as high as 149 Yuan.</p>
<p>It also had support from a loyal fanbase and nostalgic sentiment.</p>
<p>But the key point was that <em>Outlast</em> had such immense popularity, making it the most sensational horror game in recent years.</p>
<p>Yet it only achieved these sales figures.</p>
<p>This naturally caused industry designers to discuss animatedly.</p>
<p>'Chen Xu really made a miscalculation this time! <em>Outlast</em> has such high popularity, yet the sales are so low.'</p>
<p>'Yeah, it can't compare to <em>Undertale</em> or <em>To the Moon</em> back then.'</p>
<p>'No choice— the horror game market is simply too small.'</p>
<p>'I really can't understand why Chen Xu would choose to make <em>Outlast</em>.'</p>
<p>'Exactly, why would Chen Xu choose to enter the horror game genre?'</p>
<p>'Right. Making horror games is really thankless work. I thought Chen Xu would continue making games like <em>To the Moon</em> and <em>Undertale</em>.'</p>
<p>'Maybe he wanted to challenge high-development-cost games, but since the traditional RPG field is too competitive, he had no choice but to go for the horror genre?'</p>
<p>In a game industry forum, a group of designers posted threads discussing Chen Xu and <em>Outlast</em>.</p>
<p>Just as their discussion was reaching its peak, a single message instantly left them speechless.</p>
<p>'Weekly sales of 250,000 units, and priced at 65 Yuan—<em>Outlast</em> has already completely recouped its development costs! And given the current popularity and player feedback, reaching a million sales shouldn't be difficult, right? In that case, Nebula Games' gross revenue from this game might surpass 100 million Yuan!'</p>
<p>Instantly, the designers discussing the topic fell silent.</p>
<p>Who was this person?</p>
<p>Didn't they have any situational awareness?</p>
<p>As game designers, didn't they know <em>Outlast</em> was already a highly successful horror game?</p>
<p>They just wanted to boast a little, to express that Chen Xu and Nebula Games weren't all that impressive.</p>
<p>Who was this guy? So lacking in situational awareness?</p>
<p>…………………</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games' office, Chen Xu leaned back on the sofa, put down his phone, and looked at the UI interface in front of him with a regretful expression.</p>
<p>The effect of the special item he had previously obtained had been confirmed: the 6 million points labeled on it referred to the converted number, not the pre-conversion value.</p>
<p>Of course, even so, 6 million points—equivalent to fifty consecutive pulls—was still a substantial gain.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, once the point conversion from the card reached its ceiling, the accumulation speed immediately slowed down.</p>
<p>It was even a bit worse than <em>To the Moon</em>.</p>
<p>After providing the initial 6 million points, he hadn't even saved up enough for a single ten-pull since, and that was with continued contributions from <em>To the Moon</em> and <em>Undertale</em>.</p>
<p>This was exactly why Chen Xu had decided to go for a sixty-pull.</p>
<p>Underperforming!</p>
<p>Because of this, Chen Xu also took some time to reflect and summarize.</p>
<p>Finally, he reached a conclusion.</p>
<p>He had harvested the leeks too aggressively.</p>
<p>Fear emotions provided points very powerfully.</p>
<p>But the key was, players had to dare to play the game.</p>
<p>Now, what was happening?</p>
<p>A large number of players who bought the game had requested refunds, and many others had entered the game only to wander around the entrance of the asylum before immediately quitting.</p>
<p>How could such players generate fear?</p>
<p>In the end, <em>Outlast</em> was simply too scary.</p>
<p>'Miscalculation!' Chen Xu couldn't help but sigh.</p>
<p>Originally, he had hoped that with <em>Outlast</em> and the 【Fear Converter】, he wouldn't necessarily get rich quickly in one go, but at least achieve sudden wealth.</p>
<p>But judging by the current trend, results were proving difficult to yield.</p>
<p>Never mind, he might as well just spend all these points now.</p>
<p>Getting up from the chair, Chen Xu first went to the restroom, then returned.</p>
<p>First, he drew the curtains shut, then turned off the computer display.</p>
<p>Gacha pulls required a certain sense of ceremony.</p>
<p>As the points were consumed, golden light shimmered before Chen Xu's eyes.</p>
<p>After a while, when all the points were exhausted, Chen Xu fell into silence.</p>
<p>Terrible luck!</p>
<p>Fifty consecutive pulls, and none of the special items like the 【Fear Converter】 appeared. Instead, he got quite a few Memory Capsules.</p>
<p>As for skill books, he only obtained two Rare Skill Books—one for Level Design and one for Numerical Design.</p>
<p>He had even washed his hands before going to the restroom!</p>
<p>Final loot: Art Concept Art: 17 books, Level Design: 11 books, System and Numerical Planning: 9 books, Story Interaction: 3 books, Music and Sound Effects: 3 books, Camera Work: 4 books.</p>
<p>The rest were all Memory Capsules.</p>
<p>Chen Xu temporarily stored the Memory Capsules in his item inventory.</p>
<p>He'd keep them for later use when developing a new game.</p>
<p>After all, he had used quite a few of these before, and he had to admit—the effect was genuinely good.</p>
<p>As for the remaining skill books, he decided to use them all up immediately.</p>
<p>After all, keeping them wouldn't make them bear offspring and earn interest. Otherwise, he might have considered saving them.</p>
<p>'But next, I really need to consider a new direction.'</p>
<p>Leaning back in his chair, Chen Xu began to ponder.</p>
<p>In terms of money, <em>Outlast</em> had also brought in substantial profits.</p>
<p>Though the capital currently available wasn't huge, it was sufficient.</p>
<p>The real issue was the company's future planning, time management, and the operation of new projects and platforms.</p>
<p>Scrolling through recent news from the gaming industry on his phone, Chen Xu contemplated his next steps.</p>
