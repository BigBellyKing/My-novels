<p>Chapter 252: The Players' Strong Demand (Sixth update, please subscribe)</p>
<p>Staring at the prompt in front of him, Zhang Yi then watched as the game automatically exited and returned to the initial UI interface.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was completely bewildered.</p>
<p>Just when the game was getting exciting, it ended?</p>
<p>Although it was just a demo version, it was way too short!</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was utterly speechless. This abrupt ending was way too much!</p>
<p>The story wasn't such a big deal.</p>
<p>Honestly, so far, Zhang Yi hadn't paid much attention to the story of Monster Hunter: World.</p>
<p>So far, he only knew a few things: Elder Dragons were migrating, the Hunter's Guild had come to investigate the secrets behind it, and while a research team arrived every ten years, it had already been fifty years since the protagonist's team arrived.</p>
<p>The Research Team Leader was the grandson of the Commander-in-Chief, who remained in the New World.</p>
<p>As for anything else?</p>
<p>He had no idea.</p>
<p>But the key point was that the first half of the trial content was mostly about teaching players the game mechanics and systems.</p>
<p>Such as combat, collecting materials, hunting methods, and weapon introductions.</p>
<p>After players understood these, they naturally wanted to go out and hunt themselves.</p>
<p>And that's exactly what the game allowed.</p>
<p>Small Jagras, Crown-crested Dragon, and Great Jagras—three different battles in a row, even including a BOSS battle.</p>
<p>In fact, this trial version offered a very complete experience.</p>
<p>But the problem was—it was just too fun!</p>
<p>Especially in combat, the game wasn't very difficult, making it easy for every player to get the hang of things.</p>
<p>At the same time, since players had just started, they weren't yet familiar with weapon skills or combo attacks.</p>
<p>After battling the Great Jagras, many players felt they had gained a deeper understanding of their chosen weapon.</p>
<p>They were eager to challenge a new monster and test their abilities.</p>
<p>But now!?</p>
<p>The key point was gone!?</p>
<p>Before long, voices from Song Ren, Wang Han, and others began appearing in the voice channel.</p>
<p>"Man, it's already over? I haven't had enough yet! I've only used Helm Breaker a few times with my Long Sword!" Song Ren said, clearly depressed.</p>
<p>"Yeah! It's way too short. I haven't even figured out my Hammer yet!" Wang Han added, equally frustrated.</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah!" Wang Yifan and Joey echoed in agreement.</p>
<p>They all shared the same feeling: just as the fun was starting, it suddenly ended.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>While Zhang Yi and the others were discussing,</p>
<p>the community forum for Monster Hunter: World was already swarmed by frustrated players.</p>
<p>There was no helping it—it was just too painful.</p>
<p>The game got cut off right at the most exciting moment.</p>
<p>Who could possibly handle that!?</p>
<p>Countless players were @-mentioning Chen Xu's official Weibo account and Nebula Games' community, all expressing the same message.</p>
<p>They hoped Monster Hunter: World could launch early. After all, judging from the demo version, the content was already quite complete.</p>
<p>And if the game weren't finished, could such a big title really undergo any transformative changes in just one week between the demo and the official launch?</p>
<p>So the answer was simple: Monster Hunter: World had already been completed.</p>
<p>Although players kept sending petitions, many of them were well aware the launch date definitely wouldn't change.</p>
<p>They were just venting their frustration.</p>
<p>Thus, the wave of excitement caused by the demo ending quickly flared up—and quickly died down.</p>
<p>What remained, however, was the discussion about the quality of the Monster Hunter: World demo.</p>
<p>Throughout the hunting process, many players said it was extremely fun and offered a strong sense of immersion.</p>
<p>For example, after getting injured, the Great Jagras wouldn't foolishly continue fighting the player.</p>
<p>Instead, it would flee.</p>
<p>If you weren't careful and let it escape, and hadn't collected enough information before, you'd need to continue investigating the clues it left behind to successfully track it down.</p>
<p>Also, throughout the game, there were many interactive environmental traps.</p>
<p>For instance, in the cave during the first hunt for Small Jagras, there were many Flashfly bugs that looked like fireflies.</p>
<p>As long as you triggered these Flashflies, any monster that directly looked at them would fall into a dazed state.</p>
<p>There were also many plants in the game.</p>
<p>Vines, for example, could entangle monsters, giving players a few seconds of free damage output.</p>
<p>In Monster Hunter: World, every creature had a unique trait.</p>
<p>Just like the game's subtitle "World" suggested,</p>
<p>it gave players a very strong sense of realism.</p>
<p>As if in some universe of a Parallel World, such a real world truly existed.</p>
<p>After killing a monster, its corpse wouldn't disappear instantly but remain in place.</p>
<p>There was also a creature called the Hatebird that would come and eat the corpses.</p>
<p>Of course, players could also capture them.</p>
<p>The New World was filled with various harvestable plants and mineable ores.</p>
<p>The novel worldview, strange creatures, and rich combat system made the game feel incredibly fresh to many players.</p>
<p>The only thing that some players were dissatisfied with was the difficulty.</p>
<p>Each quest had an extremely generous time limit of 50 minutes and allowed three Carting chances due to exhaustion.</p>
<p>But in practice, none of that seemed necessary at all.</p>
<p>As for time, the Great Jagras could generally be taken down within 30 minutes.</p>
<p>As for Carting?</p>
<p>Many players felt it was almost impossible.</p>
<p>With Palico drawing Aggro, carrying so many Potions, and the game offering unique environmental supplies—</p>
<p>like harvesting honey to make Mega Potions, honey fruits growing on vines, and Palico summoning honey bugs to deliver honey fruits—</p>
<p>it felt like dying was an incredibly difficult task.</p>
<p>Many players were left with the feeling: "I hadn't even started taking this seriously, and it's already over."</p>
<p>Because of this, many players left suggestions under Chen Xu's official Weibo account.</p>
<p>"We strongly suggest Mr. Chen increase the difficulty of Monster Hunter: World in the subsequent work."</p>
<p>"Yes! The current difficulty is way too easy!"</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, don't underestimate us! We've been tempered by Dark Souls—we're fully capable!"</p>
<p>"Exactly right!"</p>
<p>Some casual players also voiced agreement.</p>
<p>Even they felt the game's difficulty was perhaps a bit too low.</p>
<p>In response to these player suggestions, Chen Xu didn't remain silent as he had when players earlier petitioned for an earlier release.</p>
<p>This time, he gave a clear reply.</p>
<p>"Everyone, please rest assured. The difficulty balance in Monster Hunter: World has been strictly controlled by me and the development team. The difficulty will progress gradually, and as the game content advances, players will unlock new difficulties, including Tempered monsters [beings that have endured countless battles] powered by Nebula Games' latest AI technology. So whether you're a regular player or someone seeking hardcore challenges, we believe you'll find satisfaction in the New World."</p>
<p>After Chen Xu's post, many players were very satisfied.</p>
<p>But within Nebula Games, Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, and others looked at Chen Xu with slightly different expressions.</p>
<p>Technically, his statement contained no lies.</p>
<p>But the Tempered monsters and the so-called gradual progression probably had a slight deviation from what the players imagined.</p>
<p>Watching the joyful players online, Qin Yi and the others couldn't help but sigh with emotion.</p>
