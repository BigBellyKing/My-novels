                <p>Chapter 641: Is This Game Still Playable? (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>At first glance, this naked, chubby BOSS looked quite intimidating.</p>
<p>But in reality, this gatekeeper BOSS wasn't too difficult.</p>
<p>The damage output from the two Defias Sentinel sidekicks nearby wasn't particularly high either.</p>
<p>After pulling aggro, Song Ren checked the damage he was taking and immediately felt reassured.</p>
<p>Given the BOSS's attack power, it couldn't pose a life-threatening danger to him—all they needed was for the Priest to manage their mana and time their heals properly.</p>
<p>"Let's clear these two mobs first, then focus on the BOSS. That'll be safer."</p>
<p>Once the Tactics were set, Song Ren immediately used the Skill he believed best showcased the might of a warrior to pull aggro.</p>
<p>In the game, his warrior let out a furious roar and charged toward Lakzo. Mid-charge, Song Ren switched to defensive stance—this was the warrior's Charge.</p>
<p>A headlong, unstoppable advance—what a Skill that truly embodied the essence of a warrior!</p>
<p>Once he reached Lakzo, Song Ren continued by using Demoralizing Shout to apply an attack-reducing DEBUFF on both the BOSS and the mobs, then began maintaining Aggro on them.</p>
<p>Since the BOSS's two sidekicks could attack from range with their Bow and Arrows, Song Ren had to maneuver his positioning to lure them together.</p>
<p>"Wang Han, you and Old Zhang focus on damage output for now. Only heal me if Joey runs low on mana."</p>
<p>Song Ren applied Sunder Armor to the BOSS and followed up with a Heroic Strike to solidify Aggro.</p>
<p>"No problem!" Wang Han responded excitedly, immediately unleashing a flurry of attacks on the BOSS.</p>
<p>Capable of healing, dealing damage, and tanking—this was the greatness of the Alliance's Paladin Class!</p>
<p>Of course, while it sounded perfect on paper, their damage output couldn't match Rogues or Mages, their healing couldn't compete with Priests, and their tanking fell short of Protection Warriors.</p>
<p>Most players would consider the Paladin mediocre, and Wang Han had initially felt the same way—grinding levels in the wilderness was exhausting.</p>
<p>But now, she had come to appreciate it.</p>
<p>Because this was the Paladin's defining characteristic.</p>
<p>Whatever role the Team needed, she could fill it, ensuring the Team never had any glaring weaknesses.</p>
<p>When you thought about it, wasn't that the Paladin's greatest strength?</p>
<p>The spiritual symbol of the Alliance!</p>
<p>As for Wang Yifan and Zhang Yi, they had it relatively easy.</p>
<p>All they had to do was manage Aggro and then focus on dealing damage.</p>
<p>It wasn't much different from fighting regular mobs.</p>
<p>Aside from having slightly more health than the average elite monster, this BOSS didn't pose much of a threat.</p>
<p>In terms of Skills, it only had one—a Smash attack.</p>
<p>This could deal minor damage to enemies in melee range, and the only troublesome part was that it was a stun Skill, capable of incapacitating the tank for three seconds.</p>
<p>But with a healer present, as long as they kept an eye on their health, it wasn't a serious threat.</p>
<p>After putting in some effort, Song Ren's party slowly whittled the BOSS down.</p>
<p>Watching the BOSS collapse, everyone grew excited.</p>
<p>If there was one thing that brought the most joy in MMORPGs, it was looting a BOSS's corpse after defeating it.</p>
<p>"Who's going to loot the body?" Wang Han asked, staring at Lakzo's lifeless form.</p>
<p>"Ahem... AHEM!!!" Song Ren didn't say anything, but he planted himself firmly next to the BOSS's corpse, coughing loudly over voice chat.</p>
<p>"Alright, alright, stop coughing—you're going to cough out a lung. You loot it, then." Zhang Yi said, Speechless.</p>
<p>"Sigh, let's just go. With the infamous Unlucky King looting, we shouldn't expect anything from this BOSS." Zhang Yi feigned a sigh.</p>
<p>"Old Zhang, I take offense to that! I think my luck's pretty good!" Song Ren protested indignantly.</p>
<p>"Heh." Zhang Yi's response was dripping with sarcasm.</p>
<p>"If I don't get anything good this time, I won't loot any more BOSSes! I refuse to believe the first dungeon BOSS our five-man party takes down won't drop Something!" Song Ren declared confidently, stepping up to the corpse with excitement and giving it a good loot.</p>
<p>Then, a massive Hammer burst into a radiant glow as it materialized on the ground.</p>
<p>Unlike in World of Warcraft from his previous life, looted items would scatter directly from the BOSS's body, shimmering with a pickup prompt.</p>
<p>Once picked up, they would be distributed according to the Team's assignment mode.</p>
<p>However, there was one key difference: in World of Warcraft, some dungeon items were Bind on Pickup and couldn't be traded.</p>
<p>This was a somewhat player-unfriendly setting, as players who accidentally picked up gear meant for others sometimes had to contact customer support to transfer it—a hassle.</p>
<p>So Chen Xu had implemented a system allowing dungeon loot to be traded among party members within a certain timeframe.</p>
<p>At the same time, to prevent abuse—where familiar players might exploit this system to cheat strangers—he added a dedicated reporting channel, including a Censorship system involving high-reputation players.</p>
<p>"See that? This is what a Lucky King looks like! The BOSS's weapon dropped right away!"</p>
<p>"From now on, leave the looting to me. This is what a golden touch looks like!"</p>
<p>Staring at the radiant Hammer, Song Ren was ecstatic.</p>
<p>What did this mean?</p>
<p>It meant he was chosen by fate!</p>
<p>With trembling hands, he picked it up... and then his expression froze.</p>
<p>The Hammer was indeed the BOSS's weapon—Lakzo's Hammer.</p>
<p>But why the hell was it a white-quality item?</p>
<p>Even if this BOSS was weak, was a white item all it could drop?</p>
<p>You're a BOSS, for crying out loud! And you were wielding a white-quality weapon?</p>
<p>You were even worse off than his warrior!?</p>
<p>No wonder you got slaughtered!</p>
<p>"Do you have no dignity as a BOSS?! Wearing nothing but underwear—I thought you'd invested all your assets into your weapon!"</p>
<p>"But your Hammer is white? You're such a joke!" Song Ren was utterly broken.</p>
<p>After checking two or three more times, he confirmed that the only drop was this Hammer.</p>
<p>Was he really that unlucky?</p>
<p>"Ahem, Old Song, have you considered another possibility?" Joey chimed in.</p>
<p>"Huh?" Song Ren turned to him.</p>
<p>"Maybe this BOSS was a warrior too. And the reason he wasn't wearing clothes or pants—just carrying a white Hammer—wasn't because he spent all his money on his weapon, but because he was so poor that a weapon was all he had left. After all, you still need a weapon to grind levels." Joey said with a grin.</p>
<p>Thunk—</p>
<p>It felt like an arrow had pierced Song Ren's heart.</p>
<p>"Old Song, don't hold back. This Hammer is perfect for you."</p>
<p>"Sigh... Are warriors really this poor?"</p>
<p>"Old Song, just take the Hammer back to the capital city and sell it at the Shop. Don't end up unable to afford your Skills."</p>
<p>His teammates sighed with emotion, then all passed on the loot to comfort him.</p>
<p>"Stop. I'm exhausted." Song Ren looked utterly lifeless.</p>
<p>At this moment, he was seriously questioning his path as a warrior.</p>
<p>In a way, Warcraft was an extremely fair game—yet also an unfair one.</p>
<p>Because BOSS drops and loot rolls in random parties depended entirely on luck.</p>
<p>For an Unlucky King, the player experience would be miserable.</p>
<p>Warriors were already dirt-poor. If he also had the Unlucky King tag...</p>
<p>Was this game even playable?</p>
