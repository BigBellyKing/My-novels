                <p>Chapter 201: "One Hundred Ways Wilson Dies" (Seventh Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>"Is this game fun?"</p>
<p>As Wang Han was about to explore a new world, Zhang Yi, who had just defeated Yhorm the Giant, pulled up a stool and sat behind her, asking curiously.</p>
<p>"It's pretty fun! The main Gameplay revolves around collecting, building, and Survival," Wang Han replied.</p>
<p>Although she had only survived eight days—and not very efficiently at that—Wang Han had already begun to feel some of the joys of <em>Don't Starve</em>.</p>
<p>"Collecting," "Survival," and "growing stronger"—these three elements are essentially present in nearly every game, even story-driven linear games.</p>
<p>In narrative-focused linear games, even if the game itself lacks collecting, survival, or level up mechanics, the protagonist usually grows stronger or acquires new abilities. As players, we naturally project ourselves onto the protagonist.</p>
<p><em>Don't Starve</em>, however, uses "Survival" as its core drive, allowing players to experience "collecting" and "growing stronger," thus gaining satisfaction and enjoyment from the game.</p>
<p>"Hey, what's that sound?" Zhang Yi asked, intrigued.</p>
<p>Because the night atmosphere in the game was so eerie, Wang Han had switched the audio output from her headset to the Speaker.</p>
<p>At that moment, a low rumbling noise came from the Speaker—somewhat like thunder, but also resembling the howl of a wild beast.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Wilson in the game began muttering to himself:</p>
<p>'I think I heard something. Did you hear it too? I have a bad feeling...'</p>
<p>Seeing Wilson's words on screen, Wang Han couldn't help but tense up.</p>
<p>She had already grasped the basic game mechanics.</p>
<p>Whenever Wilson started talking, it meant something was definitely about to happen.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure, probably not?" Wang Han replied to Zhang Yi, standing cautiously in place. After waiting for about a minute with nothing happening, she began to relax—but also felt puzzled.</p>
<p>"That's weird. Could it be that my Sanity is too low? Is Wilson feeling threatened and acting all mysterious act because of that?" Wang Han wondered, then decided to look for some flowers or green mushrooms to restore her Sanity.</p>
<p>Just as she was about to go searching for resources—and maybe pick a few flowers—</p>
<p>Suddenly, a dog bark echoed from the game. Two fierce Hounds appeared at the top of the map and lunged toward the Wilson she was controlling.</p>
<p>"What the hell? What kind of monster is this? There weren't any monsters here before!" Wang Han froze as the two Hounds charged at her. She had just passed through this area—when did these monsters appear? Where did these dogs even come from?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this question would remain unanswered—at least in this playthrough.</p>
<p>Under the relentless bites of the two Hounds, Wang Han's Wilson, already not at full health, stood no chance. The Hounds were extremely fast and dealt high damage.</p>
<p>Though she tried to fight back with her axe, it felt like scratching an itch. After just two rounds of attacks, Wilson collapsed into a pool of blood.</p>
<p>【Beware of Hounds】 (Trust Wilson's instincts)</p>
<p>Staring at the achievement notification, Wang Han was completely Speechless.</p>
<p>Why tell her <em>now</em>?!</p>
<p>He's already been torn apart by dogs!</p>
<p>"He's already dead?" Zhang Yi, standing behind her, was taken aback.</p>
<p>"I should've made armor and weapons first. Wandering around aimlessly wasted too much time!" Wang Han reflected on her eight-day journey in the game. Then she turned to Zhang Yi: "No more talking—Log In!"</p>
<p>Hearing Wang Han's command, Zhang Yi quickly got up. "Wait, I'm on it!"</p>
<p>Back in his room, Zhang Yi熟练ly opened the Nebula Games Platform and downloaded <em>Don't Starve</em>.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Like Zhang Yi and Wang Han, many players rushed into <em>Don't Starve</em> the moment it launched.</p>
<p>However, in their first Survival attempts, most players only experienced a tiny fraction of what the game had to offer.</p>
<p>Complex mechanics like building a camp and advancing Tech were completely untouched.</p>
<p>The only thing they truly experienced? A wide variety of deaths.</p>
<p>No matter how carefully they planned, unexpected events always arose, abruptly ending their survival.</p>
<p>On the community forum, players who had just入手 the game were actively posting and exchanging their experiences.</p>
<p>"Feels like there's so much content in this game. Played for over two hours and I've only scratched the surface!"</p>
<p>"+1, been playing all afternoon. Haven't survived past double-digit days yet, but it's still super fun!"</p>
<p>"Haha, too real—I died my first time stealing bird eggs and got pecked to death by a Tallbird."</p>
<p>"233333, I ran into a pack of red-butt bulls in the grasslands and got rammed to death!"</p>
<p>"Anyone else set the forest on fire and accidentally burned themselves to death?"</p>
<p>"I'm gagging—am I the only one who didn't build a fire at night and got killed by some monster in the dark?"</p>
<p>"Didn't make a fire and died to darkness +1, that's exactly how I died too!"</p>
<p>"It's just a mini-game, but it's incredibly fun, especially scavenging trash with friends. Hours just fly by!"</p>
<p>"Exactly! Playing with friends is way more enjoyable."</p>
<p>"Haha, playing online multiplayer—you gotta分工 clearly. The first time Hounds spawned, they came per player. A whole pack showed up and tore both me and my friend apart!"</p>
<p>"Right! Those dogs are brutal! How do you even fight them?!"</p>
<p>"First Hounds aren't too bad. Make a Grass Suit and use some smart positioning to hack them down. But for extra safety, craft a spear."</p>
<p>"Everyone, listen up—never let your Sanity drop too low. Otherwise, you'll see a swarm of black phantom creatures. Those things are damn strong—I got killed by them!"</p>
<p>"I think the game's title is totally misleading. Called <em>Don't Starve</em>, but I've never starved to death once!"</p>
<p>Countless players shared their gameplay insights on the forum communities—or more accurately, their death stories.</p>
<p>The Hounds, notorious for killing rookies, unsurprisingly topped the list of causes of death.</p>
<p>When players were still figuring out the game, slowly learning its mechanics,</p>
<p>even just two regular Hounds could deal devastating damage.</p>
<p>As players recounted their bizarre and hilarious deaths in <em>Don't Starve</em>, many admitted that despite the game's name, very few actually died from starvation. Most deaths resulted from unexpected accidents.</p>
<p>So, calling it <em>Don't Starve</em> was completely misleading. The real title should be <em>One Hundred Ways Wilson Dies!</em> instead.</p>
