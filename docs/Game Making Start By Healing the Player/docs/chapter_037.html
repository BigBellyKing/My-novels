                <h2>Chapter 37: The Whole Truth</h2>
<p>The one who got into the car accident wasn't Johnny; it was his twin brother, Joey.</p>
<p>And Joey wasn't some so-called grandfather's name at all. Rather, after Johnny's mother fatally hit Joey with her car, she developed some mental issues and began to mistake Johnny for Joey.</p>
<p>It was at this time that Johnny was given Beta-blockers.</p>
<p>Everything from before was now explained.</p>
<p>Why Johnny always slept in a double bed.</p>
<p>Why Johnny’s mother called him Joey.</p>
<p>Including the comics Johnny loved to read and the pickled olives he ate—these were all things his brother Joey liked.</p>
<p>After the car accident, Johnny's mother, overwhelmed by grief, raised Johnny as if he were Joey.</p>
<p>But there was still some confusion: what about Liva? What did this wish to go to the moon have to do with Liva?</p>
<p>As the game's timeline continued to advance, it went back to a time before Joey's death.</p>
<p>Joey, as the older brother, was very protective of his younger brother, Johnny.</p>
<p>Once again, the two of them participated in a competition at an amusement park.</p>
<p>Joey, the older brother, won a small train toy, while Johnny, the younger brother, only received a platypus toy.</p>
<p>Johnny said he wanted one too, but his mother stopped him.</p>
<p>Joey, however, said they could play with the little train together.</p>
<p>From this, it was clear that the mother seemed to favor Joey more.</p>
<p>A somewhat dejected Johnny walked gloomily towards the back hill of the amusement park, still holding the platypus he had won.</p>
<p>At this moment, Dong Zhen's spirits lifted completely.</p>
<p>Yes, that platypus!</p>
<p>That platypus, belonging to Liva, was actually won by Johnny at the amusement park.</p>
<p>Did this mean...</p>
<p>The following scene confirmed the speculation in his heart.</p>
<p>Johnny, having come to the back hill, looked up at the sky full of stars. His previously gloomy mood seemed to improve, and he found a good spot.</p>
<p>A wooden stump, like a bench, where he could sit and perfectly see the distant twinkling stars.</p>
<p>And just at that moment, a little girl appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>It was Liva from her childhood!</p>
<p>A slight tingling sensation ran down his scalp; in this instant, Dong Zhen felt as if he had understood something profound.</p>
<p>This was the scene of Johnny's first meeting with Liva. Not the so-called high school!</p>
<p>Seeing Liva approach, Johnny happily greeted her, but Liva instinctively wanted to leave.</p>
<p>Johnny called out to Liva.</p>
<p>After a brief exchange, he asked her if she would like to watch the stars with him.</p>
<p>Accompanied by soothing piano and violin background music.</p>
<p>Under a sky full of stars, Johnny and Liva sat on the wooden stump, looking at the distant sky.</p>
<p>The camera switched to a close-up.</p>
<p>The green grass on the verdant lawn swayed gently with the breeze.</p>
<p>‘Look up there…’</p>
<p>‘Did you know, there are countless lanterns in the sky!’ Johnny proactively started a conversation.</p>
<p>‘Mhm.’ Liva's reaction was just like it had been in high school.</p>
<p>‘Uh… um, me too.’ Johnny was a little flustered, but still tried to make conversation. ‘You just said this was your spot? Right?’</p>
<p>‘I only come here during carnival season.’</p>
<p>‘You don't like crowded places?… Hmm, me neither.’ Johnny continued, ‘See, you still haven't told me your name!’</p>
<p>‘I won't tell you. Everyone at school makes fun of me because of it.’</p>
<p>‘Why?’</p>
<p>‘They say hearing my name makes them want to go to the bathroom.’</p>
<p>‘Hmm, well, but… let's just say, it can't be any worse than “Johnny”, can it? I mean, in almost any place in the world, someone is named Johnny.’</p>
<p>‘So what?’</p>
<p>‘Hm?’</p>
<p>‘What's wrong with having a common name? I just hope that, like the stars in the sky, even though they all look similar from here, it doesn't diminish their beauty.’</p>
<p>‘Hmm, I think so too. So what do you think these stars are?’</p>
<p>‘My dad says the stars in the sky are giant spheres burning from within.’</p>
<p>Johnny and Liva chatted for a bit, then Liva asked, ‘Have you ever tried making Easter bunnies with the stars?’</p>
<p>‘Like finding constellations in the sky?’</p>
<p>‘Mhm.’</p>
<p>‘I've looked for others, but never for bunnies.’</p>
<p>‘Want to try?’</p>
<p>‘Mhm! We're sure to find the best bunny constellation! Let's see who finds it first!’</p>
<p>With a countdown of three, two, one, Liva immediately spoke up, “I found it!”</p>
<p>‘Uh, where?’ Johnny was a bit stunned.</p>
<p>The camera slowly shifted upwards, focusing on the full moon.</p>
<p>‘In the sky!’</p>
<p>‘Where in the sky?’</p>
<p>‘Think big, everything else is big!’</p>
<p>‘I can't find it… Wait… wait, I see it!’</p>
<p>‘Tell me what you see!’</p>
<p>‘It's there, right? Those are two ears and a head.’ Johnny's finger pointed at the moon.</p>
<p>‘And?’</p>
<p>‘And over there… those are two feet!’</p>
<p>‘Exactly! And?’</p>
<p>‘And… and the moon! The moon is its big, round belly!’</p>
<p>Simple lines in the screen outlined the stars in the sky.</p>
<p>Forming a — rabbit.</p>
<p>A rabbit with a yellow belly!</p>
<p>In that instant, the previous content of the game flashed before Dong Zhen's eyes.</p>
<p>Why did Liva start frantically folding paper bunnies after Johnny and Liva talked about their first meeting?</p>
<p>Why did Liva ask John countless times throughout her life what that yellow-bellied paper bunny was?</p>
<p>Why had Johnny's answers never satisfied Liva?</p>
<p>Now, finally, Dong Zhen understood!</p>
<p>Liva had been trying to remind Johnny in her own way.</p>
<p>Reminding him that many years ago, under the starry moon, that was their first meeting!</p>
<p>As Johnny and Liva chatted, Liva revealed that she had always believed the stars in the sky were lighthouses.</p>
<p>She thought those lighthouses wanted to communicate with others but couldn't, only able to constantly illuminate others; it was the only thing they could do.</p>
<p>Everything was explained.</p>
<p>Why Liva cared so much about Anya!</p>
<p>Then, a scene that moved countless people appeared.</p>
<p>With his mother's call, Johnny had to go home.</p>
<p>Before leaving, he left his platypus with Liva.</p>
<p>‘This is the prize I won, it's for you!’</p>
<p>That platypus, which had always accompanied Liva, came from this moment!</p>
<p>‘Will you… will you come back next year?’ Holding the platypus, Liva asked Johnny.</p>
<p>‘Of course! And you?’</p>
<p>‘I will.’</p>
<p>‘Same time? Same place?’</p>
<p>‘Mhm!’</p>
<p>Johnny, delighted by the answer, prepared to go home, when Liva asked.</p>
<p>‘But what if you get lost, or forget?’</p>
<p>‘Then we'll always meet on the moon, silly.’</p>
<p>As Johnny said these words, countless players currently playing the game involuntarily felt a pang of sadness in their eyes.</p>
<p>The game screen before them suddenly blurred.</p>
<p>All the doubts.</p>
<p>Were finally explained here.</p>
<p>(End of Chapter)</p>
