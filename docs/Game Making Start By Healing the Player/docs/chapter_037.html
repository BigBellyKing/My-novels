                <h1>Chapter 37: The Truth of Everything</h1>
<p>The person who died in the car accident wasn't Johnny, but his twin brother, Joey.</p>
<p>And "Joey" wasn't actually the grandfather's name at all. After accidentally killing Joey, Johnny's mother suffered a mental breakdown and began mistaking Johnny for Joey.</p>
<p>It was at that time that Johnny was given Beta-blockers.</p>
<p>Everything before now made sense.</p>
<p>Why Johnny always slept in double beds.</p>
<p>Why Johnny's mother called him Joey.</p>
<p>Even the comics Johnny liked to read and the pickled olives he ate—these were all things his older brother Joey had loved.</p>
<p>After the accident, overwhelmed by grief, Johnny's mother raised Johnny as if he were Joey.</p>
<p>But there were still unanswered questions—what about Liva?</p>
<p>Did the wish to go to the moon have any connection with Liva?</p>
<p>As the game progressed further, the timeline shifted back to the time before Joey's death.</p>
<p>As the older brother, Joey deeply cared for his younger brother Johnny.</p>
<p>Once, the two participated in a competition at the amusement park.</p>
<p>Brother Joey won a toy steam train, while younger brother Johnny only received a platypus toy.</p>
<p>Johnny expressed that he wanted the train too, but his mother stopped him.</p>
<p>Joey, however, said they could play with the train together.</p>
<p>From this, it was clear that their mother seemed to favor Joey more.</p>
<p>Feeling somewhat down, Johnny sulkily walked toward the back hills of the amusement park, still holding the platypus toy he had received.</p>
<p>At this moment, Dong Zhen suddenly became alert.</p>
<p>Yes, that platypus!</p>
<p>The platypus belonging to Little Sister—had actually been won by Johnny at the amusement park.</p>
<p>Could this mean…?</p>
<p>The next scene confirmed his suspicion.</p>
<p>On the hillside, Johnny gazed up at the starry sky. His previously depressed mood began to lift. He had found a wonderful spot—</p>
<p>a wooden stump shaped like a bench, perfectly positioned to view the distant twinkling stars.</p>
<p>And then, a little girl appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>It was young Liva!</p>
<p>Dong Zhen felt a chill run through his scalp. In that instant, everything seemed to click.</p>
<p>This was the real scene of Johnny and Liva's first meeting.</p>
<p>Not in high school, as previously believed!</p>
<p>Seeing Liva arrive, Johnny happily greeted her, but instinctively, Liva tried to leave.</p>
<p>Johnny called out to her.</p>
<p>After a brief exchange, he asked if she'd like to watch the stars with him.</p>
<p>Accompanied by soothing background audio of gentle piano and violin music,</p>
<p>under the vast Starry Sky, Johnny and Liva sat on the wooden stump, gazing into the distance.</p>
<p>The scene shifted to a close-up.</p>
<p>The green grass on the lush lawn swayed gently in the breeze.</p>
<p>'Look over there...'</p>
<p>'Did you know? There are countless lamps in the sky!'</p>
<p>Johnny initiated the conversation.</p>
<p>'Mm.'</p>
<p>Liva's response was just as quiet as she had been back in high school.</p>
<p>'Uh... yeah, me too,' Johnny stammered, awkwardly trying to keep talking.</p>
<p>'You said this place is your spot? Right?'</p>
<p>'I only come during the carnival period.'</p>
<p>'Do you not like crowded places?... Yeah, neither do I,' Johnny continued. 'Hey, you still haven't told me your name!'</p>
<p>'I won't tell you. The kids at school make fun of me because of it.'</p>
<p>'Why?'</p>
<p>'They say hearing my name makes them want to go to the bathroom.'</p>
<p>'Well... okay, but seriously, how bad could it be? It can't be worse than "Johnny," right? I mean, almost everywhere in the world, someone's named Johnny.'</p>
<p>'So what?'</p>
<p>'Huh?'</p>
<p>'Having a name everyone has—what's wrong with that? I think, just like the stars in the sky, they all look similar from here, but that doesn't make them any less beautiful.'</p>
<p>'Yeah, I think so too. So... what do you think the stars are?'</p>
<p>'My dad says stars are giant balls of fire burning inside themselves.'</p>
<p>Johnny and Liva chatted for a while, then Liva asked, 'Have you ever tried making an Easter Bunny out of stars?'</p>
<p>'Like finding constellations in the sky?'</p>
<p>'Mm-hmm.'</p>
<p>'I've looked for other shapes, but never a rabbit.'</p>
<p>'Wanna try?'</p>
<p>'Yeah! We'll definitely find the best bunny constellation! Let's race to see who finds it first!'</p>
<p>As the countdown of three, two, one finished, Liva beside him suddenly exclaimed, 'I found it!'</p>
<p>'Uh, where?' Johnny blinked in confusion.</p>
<p>The camera slowly panned upward, focusing on the full moon.</p>
<p>'In the sky!'</p>
<p>'But where in the sky?'</p>
<p>'Think big—everything's big!'</p>
<p>'I can't see it... Wait... Wait, I see it!'</p>
<p>'Tell me what you see!'</p>
<p>'There—those are two ears and a head!' Johnny pointed at the moon.</p>
<p>'And what else?'</p>
<p>'And there... those are two feet!'</p>
<p>'Exactly! And what else!'</p>
<p>'And... and the moon! The moon is its round, chubby belly!'</p>
<p>Simple lines in the scene traced the stars in the sky,</p>
<p>forming a—rabbit.</p>
<p>A rabbit with a yellow belly!</p>
<p>In that instant, all the previous content of the game flashed before Dong Zhen's eyes.</p>
<p>Why, after Johnny and Liva talked about their first meeting, did she start madly folding origami bunnies?</p>
<p>Why had Liva, throughout her life, repeatedly asked John what the yellow-bellied paper bunny meant?</p>
<p>Why had Johnny's answers never satisfied her?</p>
<p>Now, Dong Zhen finally understood!</p>
<p>Liva had been reminding Johnny—her whole life—in her own way.</p>
<p>Reminding him that under the moon and stars so many years ago, that was truly their first meeting!</p>
<p>As Johnny and Liva continued chatting, Liva revealed that she had always believed the stars in the sky were lighthouses.</p>
<p>She thought those lighthouses wanted to exchange with others but couldn't—so they could only keep lighting the way for others. That was the only thing they could do.</p>
<p>Everything finally made sense.</p>
<p>Why Liva cared so deeply about Anya!</p>
<p>Then came the scene that moved countless players to tears.</p>
<p>Hearing his mother calling, Johnny had to go home.</p>
<p>Before leaving, he left his platypus toy with Liva.</p>
<p>'This was my prize. I'm giving it to you!'</p>
<p>So this was how the platypus toy—the one that had always been by Liva's side—came to be!</p>
<p>'You... will you come back next year?' Liva asked, hugging the platypus.</p>
<p>'Of course! What about you?'</p>
<p>'I will.'</p>
<p>'Same time? Same place?'</p>
<p>'Mm-hmm!'</p>
<p>Satisfied with her answer, Johnny happily turned to leave. Then Liva asked,</p>
<p>'But what if you get lost... or forget?'</p>
<p>'Then we'll always meet again on the moon, silly.'</p>
<p>As Johnny said these words, countless players around the world felt an involuntary sting in their eyes.</p>
<p>Their vision blurred suddenly.</p>
<p>All the doubts.</p>
<p>Here, at last, found their answers.</p>
