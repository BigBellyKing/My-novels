<h2>Chapter 145: Player Hot Discussion (First Update – Please Subscribe, Monthly Pass Votes Needed)</h2>
<p>With the release of the <em>It Takes Two</em> promotional trailer, it instantly attracted a large number of players.</p>
<p>Aside from Nebula Games' loyal fans, a significant number of ordinary players were also drawn in.</p>
<p>This was mainly because, during this period, players were collectively experiencing a game drought.</p>
<p>There weren't many outstanding games capable of exciting the playerbase.</p>
<p>Nebula Games, having developed <em>Dark Souls</em> last year and consistently releasing numerous small-scale yet well-received titles, had already built a strong sense of trust among many players.</p>
<p>While it hadn't quite reached the point where "Nebula's products are always high-quality," the company already boasted a dedicated fanbase.</p>
<p>After watching the promotional trailer released by Chen Xu and Nebula Games' official Weibo account, many players were taken aback.</p>
<p>Even gaming industry designers who closely followed Chen Xu's moves felt the same surprise.</p>
<p>Because they realized—this was different from what they had imagined!</p>
<p>Instantly, the forums exploded with heated discussions from countless players who had seen the <em>It Takes Two</em> promotional video.</p>
<p>"Feels completely different from Chen Xu's <em>Overcooked</em> last year!"</p>
<p>"Yeah! Though the art style is cartoonish in both, this one seems way more content-rich than <em>Overcooked</em>. Is this an action-adventure game!?"</p>
<p>"Damn it! So does this mean it's a major production!?"</p>
<p>"And judging by the gameplay, two players control a male and a female character, overcoming obstacles together as they progress?"</p>
<p>"Now that you mention it, it really fits the game's title!"</p>
<p>"From the description, it seems like a married couple, after their relationship breaks down, transform into a clay figure and a wooden doll, and must repair their bond to become human again?"</p>
<p>"The content feels incredibly rich! The trailer alone seems to include all kinds of genres—RPG, FPS, even car chases—simply unbelievable!"</p>
<p>"Now that you say it, the gameplay content does seem pretty diverse!"</p>
<p>As Chen Xu released the <em>It Takes Two</em> promotional trailer and related information, it immediately sparked widespread player interest.</p>
<p>Judging from the trailer's art style, it adopts a cinematic animated style.</p>
<p>In terms of content, it integrates various gameplay elements—platforming, parkour evasion, high-speed driving, shooting, and puzzle solving.</p>
<p>It was completely unlike what they had imagined.</p>
<p>Valentine's Day, couple's cooperation, warm and friendly.</p>
<p>When Chen Xu first mentioned these tags, players couldn't help but think of <em>Overcooked</em>, which Nebula Games had launched last year around the same time.</p>
<p>Although many players jokingly commented on it as "Breakup Kitchen," there was no denying that the game had sparked a brief surge in popularity for cooperative games, even spawning numerous similar casual games.</p>
<p>Though not explicitly stated, many players had already subconsciously linked Nebula Games' new title with <em>Overcooked</em>.</p>
<p>But after watching the <em>It Takes Two</em> trailer, they realized—this was entirely different!</p>
<p>As players were still astonished, Chen Xu's official Weibo soon posted another message.</p>
<p>This message provided a detailed introduction to <em>It Takes Two</em>'s key characteristics.</p>
<p>'Originally meant as a Valentine's surprise for all players, but it's 20 days late.'</p>
<p>'This is a unique adventure game—you'll embark on the most mad journey of your life with your best friend.'</p>
<p>'This is an animated movie interactive game centered around two-player co-op and story-driven gameplay.'</p>
<p>'Players must overcome challenges together with a partner, experiencing all kinds of humor and chaos. But one thing is certain: When Two People Are of One Heart, Their Sharpness Can Cut Through Metal.'</p>
<p>'As a two-player game, <em>It Takes Two</em> does not require both players to purchase it. One copy is enough—one player can invite companions to play for free. [Note: Applies only to the Nebula Games Platform version]'</p>
<p>'Game Price: 146 Yuan!'</p>
<p>After the message was posted, Chen Xu's official Weibo comments section quickly flooded with player reactions.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, you're too thoughtful—delivering a late Valentine's surprise, classic you!"</p>
<p>"Remember last year's <em>Overcooked</em>? Now we have <em>It Takes Two</em>. Is Mr. Chen trying to turn Nebula Games into an annual release tradition!?"</p>
<p>"23333333, one couple's game every year. Last year's turned into a 'couple killer'—wonder what this year's <em>It Takes Two</em> will be like!"</p>
<p>"But I feel it might actually be quite fun. And unlike <em>Overcooked</em>, the story seems to be one of the core aspects?"</p>
<p>"Wait, did anyone notice? You only need to buy one copy to play! Though the price isn't cheap—146 Yuan? That's steep!"</p>
<p>After reading Chen Xu's official Weibo post, players quickly dug out some key information.</p>
<p>First, it subtly hinted at the game's launch date.</p>
<p>Second, it confirmed that the game was truly an adventure game, not a casual simulation game like <em>Overcooked</em>.</p>
<p>But what drew even more attention was how it differed from <em>Overcooked</em>'s "buy one, get one free" model.</p>
<p>With <em>It Takes Two</em>, only one player needs to purchase it, and then they can freely invite others to join.</p>
<p>This was far more cost-effective than "buy one, get one free."</p>
<p>For example, with <em>Overcooked</em>'s model, if you wanted to play with someone who didn't own the game, you'd have to buy a second copy.</p>
<p>But <em>It Takes Two</em> clearly avoided this issue.</p>
<p>Once you bought it, you could play with anyone you wanted—the decision-making power was entirely in your hands.</p>
<p>However, the price also surprised many players, as <em>It Takes Two</em> was priced at a surprisingly high 146 Yuan.</p>
<p>Considering Nebula Games' previous pricing, there was only one explanation:</p>
<p><em>It Takes Two</em> must have a significantly larger game scale—definitely larger than titles like <em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em> or <em>To the Moon</em>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Nebula Games wouldn't have set such a price.</p>
<p>For players, however, the game's actual content remained their top concern.</p>
<p>Although there was a promotional trailer, it wasn't actual gameplay footage, so it was hard to judge the real experience.</p>
<p>The only reference point was Chen Xu's previous co-op game, <em>Overcooked</em>.</p>
<p>But in terms of game type and scale, the two titles were clearly worlds apart.</p>
<p>Still, thanks to Nebula Games' consistently strong reputation and the widespread publicity Chen Xu gained from the recent Annual Game Awards Event, most players developed a strong interest in <em>It Takes Two</em> after learning about it.</p>
<p>Of course, this was also partly due to the current game drought.</p>
<p>Additionally, since Chen Xu had clearly stated that this was a cooperative co-op game requiring two players, many who intended to play started forming groups and recruiting potential partners.</p>
