<p>Chapter 151: The Most Perfect Two-Player Game! (Seventh Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>Before experiencing <em>It Takes Two</em>, neither Zhang Yi nor Wang Han had imagined that a two-player co-op game could be such a big title.</p>
<p>After grinding for a full day, they realized they had experienced less than half of the game.</p>
<p>Yet, the subsequent story continued to maintain the same level of brilliance as before.</p>
<p>The emotional arc involving the little plush toy reduced some of the earlier joy, adding a heavy/somber tone to the journey.</p>
<p>But soon, both were once again drawn to the even cooler levels and new abilities.</p>
<p>In the scene involving the Cuckoo Clock, May and Cody gained two new special abilities.</p>
<p>Cody gained the power to manipulate time, restoring destroyed objects.</p>
<p>May, on the other hand, obtained the ability to create clones of herself.</p>
<p>Just like in previous levels, every challenge required the use of their special abilities.</p>
<p>This segment also featured many stunning parts, such as riding on the back of a bird and soaring through the sky, which left a deep impression on both players.</p>
<p>However, during this segment, Zhang Yi and Wang Han also noticed something different.</p>
<p>Cody and May’s cooperation had become more seamless, their bond growing closer.</p>
<p>Especially at the climax of this level, when the clock exploded, Cody used time reversal to save May—perfectly showcasing their tacit understanding.</p>
<p>The subsequent parkour sequence felt like a sci-fi blockbuster—tense and thrilling.</p>
<p>Finally, the image of the two stumbling into each other, followed by their daughter Rose happily watching the repaired Cuckoo Clock, dispelled some of the gloom from the earlier plush toy storyline. It also deepened their curiosity about the upcoming story.</p>
<p>After completing the Cuckoo Clock segment, it was once again the loud and energetic emotional expert Dr. Hakim’s spotlight moment.</p>
<p>Under Dr. Hakim’s operations, Cody and May arrived at a new scene: the Snowglobe.</p>
<p>In this level, their tools were split halves of a magnet.</p>
<p>They had to use the principle of like poles repelling and opposite poles attracting to overcome obstacles.</p>
<p>But unlike before,</p>
<p>after surviving the crisis of the Cuckoo Clock, the relationship between Cody and May seemed to have softened.</p>
<p>Inside the Snowglobe, they began reminiscing about the past.</p>
<p>At the sight of a tree stuck with a saw, memories resurfaced.</p>
<p>'Oh look! A saw!'</p>
<p>'Hey, remember our first Christmas with Rose?'</p>
<p>'You mean when all the Christmas trees were sold out?'</p>
<p>'Yes!'</p>
<p>'And we sneaked into the forest,'</p>
<p>'and cut down a tree?'</p>
<p>'I thought we were definitely going to get caught.'</p>
<p>During their adventure, the two began chatting about old times.</p>
<p>Along the way, they discovered a dead silent town, frozen under endless snow and ice.</p>
<p>Dr. Hakim told them they needed to ring the bell to restore the town’s prosperity.</p>
<p>The game didn’t spell it out, but Zhang Yi and Wang Han clearly understood the metaphor.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this represented the frozen hearts of May and Cody.</p>
<p>Throughout this segment, May and Cody shared memories.</p>
<p>'This was where I proposed. I was so nervous back then.'</p>
<p>'I know. That’s why it was so special.'</p>
<p>'Really?'</p>
<p>'You completely forgot the speech you had prepared.'</p>
<p>'That was the worst proposal in history.'</p>
<p>'No. I didn’t care about your words. I cared about how you showed your fear without hiding it. That was brave.'</p>
<p>Just as the frozen, lifeless town was awakened by the sound of the bell, their feelings slowly began to mend.</p>
<p>Town, bell tower, Underwater Candy Factory—each uniquely crafted scene featured excellent puzzle designs.</p>
<p>Eventually, the two began reflecting on their shared past.</p>
<p>'Finally, we can catch our breath.'</p>
<p>'Yeah, we’ve earned this.'</p>
<p>'Absolutely!'</p>
<p>'That’s right!'</p>
<p>'You know, ever since Rose was born, we’ve never taken a vacation.'</p>
<p>'Has it really been that long!?' </p>
<p>'Exactly. Why haven’t we gone skiing together?'</p>
<p>'Well, Rose was born, and household expenses increased.'</p>
<p>Sitting on a cable car, they talked—this level letting players feel something rare in games: warmth.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the cable car dropped, and Cody and May began a thrilling race down the icy slope.</p>
<p>Two consecutive, heart-pounding skiing sequences left Zhang Yi and Wang Han completely satisfied.</p>
<p>Afterward, Dr. Hakim appeared, revealing an even more surprising twist: the magnets on their bodies now attracted each other.</p>
<p>This was no longer subtle—it was practically a Direct Statement.</p>
<p>In front of the monitor, Zhang Yi and Wang Han reflected on all the thematic scenes, realizing that none of them were meaningless.</p>
<p>The Shed and Greatwood simply introduced the story background and helped players learn the Gameplay.</p>
<p>The vacuum cleaner’s rage, the squirrel and bee infestations—all subtly hinted at the couple’s troubled life.</p>
<p>Once the story entered Rose’s room, the game truly entered its rollercoaster phase.</p>
<p>The two mistakenly believed their daughter’s tears were what turned them into dolls.</p>
<p>As they tried to destroy her toys to make her cry again, a space toy monkey appeared, stopping their cruel actions.</p>
<p>Parents wanting to hurt their child, while a toy sought to protect her—this deeply ironic story cut like a scalpel into the complexities of parent-child relationships.</p>
<p>Then, destroying the little plush toy pushed the game’s conflict to its peak: as parents, they had never considered their child’s feelings.</p>
<p>Yet, from this moment on, the game’s tone began to shift.</p>
<p>The Cuckoo Clock symbolized time. Faced with the mundane aspects of life, would they give each other enough time together?</p>
<p>The Snowglobe symbolized attraction.</p>
<p>What exactly brought them together?</p>
<p>After clearing the Snowglobe level, the two stood together, talking about the past, clearly showing concern for each other.</p>
<p>Outside the Snowglobe, daughter Rose saw it glowing again, and some of her emotional darkness lifted.</p>
<p>By this point, Zhang Yi and Wang Han realized the game was nearing its end.</p>
<p>And indeed, it was.</p>
<p>The next garden level introduced entirely new tools and fun levels.</p>
<p>It also featured an increasing number of fun mini-games.</p>
<p>But what mattered most to Zhang Yi and Wang Han now, beyond the enjoyable cooperation in clearing levels,</p>
<p>was the story itself.</p>
<p>The garden was filled with hallucinogenic purple fog, withered yellow twigs, and crumbling walls—clear signs of a neglected, abandoned place.</p>
<p>Yet this was once Cody’s most treasured spot.</p>
<p>After defeating the boss and dispersing the purple fog, green grass and flowers sprouted from the earth, with glowing yellow specks floating in the air, symbolizing the rebirth of nature.</p>
<p>The withered Poppi revived, symbolizing the return of Cody’s lost passion.</p>
<p>'I’m sorry. I didn’t realize how important this was to Cody back then. But now… I understand.'</p>
<p>Facing the blooming Poppi, May apologized.</p>
<p>But Poppi comforted her instead.</p>
<p>'Cody abandoning gardening wasn’t your fault.'</p>
<p>'No one can take away your dreams, Cody, except if you give up yourself. Will you give up now?'</p>
<p>Through this dialogue, Cody realized no one could steal his dreams.</p>
<p>It all came down to his own choices.</p>
<p>Love is the driving force behind self-discipline. It is because of love that one willingly takes responsibility to solve problems.</p>
<p>In the final scene, Cody and May, led by Dr. Hakim, entered the attic.</p>
<p>The final theme was Music—the dream May had long ago.</p>
<p>Drums and singing became the special abilities for this level.</p>
<p>With Cody and May working together, and with Dr. Hakim’s help,</p>
<p>they found the Speaker, Microphones, and lights, defeated the Flying Demon, rescued the Orchestra, and completed most of the concert preparations. All that remained was rehearsal and finding an audience.</p>
<p>By heading to the Disco, they found the concert’s audience—a group of Glow Sticks.</p>
<p>After completing everything, a unique concert began, surrounded by countless waving Glow Sticks.</p>
<p>From behind the stage, May slowly walked forward.</p>
<p>Overcoming her inner worries, she stepped onto the stage and sang at the top of her lungs.</p>
<p>Amidst May’s music, bursting Fireworks, and the joyful cheers of the Glow Sticks,</p>
<p>Cody and May floated above the center of the stage, embracing tightly and sharing a deep kiss.</p>
<p>This marked the moment when their broken relationship finally mended—fully reuniting.</p>
<p>As dolls, they had finally found the true way to return to their human forms.</p>
<p>Mei, sleeping on the sofa, and Cody, slumped over the table, woke up.</p>
<p>While Cody and Mei had fought through trials to rediscover their love,</p>
<p>their daughter Rose had also been striving to save her parents’ marriage.</p>
<p>The young girl believed she was the cause of her parents’ arguments, so she chose to leave home, hoping they’d become friends again.</p>
<p>Of course, in the end, Cody and Mei found Rose.</p>
<p>At the train station, Mei and Cody held Rose’s hands, slowly walking back home.</p>
<p>The game ended here, but the credits sequence surprised many players.</p>
<p>The repaired vacuum cleaner, the organized toolbox, the repositioned space monkey, the cleaned garden with blooming flowers, the restored plush toy, the Cuckoo Clock back on the wall, the Snowglobe on the table, the gramophone playing music, and the Book of Love sitting alone on the bookshelf—all brought a warm, knowing smile.</p>
<p>Watching these scenes, Zhang Yi and Wang Han smiled softly.</p>
<p>'This is probably the most fun Two-Player Game I’ve ever played!' Zhang Yi sighed with emotion.</p>
<p>Beside him, Wang Han nodded in agreement: 'Remove the word "probably"!'</p>
