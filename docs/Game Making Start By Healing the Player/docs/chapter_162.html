                <h2>Chapter 161: Testing Silent Hill PT (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h2>
<p>The development progress of Silent Hill PT is going smoothly, despite it being the first time developing for a VR platform.</p>
<p>After all, Silent Hill PT itself isn't a complete game—it's merely a DEMO, so its scale isn't large.</p>
<p>The game's content mainly revolves around puzzles, without involving a combat system.</p>
<p>Even the original version's DEMO didn't feature much of an action system, with interactions limited to simple actions like opening doors or picking up objects.</p>
<p>For this reason, Chen Xu added some extra details to enhance the sense of immersion in the VR experience.</p>
<p>However, actions like jumping, running, or climbing weren't included, as they would disrupt the DEMO's content.</p>
<p>Aside from these omissions, the game is naturally in first-person perspective, sparing Chen Xu the headache of VR visual presentation.</p>
<p>Still, compared to most first-person perspectives on the PC platform, which default to a 90-degree field of view, the VR platform requires a wider field of vision.</p>
<p>Additionally, even though it's the same first-person viewpoint, its presentation differs under VR's immersive mode compared to PC games.</p>
<p>In many PC games, the first-person perspective makes players feel as if their eyes are positioned on their chest, because different actions appear completely different between third-person and first-person views.</p>
<p>An action that seems perfectly normal in first-person might appear shocking in third-person, and vice versa.</p>
<p>That's why some games allow players to switch between first-person and third-person modes. To prevent character movements from appearing odd, they often prepare two sets of animation modules—one for first-person and one for third-person.</p>
<p>But this inevitably increases development costs.</p>
<p>On the VR platform, however, the limited field of view design solves this issue well.</p>
<p>"Hmm... The scene where Lisa first appears is too bright. Players should be able to see her silhouette, but not clearly make out her face."</p>
<p>"It should give off a 'half-hidden, half-revealed' feeling, creating a sense of mystery. That way, when players suddenly realize Lisa is lunging at them, they'll truly feel that heart-pounding sensation, as if a little deer has burst into their chest and is wildly ramming around."</p>
<p>In the project office, Chen Xu was instructing Ruan Ningxue on modifying certain scene lighting and color settings.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, Ruan Ningxue hesitated, wanting to speak but holding back.</p>
<p>This wasn't just a little deer running amok—it was as if a mad elephant had charged into her chest!</p>
<p>Qin Yi and the others nearby silently lowered their heads.</p>
<p>During this time, the promotional trailer development for the Dark Souls Prequel was also progressing smoothly, and the gameplay Expo was drawing near.</p>
<p>The company had already begun preparations for the exhibition, while the Dark Souls Prequel trailer was nearing completion.</p>
<p>Currently, Qin Yi and his team had started building the scenes. They had also taken a look at the so-called VR DEMO Chen Xu was working on.</p>
<p>The more they learned about it, the more their little hearts struggled to bear it.</p>
<p>Because the DEMO prepared by Chen Xu for testing the new era VR equipment was delivered in a sealed state by the Game Department, making actual gameplay experience impossible.</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, Qin Yi's team didn't particularly want to experience it anyway—just watching was enough to make their insides tremble.</p>
<p>There was another crucial point: this DEMO, with a playtime of only about 30 minutes, featured puzzles that could only be described as terrifying.</p>
<p>It even utilized the game crash mechanism previously seen in Undertale.</p>
<p>Clues required to solve puzzles and clear the game were hidden within collectible photo fragments in the game and error text prompts that appeared during crashes.</p>
<p>Without access to this information, players would be trapped in an endless loop within the eerie room corridor.</p>
<p>Combined with its horror theme, Qin Yi and his team, who previously felt the Dark Souls Prequel was excessively malicious, suddenly had a new realization—Dark Souls Prequel was practically sunshine compared to this!</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Time quickly passed, and the gameplay Expo drew near. The company had already begun planning for this exhibition.</p>
<p>Well, to be honest, there wasn't much planning needed.</p>
<p>Just like last year, except this time two unique themed areas would be added.</p>
<p>The themes for "It Takes Two" and "Dark Souls." Unlike last year, when they saved the promotional trailer for the final day as a grand finale,</p>
<p>this year they wouldn't leave in suspense. After all, there was only one trailer.</p>
<p>They would release it boldly on the first day, giving players the full experience right away.</p>
<p>After the release, players could do whatever they wanted, since the only major highlight had already been revealed.</p>
<p>While the company was preparing, Chen Xu brought the completed version of Silent Hill PT to the Game Department to deliver the project.</p>
<p>"You've already finished it in less than 20 days!?"</p>
<p>Yang Chen, the Game Department's director, looked genuinely surprised upon hearing Chen Xu's report.</p>
<p>"Mainly because the content scale of the Silent Hill PT DEMO isn't very large," Chen Xu smiled, handing over the relevant materials to Yang Chen.</p>
<p>Yang Chen took the documents and glanced through them.</p>
<p>As the Game Department's director, Yang Chen wasn't clueless. After reviewing the subsidy application materials and related invoices, as well as the project content, he understood the situation.</p>
<p>Chen Xu had listed very few project categories, with the entire DEMO essentially centered around a single scene.</p>
<p>"Chen Xu, although the subsidy is tied to content volume, the main purpose this time is to better test the feedback of immersion in the new version VR. Don't waste funds, but don't skimp on expenses for the Game Department either," Yang Chen said with a苦 smile, suspecting that Chen Xu, being young, might have tried to save money wherever possible.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Director! This game may look simple, but it's quite special. It will definitely serve its testing purpose well," Chen Xu replied with a smile.</p>
<p>"Alright then, as long as you're confident. If the results aren't satisfactory later, just revise it. And remember, don't hold back on expenses when you do."</p>
<p>"I'll have Xiao Zhang accompany you to the Research Park. Right now, many designers are over there learning about the relevant parameters. Your DEMO can also serve as a showcase. Take the opportunity to exchange experiences with these designers about developing on the new version VR equipment. For the new VR equipment, not only the users' experiences matter, but also the developers' experience is crucial," Yang Chen told Chen Xu.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>After leaving the Game Department building, Chen Xu followed Xiao Zhang in his car to the Research Park.</p>
<p>Many designers were gathered, listening to explanations about various parameters of the VR equipment.</p>
<p>Among them were some new faces—clearly senior designers who had recently joined the Game Department.</p>
<p>There were also familiar ones, such as the enthusiastic Teacher Meng.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, you've finished your DEMO!?"</p>
<p>Upon hearing Chen Xu explain his purpose for coming, Meng Zuo was stunned, just like Yang Chen earlier.</p>
<p>Recently, he had exchanged some ideas with Chen Xu.</p>
<p>But since he was also working on his own designs, apart from knowing it was a horror-themed game, he had no other information about Chen Xu's DEMO.</p>
<p>He had come today mainly to better understand the VR equipment's parameters, to help adjust his own content.</p>
<p>Yet now Chen Xu had appeared, telling him the DEMO was already complete?</p>
<p>"It's mainly because the game is quite special, and the scale isn't very large," Chen Xu nodded with a smile.</p>
<p>The staff at the Research Park also looked surprised, clearly not expecting test materials to be ready this quickly.</p>
<p>While Chen Xu was chatting, the staff announced that the test preparations were complete.</p>
<p>"It's a pity we designers can't experience it ourselves, except for the testers who've passed the medical check-up and censorship. Otherwise, I'd really want to personally try out your game, Mr. Chen," Meng Zuo said with some regret.</p>
<p>Other designers, both those Chen Xu knew and didn't know, were chatting as well, clearly full of anticipation for Chen Xu's DEMO about to undergo testing.</p>
<p>After all, this was the first officially playable DEMO on the new version VR equipment. Combined with Chen Xu's distinctive works over the past two years, they felt this game titled Silent Hill PT might offer them significant inspiration.</p>
<p>The only regret was that they couldn't personally experience it. Otherwise, they could better grasp the game designer's intentions.</p>
<p>"Hmm... I think, Teacher Meng, you'll probably change your mind about that later," Chen Xu chuckled.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, the surrounding designers didn't respond, just smiled faintly.</p>
<p>After all, they were all colleagues—some mutual respect was necessary.</p>
<p>Horror theme? How big a deal could that be?</p>
<p>As game designers, what hadn't they seen?</p>
<p>It's just a horror game! They'd even played Chen Xu's Outlast before.</p>
<p>The same mindset was shared by the testers preparing for the experience.</p>
<p>Only one unit was prepared, but three testers were on duty today.</p>
<p>The three decided who would go first by playing rock-paper-scissors.</p>
<p>"My apologies, I'll take the first turn," said a young man, 1.85 meters tall with a crew cut, grinning as his two companions looked disappointed. His name tag read: Li Yue.</p>
<p>The other two colleagues were named Tao Fa and Ye Xun. Both appeared sturdy in build, as the testing role was special, and personnel were carefully selected.</p>
<p>"Too bad. I've always been a big fan of Chen Xu's games," Tao Fa lamented.</p>
<p>"Yeah, but don't end up pissing yourself later," Ye Xun teased.</p>
<p>"Pfft, I've experienced various materials on the new VR equipment before. Tested all kinds of bloody and terrifying scenes. Do you think I'd be scared?" Li Yue scoffed with a laugh.</p>
<p>As the three chatted, Chen Xu and the others entered a room. Directly ahead was a large LCD screen. According to the staff nearby, this screen would broadcast the tester's gameplay footage.</p>
<p>Soon, after being checked by the staff and confirmed ready, Li Yue entered the gaming pod with anticipation.</p>
<p>As a young man, Li Yue naturally enjoyed playing games and was quite familiar with Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Now, having the chance to experience the first DEMO created by Chen Xu for the new era VR equipment, he felt extremely excited and thrilled.</p>
<p>Filled with this excitement and anticipation, Li Yue inside the gaming pod officially launched the test DEMO titled Silent Hill PT.</p>
<p>First update of three; more tonight—but it might be a bit late.</p>
