                <p>Chapter 161: Testing Silent Hill PT (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>The development of Silent Hill PT was smooth, despite it being the first time developing for a VR platform.</p>
<p>But after all, Silent Hill PT itself wasn't a complete game, just a DEMO, not large in scale.</p>
<p>The game content was basically puzzles, not involving a combat system.</p>
<p>Even the original DEMO didn't involve much of an action system, at most just interactive actions like opening doors or picking up items.</p>
<p>For this, Chen Xu even added some detailed actions to the VR version to make the experience more immersive.</p>
<p>Of course, jumping, running, and climbing were still not included.</p>
<p>Because it would have some impact on the DEMO's content.</p>
<p>Besides these, the game itself was first-person, which meant Chen Xu didn't have to worry much about the VR visual representation.</p>
<p>However, compared to most first-person perspectives on PC platforms, which typically use a default 90-degree field of view, transferring to a VR platform required a much wider field of view.</p>
<p>In addition, although it was still a first-person perspective, its presentation in VR immersive mode was different from PC games.</p>
<p>In many PC games with a first-person perspective, players might feel like their eyes are on their chest; this is because actions are completely different between third-person and first-person.</p>
<p>Actions that are perfectly normal in first-person would be shocking and outrageous in third-person.</p>
<p>And vice-versa.</p>
<p>Therefore, some games allow players to switch between first-person and third-person, and to prevent character movements from appearing strange, they often prepare two sets of animation modules: one for first-person and one for third-person.</p>
<p>But this consequently increases costs.</p>
<p>On VR platforms, however, the restricted field of view design resolves this issue well.</p>
<p>“Hmm... the scene where Lisa just appeared is too bright. Players need to be able to see her silhouette, but not clearly her face.”</p>
<p>“It needs to have that feeling of subtle allure, a sense of mystery, like a pipa player covering half her face with her instrument. That way, when players turn around and are startled by Lisa lunging at them, they can truly feel that thump-thump, like a little deer crashing around wildly in their heart.”</p>
<p>In the project room, Chen Xu was guiding Ruan Ningxue through some modifications to the scene lighting and colors.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, Ruan Ningxue hesitated to speak.</p>
<p>This wasn't a little deer crashing around; this was a crazed elephant charging into one's heart!</p>
<p>Qin Yi and the others beside them also silently lowered their heads.</p>
<p>During this period, the development of Dark Souls Prequel's promotional trailer was also very smooth, as the gameplay Expo drew closer.</p>
<p>The company had already begun preparations for the exhibition, and the Dark Souls Prequel trailer was almost complete.</p>
<p>Currently, Qin Yi and his team had already begun scene construction, and they also learned a bit about what Chen Xu called the VR demo.</p>
<p>And the more they learned, the more their little hearts couldn't quite handle it.</p>
<p>Because Silent Hill PT was a DEMO prepared for a new type of VR test, the VR prototype machine sent over by the Game Department was in a locked state and could not actually be experienced or played.</p>
<p>Of course, to be honest, none of Qin Yi's team actually wanted to try it out, as just watching it was enough to make their hearts tremble.</p>
<p>There was also a more crucial point: this DEMO, which only lasted about 30 minutes in length...</p>
<p>Its puzzles could only be described as terrifying, even utilizing the game crash mechanism seen in Undertale.</p>
<p>The clues for solving the puzzles and clearing the DEMO were buried in collectible photo fragments within the game, as well as in error text prompts that appeared during crashes.</p>
<p>If players couldn't figure out this information, they would be trapped in an endless loop within this eerie room and corridor.</p>
<p>Coupled with the horror tag, Qin Yi and his team, who had previously felt Dark Souls Prequel was full of malicious design, suddenly had a feeling at this moment: Dark Souls Prequel was actually so wholesome!</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Days quickly passed, and the gameplay Expo was approaching. The company had already begun planning for this exhibition.</p>
<p>Of course, calling it planning was a bit of an exaggeration; in reality, there wasn't much to plan.</p>
<p>It would be similar to last year, except two unique themed areas would be added this time.</p>
<p>The two themed areas for It Takes Two and Dark Souls. Unlike last year, when the promotional trailer was released as the grand finale on the last day, this year would be different.</p>
<p>There was no need for suspense this year, as there was only one promotional video.</p>
<p>It would simply be presented to all players on the first day, and that would be that.</p>
<p>After it was shown, players could do whatever they wanted, as the only major highlight would have already been revealed.</p>
<p>While the company was preparing, Chen Xu also took the finished Silent Hill PT to the Game Department to hand it over.</p>
<p>“It's only been less than 20 days, and you've already finished!?”</p>
<p>Yang Chen, the head of the Game Department, looked astonished when he heard Chen Xu's report.</p>
<p>“It's mainly because the content volume of the Silent Hill PT DEMO isn't much,” Chen Xu said with a smile, handing over some relevant materials to Yang Chen.</p>
<p>Picking up Chen Xu's documents, Yang Chen glanced at them.</p>
<p>As the head of the Game Department, Yang Chen wasn't completely ignorant. After looking through the relevant bills and project content in the subsidy application documents, he understood.</p>
<p>Because Chen Xu had provided too few project categories, and the entire DEMO basically revolved around a single scene.</p>
<p>“Chen Xu, although the subsidy here is based on content volume, the main purpose this time is to better test the immersive feedback of the new version VR. Funds shouldn't be wasted, but don't try to save money for the Game Department either,” Yang Chen said with a wry smile, shaking his head. He had a guess in mind: Chen Xu was probably young and inexperienced, so he tried to save money wherever possible.</p>
<p>“Minister, don't worry! This game looks simple, but it's quite special and will definitely serve as an excellent test,” Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Alright, as long as you're confident. If the results aren't good later, you can rework and revise it. Just remember not to save funds for us then.”</p>
<p>“I'll have Xiao Zhang accompany you to the park. There are quite a few designers there right now learning about the relevant parameters. Your DEMO can serve as a showcase then, and you designers can also exchange experiences developing on the new version VR equipment. For the new version VR equipment, not only the testers but also your developers' experiences are very important,” Yang Chen said to Chen Xu.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>After leaving the Game Department building, Chen Xu drove with Xiao Zhang to the research park.</p>
<p>Many designers were listening to the explanations of various VR equipment parameters at the research park.</p>
<p>Among them were some new faces, clearly senior designers who had joined the Game Department later and were reporting in.</p>
<p>There were also some they had met before, such as the enthusiastic Teacher Meng.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, your DEMO is finished!?”</p>
<p>Meng Zuo was dumbfounded, just like Yang Chen earlier, when he heard Chen Xu state his purpose.</p>
<p>During this time, he had also conversed with Chen Xu a few times.</p>
<p>However, he was also working on his own design, so regarding Chen Xu's DEMO, he knew nothing beyond it being a horror theme.</p>
<p>His main reason for coming today was to better understand the relevant parameters of the VR equipment, to facilitate content adjustments.</p>
<p>And now Chen Xu appeared and told him the DEMO was already finished?</p>
<p>“Mainly because the game is quite unique, and its scale isn't very large,” Chen Xu said with a smile, nodding.</p>
<p>The staff at the research park also looked surprised; clearly, they hadn't expected testing material to be ready so quickly.</p>
<p>While Chen Xu was chatting, the staff there also informed them that all the test preparations were complete.</p>
<p>“It's a shame that besides the testers who have passed physical examinations and reviews, we designers can't experience it. Otherwise, I would really like to personally try out your game, Mr. Chen,” Meng Zuo said with some regret.</p>
<p>Some designers, both known and unknown to Chen Xu, were also chatting, clearly looking forward to the DEMO Chen Xu was about to test.</p>
<p>After all, this was the first officially playable DEMO on the new version VR equipment, and given that Chen Xu's works over the past two years had been very distinctive, they felt that this game called Silent Hill PT might provide them with considerable inspiration.</p>
<p>The only regrettable thing was that they couldn't experience it themselves; otherwise, they could better understand the game designer's intentions.</p>
<p>“Hmm... I think, Teacher Meng, you might change your mind later,” Chen Xu chuckled.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, the surrounding designers didn't speak, merely smiled.</p>
<p>After all, they were all colleagues, and they had to show each other some respect.</p>
<p>A horror theme? How big of a deal could that be?</p>
<p>As game designers, what kind of major difficulties hadn't they seen?</p>
<p>It's just a horror game! They had all played Chen Xu's Outlast before.</p>
<p>Sharing the same mindset were the testers who were preparing for the experience.</p>
<p>Only one device was prepared, but three testers were on duty today.</p>
<p>The three decided who would go first by playing rock-paper-scissors.</p>
<p>“I concede, I'll take the first experience,” a young man with a buzz cut, 1.85 meters tall, chuckled at his two disappointed colleagues. His work badge bore his name: Li Yue.</p>
<p>His two colleagues were named Tao Fa and Ye Xun. Both looked quite strong in build, as the work of testing experiences was rather specialized, and personnel were carefully selected.</p>
<p>“What a shame, I've always really liked Chen Xu's games,” Tao Fa said regretfully.</p>
<p>“Exactly, but don't get scared stiff later, okay?” Ye Xun said.</p>
<p>“Heh heh, it's not like I haven't experienced various materials on the new VR equipment before, right? All sorts of bloody and terrifying scenes have been tested. Why would I be scared?” Li Yue scoffed.</p>
<p>While the three were chatting, Chen Xu and his group had entered a room. Directly in front of them was a large LCD screen, which, according to the staff nearby...</p>
<p>...would display the player's game screen.</p>
<p>Soon, after Li Yue was checked by the staff and confirmed to be fine, he entered the gaming pod with anticipation.</p>
<p>As a young man, Li Yue naturally enjoyed playing games, and he was certainly no stranger to Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Now, having the opportunity to experience the first game DEMO created by the other party for the new era VR equipment, still made him extremely excited, even thrilled.</p>
<p>Carrying this excitement and anticipation, he officially launched the test DEMO, Silent Hill PT, from within the gaming pod.</p>
<p>First three updates, will continue tonight~ but it might be a bit late.</p>
