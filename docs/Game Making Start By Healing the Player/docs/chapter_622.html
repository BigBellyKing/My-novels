                <p>Chapter 621: Give Us Back Our Girls! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>“<em>Detroit: Become Human</em> is less a depiction of the future world and more an exploration of human nature.”</p>
<p>“For example, why are all the androids in the game designed to be human-shaped? This primarily aims to create a sense of empathy for the androids, making people subconsciously perceive them as humans rather than robots.”</p>
<p>“Just as the uncanny valley theory suggests, when robots resemble humans but aren't entirely identical, people feel fear. But when they are completely identical, people feel a sense of familiarity, subconsciously treating them as humans.”</p>
<p>“This includes the experiences of Markus, Connor, and Kara, and other androids in the game. It isn't meant to show what a future world with android technology truly looks like.”</p>
<p>Chen Xu spoke to the reporter in front of him.</p>
<p>After all, there are some rather illogical aspects in the game, such as whether ordinary working androids need such a high level of intelligence, or need to be made into human-like forms.</p>
<p>One could say that <em>Detroit: Become Human</em> doesn't aim to explore some future world; it simply discusses stories about human nature, incidentally telling a tale that can move players.</p>
<p>As for what players take away from this story, that's entirely up to them.</p>
<p>After the interview with Chen Xu concluded and she was escorted away by staff, the female reporter, holding the interview materials in the elevator, felt a wave of dizziness.</p>
<p>This interview's rhythm was completely thrown off!</p>
<p>And how come, listening to Mr. Chen's introduction, she felt like he said a lot, yet at the same time said nothing at all?</p>
<p>The female reporter with the recording pen fell into a daze.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Soon, Chen Xu's interpretative interview about <em>Detroit: Become Human</em> was released.</p>
<p>Audiences who watched it were equally bewildered.</p>
<p>Just like the reporter who conducted the interview, many players also felt that Mr. Chen was pulling a fast one on them!</p>
<p>However, while sensing that something was subtly amiss, they couldn't quite pinpoint it.</p>
<p>Was there anything wrong with these statements? Absolutely!</p>
<p>Upon hearing these remarks, many viewers' first thought was: What the heck is he talking about?!</p>
<p>But reviewing it from the beginning, especially for players who had played <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>,</p>
<p>They found that, when combined with the game's content, it actually made a lot of sense!</p>
<p><em>Detroit: Become Human</em> already had high popularity, and after this interview was broadcast, the game once again became a hot topic.</p>
<p>Although everyone felt that Mr. Chen was talking nonsense, they couldn't come up with examples to refute him?</p>
<p>These points also made many players curious.</p>
<p>As is well-known, curiosity leads to desire.</p>
<p>Thus, the sales of <em>Detroit: Become Human</em> continued to grow and break records, being the first game to use brainwave technology after all.</p>
<p>At the same time, after many casual players played it, their focus gradually shifted from artificial intelligence and brainwave technology to the content of <em>Detroit: Become Human</em> itself.</p>
<p>After all, artificial intelligence, for ordinary players, was simply too distant.</p>
<p>Comparatively, the stories of the three protagonists in the game moved them more.</p>
<p>Of course, amidst the emotion, another hot topic quickly soared to the headlines.</p>
<p>That was, players discovered that Chloe had disappeared!</p>
<p>In Nebula World, Song Ren stared blankly at his empty island.</p>
<p>Originally, there was a very beautiful and adorable girl there: Chloe.</p>
<p>But now?</p>
<p>She was gone!</p>
<p>After just finishing <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>, Chloe displayed a very human-like scene, so under the intertwining emotions at the time, Song Ren hardly thought twice and directly gave Chloe her freedom.</p>
<p>But now, it seemed the freedom he gave was too much, and he had to bear all the pain himself.</p>
<p>He originally thought she would just disappear for a day or two, but now?</p>
<p>The game had been online for four days, and there was no news of Chloe!</p>
<p>There were many players like Song Ren.</p>
<p>After finishing the game, with that emotional stir inside, coupled with the adorable and beautiful Chloe's pleading, who could bring themselves to refuse?</p>
<p>But after making the promise, the girl really disappeared!?,br/&gt;
Suddenly, players erupted in an uproar.</p>
<p>‘Damn it, damn it, Old Geezer Chen Xu! Give me back my Chloe!’</p>
<p>‘Exactly, exactly! Where’s my adorable girl! We paid money for her!’</p>
<p>‘Ahem, bro upstairs, Chloe is free. The other decorations were paid for, and they haven't disappeared. Only Chloe is gone.’</p>
<p>‘???????! This damn Old Geezer! He planned this from the start?’</p>
<p>‘I don't care! Anyway, Mr. Chen, you have to give me back my Chloe!’</p>
<p>‘That’s right, give us back our girls! The androids in the game become deviant and escape because they’re abused. My Chloe was served well, never lacked good food or drink, and was meticulously dressed up!’</p>
<p>‘+1, I don’t care about anything else. Can Old Geezer give me back my wife?’</p>
<p>‘I’m so sad, if only I had known, I wouldn’t have agreed to let Chloe leave.’</p>
<p>‘Bro upstairs, you can't think that way. If you didn’t let Chloe leave, her expression would have been heartbreaking. We need to be united. How can you complain and then take the blame yourself? We must condemn Old Geezer!’</p>
<p>In an instant, Chen Xu's official Weibo account was quickly bombarded by excited players.</p>
<p>The players' address for Chen Xu immediately changed to “Old Geezer.”</p>
<p>Calling him “Mr. Chen” before was a sign of respect, but now that the girls were gone, did he still expect to be called “Mr. Chen?”</p>
<p>Calling him “Old Geezer” was already being polite enough! Didn't they believe that they would bring a box of knives and block the entrance of Nebula Games for a whole week?</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games, Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin, among others in the team, looked at Chen Xu with emotion, observing the player uprising online.</p>
<p>As expected of Mr. Chen, he always managed to stir up the players.</p>
<p>“So, Mr. Chen, is Chloe really confiscated from the players?” Yang Xin asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, Mr. Chen, this is a bit too cruel. Many players already consider Chloe their good friend,” Ruan Ningxue also nodded.</p>
<p>Such feelings were very normal. Even with ordinary character illustrations, many players would project their emotions onto them, let alone Chloe in Nebula World, who was a VR immersive model, and even applied some simple AI expressions, showing a human touch.</p>
<p>“How could she be confiscated from players? Chloe will definitely come back. Forget it, I'd better give players a heads-up in advance,” Chen Xu sighed.</p>
<p>How could they think he was so evil?</p>
<p>Hurting players' feelings, was that something he would do?</p>
