                <p>Chapter 538: Bringing joy to players, I never forget my original intention (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games' official forum community, a topic post titled 'Mr. Chen, can we get some normal human stuff done?' was highly upvoted.</p>
<p>In this post, the user was a loyal long-time fan of Nebula Games, having been a dedicated player since Chen Xu's first 'shooting' game, Mirror (Game).</p>
<p>In the post, this veteran player passionately recounted Nebula Games' artistic performance over the years.</p>
<p>The witches, Zombie, and Dark Elf in Mirror (Game), and later the adorable Overcooked (Chinese title) and It Takes Two; although there were unexpected detours into the 'underworld' like Outlast, overall, it was still very exciting.</p>
<p>But looking at some recent games, the user felt that Mr. Chen's monster designs had simply gone and never returned!</p>
<p>Hades (Game) aside for now, as it's a game with a comic-style art anyway.</p>
<p>Look at Bloodborne, besides a Doll Sister and Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower, is there anyone else good-looking?</p>
<p>Before the game's release, many players were extremely excited about Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower, only to find out after playing the game that she was the <em>only</em> good-looking character in the entire game!</p>
<p>You know, in the Dark Souls series, besides the Fire Keeper, there are also characters like Yuria, the Red and White Spider, Gwyndolin, Gwynevere, and many more!</p>
<p>Then, when it comes to The Witcher: Wild Hunt, while the game's content is indeed explosive, Novigrad is full of popular figures, including Triss, Yennefer, Ciri, and other characters, who are utterly beautiful.</p>
<p>But the crucial point is that the enemies in the game are also extremely grim!</p>
<p>As soon as this post was published, it immediately garnered a huge response, becoming a hot topic in the community forum.</p>
<p>However, what truly made the post explode in popularity was a reply from Chen Xu.</p>
<p>At first, players thought it was a fake account, until they saw the Nebula Games LOGO verification next to the ID.</p>
<p>As for the content of Chen Xu's reply, it was also very simple.</p>
<p>'Regarding the feedback about everyone being quite startled, and the concerns about future design directions, I have received your feedback here.'</p>
<p>'On my business card, I am the supreme leader of Nebula Games; in my mind, I am a game developer; and deep in my heart, I am a player.' [Note 1]</p>
<p>'Bringing joy to all players, this is the purpose of Nebula Games and also my wish. I have never forgotten my original intention.'</p>
<p>'Here, I can reveal a piece of news to everyone in advance: on September 1st, Nebula Games will hold a carnival, located at the Nebula Games Theme Park.'</p>
<p>'At that time, in addition to related performances such as Rainbow Six Siege, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Warcraft competitions, and concerts.'</p>
<p>'At the carnival, we will unveil Nebula Games' brand-new upcoming works and development plans.'</p>
<p>'Of course, before that, we are about to present all players with a gift: a brand-new cooperative mini-game, to mend everyone's once-injured hearts, and also to let everyone know that Nebula Games has always been a developer dedicated to bringing joy to players.'</p>
<p>Chen Xu's reply, it can be said, surprised many players.</p>
<p>News about Nebula Games' headquarters and the theme park's content had actually been hyped online a couple of years ago; corresponding Concept Art and local aerial real-life footage had also been reported by major media outlets.</p>
<p>Many players sighed, 'It's good to be rich!' Additionally, there were two main subway lines that went directly there, and whether horizontally or vertically, walking from the exit took no more than 600 meters, so transportation was quite convenient.</p>
<p>Of course, these weren't actually the players' main concerns. If the theme park opened later, many players might specifically go on a 'pilgrimage,' but for the players, the real focus was still the games.</p>
<p>Chen Xu's simple official Weibo account post had actually revealed a lot.</p>
<p>For example, Nebula Games' upcoming development plans would be announced at the carnival.</p>
<p>And there was also a brand-new mini-game?</p>
<p>The forum community, Tieba official Weibo accounts, and various player groups were all discussing the related topics and content.</p>
<p>At the same time, on the day after Chen Xu's reply, Nebula Games' official Weibo account and official website had also updated with corresponding content.</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games' office, Chen Xu stretched lazily.</p>
<p>Regarding the Nebula Games Carnival, it had actually been decided upon long ago.</p>
<p>It just wasn't him who was promoting and in charge of it.</p>
<p>The Nebula Games employee headquarters area was still under construction.</p>
<p>However, it was divided into different areas, and the publicly accessible theme park was not wholly-owned by Nebula Games. After all, a large portion of the theme park's audience wasn't actually adults, but children.</p>
<p>Therefore, some well-known domestic and international film and television entertainment companies with cartoon IPs had related collaborations with Nebula Games, which was a win-win situation.</p>
<p>Of course, the main core theme was still established around Nebula Games' IP games.</p>
<p>This time wasn't considered an official grand opening. Although it had already passed three rounds of internal testing, for the public, tickets would be distributed for free.</p>
<p>Any player who had made a purchase on the Nebula Games Platform could participate in a lottery.</p>
<p>As for the slots, there were 3000 domestically and also 3000 overseas.</p>
<p>Of course, souvenirs, collectible figures, and food and drinks inside the park still needed to be paid for by the players themselves.</p>
<p>Accompanying this...</p>
<p>While players were eagerly discussing, many Nebula Games employees were also excitedly chatting.</p>
<p>After all, the opening of the new park, especially one of this scale, was quite capable of inspiring a sense of pride in everyone.</p>
<p>'Mr. Chen, are we going to make joyful games next?' In the office, Ruan Ningxue and the others were visibly excited, but also a little curious.</p>
<p>After all, according to Chen Xu's previous statement, they were going to bring some joyful games to players?</p>
<p>However, at hand, putting aside the works of other teams under their umbrella...</p>
<p>Their core team actually had only two main tasks at hand.</p>
<p>Those were the development of The Witcher: Wild Hunt's DLCs, 'Hearts of Stone' and 'Blood and Wine.' Although called DLCs, their scale was so massive that they were almost entirely equivalent to sequels.</p>
<p>But in the midst of development, they couldn't see how this was related to joy.</p>
<p>Among them, Blood and Wine's new setting, Toussaint, was like a fairytale world, while Hearts of Stone felt like a deep, dark fairy tale.</p>
<p>'You don't need to worry about the joyful games part; I just need to pull some people from a mini-game team. Aside from 'Hearts of Stone' and 'Blood and Wine,' your main responsibility will be two new titles,' Chen Xu said with a bright smile. 'One will be a Switch exclusive, and the other will be a sequel to one of our FPS masterpieces from last year.'</p>
<p>Last year, an FPS masterpiece!?</p>
<p>Did they release an FPS masterpiece last year!?</p>
<p>'Uncharted!? But that's not right, Nathan Drake's story has already concluded perfectly!' Yang Xin scratched her head, a little puzzled.</p>
<p>From what she knew of Chen Xu, it was clear that the Uncharted series had perfectly concluded. He wouldn't gild the lily by bringing Drake back out. Could it be his brother Sam's story?</p>
<p>But Qin Yi and Meng Zuo, standing nearby, seemed to have realized something, and they both swallowed nervously.</p>
<p>'E-Ethan's story?'</p>
<p>This quote was said by Satoru Iwata at the GDC game development conference in 2005~it's still deeply remembered to this day~</p>
