                <p>Chapter 191: Team Gets Farmed by the BOSS! (Fourth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Inside the room, Song Ren fell silent.</p>
<p>'YOU DIED!'</p>
<p>These three blood-red words were all too familiar.</p>
<p>However, Song Ren's attention was still focused on the battle just now.</p>
<p>It lingered on his fierce battle with Artorias.</p>
<p>Originally, he thought it was just a straightforward chain of combat actions and skills, and that being able to roll-cancel attack animations was already outrageous enough.</p>
<p>But he was still too naive; he never expected the BOSS would actually use feints.</p>
<p>It clearly had the stance for a straight thrust, how did it suddenly turn into a roll?!</p>
<p>And as such a huge BOSS, how could it be so nimble?</p>
<p>If he weren't challenging a BOSS, Song Ren even felt that this Artorias might have been controlled by a skilled Dark Souls player.</p>
<p>This damn thing could only be described as 'outrageous'!</p>
<p>“This Artorias in Death Mode is so powerful!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Old Song was beaten without any chance to retaliate!”</p>
<p>“The main thing is he’s too cool! This is truly the legendary Wolf Knight Artorias, one of the Four Knights of Gwyn!”</p>
<p>“Exactly, when playing the previous game, I originally thought the Farron Undead Legion was already cool enough, but Artorias in his prime is just unbelievably cool!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, no wonder the Farron Undead Legion became Artorias' fanboys, even directly cosplaying his attire.”</p>
<p>“But it's a shame they didn't cosplay him completely. Artorias clearly used a shield; he only left his great barrier shield behind to protect Sif the Great Grey Wolf.”</p>
<p>Zhang Yi and Wang Han chatted back and forth, discussing Artorias' amazing performance.</p>
<p>As for Wang Yifan and Joey, the two of them were each eating a slice of watermelon.</p>
<p>Because they had been busy before, although they had also bought Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame, they hadn't really played it yet. So they couldn't really understand how outrageous Artorias truly was; they just thought he was cool.</p>
<p>“I think this mode might not be suitable for me for now,” Song Ren sighed, interrupting Zhang Yi and Wang Han's conversation, attempting to end the current awkward mood.</p>
<p>Although in this first encounter, he managed to take down one-fifth of Artorias' health.</p>
<p>But it was clear this one-fifth health belonged to Artorias' first phase, and the changes weren't significant.</p>
<p>Simply put, this was Chen Xu's mercy.</p>
<p>After all, a player who just met a BOSS and hadn't even exchanged blows yet would be instantly killed.</p>
<p>How devastating would such a blow be to a player's psyche!</p>
<p>So, generally in the first playthrough, even with a 'cheese' weapon like the Guandao, as long as one understood the BOSS's basic skills and had some foundational skill.</p>
<p>For some BOSSes on the first encounter, they could still withstand a couple of attacks.</p>
<p>And clearly, this upper limit of withstanding a couple of attacks was one-fifth of the BOSS's health.</p>
<p>After players took down one-fifth of the BOSS's health, the BOSS would directly enter the next phase; its moves and the pace of combat would change completely, and that's when the real challenge began.</p>
<p>Hearing Song Ren's words, Zhang Yi, beside him, glanced at him: “Don't use words like 'think' or 'for now'. Let's be blunt, this mode isn't for us!”</p>
<p>Even though he hadn't personally tried it, he could feel it just by watching.</p>
<p>Artorias in his first phase wasn't too difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>But Artorias in his second phase was a bit terrifying.</p>
<p>Moreover, this was a BOSS, not an ordinary player.</p>
<p>Regarding his own strength, he still had some self-awareness.</p>
<p>“Not necessarily, this allows for multiplayer teaming! How about we team up, Old Zhang, and we don't have to fight Artorias – he's too formidable in the lore. Let's go play the previous game and pick on his fans instead!”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Song Ren felt more and more confident: “Exactly, let's pick on his fans, the Farron Undead Legion! If we can't beat the idol, can't we beat his fans? Besides, although Death Mode adjusts and compensates attributes, there are still various playstyles, and our 'well-rounded' builds will definitely have a slight advantage.”</p>
<p>“I can join for the previous game too!” Wang Yifan, beside him, said.</p>
<p>For the new game, he was still on a completely new account; his current progress had only just reached Blighttown, and he hadn't even rung the bell yet.</p>
<p>But for the previous game, he still had some say; without the option to level-lock, his account had long since become 'well-rounded'.</p>
<p>“Alright,” Zhang Yi pursed his lips, “But I bet we'll still get stomped.” His hands didn't stop moving, and he quickly opened Dark Souls.</p>
<p>Wang Yifan also opened and entered the game. Having left it running in the background earlier, the two of them had already updated the version.</p>
<p>After entering the game, all three teleported to the Firelink Shrine, then activated Death Mode, and then teleported to the fog gate of the Farron Undead Legion.</p>
<p>Then, Zhang Yi left a summon sign on the ground, and through friend mode, they searched for the sign, entering Zhang Yi's world.</p>
<p>All necessary buffs were applied, then the three of them entered the fog gate.</p>
<p>The BOSS stood motionless in the distance, just like Artorias when Song Ren fought him earlier.</p>
<p>Clearly, players needed to approach to attract the BOSS's aggro and officially start the BOSS battle.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, Song Ren, and Wang Yifan discussed it. Because they didn't know how multiplayer mode worked yet, they decided to temporarily maintain a strategy of one person drawing aggro and the other two seizing the opportunity to deal damage.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi took two steps forward, then the background music abruptly changed, and a member of the Farron Undead Legion was successfully aggroed.</p>
<p>Wielding the Farron Greatsword, it charged over, swinging.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, Song Ren, and Wang Yifan proceeded to gang up on the Farron Undead Legion.</p>
<p>“This feels much easier!”</p>
<p>“Yeah! Just be careful not to get one-shot and it'll be fine!”</p>
<p>Zhang Yi and Song Ren exchanged combat tips.</p>
<p>In multiplayer mode, the BOSS's health, stats, etc., were all increased.</p>
<p>Moreover, the BOSS wouldn't necessarily keep attacking one person, but had random aggro.</p>
<p>This made it a bit tricky. Otherwise, two people could completely tank it in melee, and the other person could deal damage with spells from a distance, since there was no friendly fire.</p>
<p>But now, that was clearly not possible; almost every BOSS had a skill to quickly close distances.</p>
<p>Coupled with the fact that the BOSS's attack frequency and moves in Death Mode were different from usual.</p>
<p>Being attacked instantly after trying to keep distance was still very hard to dodge.</p>
<p>Even so, fighting together in this first phase with three people still felt quite easy.</p>
<p>After all, the Farron Undead Legion was different from other BOSSes; first, they faced ordinary Farron Undead Legion members, and after defeating them, the Wolf Blood within the members would gather, and they would become a powerful Lord of Cinder.</p>
<p>Soon, the BOSS entered its second phase.</p>
<p>“Wait, where are the red-eyed members who attack indiscriminately in a daze?!”</p>
<p>As the second and third Farron Undead Legion members stood up, Song Ren and Zhang Yi quickly realized something was off.</p>
<p>According to the original normal flow, there should have been red-eyed members fighting each other!</p>
<p>Many players, when fighting the Farron Undead Legion, the health they lost before the Wolf Blood gathered was all taken by the red-eyed members killing each other, rather than by themselves.</p>
<p>But now, where were the red eyes?</p>
<p>Moreover, these revived Farron Undead Legion members, although they didn't have BOSS health bars, their attack patterns were exactly the same as the BOSS's!</p>
<p>They even cooperated with each other.</p>
<p>Just as Zhang Yi was about to circle behind the BOSS, whose aggro Song Ren had drawn, to land a heavy hit, one of the two BOSSes that were originally ganging up on Wang Yifan immediately came over to attack him, forcing him to switch to defense.</p>
<p>“The Abyss Watchers, they are not one person, but a group of Undead. They spontaneously formed the Farron Undead Legion, swearing an oath by the Wolf Blood to watch over the Abyss. As long as there is even a slight sign of the Abyss, they will stop at nothing, even if it means destroying a nation.”</p>
<p>“According to the conjectures of the Souls scholar masters, High Lord Wolnir's nation was destroyed, sealed, and monitored by the Farron Undead Legion. The combined strength of all Farron Undead Legion members is nation-destroying level! Isn't it normal for them to defeat the three of you?”</p>
<p>Wang Han, beside them, ate watermelon with Joey while explaining the background and origins of the Farron Undead Legion.</p>
<p>“Sister Han is right!” Joey chimed in while eating watermelon!</p>
<p>While they were talking, with the Farron Undead Legion's tacit cooperation, the three-person squad was already wiped out.</p>
<p>In multiplayer mode, the number of certain BOSSes would also increase.</p>
<p>For example, the Farron Undead Legion that players would face, did they think that team mode would let them fairly outnumber the BOSS?</p>
<p>Sorry, but they had more people than you!</p>
<p>This wasn't teaming up to farm the BOSS; this was clearly teaming up to be farmed by the BOSS!</p>
<p>“I think this is no longer our realm,” Song Ren coughed.</p>
<p>“I think so too,” Wang Yifan nodded.</p>
<p>“Exactly!” Zhang Yi made the final summary.</p>
