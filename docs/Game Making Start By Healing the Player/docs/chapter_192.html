<p>Chapter 191 Team Up and Get Farmed by the BOSS! (Fourth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>Inside the room, Song Ren fell silent.</p>
<p>'YOU DIED!'</p>
<p>Those three blood-red words were far too familiar.</p>
<p>Yet Song Ren's thoughts remained fixed on the previous battle.</p>
<p>On his fierce duel with Artorias.</p>
<p>Originally, he thought it was merely a matter of combat actions and skill chaining—canceling recovery frames with rolling was already excessive.</p>
<p>But he had been far too naive. He never expected the BOSS to actually use feints.</p>
<p>The stance clearly indicated a thrust—how could it suddenly turn into a roll?</p>
<p>And as a BOSS, how could something so massive be so agile?</p>
<p>If this weren't a challenge against a BOSS, Song Ren might have suspected that Artorias was actually being played by a skilled Dark Souls player.</p>
<p>This could only be described with one word: absurd!</p>
<p>"Artorias in Death Mode is incredible!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, Old Song got completely overwhelmed!"</p>
<p>"But he's just so damn cool! This is truly Artorias, one of the legendary Four Knights of Gwyn, the Wolf Knight!"</p>
<p>"Exactly! When playing the original game, I thought the Farron Undead Legion was already impressive, but Prime-era Artorias is just unbelievably cool!"</p>
<p>"Right? No wonder the Farron Undead Legion became Artorias's biggest fans, even copying his outfit directly."</p>
<p>"Though it's a shame they didn't copy everything. Artorias actually used a shield—he left behind the Great Barrier Shield to protect Sif the Great Grey Wolf."</p>
<p>Zhang Yi and Wang Han chatted back and forth about Artorias's astonishing performance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Wang Yifan and Joey each held a slice of watermelon, casually munching away.</p>
<p>They had both purchased Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame, but due to their busy schedules, hadn't played much. They couldn't grasp just how overpowered Artorias truly was—only sensing that he looked extremely cool.</p>
<p>"I think this mode might not be suitable for me right now," Song Ren sighed, interrupting Zhang Yi and Wang Han's conversation, attempting to ease the awkward atmosphere.</p>
<p>Although he had managed to shave off a fifth of Artorias's health on his first attempt,</p>
<p>that fifth clearly belonged to Artorias's first phase, with minimal variation.</p>
<p>Simply put, this was Chen Xu's Mercy.</p>
<p>After all, for a player encountering a BOSS for the first time, being instantly killed before even landing a hit</p>
<p>would be devastating psychologically!</p>
<p>Therefore, even in a first playthrough, using cheese weapons like the Guandao, as long as the player understood the BOSS's basic skills and had some technical foundation,</p>
<p>they could still exchange blows with certain first-time BOSSes.</p>
<p>And clearly, the upper limit of 'exchanging blows' was one-fifth of the BOSS's health.</p>
<p>Once the player dealt one-fifth damage, the BOSS immediately entered the next phase—attacks and combat rhythm changed completely. That was when the real challenge began.</p>
<p>Hearing Song Ren's words, Zhang Yi glanced sideways at him. "Don't use vague terms like 'I think' or 'for now.' Just say it clearly—this mode isn't suitable for us!"</p>
<p>Though he hadn't personally tried it, just watching was enough to tell.</p>
<p>The first phase of Artorias wasn't too difficult to handle.</p>
<p>But the second phase of Artorias was somewhat terrifying.</p>
<p>And this was a BOSS, not an ordinary player.</p>
<p>He had at least some self-awareness about his own skill level.</p>
<p>"Not necessarily. This game supports multiplayer team-up! How about Old Zhang, we form a team? And we don't have to fight Artorias—he's way too strong in the story background. Let's go mess with his fans from the original game instead!"</p>
<p>As Song Ren spoke, the idea grew more convincing. "Exactly! Let's pick on his fans, the Farron Undead Legion! If we can't beat the idol, can't we at least beat the fans? Besides, even though Death Mode applies attribute rectification and compensation, different playstyles still exist. Our balanced stat builds should still have some advantage."</p>
<p>"I can join too, for the original game!" Wang Yifan chimed in from the side.</p>
<p>For this new work, he was still a completely fresh account—his progress had only just reached Blighttown, and he hadn't even rung the bell yet.</p>
<p>But for the original game, he still had some credibility. Without level-locking, his account had long ago become a balanced build.</p>
<p>"Fine, though I suspect we're all destined to get easily defeated," Zhang Yi muttered, pursing his lips. Nevertheless, his hands didn't stop moving as he quickly launched Dark Souls.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Wang Yifan also opened the game. They had both kept it running in the background and had already updated to the latest version.</p>
<p>After entering the game, all three teleported to the Firelink Shrine and activated Death Mode, then teleported to the fog gate of the Farron Undead Legion.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi placed a ground sign and used friend mode to search for the symbol, entering Zhang Yi's world.</p>
<p>All necessary buffs were applied, and then the three entered the fog gate.</p>
<p>The BOSS stood motionless in the distance, just as it had been when Song Ren fought Artorias.</p>
<p>Clearly, the player needed to approach to attract the BOSS's aggro and officially start the battle.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, Song Ren, and Wang Yifan discussed their strategy. Since they didn't know how multiplayer mode worked, they decided to temporarily adopt a method where one person would draw aggro while the other two focused on damage output.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi stepped forward a few paces, and suddenly the background audio shifted dramatically. The Farron Undead Legion member was successfully provoked.</p>
<p>Wielding his Farron Greatsword, he charged forward.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, Song Ren, and Wang Yifan began their assault on the Farron Undead Legion.</p>
<p>"This feels much easier!"</p>
<p>"Yeah! Just be careful not to get instantly killed!"</p>
<p>Zhang Yi and Song Ren exchanged combat insights.</p>
<p>In multiplayer mode, the BOSS's health and numerical stats were increased.</p>
<p>Moreover, the BOSS didn't single out one target for continuous attacks but instead applied random aggro.</p>
<p>This was somewhat troublesome. Otherwise, two players could easily keep the BOSS occupied with melee while the third dealt ranged spell damage—especially since there was no friendly fire.</p>
<p>But now, clearly that wouldn't work. Almost every BOSS had a skill to rapidly close distance.</p>
<p>Combined with Death Mode's increased attack frequency and varied moveset, being caught at range and instantly attacked was extremely hard to dodge.</p>
<p>Still, even so, the first phase felt quite manageable with three players working together.</p>
<p>After all, the Farron Undead Legion was different from other BOSSes. First, players faced regular Farron Undead Legion members. Only after defeating them would the Wolf Blood within them coalesce into a powerful Lord of Cinder.</p>
<p>Soon, the BOSS entered its second phase.</p>
<p>"Wait, where are the red-eyed members who lose consciousness and attack indiscriminately?"</p>
<p>As the second and third Farron Undead Legion members stood up, Song Ren, Zhang Yi, and the others quickly noticed something was off.</p>
<p>According to the normal gameplay flow, there should be red-eyed members attacking each other!</p>
<p>In fact, many players relied on red-eyed members killing the pre-coalescence Wolf Blood enemies instead of doing it themselves.</p>
<p>But now, where were the red-eyed members?</p>
<p>And although these revived Farron Undead Legion members didn't share the BOSS's health bar, their attack patterns were identical to the BOSS's!</p>
<p>Even more surprisingly, they actually began coordinating with each other.</p>
<p>Just as Zhang Yi attempted to circle behind the BOSS—currently drawing aggro from Song Ren—to land a heavy blow, one of the two BOSSes previously attacking Wang Yifan immediately rushed over and attacked him, forcing him to switch to defense.</p>
<p>"The Abyss Watchers aren't a single individual but a group of Undead. They voluntarily formed the Farron Undead Legion, swearing upon Wolf Blood to monitor the Abyss. At the slightest sign of the Abyss, they would destroy even an entire nation without hesitation."</p>
<p>"According to veteran players and Souls scholars, High Lord Wolnir's kingdom was destroyed and sealed under surveillance by the Farron Undead Legion. The combined strength of all Farron Undead Legion members is Nation-Destroying Level. Beating you three isn't normal—it's expected."</p>
<p>From the side, Wang Han, munching on watermelon with Joey, explained the Farron Undead Legion's lore and background.</p>
<p>"Sister Han is right!" Joey agreed while eating.</p>
<p>As they spoke, the three-man team was already wiped out by the Farron Undead Legion's seamless coordination.</p>
<p>In multiplayer mode, the number of certain BOSSes also increased.</p>
<p>For example, when facing the Farron Undead Legion, did you think teaming up meant you could Just Ganging Up on One?</p>
<p>Sorry, they outnumber you!</p>
<p>This wasn't teaming up to farm BOSSes—it was clearly teaming up to get farmed by the BOSS!</p>
<p>"I think... this is beyond our skill level," Song Ren coughed.</p>
<p>"I agree," Wang Yifan nodded.</p>
<p>"Exactly right!" Zhang Yi delivered the final verdict.</p>
