                <p>Chapter 129: Malice Overflowing</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, after overcoming the monsters encountered at the High Wall of Lothric—including the Curse-Rotted Greatwood that fell into the deep pit—even these bosses felt simpler to fight than mobs like the Black Knight.</p>
<p>Some elite monsters encountered along the way, such as the Outrider Knight, Black Knight, and Giant Crab, could even be bypassed entirely.</p>
<p>Regular mobs were slightly tougher than previous monsters, but the difficulty coefficient hadn’t escalated to anything terrifying.</p>
<p>As long as players figured out the attack routines and mechanics of these enemies, they weren’t particularly hard to defeat.</p>
<p>But the core issue was the cost paid before gaining familiarity—death.</p>
<p>Moreover, during combat, players weren’t merely facing enemies.</p>
<p>They also had to contend with the terrain and environment of the map itself.</p>
<p>Inside Farron Keep, for instance, should you endure the thrashing from the toxic pool, or just play it safe and retreat?</p>
<p>Traps combined with enemy placements—this combination alone brought countless players to tears.</p>
<p>Many players even felt that facing the Great Machete Ghru and Darkwraith in Farron Keep was harder than fighting actual bosses.</p>
<p>Yet, at this point, although players were actively complaining about the excessively grim map design, they weren’t directing their anger at <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>After experiencing the earlier levels, they clearly understood what kind of game <em>Dark Souls</em> truly was.</p>
<p>They had also begun to appreciate its unique attraction. Instead, their criticism was squarely aimed at Chen Xu.</p>
<p>After all, he was the true mastermind behind it all.</p>
<p>‘I’m done. What kind of person designs a map like Farron Keep?’</p>
<p>‘Look at my meme. It’s clearly this guy!’</p>
<p>‘Honestly, Mr. Chen, this map design is just too grim!’</p>
<p>‘Haha, I already knew Mr. Chen’s style back during <em>Outlast</em>. He’s finally revealed himself! Warrior of Love? More like Warrior of Deceit!’</p>
<p>‘Well said! But bro upstairs, judging from your Nebula Games Platform account, why have you purchased every single game by Chen Xu? And your linked overseas account shows you’ve played <em>Mirror (Game)</em> for 420.1 hours? You’ve been using that for the past year?’</p>
<p>‘Ahem! Limited resources, and I was young and foolish back then.’</p>
<p>Because of the Farron Keep map, countless players became active on forum communities.</p>
<p>But to many people’s surprise, at this moment, Chen Xu actually shared an official Weibo post from a player complaining about how difficult Farron Keep was, then left a comment underneath.</p>
<p>The post was simple: <em>‘The Farron Keep map is indeed quite difficult—it belongs to the top tier of maps.’</em></p>
<p>Seeing Chen Xu’s reply, countless players were left speechless.</p>
<p>You actually know this map is packed with malice!</p>
<p>But after their brief grumbling, many players began to feel hopeful.</p>
<p>If Farron Keep represented peak-level malice, then surely things would get easier after pushing through it, right?</p>
<p>Of course, some players suspected it wouldn’t be that simple.</p>
<p>And indeed, after barely surviving the Farron Keep area and progressing forward, they quickly realized:</p>
<p>Yes, Farron Keep was indeed a top-tier malice-filled map.</p>
<p>But that didn’t mean the maps ahead were necessarily easier!</p>
<p>After defeating the Farron Breakdance—no, the Farron Undead Legion—and unlocking the entrance to the Catacombs, players fully experienced what ‘love’ truly meant.</p>
<p>The Carthus Swordsmen wielding great machetes and the endless hordes of skeletons were bad enough.</p>
<p>But the traps in this area left countless players bewildered.</p>
<p>Walking along, a row of crossbow bolts would suddenly shoot from the walls, obliterating the player.</p>
<p>Walking along, a massive skeletal boulder would plummet from above, sending you flying.</p>
<p>Random jars and vials sat around—your ADHD self couldn’t resist rolling into them, only to be engulfed by eerie mist that taught you ‘YOU DIED’ all over again.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, players with exceptional talent and hardcore grinders, upon reaching Irithyll Dungeon and the Profaned Capital, faced even greater mental torment.</p>
<p>Beyond the countless malicious, trap-laden environments, the monsters and scenes here made timid players tremble, reminiscent of their <em>Outlast</em> days.</p>
<p>Wretches wailed incessantly. Maggot-ridden Wretches and Cage Spiders delivered pure mental pollution. Corpses shrieked when you tried picking up items from the ground.</p>
<p>After defeating a group of rats and giants, the items they dropped might just be Dung Pies.</p>
<p>Seven Jailers, each wielding red-hot irons, formed the Seven Jailers' Kindling Slaughter Formation, teaching players firsthand what it meant to be Butt-Roasting Experts.</p>
<p>Many players had faced Gundyr the Ash without flinching, gritted their teeth through the High Wall of Lothric, motivated themselves in the Undead Settlement, and finally transformed in Farron Keep.</p>
<p>But here, they broke completely, openly declaring they’d rather keep company with the Crestfallen Warrior.</p>
<p>This fire? Let whoever wants it carry it!</p>
<p>Compared to regular players, who could simply quit if they wanted to,</p>
<p>streamers on various platforms were suffering yet enjoying themselves.</p>
<p>The suffering came from the game’s relentless malice and extreme difficulty—it was absolutely perfect.</p>
<p>The joy came from the fact that players loved watching.</p>
<p>Especially those who had been scared off the game—they loved watching streamers play, feeling a sense of shared struggle.</p>
<p>When the streamer died, they could send sarcastic bullet comments. The joy was indescribable.</p>
<p>Likewise, the popularity of live streams and videos on video platforms fueled the game’s sales and popularity, which steadily climbed.</p>
<p>This brought wave after wave of new players, as everyone understood that playing and watching were two entirely different concepts.</p>
<p>After watching streamers get mentally broken, many viewers thought, <em>‘If I played, I’d definitely do better.’</em></p>
<p>Then, after purchasing the game, they quickly realized it wasn’t that simple at all.</p>
<p>Players responded in various ways.</p>
<p>Some immediately requested refunds.</p>
<p>Some bought it but never played.</p>
<p>Others chose to persevere, gradually awakening a special kind of resilience, discovering the unique texture and charm of the Souls series.</p>
<p>And while everyone else suffered, in the office of Nebula Games, Chen Xu watched his points rise and couldn’t stop smiling.</p>
<p>For <em>Dark Souls</em>, emotional harvesting was simply unstoppable!</p>
<p>Initially, most players contributed Resentment Points.</p>
<p>Later, upon defeating powerful enemies and acquiring better weapons, joy and happiness began to emerge.</p>
<p>This was the hallmark of <em>Dark Souls</em>—it wasn’t merely a game designed to torment players.</p>
<p>Beyond the broken resentment, once players truly immersed themselves and adapted, they could experience numerous satisfying moments.</p>
<p>The joy of growing stronger. The joy of seeing through the producer’s sneaky traps. The joy of discovering new playstyles and routines.</p>
<p>Truly, <em>Dark Souls</em> was a top-tier emotional harvesting machine.</p>
<p>‘The resentment bar is completely overflowing!’</p>
<p>Looking at the golden item he had drawn earlier in his inventory, Chen Xu noticed that among the four different progress bars, the one for Resentment—previously the lowest—was now full.</p>
<p>Clearly, if visualized, it would already be spilling over.</p>
<p>Happiness was just a tiny bit short. Anger and sadness lagged behind, each still missing about one-sixth.</p>
<p>But judging from the current progress, it was only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Leaning back in his office chair, Chen Xu was contentedly observing the numbers when a knock sounded at the door. His assistant Lin Rou’s voice followed.</p>
