                <p>Chapter 74: Workshop Update and Multiplayer Game</p>
<p>Over the past week, Chen Xu had several meetings with representatives from NetDragon and TengHua.</p>
<p>It was basically just one word: hanging around.</p>
<p>The other party expressed interest in acquiring Nebula Games.</p>
<p>He met with their appointed representatives to discuss the acquisition.</p>
<p>Judging from their offer and various terms,</p>
<p>Chen Xu already had a rough idea.</p>
<p>They were interested, but not particularly serious about it.</p>
<p>After a few discussions, the other party stopped contacting Chen Xu, clearly having given up on the idea.</p>
<p>Thus, the matter of acquisition was temporarily laid to rest.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the new version of <em>Overcooked</em> officially launched.</p>
<p>This update came exactly two and a half weeks after the game's initial release.</p>
<p>The main highlight was the opening of the Workshop (modding platform).</p>
<p>Of course, it also included several new official game maps, themes, and dish combinations.</p>
<p>With the new version of <em>Overcooked</em> released, players quickly noticed an additional update package.</p>
<p>They rushed to download and install it.</p>
<p>"Huh? <em>Overcooked</em> actually updated?!"</p>
<p>"For free? New maps, new levels, and this 'Workshop'? Isn't this DLC content? So conscientious!"</p>
<p>"I checked the patch notes—players can actually create their own levels now!"</p>
<p>"Damn it! Is it really that awesome? Let me see!"</p>
<p>Many players updated immediately.</p>
<p>At the same time, discussions exploded in <em>Overcooked</em>'s player community.</p>
<p>After all, this update was somewhat unexpected.</p>
<p>Typically, such content updates would be DLC—meaning paid content.</p>
<p>But this time, <em>Overcooked</em>'s update was completely free.</p>
<p>Secondly, <em>Overcooked</em> had only been on the market for a little over half a month.</p>
<p>Although the popularity of memes related to 'Breakup Kitchen' and 'Friendship Over Kitchen' had slightly declined compared to earlier, the game was still quite popular.</p>
<p>A steady stream of new players continued to join, evident from sales figures and online player counts.</p>
<p>The game clearly had a relatively long lifespan, and this update surprised many players.</p>
<p>After the update, players interested in Level Design began experimenting with <em>Overcooked</em>'s Workshop.</p>
<p>During development, Chen Xu had specifically considered the possibility of players creating their own levels in the future.</p>
<p>Thus, the Creative (mode) was extremely simple and intuitive.</p>
<p>In fact, technically, Chen Xu could have fully integrated these features directly into the game itself,</p>
<p>just like a game from his previous life called Super Mario Maker.</p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, this wouldn’t have been an issue.</p>
<p>But in the end, Chen Xu chose not to.</p>
<p>The main reason was that he hoped to use this to build Nebula Games' player community.</p>
<p>How could player engagement be maintained outside the game?</p>
<p>A stable game community was undoubtedly crucial.</p>
<p>After the new version of <em>Overcooked</em> launched, more and more players began joining the community.</p>
<p>In the meantime, several players had already published custom levels.</p>
<p>However, these were still quite primitive, mostly consisting of simple terrain modifications.</p>
<p>And they weren’t particularly impressive—clearly lacking standout features.</p>
<p>But Chen Xu wasn’t too worried. As long as enough people participated, excellent maps would inevitably emerge.</p>
<p>In fact, the Workshop feature quickly sparked a wave of enthusiasm among players.</p>
<p>And the ways players could cause 'breakups' became even more diverse.</p>
<p>For example, designing a truly grim map yourself and then making someone else (or her) play through it.</p>
<p>In Nebula Games' Workshop community, countless players discussed this update.</p>
<p>"Frogs! This update is insane!"</p>
<p>"Right! It feels like there's so much more content to experience now!"</p>
<p>"Has anyone noticed? Some creators have even made levels designed specifically for smooth solo play!"</p>
<p>"Exactly! Awesome! I can finally cook alone!"</p>
<p>"<em>Overcooked</em>... playing solo? Sending sympathy to that brother!"</p>
<p>"To be honest, before I started playing solo, I actually had a partner too!"</p>
<p>Following the Workshop update for <em>Overcooked</em>, Chen Xu checked online player reviews.</p>
<p>Uniformly Positive Reviews.</p>
<p>However, apart from players, the update didn’t stir much attention elsewhere.</p>
<p>After all, it was just a version update.</p>
<p>But Chen Xu clearly understood that the Workshop feature could significantly extend <em>Overcooked</em>'s Lifespan for quite some time.</p>
<p>How long exactly would depend on the market and players—something beyond his control.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>In the following days, things remained relatively quiet. The main focus was on company expansion.</p>
<p>The entire upper floor had already been negotiated with the Owners and rented out.</p>
<p>Only the renovating remained.</p>
<p>On the personnel side, numerous resumes had been received.</p>
<p>Chen Xu was beginning to consider the next phase.</p>
<p>Users and monetization—these were the two directions Chen Xu was now considering.</p>
<p>But primarily users.</p>
<p><em>Overcooked</em> had gotten off to a strong start.</p>
<p>Currently, the Daily active users on the Nebula Games Platform numbered around 500,000.</p>
<p>All were brought in by <em>Overcooked</em>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the opening of the Workshop, at least in the short term, these users wouldn’t be lost quickly.</p>
<p>But if Nebula Games didn’t make further moves, they inevitably would.</p>
<p>"Multiplayer games—but not ones with a long Development cycle. Also, we should start preparing for real blockbusters. Can’t have zero experience."</p>
<p>Sitting in front of his computer, Chen Xu had already formed a clear Development path for Nebula Games.</p>
<p>In the short term, develop multiplayer games with relatively short Development cycles to rapidly grow the platform and accumulate users.</p>
<p>Second, the Team should begin accumulating experience toward creating a true 3A blockbuster.</p>
<p>After all, when it came time to grow the platform, they’d need at least one 3A title as a Cornerstone title.</p>
<p>Winning first prize in last year’s Game Design Competition, followed by the successful releases of <em>Outlast</em> and <em>Overcooked</em>, had greatly enhanced Chen Xu’s resume.</p>
<p>Although there had been no official notification yet, the resources available in his backend for Official Game Designer ratings had increased by half compared to before.</p>
<p>Developing a large-scale VR version game was still tight in terms of resources and funding.</p>
<p>But for PC, both funding and resources were no longer an issue—the risks were well within acceptable limits.</p>
<p>At this stage, the main bottleneck was the Team’s Technical capabilities. This had been a consideration even during the development of <em>Outlast</em>.</p>
<p>Including this round of hiring new employees, the requirements were much stricter than before.</p>
<p>Essentially, all candidates needed at least four years of Industry-related experience.</p>
<p>The goal was for them to, under his guidance, use the Official Game Engine to deliver Qualified requirements.</p>
<p>Just as Chen Xu was pondering the future Development path of Nebula Games,</p>
<p>the office door was knocked.</p>
