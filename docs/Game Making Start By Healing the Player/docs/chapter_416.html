                <p>Chapter 415: Where Did My Time Go? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Next, Song Ren didn't immediately rush to find the shrines, but instead controlled Link to wander around.</p>
<p>In the nearby swamp, Song Ren discovered two treasure chests.</p>
<p>Just then, using the newly learned Magnesis power, he moved some iron boxes and iron plates to build a bridge across the swamp, and after opening the treasure chests, he obtained several elemental arrows.</p>
<p>At the same time, under a nearby rock, he unexpectedly discovered another Korok.</p>
<p>Accompanied by the enchanting sound of ‘Ya-ha-ha,’ he once again harvested a Korok Seed.</p>
<p>Exploring the Great Plateau bit by bit, Song Ren realized that this game, though seemingly devoid of NPCs and feeling desolate,</p>
<p>actually had a lot of content. In a nearby forest, he met the old man again and learned hunting skills.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a valley, he encountered a Stone Talus BOSS.</p>
<p>The opponent was like a small mountain, and his attacks felt like mere tickles.</p>
<p>Song Ren's first life in the game was lost to this guy.</p>
<p>And it was an instant kill; one punch and those three red hearts were gone.</p>
<p>However, after a bit of contemplation, Song Ren quickly discovered the Stone Talus BOSS's weakness.</p>
<p>Namely, on this BOSS's body, there was a protruding black rock.</p>
<p>If he hit it with a wooden club, the damage wasn't very high.</p>
<p>But in the shrine level for Magnesis power he had cleared earlier, he had obtained a large iron hammer from a treasure chest.</p>
<p>With that, he could knock off a lot of the Stone Talus's health.</p>
<p>Of course, there was also a monster that Song Ren found most challenging: In an abandoned ruin, he encountered some statues called Guardians.</p>
<p>These statues could shoot laser-like beams, instantly killing him.</p>
<p>Even using the shield looted from a Bokoblin, one hit would shatter the shield, and the second hit would kill him.</p>
<p>As for attacking, he felt the opponent had absolutely no weakness.</p>
<p>After dying three times consecutively, Song Ren learned his lesson and avoided them.</p>
<p>He figured this might not be something he could handle at his current stage.</p>
<p>Wandering all over the Great Plateau, Song Ren was having a blast.</p>
<p>“This game is really quite fun!”</p>
<p>Song Ren couldn't help but exclaim.</p>
<p>At this moment, he had just unlocked a new ability called Remote Bomb power.</p>
<p>He could throw out square or circular remote bombs.</p>
<p>And now, he was bomb fishing.</p>
<p>Hmm… literally bomb fishing.</p>
<p>Throwing bombs into the pond, and then detonating them, he could see many fish stunned and floating on the surface of the lake, ready for the taking.</p>
<p>Facing these Hylian fish, bellies up and eyes rolled back, he simply touched them and tucked them into his four-dimensional pocket.</p>
<p>While happily bomb fishing here, Song Ren's phone in his pocket vibrated.</p>
<p>“Holy cow! Where did my time go?!”</p>
<p>Looking at the caller ID and time on his phone, Song Ren's eyes widened, and he froze.</p>
<p>It was almost three o'clock?</p>
<p>He had already been playing for over two hours?</p>
<p>The key was that he felt he hadn't done much at all; he had only cleared three shrines!</p>
<p>It wasn't just Song Ren; other players who immediately started playing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild had the same feeling.</p>
<p>How did time just slip away unnoticed?</p>
<p>They said they'd play for half an hour to experience the game's quality.</p>
<p>How did it get dark before they knew it?</p>
<p>Most crucially, they felt they hadn't even <em>done</em> anything significant in the game!</p>
<p>They hadn't even left the Great Plateau in the early stages, and several hours had already vanished?</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>“No way! I bombed for almost an hour, and all I got were a few springs and gears!”</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, lying on the sofa in the room, had a completely despairing expression on his face. Wang Han, who was also holding a Switch and exploring Hyrule, curiously leaned over.</p>
<p>She saw a destroyed Guardian on Zhang Yi's Switch screen, and his Link was holding a bomb.</p>
<p>“You didn't just bomb it for an hour, did you?” Wang Han looked at Zhang Yi with a speechless expression.</p>
<p>She had also encountered this monster before, but after being instantly killed twice, she wisely left.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhang Yi's posture, he had literally bombed it to death using Remote Bomb power!</p>
<p>“I thought it would drop some divine weapon. I'm so stupid, really.”</p>
<p>“I only knew this monster was powerful and shot lasers; I didn't know it wouldn't drop any weapons…”</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was filled with despair. He had already scavenged plenty of springs and gears from the abandoned Guardians near the dilapidated shrines.</p>
<p>Facing this Guardian, most players, after realizing how powerful they were, would avoid provoking them.</p>
<p>But he was different.</p>
<p>Thinking that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild had no level system, it seemed to be purely about weapon attack power, and there were no equipment attribute requirements or anything like that.</p>
<p>So he thought, if he defeated this monster and it dropped that laser weapon, wouldn't he just waltz through the early game?</p>
<p>Forget about Wild Boar-like monsters; when he got a laser weapon and went 'pew pew pew,' he'd be invincible.</p>
<p>So, after obtaining Remote Bomb power, with great perseverance, he slowly whittled it down to death, bomb by bomb.</p>
<p>And now, his mentality had collapsed!</p>
<p>“Your perseverance…” Wang Han was also speechless.</p>
<p>“Also, just in case you don't know, I've already seen players in the chat group figure out how to defeat this monster; it's like the Longsword's Foresight Slash in Monster Hunter: World. In the game, Link can use a Perfect Guard to deflect the laser back, and it dies in one hit.” Wang Han's words mercilessly struck Zhang Yi's already fragile heart once again.</p>
<p>With the launch of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, unlike VR games which are not easy to play and share simultaneously,</p>
<p>as a game on the Switch, many players were taking screenshots and posting while playing, or discussing their in-game discoveries in chat groups.</p>
<p>While many players were still wandering aimlessly on the Great Plateau, there were also many players actively pushing through the story. These story-driven players quickly reached the game's first village, Kakariko Village.</p>
<p>Along the way, they would encounter shrines, which would teach players about aspects of the combat system.</p>
<p>For example, Perfect Guard, Link Time after dodging, and so on.</p>
<p>Of course, even without visiting these shrines, players could still use these abilities; they just wouldn't know about them.</p>
<p>Among these actions, Link Time after dodging was the easiest for players to naturally perform, because many players would instinctively dodge when fighting monsters.</p>
<p>However, many players didn't know about Perfect Guard, and Zhang Yi was clearly one of them.</p>
<p>“Don't say anymore… I'm mentally exhausted. Let me just take a breather.” Looking at the Switch in his hands, Zhang Yi suddenly felt a bit of weariness.</p>
<p>The first time I played, it wasn't even localized~ When facing the Guardians, I just wanted to blow them up with bombs. In the ruins next to the shrine, I'd climb a wall, throw a bomb, then jump down to dodge the laser… Of course, I eventually gave up, because after taking almost a quarter of its health, one mistake and I'd get hit by the laser…
