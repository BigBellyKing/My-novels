<p>Chapter 232: Industry Earthquake (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>With Nebula Games' official announcement that their platform would be transforming into a comprehensive digital platform,</p>
<p>The entire gaming industry instantly exploded.</p>
<p>Whether players, designers, major game developers, or channel providers, everyone was frantically discussing this monumental event.</p>
<p>"Damn it! Have you heard? Nebula Games Platform is shifting to a comprehensive digital platform! All Game Designer works can now launch on the Nebula Games Platform!"</p>
<p>"How could I not have heard? The real shock is the Commission! Only 25%?"</p>
<p>"Is that true? It sounds too mystical—could it be a scam?"</p>
<p>"What are you thinking? Nebula Games' official Weibo account confirmed it, and they've even released the platform contract terms. The entire industry and players are watching closely—how could it possibly be fake? Besides, doesn't this seem like something Nebula Games had been planning all along?"</p>
<p>"Exactly! 'Minecraft' directly ignited massive player attention, skyrocketing Nebula Games' visibility. And right at this moment, they drop the bomb about platform transformation."</p>
<p>"In a way, it's actually expected. Nebula Games has had an incredibly smooth run these past two years. Have you noticed the subtle details from Nebula Games recently? In the early days, their games launched simultaneously across all major channels, using their own platform with preferential pricing. But in the last two years, titles like 'It Takes Two' and 'Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame' debuted first on the Nebula Games Platform, then later appeared on distribution platforms."</p>
<p>"Right! And this time, 'Minecraft' and earlier 'Don't Starve' didn't appear on any distribution platforms at all. Yet, 'Don't Starve' is nearly approaching ten million in sales, while 'Minecraft' is aiming for twenty million or even higher. This clearly shows one thing: the Nebula Games Platform definitely has a viable paying environment."</p>
<p>"I wonder what Chen Xu is thinking. With such low revenue sharing, are they not making profits anymore? And aren't they challenging the industry's unwritten rules?"</p>
<p>"It's just a price war. Once Nebula Games Platform secures its position, they might revise the commission later. But right now, it's undoubtedly a golden opportunity. The platform still lacks games, so developers who join now will surely receive excellent exposure. With such a massive user base, you're bound to earn something!"</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>A meeting room inside NetDragon Games.</p>
<p>Ma Lei, the President, listened to his subordinates reporting data related to the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>"The domestic channels have always followed a 50-50 split rule. If Nebula Games simply wanted to enter the distribution arena, there'd be no need for such an aggressive approach. Not only are they sacrificing immediate profits, but they're also alienating countless channel providers—essentially declaring war on the entire distribution ecosystem," Ma Lei said gravely, his fingers lightly tapping the table.</p>
<p>"But the key point is that over the past few years, Nebula Games has steadily built up their strength. They've released blockbuster titles like 'Dark Souls,' independent hits like 'Don't Starve,' 'Fall Guys,' and 'Valiant Hearts: The Great War,' as well as medium-scale games such as 'Outlast' and 'It Takes Two.' Combined with the explosive success of 'Minecraft,' Nebula Games now has enough confidence. Their user base is solidified. Even in the worst-case scenario—losing the channel war—they'd still stand unshaken," said Yao Guang, head of the Platform Channels and Content Business Group, sighing with emotion.</p>
<p>"Yes, mainly because 'Minecraft' is just too phenomenal! Just one game alone is enough to secure Nebula Games' position," Ma Lei added helplessly.</p>
<p>Since its release, the game had maintained its popularity, with no sign of slowing down.</p>
<p>Just this one title alone—regardless of sequels—would be enough for Nebula Games to live off for ten years.</p>
<p>And not just that.</p>
<p>Although 'Minecraft' was a buy-to-play game, priced under 100 Yuan even excluding the VR version,</p>
<p>Its massive sales volume had already made Nebula Games extremely profitable.</p>
<p>But that wasn't all. A game's revenue isn't limited to in-app purchases and sales.</p>
<p>For some games, IP-derived income can even surpass the game's own profits.</p>
<p>The block-building gameplay of 'Minecraft' clearly held immense potential for expansion.</p>
<p>Collaborative building block toys, MOD modules, and real-world collaborative toys could be integrated.</p>
<p>For example, including a QR code or serial number with physical collectible figures—once players purchased the real-world toy, they could recreate the structure in-game. To differentiate them from ordinary builds, special features could be added.</p>
<p>Sitting in his office, Ma Lei instantly brainstormed dozens of potential revenue streams for 'Minecraft,' regretting deeply that the game wasn't theirs.</p>
<p>"So, Mr. Ma, what's our next move?" Yao Guang asked, looking at Ma Lei.</p>
<p>"For now, stabilize our relationships with independent game designers across our channels. Lowering our commission can be a backup plan. But honestly, we're not the ones most anxious. TengHua is probably watching the show too. The ones truly panicking are the pure channel platforms without any development capabilities," Ma Lei mused for a moment before replying.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>After Chen Xu announced the transformation of the Nebula Games Platform, although the two industry giants, TengHua and NetDragon, remained on the sidelines,</p>
<p>They quietly began adjusting strategies targeting third-party game developers and designers.</p>
<p>The reason was that NetDragon and TengHua differed from ordinary channel providers.</p>
<p>Though both were China's largest distributors, with channel commissions making up a significant portion of their revenue, they weren't solely reliant on distribution.</p>
<p>However, for pure distribution platforms, the reactions were far more intense.</p>
<p>First, they rushed to sign exclusive publishing deals with numerous independent game designers and second- and third-tier game developers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some channel providers directly attacked Nebula Games and Chen Xu, accusing them of disrupting the gaming market.</p>
<p>The pressure from Nebula Games was simply too great.</p>
<p>If it were just another ordinary game platform trying such a price war,</p>
<p>Without users, without resources—what could possibly attract game designers to join?</p>
<p>Just because of lower commissions?</p>
<p>You still need to actually sell the games!</p>
<p>But Nebula Games was entirely different.</p>
<p>With abundant resources, a massive user base, and ample capital, they were fully capable of entering this distribution war.</p>
<p>In an instant, the entire gaming industry was abuzz with commotion.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chen Xu, the man at the center of the storm, remained remarkably relaxed.</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games' meeting room, a meeting was underway.</p>
<p>"First, everyone is well aware that 'Minecraft' has achieved tremendous success. But this is only the beginning. I believe 'Minecraft's potential goes far beyond this. As more players join and delve deeper into the game, its lifespan will be exceptionally long. Therefore, we must ensure proper Macro operations."</p>
<p>"This includes game history summary programs for players, maintenance of the community environment—these are all essential. We should also consider player and MOD maker needs as appropriate, but everything must revolve around two Core Aspects: 'Free' and 'Creative,'" Chen Xu said, looking at the team.</p>
<p>After a brief pause, he continued, "Additionally, I'm sure you all understand that Nebula Games is currently facing a significant challenge. Therefore, we will develop more complex games and accelerate our progress. If there are staffing shortages, contact HR directly, conduct your own interviews, and I'll make the final hiring decisions."</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu, everyone present was visibly excited.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Nebula Games Platform's unprecedented move—breaking industry norms in distribution—had energized the entire team.</p>
<p>As game developers, no one truly liked the current channels' domineering style.</p>
<p>Now, undoubtedly, Nebula Games was playing the role of a dragon-slaying hero.</p>
<p>This real-world 'RPG' scenario stirred immense enthusiasm across the entire team.</p>
<p>"Next, let me give you an inside scoop on our future plans. For the upcoming period, our focus will shift to large-scale games to further increase player attention on the Nebula Games Platform," Chen Xu said earnestly.</p>
<p>What is the foundation of a game platform?</p>
<p>Blockbuster titles?</p>
<p>Not exactly. The true foundation lies in various independent mini-games and medium-to-small scale games—</p>
<p>Titles like 'Valiant Hearts: The Great War,' 'Don't Starve,' and 'It Takes Two.'</p>
<p>But supporting a platform requires more than just one or two such titles.</p>
<p>Therefore, third-party developers must inevitably be involved.</p>
<p>So how do we attract third-party developers?</p>
<p>Nebula Games is already taking action.</p>
<p>First, lower commissions; second, a larger player base.</p>
<p>And how do we attract more players?</p>
<p>The answer is simple: blockbuster titles—exclusive blockbusters.</p>
<p>"However, before that, Qin Yi, continue your research on the new AI technology. It will be applied to upcoming games," Chen Xu said, turning to Qin Yi.</p>
<p>"Alright, that's all for now. Zhang Yida, stay behind. Everyone else, back to work."</p>
<p>Inside the meeting room, Zhang Yida reported recent developments to Chen Xu.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, there's been a lot of negative news online, along with internet trolls stirring up trouble. We've already signed contracts with Sanyuan and Yihua Law Firm and are preparing to file lawsuits," Zhang Yida reported.</p>
<p>Currently, Nebula Games hadn't established its own legal department, mainly because it wasn't yet necessary.</p>
<p>Thus, legal matters were outsourced, and both firms specialized in civil and commercial law as well as the online domain.</p>
<p>"You handle this part. Also, push forward with platform promotion and outreach to third-party designers and developers."</p>
<p>Chen Xu nodded, emphasizing key points to Zhang Yida, then slowly exhaled and pulled out his phone to check.</p>
<p>All industry chat groups were flooded with +999 unread messages. Numerous designers from the gaming industry who had his contact were privately inquiring about the Nebula Games Platform. The official Weibo account was also swarming with all kinds of comments.</p>
<p>After a moment of thought, Chen Xu opened his official Weibo account and posted a message:</p>
<p>'Just a brief statement regarding Nebula Games Platform's transformation into a comprehensive digital platform.'</p>
<p>'First, this transformation was actually quite foreseeable. The Nebula Games Platform has always been committed to delivering better player experiences—fostering a healthy community environment, offering a rich Workshop, implementing a feedback-driven review system, cloud saves, trophy and achievement tracking—we've consistently aimed to provide the best possible experience.'</p>
<p>'As for the commission rates, a topic of interest among industry peers and players, the answer is simple: Nebula Games isn't trying to wage a price war to eliminate competitors and later raise prices. The 25% commission policy will never change. Moreover, for games receiving excellent player reviews, the commission will be further reduced, down to a minimum of 12%.'</p>
<p>'As for profitability, I can only say that, after deducting costs from current platform and community operations, we achieve a profit margin of approximately 7% under the current commission structure. As our scale expands, this margin can reach 9%–10%.'</p>
<p>'Nebula Games Platform has never sought to monopolize game distribution. Our goal is to provide developers with a more lenient development environment and deliver more fun and engaging games to players.'</p>
<p>'Two updates for now; the rest will follow as usual.'</p>
