                <p>Chapter 92: Done, It's Already in Progress</p>
<p>The promotional video wasn't long. It was just a simple CG cutscene. There was no mention of the game's actual gameplay or content at all.</p>
<p>Yet, it excited all the players. One reason was the sudden surprise, and the other was how incredibly exquisite the promotional video was.</p>
<p>Just watching it was enough for players to feel that Nebula Games must have invested heavily. With this promotional video, combined with Chen Xu's mention of a PC blockbuster, it was clearly very convincing.</p>
<p>If it wasn't a blockbuster, could a promotional video be so impactful?</p>
<p>As the promotional video concluded, the players in the audience cheered and applauded enthusiastically.</p>
<p>'This is amazing! I didn't expect such a pleasant surprise at this year's expo!'</p>
<p>'Who knew Chen Xu was waiting with this! This must be Chen Xu's first major production!'</p>
<p>'So exciting! When Aldrich, Devourer of Gods, and the Farron Undead Legion, and Yhorm the Giant appeared, combined with the background music, it was absolutely electrifying!'</p>
<p>'This is truly shocking, my mom will be talking about it for a year!'</p>
<p>'Anyway, I'm a little impatient to play this game!'</p>
<p>'+1, the expo announced the news, and the promotional video is already out, so the game should be almost ready, right?'</p>
<p>'Definitely! It probably won't be long until we see it!'</p>
<p>'These Farron Undead Legion and Yhorm the Giant must be the BOSSes in the game, right? Just imagining fighting them for three hundred rounds makes me ecstatic.'</p>
<p>The entire audience erupted in excitement, and the commotion also attracted many players from other exhibition areas.</p>
<p>When these players came over and learned that Nebula Games had announced such significant news, they couldn't stay quiet. They shouted from below the stage, demanding Chen Xu play the promotional video again.</p>
<p>At the same time, Nebula Games' booth was completely packed, and even the security staff at the exhibition hall were somewhat overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Male employees from other participating companies, such as Qin Yi, also joined in helping to maintain order at the scene.</p>
<p>There was nothing they could do; just like a street spectacle, sometimes a single spark draws in a huge crowd. This was a kind of herd mentality, especially prevalent at exhibition venues like this.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, many players shouted questions to Chen Xu, who had just stepped off the stage.</p>
<p>"Chen Xu, when will the game <em>Dark Souls</em> be released?!"</p>
<p>"What genre is the new game? Can you tell us about it?"</p>
<p>"Is the new game related to the Warrior of Love?"</p>
<p>The players were incredibly enthusiastic, though some also took the opportunity to tease him. If you're asking about the new game, just ask about the new game, why bring up the Warrior of Love?</p>
<p>Yet, once someone brought it up, others quickly followed suit, and the discussion around that topic grew quite loud.</p>
<p>Chen Xu couldn't pretend not to hear and answered each question one by one.</p>
<p>Smiling, Chen Xu looked at the excited players and nodded slightly: "When will it be released? That depends on the development progress of the team. As this is Nebula Games' first time developing a large-scale game, there are many difficulties to solve besides technical issues."</p>
<p>"However, what I can reveal is that the game is already in progress."</p>
<p>"We hope to create a perfect game for our players, so I cannot give you a specific launch date here, because nobody remembers garbage games released on time."</p>
<p>Hearing this, the players showed satisfied smiles.</p>
<p>Behind the exhibition area, Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and other core development members quietly bowed their heads.</p>
<p>Yes, the development progress was very encouraging. The game was already in progress. When had Brother Xu ever lied to them? The folder had been created two months ago.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chen Xu continued to answer questions at the booth.</p>
<p>"As for the genre of <em>Dark Souls</em>, broadly speaking, it's an ARPG game. But compared to all ARPG games currently on the market, its style is completely different; it will be a brand new type of ARPG."</p>
<p>"Finally, regarding the topic of whether this game has 'love,' I've actually explained it more than once. Every game is filled with my love for the players. As for whether the game itself has a 'love' attribute, it does. Many players should have already felt it from the trailer."</p>
<p>"The setting of <em>Dark Souls</em>, just like its name, depicts a world filled with despair. And it is within this despairing atmosphere that players need to embody a Firelinker and carry the flame throughout this world."</p>
<p>"This is a great love, like Shennong tasted all herbs, or Yu the Great tamed the floods, passing his home three times without entering."</p>
<p>The players at the scene were all extremely excited.</p>
<p>However, at this particular gameplay Expo, the fun <em>Fall Guys</em> and the highly replayable <em>Sanguosha</em> had certainly made their presence strongly felt.</p>
<p>At the same time, many players at the scene mentally prepared themselves: the plot of <em>Dark Souls</em> might be quite grueling.</p>
<p>After all, a world of despair and the task of carrying the flame of hope, coupled with their previous experiences with <em>Outlast</em> and <em>Overcooked</em>, had left them completely numb.</p>
<p>Although the styles of <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em> seemed to bring Chen Xu back to his heartwarming persona as the 'Warrior of Love.'</p>
<p>It was clear, however, that this game called <em>Dark Souls</em> was not going to be a feel-good story with a happy ending.</p>
<p>The desolate and decaying aesthetic was evident even from the promotional video.</p>
<p>So, many loyal fans of Chen Xu were already prepared. What's the big deal if it's a little emotionally taxing?</p>
<p>They had already been put through the wringer before when playing <em>To the Moon</em>.</p>
<p>………………………………</p>
<p>Just as in the first four days of the gameplay Expo, where most players were drawn to <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Sanguosha</em>.</p>
<p>On this final day, all players were captivated by Nebula Games' <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>All players were discussing this game, and the teaser promotional video, released at the expo, was uploaded to Chen Xu's and Nebula Games' official Weibo accounts within two hours, immediately attracting countless discussions from players.</p>
<p>It's safe to say that Nebula Games was the biggest winner of this year's gameplay Expo.</p>
<p>Although their booth wasn't the largest, and the games weren't the biggest in scale, they successfully captured all the attention.</p>
<p>Chen Xu wasn't sure about other game developers and designers. But for Nebula Games, at least, this year's expo was an absolute success.</p>
<p>The next day, inside Nebula Games. Employees who participated in the expo hadn't quite recovered, still excitedly discussing the many interesting things that happened.</p>
<p>"This expo was really interesting!" Ruan Ningxue said, still wanting more.</p>
<p>Yang Xin nodded: "Yeah, and just thinking about how both TengHua and NetDragon brought out their VR games, only for us to steal their thunder in the end, it makes me want to laugh."</p>
<p>"But Mr. Chen, our game? We haven't even initiated the project yet!" Qin Yi scratched his head, looking at Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Ever since returning from the expo, he'd been dwelling on this. Although the promotional video was out, it was essentially just a few of them responsible for it, and the promotional video itself was entirely outsourced.</p>
<p>As for the game itself, they had only produced some concept art drafts.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and a group of other core development members all looked at Chen Xu.</p>
<p>They saw all the online discussions among players, with many naive and optimistic ones even believing that <em>Dark Souls</em> might have gameplay demo footage within just over a month.</p>
<p>But they could only say those players were thinking too much; they knew their own situation. The game literally only had a folder created!</p>
<p>"No rush. And didn't I say at the expo that I couldn't give a definite release date, only that it was 'in progress'? If players ask about the progress, we'll just say it's in progress."</p>
<p>"Moreover, for a game, especially a large-scale production like this, even a PC platform game and not a VR platform game, the development cycle isn't short. What's more, we don't have experience in this area. I'll elaborate once I've finalized the complete concept and design plan."</p>
<p>"For now, follow the two directions I mentioned before: start with the content design for art assets, and the implementation of various actions in the game. Although it's an ARPG, action elements are very crucial in this game."</p>
<p>"Additionally, the operations team needs to keep up with <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em>. For the Nebula Games platform, these two games are still very important at the moment," Chen Xu said, looking at everyone.</p>
