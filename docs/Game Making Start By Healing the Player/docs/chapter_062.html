<p>Chapter 62 Some Modifications</p>
<p>The overall planning of <em>Overcooked</em> was actually relatively simple.</p>
<p>The story aspect was trivial—just basic cutscene CG animations. Unlike <em>To the Moon</em> or <em>Undertale</em>, this wasn't a narrative-driven game.</p>
<p>The true core of <em>Overcooked</em> lay in its map and level design.</p>
<p>Combined with gameplay mechanics like chopping ingredients, washing dishes, and cooking meals, the quality of level design directly influenced the player's actual experience.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game featured various distinct scenes. Each stage had a unique theme, requiring different models, textures, and other assets.</p>
<p>Another standout feature of <em>Overcooked</em> was its gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p>Players would chop ingredients, interact with objects in the environment, wash dishes, and cook.</p>
<p>The numerical design determined the game's difficulty and overall feel.</p>
<p>However, this aspect posed no significant challenge for Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Through the system's gacha pulls, he had recently obtained numerous skill books related to numerical design.</p>
<p>If he were developing a large-scale, data-heavy game such as an RTS or MOBA, it might have been somewhat demanding.</p>
<p>But for <em>Overcooked</em>, it was effortless—especially with the support of Memory Capsules.</p>
<p>Once these core aspects were handled, the remaining elements like music and UI weren't particularly crucial to the game.</p>
<p>Moreover, Chen Xu's main modifications to <em>Overcooked</em> focused on expanding the game's content.</p>
<p>In his previous life, <em>Overcooked</em> had virtually no MOD support.</p>
<p>Creating MODs would have required an enormous workload for players.</p>
<p>And game developers certainly wouldn't release their resources.</p>
<p>After all, the core appeal of <em>Overcooked</em> lay in its gameplay mechanics combined with diverse, dynamic maps.</p>
<p>If players were allowed to create expansions, what would be left for the developers to sell as map DLC?</p>
<p>Of course, this was also because the original development team never considered MOD support during development.</p>
<p>But for Chen Xu, <em>Overcooked</em> would serve as a pilot project.</p>
<p>Unlike in his previous life, games in this Parallel World were mostly built using editor engines.</p>
<p>While MODs were extremely common in his previous life—with some games even being built entirely around MOD gameplay—</p>
<p>In this Parallel World, very few game developers offered MOD support.</p>
<p>One reason was the hassle involved; another was the risk of exposing the game's core numerical data.</p>
<p>Enabling player-made MODs also required restructuring the game's internal resource architecture from a design perspective.</p>
<p>This made most developers reluctant to even consider it.</p>
<p>After all, it was troublesome and offered no immediate financial return.</p>
<p>Yet Chen Xu clearly understood how vital MODs could be for a game.</p>
<p>It wasn't just independent games—major titles could also greatly benefit and gain new life from MODs.</p>
<p>Thus, <em>Overcooked</em> would become an experimental title.</p>
<p>To make MOD creation more accessible, Chen Xu planned to rethink the game's entire architecture, rather than simply opening a port like most games that supported MODs.</p>
<p>Doing so would impose a steep learning curve on players, hindering MOD adoption.</p>
<p>"The Workshop (modding platform) community will require the Nebula Games Platform to play MODs. We'll need to set up a dedicated server for data backup."</p>
<p>"Additionally, we need to rework the Art architecture."</p>
<p>Chen Xu tapped the keyboard, drafting the design concept drafts.</p>
<p>For this part, Chen Xu intended to adopt a block-based splicing structure, similar to Minecraft.</p>
<p>Various in-game devices and items—such as conveyor belts, sinks, cabinets, fire extinguishers, serving stations, stoves, and even large items like hot air balloons—would all be individually movable.</p>
<p>Different background themes, however, would remain fixed—such as glaciers, Regular canteens, or even the world's core…</p>
<p>Seated in front of his computer, Chen Xu meticulously refined the settings for <em>Overcooked</em>.</p>
<p>After a day and a half, he had largely finalized the design concept drafts for <em>Overcooked</em> and was ready to hold a meeting to assign tasks for the new project.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>In a modest-sized meeting room, a group of people sat whispering among themselves.</p>
<p>The door swung open, and Chen Xu walked in.</p>
<p>Seeing Chen Xu arrive, everyone stood up from their seats.</p>
<p>"Have a seat. I'll briefly go over our upcoming development plan," Chen Xu said.</p>
<p>Hearing his words, the team members' faces lit up with excitement.</p>
<p>They had already caught wind of the upcoming new project and were eager to get started.</p>
<p>The success of <em>Outlast</em> had earned them substantial bonuses.</p>
<p>After all, projects meant money—provided they succeeded.</p>
<p>Moreover, the team deeply respected Chen Xu's capabilities.</p>
<p>They had no choice but to respect him—Chen Xu's track record since his debut was impressive enough to command their full attention.</p>
<p>"Unlike <em>Outlast</em>, this time we're shifting focus to develop a game specifically targeting a Spring Festival launch."</p>
<p>"But don't worry—this game's scale won't be large. It's significantly smaller than <em>Outlast</em>."</p>
<p>Chen Xu smiled as he observed their reactions.</p>
<p>However, his expression soon turned slightly more serious.</p>
<p>"Even though this project is smaller in scale, it holds exceptional strategic importance for the company's growth. I intend to use this game, launched during the Spring Festival, to gradually roll out our own platform," Chen Xu stated earnestly.</p>
<p>Most of those present had signed confidentiality and non-compete agreements, so Chen Xu wasn't particularly worried about leaks.</p>
<p>After all, Nebula Games was thriving, and Chen Xu had already hinted at the company's upcoming expansion, along with some ambitious promises.</p>
<p>Even if these plans did leak, it wouldn't matter much.</p>
<p>In the gaming industry—especially among game developers—who didn't dream of building their own channels?</p>
<p>Chen Xu was well aware of this.</p>
<p>Yet the team members, seeing Chen Xu's serious demeanor, responded with equal seriousness—and even greater excitement.</p>
<p>They were all young. No one wanted to stagnate in a company with no ambition.</p>
<p>Of course, this only worked if the company truly had the capability; otherwise, it would just be empty promises and toxic motivation.</p>
<p>"Here's the game we're preparing to develop. These are the concept drafts—take a look."</p>
<p>"After reviewing them, feel free to share any thoughts, suggestions, or ideas regarding promotion."</p>
<p>Chen Xu turned on the projector, and the screen displayed the design concept drafts for <em>Overcooked</em>.</p>
