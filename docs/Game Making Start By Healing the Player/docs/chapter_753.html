                <p>Chapter 752: Two Yuan! Is It Really Worth It For Two Yuan!?</p>
<p>There were no intense jump scare scenes, yet it was actually more terrifying than the appearance of ghosts.</p>
<p>Especially the game's scene layout, it gave Song Ren a full sense of immersion.</p>
<p>Back then, relying on an Infinite Corridor in a DEMO, Nebula Games terrified countless players, and that was just the standard PC version.</p>
<p>This also led many horror games later on to adopt similar confined space designs.</p>
<p>If you were to say it was scary, this method had actually been used many times before.</p>
<p>But if you were to say it wasn't scary, Song Ren now felt like dying.</p>
<p>It was an experience like a supernatural loop, walking in the empty alleys of the small town, the lights in his vision slowly changing color, with every step, the echoing footsteps and the protagonist's breathing sounds – it truly made one's hair stand on end.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Song Ren didn't suffer for long, because he soon found a wooden door to a room named Cai Deng Ge open in front of him.</p>
<p>Song Ren cautiously walked in. After entering, he discreetly swallowed a mouthful of saliva.</p>
<p>Because this room called Cai Deng Ge was actually a mourning hall filled with funeral offerings.</p>
<p>The lifelike paper figures, gold paper ingots, and coffins made Song Ren involuntarily break out in goosebumps.</p>
<p>He didn't know if it was his illusion, but Song Ren felt as if those wide-eyed paper figures were staring at him.</p>
<p>“Don't panic... it's all fake. I've played so many horror games, how could I be scared by these little things?” Song Ren comforted himself, but inside the mourning hall, he quickly found clues.</p>
<p>Most items in different scenes could be interacted with.</p>
<p>For example, the paper figures, coffins, and so on.</p>
<p>Some were to create an atmosphere of fear, while the rest were key items.</p>
<p>On the Altar, Song Ren found a note.</p>
<p>However, after reading the wording on it, Song Ren felt a little panicked.</p>
<p>It read that Wang Jincai, the grocery store owner, had passed away due to illness.</p>
<p>So, the grocery store owner was actually dead.</p>
<p>Then who was the grocery store owner who had given Lin Lixun the battery before?</p>
<p>Could it have been his son?</p>
<p>Song Ren felt a shiver down his spine.</p>
<p>Continuing to investigate the scene, he found a candle. Then, he used the candle to light the left Altar, and where the paper figures were arranged, Song Ren found another ledger.</p>
<p>The first two pages were unremarkable, but the words written on the third page made Song Ren pause, even temporarily forgetting some of the fear in his heart.</p>
<p>Because it read: 'Lin Lixun bought one battery on credit, owing Wang Jincai two Yuan.'</p>
<p>And the signature below was dated two days after what Lin Lixun perceived as the present.</p>
<p>So, had the supernatural loop brought him to the future?</p>
<p>Feeling a little tremor in his heart, Song Ren slowly explored.</p>
<p>After circling around and confirming there was nothing else, Song Ren slowly, like a crawling turtle, crept out of the Cai Deng Ge house.</p>
<p>But after stepping out, he couldn't help but shiver.</p>
<p>“No! Where did that big door go?!” Song Ren's voice was a little cracked, with a hint of a crying tone amidst his panic.</p>
<p>Because he discovered a critical problem: as he walked out, the main door he had used to enter Cai Deng Ge had turned into a brick wall.</p>
<p>Beside the brick wall, there was also a stool with a piece of paper on it, which read—</p>
<p>Debt of the Dead: If you take something from the dead, you will owe a debt to the dead. If not returned promptly, you will be plagued by illness at best, or face ruin and death at worst. Return the item as soon as possible to escape a calamity.</p>
<p>Debt of the Dead, Wang Jincai, a two-Yuan battery?</p>
<p>In that instant, Song Ren thought of the two batteries Lin Lixun had bought earlier. Combined with the fact that Wang Jincai was dead and he had bought them on credit, wasn't it talking about him?</p>
<p>“Zheng Ming bought the battery, Brother Zheng who fixes cars! Don't come looking for me! Besides, it's just a two-Yuan item! It's really not worth it!” With the game's unusually familiar environment, Song Ren was completely immersed.</p>
<p>Especially when he put the item away, he saw that a hole had appeared in the previously empty red brick wall, and inside the hole were two copper coins stained with blood.</p>
<p>Wasn't that symbolizing his two Yuan?</p>
<p>Playing up to this point, there wasn't a single sudden jump scare, not even a ghost had appeared, yet Song Ren already felt like he needed to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>Suppressing the fear in his heart, Song Ren continued to play.</p>
<p>His motivation to persevere wasn't due to great expectations for the game.</p>
<p>After all, it had just started, and he didn't know what would happen later. He just knew that the fright he was experiencing now, Old Zhang would also experience later.</p>
<p>Fumbling along the street, the bulletin board was filled with various messy things: a Volunteer Teacher had passed away for some reason, a family had fallen victim to a Family Massacre, and other county and village affairs.</p>
<p>Not finding many key clues, Song Ren continued forward. After turning an alley, what appeared before him made him stop dead in his tracks.</p>
<p>A mourning hall had been set up, with many wreaths and white lanterns placed at the entrance.</p>
<p>What was eerie was that none of the family members keeping vigil for the deceased were anywhere to be seen.</p>
<p>“Damn it, isn't that the guy who sold me the battery?!”</p>
<p>After hesitating for a long time, Song Ren immediately wanted to quit after walking inside.</p>
<p>Because right in front of the mourning hall, he saw a black and white photo, unmistakably of the grocery store owner who had sold him the battery earlier.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, Song Ren discovered a critical issue: this damn game actually had an invisible wall!</p>
<p>“Resident Evil does door jump scares, but now Mr. Chen, you're not even pretending to act? You're going straight for the invisible wall?!” Song Ren was utterly stunned.</p>
<p>Although Song Ren wished he could punch Chen Xu in the face, his heart was still suspended in mid-air as he cautiously investigated the mourning hall.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, there were no intense scenes.</p>
<p>He only found a charred phone and clues of a fire; there was a smell of smoke, and according to his investigation, the fire had even started inside the coffin. Clearly, there was more to this fire incident than met the eye.</p>
<p>After circling twice and confirming he hadn't missed anything, Song Ren also noticed that the curtain at the entrance of the mourning hall had opened by itself, as if telling him he could leave now.</p>
<p>Peeking his head around, Song Ren observed, and only after confirming there were no monsters at the entrance did he slowly walk out.</p>
<p>Now, he should probably go back and find that guy named Zheng Ming, right?</p>
<p>Wonder if that guy is gone?</p>
<p>Song Ren mentally pictured the possible scenarios for the other person: when he returned, he might be neither alive nor dead, or transformed into a tragic corpse.</p>
<p>After all, this was the standard fate for teammates in horror games.</p>
<p>But as he walked through the small path, Song Ren shivered. At the entrance of the grocery store where he had bought the battery earlier, a woman was standing. In the darkness, he could only see her silhouette, but before he could get a clear look, the figure vanished, replaced by countless white Spirit Money falling from the sky.</p>
<p>He approached cautiously, and no terrifying female ghost appeared. However, something on the grocery store counter caught his attention.</p>
<p>A ledger, showing an interactive button, was glowing there.</p>
<p>Clearly, this was one of the key clues in the game.</p>
<p>Song Ren controlled Lin Lixun to reach out and pick it up, and the content on it immediately left him bewildered.</p>
<p>“No! Big Bro, is it really worth it?!”</p>
<p>“Two Yuan! For two Yuan, you're going to kill me?!”</p>
<p>A line of Blood-red Characters appeared on the ledger: You cannot escape! You're next!</p>
<p>Debt! Debt! Debt! Debt! Debt! Debt! Debt!</p>
<p>The next moment, Song Ren's vision in the game blurred. The original grocery store had turned into a red brick wall, and prominently displayed on it was Wang Jincai's portrait from the mourning hall, covered with Blood-red Characters spelling “Debt.”</p>
