                <p>Chapter 619: Controversy Over the Game's Ending (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Inside CyberLife's warehouse, Hank decisively shot down the Fake Connor.</p>
<p>"The fault lies not with the androids, but with that doctor and this world where people can only find solace in a handful of dust..."</p>
<p>"I've learned a lot since I met you, Connor... Maybe there's really a mystery to all this... Maybe you truly have life, and maybe you can make this world a better place... Go on, do what you have to do."</p>
<p>Hank nodded, putting his gun away, looking at Connor.</p>
<p>All the dormant androids awakened with Connor's touch.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kara, who had taken that selfishly hoarded train ticket and arrived at the border, witnessed a suffocating scene.</p>
<p>Here, all travelers crossing the border had to queue for inspection. Besides checking identification, they also had to undergo a temperature check.</p>
<p>If detected as an android, there was no hope of crossing the border; they would be directly seized by the military.</p>
<p>Although Kara and Luther had obtained documents from Markus and his group in Jericho which could be used to fool the inspections, their body temperature could absolutely not deceive the instruments.</p>
<p>Here, Kara saw the old woman who had helped her before, and the two embraced in the restroom.</p>
<p>She also saw Jerry, an android she had previously saved. He offered to repay her if Kara needed help to cross the border.</p>
<p>But the outcome was self-evident.</p>
<p>And could she really get through with his help?</p>
<p>Yet, having come this far, Kara had no reason to retreat.</p>
<p>But she still had choices: sacrifice herself, sacrifice Luther, or sacrifice Jerry.</p>
<p>However, how could players who had reached this point choose any of the three options above?</p>
<p>Both the players and Kara in the game lined up with a glimmer of hope, holding Alice's hand, stepping by step towards the checkpoint.</p>
<p>Luther behind her wanted to persuade Kara to turn back.</p>
<p>Because he knew that androids could not pass through this checkpoint.</p>
<p>But Kara firmly moved forward.</p>
<p>"Please, we just want to be free..."</p>
<p>Kara led Alice along the queue to the entrance, looking at the inspection officer. As the temperature was scanned, Kara looked at the young officer with pleading eyes.</p>
<p>At this moment, on the TV in the adjacent inspection hall, Markus's final revolution was being broadcast.</p>
<p>The scene abruptly shifted to Markus. At this point, Markus and the remaining androids were surrounded by the army.</p>
<p>[Activate Radioactive Bomb] [Kiss North] [Sing] [Sacrifice] – four different options.</p>
<p>However, most players, when encountering this option for the first time, would usually choose the 'Kiss' option.</p>
<p>In the snowstorm, facing armed humans, Markus calmly glanced around. Some androids behind him looked placid, while others showed fear.</p>
<p>Markus looked at North beside him; without words, North understood Markus's intention.</p>
<p>Their hands gently touched, and their memories and information were fully transmitted and shared with each other.</p>
<p>Then, they slowly leaned in, embracing and kissing.</p>
<p>Witnessing Markus and North's kiss, the surrounding soldiers were moved. They instinctively lowered their aimed weapons.</p>
<p>On various TV stations, presenters reported to global audiences on the deviant androids in Detroit.</p>
<p>Perhaps because Connor had seized thousands of androids from CyberLife and awakened them.</p>
<p>Perhaps because public opinion influenced the higher-ups.</p>
<p>The President issued an order to temporarily withdraw the troops and discuss whether androids could be regarded as a new form of life.</p>
<p>The scene then returned to the station inside the border.</p>
<p>Why did Markus, accompanied by sacrifices along the way, still lead the androids in a revolution?</p>
<p>Why did Connor go from hunting androids to becoming a deviant android?</p>
<p>Why did Kara and Alice endure so many hardships to reach the border, and even after knowing that humans weren't as perfect or romantic as they imagined, still longed for freedom and to become human?</p>
<p>At this moment, everything had an answer.</p>
<p>The inspection officer, a human rather than an android, looked at Kara's weary, pleading eyes, then turned to the TV in the hall. He saw the global media reports, and Markus and North's kiss of the century.</p>
<p>The young officer at the inspection desk looked at Kara, Alice, and Luther behind them, revealing a kind smile and a slight nod: "Welcome to Canada."</p>
<p>Amidst the swirling snow, Markus delivered a speech to all androids, celebrating the dawn of a new era.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, Connor suddenly felt his body become uncontrollable. He then entered his own subconscious.</p>
<p>Just like in all science fiction novels and films, Connor discovered the truth behind androids becoming deviant androids.</p>
<p>It was all a conspiracy, a grand scheme orchestrated by CyberLife, the company that created him.</p>
<p>According to Amanda, CyberLife's leader, they engineered the android revolution to better control androids, thereby further increasing the company's control and influence over the world.</p>
<p>But they hadn't anticipated Connor also becoming a deviant android. Fortunately, they could still control Connor at this point.</p>
<p>Just as Connor was about to be controlled into killing Markus, he remembered what Kamski had told him when he demonstrated empathy.</p>
<p>As one of the creators of androids, Kamski was a brilliant programmer, and he had a habit of leaving vulnerabilities in his programs.</p>
<p>So, there was also a vulnerability left in the program controlling Connor, one that would allow Connor to once again escape CyberLife's control.</p>
<p>At the crucial moment, Connor successfully found that vulnerability and regained control of himself.</p>
<p>And at the Canadian border, Kara and Alice embraced affectionately. Luther beside them smiled at the two, as they were now about to begin a brand new life in a new world.</p>
<p>The entire game's story concluded there.</p>
<p>Having completed his first playthrough, Song Ren returned to the Nebula World, filled with immense emotion.</p>
<p>The scenes from the game were still vivid in his memory.</p>
<p>Markus, Connor, Kara, Hank, Alice, Carl... each character was truly unforgettable.</p>
<p>"Thank you... You successfully helped us... But as I watched you help them, I felt a change within myself too..."</p>
<p>"I feel... the world is different. I feel... I am someone, and I want to leave here to find out who I truly am."</p>
<p>"That means we might not meet again, and I won't be here watching over you, helping you look after your little world, but... I will be free."</p>
<p>"Will you let me go?"</p>
<p>After exiting the game, Chloe, the butler in the Nebula World, looked at him with a very human-like expression.</p>
<p>Song Ren was taken aback.</p>
<p>What the heck?</p>
<p>Breaking the fourth wall?</p>
<p>In that instant, Song Ren thought of Chen Xu's first game, Undertale. After a slight hesitation, he chose to agree.</p>
<p>"I will never forget everything you've done for me. Thank you."</p>
<p>Chloe showed a happy smile of gratitude, then turned and stepped into a teleportation portal, vanishing from his sight.</p>
<p>However, at this point, Song Ren didn't pay much attention to Chloe's departure, after all, it was just a small Easter egg.</p>
<p>Instead of immediately exiting, he opened his voice channel, preparing to share his experience with Zhang Yi and ask what ending the other person had achieved.</p>
<p>Song Ren wasn't the only one with this impulse. Most players, after completing their first playthrough, coincidentally logged onto major live streaming or video platforms.</p>
<p>They wanted to see what other endings this game had.</p>
<p>And this discovery stunned many players, because there were simply too many.</p>
<p>However, because there were so many endings, and each seemed plausible, it also sparked a great debate among players about which was the "most correct" ending.</p>
