<p>Chapter 91: The Fire is Dying, Yet the King's Seat Lies Empty</p>
<p>Online, players everywhere were thrilled by <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em>.</p>
<p>Across the various booths at the exhibition, groups of ordinary players could be seen enjoying <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em> together.</p>
<p>But on this fifth day—the final day of the exhibition—</p>
<p>Many players and gaming media outlets began to notice something.</p>
<p>In front of Nebula Games’ booth at Hall Six, crowds wore expressions of utter surprise.</p>
<p>"What’s going on!? Why has the style changed?"</p>
<p>"Damn it! Is this a teaser for Chen Xu’s new game? Not just <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Sanguosha</em>, but a new title too!?"</p>
<p>"A Medieval-style game? Those armor and two-handed greatswords look so cool!"</p>
<p>"Finally! Finally there are some young ladies! But why are her eyes covered?"</p>
<p>At the Nebula Games booth, all previous posters for <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em> had been replaced.</p>
<p>A Black Knight clad entirely in black, wearing a pointed iron helm, a black leather vest over chainmail, and a scarlet cape fluttering in the wind, wielding a sword and shield.</p>
<p>A warrior like a king, riding atop an Elder Dragon, gripping the Dragonslayer Swordspear.</p>
<p>A burly knight holding a weapon resembling a Guandao.</p>
<p>An Onion Knight, layered in segmented armor, brandishing sword and shield.</p>
<p>A blind maiden in a black robe, holding flames in her hands, wearing a white crown that conceals her eyes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the colorful <em>Fall Guys</em> cosers had been replaced by a group of cosers dressed in various armors, each carrying weapons and shields.</p>
<p>Had this happened on the first day, it might not have drawn much attention—</p>
<p>After all, most exhibitors featured similar Medieval or fantasy-themed cosers.</p>
<p>But after four days of immersion in the playful, vibrant <em>Fall Guys</em> aesthetic, this sudden shift back to dark, armored warriors sparked intense curiosity among players.</p>
<p>Some who had visited the Nebula Games booth on the first day now recalled something.</p>
<p>On that day, Chen Xu had mentioned to them that on the final day, he would reveal a major announcement.</p>
<p>So—Nebula Games had brought yet another blockbuster!?</p>
<p>Crowds swarmed the booth, forming layers three deep both inside and out.</p>
<p>At last, Chen Xu stepped onto the stage, smiling at the audience. "I believe many of you have already guessed it."</p>
<p>"That’s right. Today, we’re announcing another piece of news—we’ve been secretly developing a major title for the PC platform."</p>
<p>"Constantly striving to surpass ourselves, constantly exploring the unknown mysteries; now, the fire is dying, yet the king's seat lies empty. This will be a tale of flames and Firelinkers."</p>
<p>"Stay Tuned!"</p>
<p>As Chen Xu finished speaking, the crowd erupted into thunderous applause.</p>
<p>Even nearby media from Hall Six looked stunned.</p>
<p>Is Nebula Games developing a blockbuster?</p>
<p>Was this the true centerpiece of Nebula Games’ exhibition?</p>
<p>Were <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em> merely appetizers?</p>
<p>Other game designers and developers from surrounding booths wore deeply frustrated expressions.</p>
<p>What the hell!</p>
<p>This is an exhibition!</p>
<p>An exhibition! Do you even know what an exhibition is for!?</p>
<p>Why does Nebula Games—and especially you, Chen Xu—always have so many tricks up your sleeve!?</p>
<p>This isn’t your personal game launch event!</p>
<p>Watching the massive crowd gather around Nebula’s booth, everyone else could only feel utterly exasperated.</p>
<p>Even representatives from NetDragon and TengHua, who had been closely monitoring the situation, were left speechless.</p>
<p>Especially Meng Zuo, who still hadn’t recovered from the shock.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t have turned out like this!</p>
<p>It shouldn’t!</p>
<p>What went wrong!?</p>
<p>Everything was supposed to be his first!</p>
<p>Blockbuster titles, promotions—why did everything end up so differently!?</p>
<p>But for ordinary players, the past four days of <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Sanguosha</em> had already ignited their passion.</p>
<p>Had Chen Xu announced a new title on the first day, it might have been met with mere polite interest.</p>
<p>But now, the situation was completely different.</p>
<p>Amidst the mountainous waves of applause and cheers,</p>
<p>a pre-prepared LCD screen began playing a CG animation rushed to completion with overtime work over the past two months.</p>
<p>Unlike the simple cutscenes of the original <em>Dark Souls</em> from Chen Xu’s previous life, the content remained the same, but the visual presentation was in an entirely different league.</p>
<p>After all, Chen Xu had commissioned a top domestic CG company to produce this short animation. In terms of visual effects, it was unquestionably top-tier—using a cliché phrase, it was clearly a AAA-grade production just from looking at it.</p>
<p>Due to the tight schedule, the CG team had worked day and night, though they were generously compensated in return.</p>
<p>The cost of this single CG animation, under three minutes long, nearly matched the entire development cost of <em>Outlast</em>.</p>
<p>A brief black screen. An old woman’s voice echoed.</p>
<p>[Yes, that is Lothric,]</p>
<p>[The homeland of the Lords of Cinder, and the confluence of wandering souls.]</p>
<p>As the old woman’s weathered voice narrated, a ruined and desolate capital slowly emerged on screen. Though now in ruins, its former glory and grandeur were still faintly perceptible.</p>
<p>Under dim light, a biting wind swept through, carrying swirling snow.</p>
<p>Gray ash blanketed the massive city, and the entire world lay in dead silence.</p>
<p>[Thus, the pilgrims journey northward, learning the meaning of the prophecy.]</p>
<p>In the midst of a blizzard, a group of hunched figures trudged forward, each carrying a shell-like object wrapped in chains, leaning on staffs as they struggled through the storm.</p>
<p>Their thick garments concealed their bodies, but their exposed arms resembled burnt kindling—blackened and cracked, with faint orange-red speckles of light flickering within.</p>
<p>Finally, one pilgrim collapsed to the ground, motionless, unable to continue.</p>
<p>[The Fire is Dying, Yet the King's Seat Lies Empty.]</p>
<p>Muffled drum beats began to rise, accompanying the old woman’s solemn narration.</p>
<p>The countless players in attendance were instantly drawn into this mysterious world, eagerly wondering what kind of game this was, and what story it would tell.</p>
<p>[When the flame of传承 is near extinction, bells shall ring across the land, awakening the ancient Lords of Cinder from their slumber within the coffins.]</p>
<p>As deep, resonant bells tolled, a violin concerto began, merging with the mixed chanting of soprano and tenor voices.</p>
<p>The scene shifted instantly.</p>
<p>A gigantic sarcophagus cracked open, and from the dark and deep underground caverns, countless streams of black, viscous liquid surged forth, pulsing and throbbed. Within it, a crown was faintly visible.</p>
<p>[The Abyss Watcher—Aldrich, Devourer of Gods.]</p>
<p>From among the coffins and mountains of corpses, soldiers clad in armor slowly rose, wielding Farron Greatswords, their blood-soaked dark red cloaks fluttering in the wind.</p>
<p>[The Watchers of the Abyss—Farron Undead Legion.]</p>
<p>A massive greatscythe slammed into the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust. From a colossal sarcophagus, a figure like a small mountain slowly rose. Its arms, holding the greatscythe outside its armor, were cracked, and flames were visibly emanating from within.</p>
<p>Accompanied by an earth-shattering roar, the giant’s flames reignited.</p>
<p>[The lonely king of the Profaned Capital—Yhorm the Giant.]</p>
<p>As Yhorm the Giant roared, the mixed chanting of soprano and tenor voices reached its crescendo.</p>
<p>Harmonized with the violin concerto, every player felt a profound sense of ‘epicness’ surge through them.</p>
<p>But in the next moment, all sound abruptly ceased.</p>
<p>The screen plunged into darkness. Silence blanketed the world.</p>
<p>The old woman’s voice returned.</p>
<p>[In truth, the kings will ultimately abandon their thrones, and the Ashen Ones shall come forth from the ashes.]</p>
<p>[A nameless, incapable of becoming kindling, accursed Undead.]</p>
<p>A pair of fair hands appeared on screen, slowly placing a blindfold made of a dark, liquid-like substance onto a face. The camera pulled back as the figure slowly stood.</p>
<p>Silver-white long hair, a black robe, and a tall stature—she looked just like a Saintess.</p>
<p>[Perhaps that is why the Ashen One so desperately craves the fading embers.]</p>
<p>In the darkness, flames continued to burn. The blindfolded woman turned, gently cradling a ‘corpse’ as she walked forward.</p>
<p>Finally, the screen faded to black. The game’s title emerged in the center: <em>Dark Souls</em></p>
<p>Beneath it, a small, unobtrusive line of text: Release Date TBA.</p>
<p>(PS: Will you Link the Fire? If not, hand over your recommendation votes and Monthly Pass—otherwise, the Fire Keeper young lady will drag you off to be burnt as kindling.)</p>
