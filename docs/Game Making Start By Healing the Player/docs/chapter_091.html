                <p>Chapter 91: The Fire Fades, and No King Sits Upon the Throne</p>
<p>Online, various players were excited by <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em>.</p>
<p>In every exhibition area of the gameplay Expo, ordinary players could be seen grouped together, playing <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em>.</p>
<p>However, on this fifth day, the final day of the expo.</p>
<p>Many players, as well as gaming media, noticed something.</p>
<p>In front of the Nebula Games exhibition booth, located in Exhibition Hall 6, many people wore expressions of surprise.</p>
<p>"What's going on!? How did the style change?"</p>
<p>"Holy cow, is this a trailer for Chen Xu's new game? Not just <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Sanguosha</em>, but a new game!"</p>
<p>"Is it a medieval-style game? That armor and greatsword look pretty cool!"</p>
<p>"Finally! Finally, some ladies! But why are their eyes covered?"</p>
<p>At the Nebula Games exhibition booth, all previous posters for <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em> had been replaced.</p>
<p>A Black Knight, covered head to toe in black, wielding a sword and shield, wore a pointed iron helm, chainmail beneath a black leather vest, and a scarlet cape that seemed to drift with the wind.</p>
<p>A warrior, holding a Dragonslayer Swordspear, rode upon an Ancient Dragon like a king.</p>
<p>A burly knight held a weapon resembling a Guandao.</p>
<p>A knight, with armor resembling an onion, carried a sword and shield.</p>
<p>A blind maiden, holding fire in her hands, wore a white crown that covered her eyes and a black robe.</p>
<p>At the same time, the previously colorful <em>Fall Guys</em> cosers had transformed into a group of cosers clad in various armors, holding weapons and shields.</p>
<p>If this had been at the start of the expo, it would have been hard to attract much player attention.</p>
<p>Because, essentially, everyone else was uniformly like this.</p>
<p>But after four days of continuous exposure, many players had grown accustomed to the <em>Fall Guys</em> cosers.</p>
<p>This sudden change back to the original style, on the contrary, sparked even greater curiosity among many players.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some players who had visited the Nebula Games exhibition booth on the first day recalled something.</p>
<p>That on the first day, Chen Xu had told them that there would be a major announcement on the final day.</p>
<p>So, Nebula Games also brought a new blockbuster!?</p>
<p>Players outside the exhibition area gathered in a dense crowd.</p>
<p>At this moment, Chen Xu finally stepped onto the stage, smiling as he looked at the players below and said: "I believe many players have already guessed it."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's right. Today, we have another piece of news for everyone: we've been secretly developing a major title that will launch on the PC platform."</p>
<p>"Constantly pursuing self-breakthrough, continuously exploring all unknown mysteries; now the fire fades, and no king sits upon the throne. This will be a story of fire and Fire Keepers."</p>
<p>"Please look forward to it."</p>
<p>As Chen Xu's words fell, the players present appropriately erupted in cheers.</p>
<p>Even some media personnel who happened to be in Exhibition Hall 6 were surprised.</p>
<p>Is Nebula Games developing a major title now?</p>
<p>Is this the main event of Nebula Games' expo this time?</p>
<p>Are <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em> just appetizers?</p>
<p>Similarly, game designers and developers from other exhibition areas all wore pained expressions.</p>
<p>"What the hell!"</p>
<p>"This is an expo!"</p>
<p>"An expo! Do you even know what an expo is?!"</p>
<p>Why does Nebula Games, why does Chen Xu always have so many tricks up his sleeve!</p>
<p>This isn't for you to hold a game launch event!</p>
<p>Watching countless players flock over, everyone wore a pained expression.</p>
<p>This included NetDragon and TengHua, whose relevant personnel had been closely monitoring the situation.</p>
<p>Especially Meng Zuo, who still hadn't recovered from this blow.</p>
<p>It shouldn't be like this!</p>
<p>It shouldn't be!</p>
<p>What exactly went wrong?</p>
<p>Everything should have been his first!</p>
<p>Whether it was blockbusters or promotions, why did the final outcome turn out so differently?</p>
<p>However, for ordinary players, the previous four days of <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Sanguosha</em> had completely ignited their enthusiasm.</p>
<p>If Chen Xu had announced news of a so-called new game on the first day, it would probably have just been a fleeting sound.</p>
<p>But now, it was completely different.</p>
<p>Amidst thunderous applause and cheers.</p>
<p>On the pre-prepared LCD screens, the CG animation, rushed to completion with overtime work over the past two months, began to play.</p>
<p>Unlike the simple cutscenes of <em>Dark Souls</em> in his previous life, although the content remained unchanged, the visual presentation was definitely on a different level.</p>
<p>After all, this simple cutscene was directly produced by a top domestic CG company commissioned by Chen Xu; from a visual effects standpoint, it was absolutely up to par. To use an old cliché, just by looking at it, one could tell it was a AAA-level production.</p>
<p>Due to time constraints, the CG company had been working overtime every single day, though, of course, they were well compensated.</p>
<p>The cost of this single CG animation, less than three minutes long, was almost comparable to the pure development cost of <em>Outlast</em>.</p>
<p>A brief black screen, then the voice of an old woman resonated.</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed. That is Lothric."</p>
<p>"Homeland of the past Lords of Cinder, and the confluence of wandering souls."</p>
<p>As the old woman's weathered voice spoke, a ruined and desolate capital slowly appeared on screen. Though now dilapidated, one could still faintly sense how prosperous this capital must have been in its prime.</p>
<p>Under dim light, biting cold winds swept, scattering snowflakes.</p>
<p>Grey dust shrouded the massive capital, and the entire world was enveloped in dead silence.</p>
<p>"Thus, pilgrims all journey northwards, and learn the meaning of the prophecy."</p>
<p>Amidst the heavy snowfall, a group of hunched figures, carrying what resembled a turtle shell wrapped in chains on their backs, leaned on staffs as they trudged forward against the biting wind and snow.</p>
<p>Thick clothing tightly encased their bodies, but their exposed arms were like burnt kindling, displaying a black, cracked state, with even faint orange-red speckles of light visible.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the pilgrims could no longer bear it, collapsing to the ground and falling silent.</p>
<p>"The Fire Fades, and No King Sits Upon the Throne."</p>
<p>Muffled drum beats gradually began, accompanying the old woman's weathered narration.</p>
<p>It made countless players in the audience feel as though they had entered this mysterious world, eager to know what kind of game and story this was.</p>
<p>"When the Age of Fire wanes, the bell tolls across the land, awakening the slumbering Lords of Cinder from their coffins."</p>
<p>As the muffled bells tolled, a violin concerto, and the mixed chanting of soprano and tenor voices began.</p>
<p>The camera instantly cut.</p>
<p>Gigantic sarcophagi split open, and from dark and deep underground caverns, countless black goo pulsed and throbbed, with a crown faintly visible in their midst.</p>
<p>"Aldrich, Saint of the Deep — Aldrich, Devourer of Gods."</p>
<p>From sarcophagi and mountains of corpses, a group of armored soldiers wielding Farron Greatswords slowly rose, their blood-soaked dark red cloaks fluttering behind them.</p>
<p>"Abyss Watchers — Farron Undead Legion."</p>
<p>A massive greatscythe struck the ground, stirring up a cloud of dust. From a colossal sarcophagus, a colossal figure, like a small mountain, slowly rose. Its arms, holding the greatscythe outside its armor, were cracked, and flames were visibly emanating.</p>
<p>Accompanied by an earth-shattering roar, the flames on the giant's body reignited.</p>
<p>"Yhorm the Giant — Lonely Lord of the Profaned Capital."</p>
<p>With Yhorm the Giant's roar, the mixed chanting of soprano and tenor reached its crescendo.</p>
<p>Combined with the violin concerto, it instilled in every player a sense of 'epicness'.</p>
<p>But the next moment, all sounds abruptly ceased.</p>
<p>The screen plunged into darkness, and the world fell silent.</p>
<p>The old woman's voice resonated once more.</p>
<p>"Indeed, the Lords will abandon their thrones, and the Ashen Ones will flock here."</p>
<p>"They are nameless, incapable of becoming kindling, and accursed Undead."</p>
<p>A pair of fair hands appeared on screen, slowly placing a blindfold, made of a dark, liquid-like substance flowing from a candelabra, over her eyes. Then the camera zoomed out, and the woman slowly rose.</p>
<p>Her silver-white long hair, black robe, and tall stature made her look like a Saintess.</p>
<p>"For this reason, the Ashen One truly desires embers."</p>
<p>In the darkness, the fire still burned. The blindfolded woman turned, slowly moving forward, carrying a 'corpse'.</p>
<p>Finally, the screen plunged into darkness, and the game title appeared in the center: <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>Below it, in less conspicuous small print, was a line: Release date to be determined.</p>
<p>P.S.: Will you Link the Fire? If not, hand over your Recommendation tickets and monthly passes, or else the Fire Keeper might drag you away to be burnt as kindling.</p>
