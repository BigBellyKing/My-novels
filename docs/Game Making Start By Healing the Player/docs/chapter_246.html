<p>Chapter 245: Too Many Choices Are a Kind of Suffering Too! (Seventh Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>Following that was a brief dialogue storyline, helping Zhang Yi understand some of the game's background narrative.</p>
<p>The Hunter identity he now played belonged to the Reconnaissance Team of the Fifth Fleet, tasked with traveling to the New World to uncover the secrets behind Elder Dragon migrations.</p>
<p>And it had already been forty years since the first expedition.</p>
<p>Recalling the Nergigante from the promotional Concept Art and the Rathalos from the promotional CG animation, Zhang Yi's heart swelled with anticipation.</p>
<p>At the same time, looking around at the ship's cabin filled to the brim with Hunters, he felt overwhelming emotion.</p>
<p>Just this single Fifth Fleet alone had so many companions, and on top of that, there were still four previous Fleets.</p>
<p>By the time they truly reached the New World, all of them should be recruitable teammates.</p>
<p>As for the Mohawk-haired Hunter beside him who had become instantly familiar, following typical story conventions, he was clearly destined to be the player's trusted companion.</p>
<p>And judging from how stories usually unfolded, each Fleet would contribute one Hunter to join the protagonist's party.</p>
<p>Finally, under the protagonist's leadership, they would uncover the truth behind Elder Dragon migrations, culminating in the protagonist becoming the legendary Azure Star.</p>
<p>Although he had just started the game, Zhang Yi had already mentally pictured the entire story.</p>
<p>Yet, as Zhang Yi was lost in thought, the game's vessel suddenly shook violently!</p>
<p>Lights flickered, books, wine glasses, and food on the table all crashing to the floor.</p>
<p>The entire deck began tilting.</p>
<p>Inside the cabin, Hunters scrambled in chaos.</p>
<p>The Mohawk-haired guy, a fellow member of the Hunter Reconnaissance Team, immediately rushed toward the deck.</p>
<p>At the same time, Zhang Yi's bun-haired partner shouted a line: "Partner, quickly, let's go check outside!"</p>
<p>The partner Investigator hurried toward the deck, and Zhang Yi's character automatically followed.</p>
<p>Following behind them was a black-and-white Palico, bouncing and hopping out as well.</p>
<p>Reaching the deck, the previously calm sea was now churning violently.</p>
<p>Huge waves crashed onto the deck.</p>
<p>The entire ship rocked violently, and all the Hunters could do was grab onto ropes, staring in panic at their surroundings.</p>
<p>'Crash!'</p>
<p>Just as everyone stood helpless, a massive, bizarre black creature, like a volcano, surged up from the ocean.</p>
<p>Arriving at the ship's deck, under the night sky, the once-calm sea now heaved violently.</p>
<p>A black volcano abruptly rose from the seabed, lifting the vessel resting atop its back and splitting it cleanly in two.</p>
<p>Amid the storm and turmoil, Zhang Yi noticed that this colossal black volcano wasn't the volcanic formation he had imagined.</p>
<p>This was actually a living creature!</p>
<p>As the enormous 'black volcano' continued rising from the water, the ship carrying the Fifth Fleet Hunters slid off its back, and the game's protagonist was helplessly flung into the sea.</p>
<p>Moments later, the camera shifted to the creature's back—surrounded by black rocks and flowing lava, while the other Hunters had clearly been scattered.</p>
<p>At that moment, the receptionist's voice called from afar.</p>
<p>Alongside it, specific operation guides appeared.</p>
<p>Climbing, running, and so on...</p>
<p>Clearly, just like most games, this was a blend of story and tutorial, teaching players how to play.</p>
<p>But what truly surprised Zhang Yi was learning the name of this volcanic creature during the conversation with the receptionist: Zorah Magdaros!</p>
<p>"This can't possibly be a monster I'll have to fight later? It's so huge that even trimming its nails wouldn't count! Actually attacking it would be like scraping calluses!" Zhang Yi, sitting in front of his computer, was completely stunned.</p>
<p>Originally, he thought the Anjanath and Rathalos from the previous trailer, along with the Nergigante from the promotional Concept Art, were already absurdly large.</p>
<p>Now, right from the start, they were telling him that this island-sized volcanic creature was also an Elder Dragon?</p>
<p>Still, despite the shock, this segment of the story was essentially content-light, merely teaching players basic operations.</p>
<p>After going through it once, Zhang Yi basically understood everything and picked up on one key characteristic.</p>
<p>"Just like the Undead, they can't jump on the spot, but unlike the Undead, they have the attribute of taking no fall damage—an invincible upgrade!" Zhang Yi sighed with emotion, watching his own playful pink-haired Hunter in the game.</p>
<p>Following the receptionist's guidance, Zhang Yi soon controlled his character to climb to the top of Zorah Magdaros's head.</p>
<p>Then, a cutscene triggered: the Hunter in the game used a grappling hook to catch a Wingdrake mid-air, carrying the Investigator as they escaped Zorah Magdaros's body.</p>
<p>This cutscene of leaving Zorah Magdaros reminded Zhang Yi of leaving the High Wall of Lothric and the Northern Undead Asylum in <em>Dark Souls</em>—there were definite similarities!</p>
<p>Combined with the game's hunting-dragon vibe, could it possibly be hinting at something?</p>
<p>Strangely, a peculiar feeling stirred in Zhang Yi's heart.</p>
<p>But before he could ponder further, as the Wingdrake soared through the clouds, the breathtaking scenery before him left him stunned.</p>
<p>The sun rose from the horizon, and the silhouette of the New World appeared in view.</p>
<p>A massive Ancient Tree piercing the sky, Herbivores resting along the coast.</p>
<p>Peaceful and serene, this scenery, existing only in fantasy, widened Zhang Yi's eyes.</p>
<p>This visual presentation was undoubtedly at the top tier of standards.</p>
<p>More importantly, the unique Art design was absolutely stunning.</p>
<p>Upon entering the New World, Zhang Yi, along with the bun-haired receptionist, clarified his current basic situation.</p>
<p>He also learned basic operations like reading the map from the receptionist, and the next main quest was to find the Hunter base.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Yi didn't rush headlong into advancing the main quest.</p>
<p>Instead, he curiously surveyed the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>The azure sky, drifting白云, distant waves and sandy beach, the sea breeze rustling grass and trees, accompanied by the chirping of insects and calls of flying birds.</p>
<p>Around a dense forest's bend, a brand-new landscape unfolded.</p>
<p>On the broad land ahead, numerous Herbivores were foraging. According to the receptionist nearby, these were an extremely gentle species of dragon.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi cautiously maneuvered his Hunter, approaching close to observe a feeding Herbivore.</p>
<p>Upon noticing Zhang Yi's unexpected presence, the creature showed no sign of aggression at all—instead, it got startled and fled in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The game's opening, shifting from the shock and tension of Zorah Magdaros to the tranquility of the Ancient Forest, felt incredibly satisfying to him.</p>
<p>The next segment of the story was similar to the earlier escape from Zorah Magdaros, except that escaping Zorah Magdaros taught players standard gameplay operations.</p>
<p>This segment in the Ancient Forest, however, taught players the standard game systems—such as how to read the map, gather resources scattered across it, what the green Scoutflies were for, evading Jagras in the grass, and climbing vines.</p>
<p>"Why don't I have any weapons yet? I can't even fight!" Zhang Yi felt a bit frustrated.</p>
<p>Although the scenery was beautiful, he still wanted to grab a weapon and test out the game's Combat System—after all, no matter how you looked at it, hunting combat was the core.</p>
<p>After a brief grumble inwardly, Zhang Yi continued advancing the story.</p>
<p>Following the Investigator deeper and deeper.</p>
<p>Just before reaching the Fleet's base, Astera Settlement, they were attacked by a Great Jagras, but luckily saved by the Investigation Leader.</p>
<p>As for the Great Jagras, it became Anjanath's meal.</p>
<p>"This is Anjanath? I thought it was just a super weak mob!"</p>
<p>Watching the Anjanath tear into the Great Jagras in the cutscene, Zhang Yi in the game sighed with emotion.</p>
<p>After all, in the previously released promotional video animation, this Anjanath was first brutally beaten by a Hunter, then beaten again by Rathalos, giving him the illusion of being very weak.</p>
<p>But now, seeing its massive body, Zhang Yi had a completely different impression—that it was actually kind of fierce!</p>
<p>After surviving the danger, they finally arrived at Astera Base.</p>
<p>A vast outpost built from wood and beast bones, the entire Astera Base resembled a fortress, delivering a powerful visual impact.</p>
<p>Inside the base, the members of the Fifth Fleet he had previously met had all arrived, busy transporting resources.</p>
<p>After conversing with the Commander-in-Chief, Zhang Yi, under the guidance of the Squad Leader, took a tour of Astera Settlement.</p>
<p>Its tower-like design spanned from the lowest to the highest level, with each floor serving different areas and functions.</p>
<p>The lowest floor was the commercial district; going up were the Processing Workshop for forging weapons and armor, the dining areas for eating, and the Hunters' quarters.</p>
<p>Additionally, there were the Ecological Research lab, Botanical Research lab, Argosy, and Command Center—each scene with its own distinct characteristics.</p>
<p>For example, at the Canteen, an eyepatch-wearing Palico and its assistant chefs were bustling around, preparing various ingredients.</p>
<p>In the Processing Workshop, craftsmen wielding hammers were constantly forging gear for Hunters.</p>
<p>The entire camp brimmed with life, each Hunter diligently performing their duties.</p>
<p>After a brief tour and introduction, the Squad Leader led Zhang Yi into the Hunter's Lodge, instructing him to choose a weapon to begin official hunting quests.</p>
<p>"It's here, it's finally here!"</p>
<p>Seeing this moment, Zhang Yi felt a surge of excitement.</p>
<p>Although the previous series of tutorials had let him appreciate the New World's beauty and Astera Base's grandeur,</p>
<p>he had still been eager to start hunting as soon as possible.</p>
<p>After all, the game was called <em>Monster Hunter</em>—hunting was the main theme!</p>
<p>But after the excitement passed, Zhang Yi fell into a state of decision paralysis.</p>
<p>Because there were simply too many weapons in this game!</p>
<p>Having so many choices was a kind of suffering too!</p>
<p>He felt like each one looked incredibly powerful!</p>
