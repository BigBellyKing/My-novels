                <p>Chapter 348: Warzone Promotional CG (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>The popularity of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare continued to rise. Especially after most players experienced the story campaign and then dove into multiplayer versus, it became unstoppable.</p>
<p>The number of active players in multiplayer mode grew at a terrifying rate. It completely distinguished itself from previous FPS games with its fast-paced style, instantly attracting a large number of FPS players.</p>
<p>Moreover, compared to the previous Rainbow Six Siege, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was clearly much easier to pick up. Just grab a gun and go; there's no economic system, so you just unlock the weapon you want and use it directly, plus a rich attachment system.</p>
<p>This allowed players to experience a unique kind of fast-paced fun. Coupled with the killstreak reward system, the game became even more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Summoning a UAV drone after a killstreak could reveal enemy positions, almost like having wallhacks. After a longer killstreak, you could even summon a bomber to bomb a specific area.</p>
<p>Compared to other traditional FPS games, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's pace was incredibly fast and even more thrilling. It fully demonstrated the utility of modern weaponry.</p>
<p>This directly elevated the popularity of Modern Warfare to a new level. It also completely stunned the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Of course, there weren't many modes in the game yet: regular Quick Play modes included team fights, Domination, Search &amp; Destroy, and Kill Confirmed. Besides these, there was also a PVE mode, like a multiplayer challenge mode, allowing players to continue challenging campaign scenarios.</p>
<p>There was also a Survival Mode, where players, alone or in teams, defended a single point against waves of enemies until they were defeated. Other modes, like Ground War mode, Chen Xu had not yet implemented.</p>
<p>Because that mode was truly hard to describe, combined with the inherent characteristics of the killstreak reward system and the map design, it essentially devolved into sniper battles, with players camping in rooms for what felt like a year.</p>
<p>Ground War turned into a trench warfare. What? You say you don't camp?</p>
<p>Then you become the game experience for those campers.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Under the relentless bombardment of game media and the fervent praise of players, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's popularity remained high.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Atrai's Storm Action was inevitably dragged out and repeatedly mentioned. After all, it was the game that had previously entered an arena match with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.</p>
<p>And it was also the latest product from Zeus and Huanyu New Generation VR. Initially, the two games' promotions went back and forth, but as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare launched first, everything changed. Storm Action immediately entered playing dead mode, even opting for a delay.</p>
<p>Now, there was still some time until the official release of Storm Action. But regardless of players or the gaming industry, everyone basically felt that this game would be unable to make any waves.</p>
<p>In every aspect, Storm Action was far inferior to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. If there was any advantage, it was probably only in platform dominance.</p>
<p>After all, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was escorting the Cosmic VR Platform. Storm Action was launching on the Zeus Platform, and Zeus Platform players had no other choice.</p>
<p>Howard Warsaw, the lead designer at Atrai, was also very depressed.</p>
<p>“Just bear with it! It’s normal for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare to be trending right now. But both multiplayer and single-player modes are already online. By the time Storm Action launches in July, its popularity should have somewhat cooled down. A gentleman conceals his abilities, awaiting the opportune moment to strike; a gentleman’s revenge is never too late, even after ten years. Hold on!” Howard Warsaw silently recited two Eastern proverbs, then closed the Nebula Games related information. Out of sight, out of mind. As long as he didn’t see it, he hadn’t lost.</p>
<p>Almost a month should be enough for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's popularity to cool down a bit. By then, with Storm Action's promotion, seizing some of that popularity—it certainly couldn't compare to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, but Storm Action's quality itself was still decent.</p>
<p>Coupled with some hype and promotion, we'll be a hero once again.</p>
<p>Atrai and Howard Warsaw were both making their little calculations. It's okay if they can't compete in raw skill; we'll just avoid them.</p>
<p>The idea was excellent, but accidents always happen so suddenly. Just five days before Storm Action's release, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare had a new move.</p>
<p>A brand new mode, 'Warzone,' was launched. And there was a promotional CG video on the official Weibo account.</p>
<p>This also made many players curious. A promotional CG video for a brand new mode? Even when multiplayer mode was launched before, Nebula Games wasn't this extravagant!</p>
<p>Seriously, is it an animation company that got sidetracked by games? Making CG animations at the drop of a hat?</p>
<p>Of course, grumbling aside, this video still had to be watched immediately.</p>
<p>Above a city named Verdansk, an attack helicopter was flying.</p>
<p>“Attention, intense fighting in the landing zone!”</p>
<p>The next moment, an exciting voice for players rang out:</p>
<p>“It’s time. Let’s go, a hundred and fifty-person battle.”</p>
<p>Inside the helicopter, a familiar character, Captain Price, appeared, puffing on a cigar. Next to him were Soap and Ghost. As the cigar was flicked out the window, Soap, Ghost, and Captain Price punched each other's chests. At the same time, a soldier on the attack helicopter gave a thumbs-up. The three then leaped out of the hatch and opened their parachutes.</p>
<p>At this point, the entire city was in chaos, with countless armed militants exchanging fire.</p>
<p>“Go! Go! Go!”</p>
<p>As Price, Soap, and Ghost landed inside an arena, intense gunfights began. The familiar M1911 pistol, but against the enemy's submachine gun fire, it was hard to resist. Fortunately, there were quite a few rifles on the ground around them. Picking up weapons, they began to fight back.</p>
<p>The next moment, the sound of an attack helicopter blared outside. An armed militant wearing sunglasses laughed maniacally: “Begin!” The machine gun on the firing position swept wildly.</p>
<p>“We need to move!”</p>
<p>Ducking to avoid the machine gun fire, Captain Price, Ghost, and Soap headed towards the garage. With a passionate BGM playing, the trio cleared enemies from their path.</p>
<p>“Keep pushing!”</p>
<p>Jumping into a Jeep, dodging the attack helicopter's strafing runs from above, the three-person squad frantically escaped. In the city, countless others were still engaged in fierce combat.</p>
<p>“Die!”</p>
<p>The camera instantly switched to a sniper on a distant hillside, dressed in a Ghillie Suit, aiming at the Jeep. Bang! With the gunshot, the Jeep's tire instantly burst. The high-speed Jeep, due to the flat tire, immediately lost control and flipped over, and at the same time, the screen went black.</p>
<p>Moments later, a new scene appeared, but it was in a prison: the Gulag. “Welcome to the Gulag. If you can defeat your opponent, you will regain your freedom!”</p>
<p>Amidst the cheers of the crowd, Price, Soap, and Ghost each defeated their opponents, then were airlifted out of the Gulag prison by a helicopter.</p>
<p>“Welcome back, Task Force 141. But… it’s time to get to work!”</p>
<p>From the plane, Price and his two companions parachuted back into the city, where a dark green storm was sweeping in from behind them. “Gas! It’s gas! We have to get to the safe zone!” “We need to move, now!”</p>
<p>Price shouted urgently, then once again drove the Jeep towards the city center. The three were unstoppable, eliminating all enemies in their path. Finally, amidst the vast expanse of gas, a helicopter arrived above Price and his team, lowering ropes to pick them up and carry them away from the city now covered in gas.</p>
<p>As the attack helicopter flew away, rows of subtitles appeared in the center of the screen.</p>
