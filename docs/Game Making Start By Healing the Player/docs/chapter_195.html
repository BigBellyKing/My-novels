                <p>Chapter 194: Don't Starve (7th Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>As the screen displayed the visuals, everyone's attention was immediately drawn to the <em>Don't Starve</em> concept drafts.</p>
<p>At the forefront of the concept draft, Chen Xu had already completed some simple artwork for the game.</p>
<p>In the wilderness, a disheveled little figure sat beside a campfire, while distant monsters like spiders and wild pigs slowly crept closer.</p>
<p>The images weren't colored, yet at a single glance, the game's distinct art style was unmistakable.</p>
<p>"Is this a survival-type game?"</p>
<p>"The art style feels so eerie—thick lines, kind of like a Western cartoon-style?"</p>
<p>"Is it similar to <em>It Takes Two</em> or <em>Overcooked</em>, meaning it's a cooperative game?"</p>
<p>Looking at the title <em>Don't Starve</em> and the concept art, those present quietly speculated about what type of game this truly was.</p>
<p>"Just like the game's title, <em>Don't Starve</em>, the player's entire purpose is to avoid death. Survival is the sole core of this game."</p>
<p>"Collect rocks, twigs, craft hunting tools, advance through Tech, establish their own camp, explore unknown worlds, and strive to survive longer."</p>
<p>"Within the game, players might go insane and suffer mental breakdowns from encountering bizarre monsters, freeze to death from the cold, starve to death from hunger, or be killed by attacks from wilderness monsters."</p>
<p>Chen Xu explained the core design philosophy behind <em>Don't Starve</em>.</p>
<p>"Does anyone have any questions?" Chen Xu asked.</p>
<p>As his words fell, Qin Yi stroked his chin, staring at the concept draft on the large screen. "So this is a survival game? But Mr. Chen, if it's too difficult, won't players just give up?"</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue beside him nodded in agreement. "Yeah, Mr. Chen. <em>Dark Souls</em> was a major production—its graphics, story, and actions were all top-tier. But <em>Don't Starve</em> is clearly a small-scale production. Without that appealing exterior to keep players engaged, won't it just drive them away from the start?"</p>
<p>"Wait, why do you both assume this is a game about suffering?" Chen Xu said, slightly speechless.</p>
<p>With its slightly eerie art style and its classification as a survival game—complete with mental breakdowns, freezing to death, starving to death, and monster attacks—</p>
<p>From Chen Xu's description, it seemed the protagonist constantly faced threats of death.</p>
<p>Considering Chen Xu's previous creations—<em>Dark Souls</em>, <em>Silent Hill PT</em>, and that tear-jerking game with The one with the big hammer—as well as the recently launched Death Mode,</p>
<p>Instinctively, they had associated this game with suffering.</p>
<p>"There will definitely be difficulty, but unlike Dark Souls, players can choose their own path," Chen Xu explained, slightly exasperated.</p>
<p>Did he really seem like a designer who enjoyed tormenting players? It was ridiculous—they didn't even trust him anymore!</p>
<p>"Alright, let me explain in detail the game's design direction. The core revolves around survival—exploration, collecting resources..."</p>
<p>After thoroughly explaining the design philosophy of <em>Don't Starve</em>, everyone returned to their respective tasks.</p>
<p>In the previous life, <em>Don't Starve</em> was an exceptionally unique small-scale game.</p>
<p>Although it was a modest production, its sales figures surpassed even some 3A blockbusters.</p>
<p>In its previous life on the Steam platform, <em>Don't Starve</em> sold over ten million copies.</p>
<p>Later, after being published by TX and released on the WeGame Store, it surpassed one million sales within the first month, and shortly after, quickly broke through three million.</p>
<p>Of course, this explosive success had contributing factors. Initially, <em>Don't Starve</em> was only a single-player game. Despite its unique charm, it lacked a breakout moment.</p>
<p>It wasn't until the release of the Online Multiplayer Version that <em>Don't Starve</em> truly experienced explosive growth in sales.</p>
<p>Choosing this game as the team's next development project served two purposes.</p>
<p>First, the excellence and appeal of <em>Don't Starve</em> itself; second, to support the subsequent strategic development of the Nebula Games Store.</p>
<p>Using <em>Don't Starve</em> as a test stone to gauge players' passion for survival and sandbox games.</p>
<p>For sandbox games, there were actually many options—like <em>Valheim</em>, which was hugely popular in the previous life, or the undeniable classics <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Terraria</em>.</p>
<p>But considering that in this Parallel World, the sandbox mode hadn't yet become popular—although Chen Xu had noticed a few games with sandbox attributes emerging—</p>
<p>It still hadn't formed an independent genre.</p>
<p>Players remained relatively unfamiliar with this gameplay style.</p>
<p>Releasing <em>Don't Starve</em> first would serve as a test.</p>
<p>Because compared to the previously mentioned games, <em>Don't Starve</em> had one crucial characteristic:</p>
<p>Its objective was extremely clear.</p>
<p>As a sandbox game with high freedom, new players entering without prior experience would most likely be completely bewildered.</p>
<p>In the previous life, many <em>Minecraft</em> players, upon entering the game, didn't even understand the difference between Creative and Survival modes.</p>
<p>And the complex tools? Many couldn't even make a crafting table.</p>
<p>For most new players, they could only do two things: dig holes in place and chop down trees.</p>
<p>Although this was partly due to inadequate tutorial guidance, it was also because the excessive freedom overwhelmed players unfamiliar with sandbox gameplay, leaving them bewildered.</p>
<p><em>Don't Starve</em>, on the other hand, was much more direct—whether Survival, Adventure, or Team mode—</p>
<p>It immediately told players the core goal: explore and collect resources in an unfamiliar world, build various production facilities, and survive as long as possible.</p>
<p>This directly gave players a main quest: survival.</p>
<p>With this main quest, players wouldn't feel entirely bewildered, because they knew their purpose in the game was survival, and their goal was to achieve it.</p>
<p>Through this objective, players could gradually experience sandbox gameplay and discover the rich content within <em>Don't Starve</em>.</p>
<p>Various scene maps—plains, swamps, grasslands, mines, forests, caves—each terrain produced different resources, and the monsters spawning on them also varied.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game's basic rules included Season Settings.</p>
<p>Spring brought frequent rain, and crops grew faster than in other seasons.</p>
<p>In summer, flammable materials could spontaneously ignite, and the character's body temperature would rapidly rise, leading to Heatstroke State.</p>
<p>In winter, crops grew slowly, the character's temperature dropped quickly, and they entered Frostbite State.</p>
<p>Combined with Random Map Generation Settings, every survival journey offered a unique experience.</p>
<p>On another note, as a sandbox game, part of the fun came from various MODs.</p>
<p>In the previous life, <em>Minecraft</em> remained popular for over a decade, and the MOD community played a monumental role in its longevity.</p>
<p>In this regard, the Workshop (modding platform) on the Nebula Games Platform had already laid a solid foundation through <em>Overcooked</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em>.</p>
<p>Currently, <em>Overcooked</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em> still maintained considerable popularity, primarily due to the thriving MOD community.</p>
<p>The platform users and the Workshop (modding platform) were already well-established.</p>
<p>All that remained was to observe the Player Performance Feedback brought by <em>Don't Starve</em>.</p>
