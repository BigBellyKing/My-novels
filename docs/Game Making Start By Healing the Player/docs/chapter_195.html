<p>Chapter 194: Don't Starve (7th update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)</p>
<p>As the screen displayed the image, everyone's attention was drawn to the <code>Don't Starve</code> <code>Concept Drafts</code> before them.</p>
<p>In front of the <code>Concept Drafts</code>, <code>Chen Xu</code> had already completed some simple art illustrations for the game.</p>
<p>In the wilderness, a dishevelled figure sat in front of a campfire, while distant <code>spiders</code>, <code>wild boars</code>, and other <code>monsters</code> slowly approached.</p>
<p>It wasn't colored, but the game's style was immediately apparent.</p>
<p>“Is this a survival type of game?”</p>
<p>“This <code>art style</code> is so eerie; the rough lines give it a European and American cartoon style?”</p>
<p>“It's similar to <code>It Takes Two</code> and <code>Overcooked (Chinese title)</code>. Is it a cooperative type of game?”</p>
<p>Looking at the <code>Don't Starve</code> game title and concept art, everyone present was quietly guessing what type of game it actually was.</p>
<p>“Just like the game's name, <code>Don't Starve</code>, what <code>players</code> need to do in the game is not let themselves die. <code>Survival</code> is the sole <code>core</code> of the entire game.”</p>
<p>“<code>Collect</code> <code>stone</code>, <code>twigs</code>, <code>craft</code> <code>hunting tools</code>, climb the <code>tech tree</code>, establish your own <code>camp</code>, then <code>explore</code> the unknown world to <code>survive</code> better.”</p>
<p>“Also, in the game, <code>players</code> might suffer a <code>mental breakdown</code> and go crazy from facing various eerie monsters, <code>freeze to death</code> from being too cold, <code>starve to death</code> from being too hungry, or die from <code>attacks</code> by <code>wild monsters</code>.”</p>
<p><code>Chen Xu</code> explained the <code>core idea</code> of <code>Don't Starve</code> to everyone.</p>
<p>“<code>Does anyone have any more questions?</code>” <code>Chen Xu</code> asked.</p>
<p>As he finished speaking, <code>Qin Yi</code> stroked his chin while looking at the big screen on the <code>Concept Drafts</code>: “So this is a <code>survival game</code>? But <code>Mr. Chen</code>, if it's too difficult, won't <code>players</code> <code>stop playing</code>?”</p>
<p><code>Ruan Ningxue</code> beside him also nodded: “<code>That's right, Mr. Chen. Dark Souls</code> is a <code>big production</code> with <code>top-tier graphics</code>, <code>plot</code>, and <code>action</code>. But <code>Don't Starve</code> is clearly a <code>small-scale production</code> and lacks that external appeal to make <code>players</code> <code>keep playing</code>. Won't it <code>turn players away</code> right from the start?”</p>
<p>“<code>By the way, why do you all think this is a game that makes you suffer?</code>” <code>Chen Xu</code> was a little speechless.</p>
<p>The slightly eerie <code>art style</code>, coupled with it being a <code>survival game</code>.</p>
<p>What with <code>mental breakdowns</code>, <code>freezing to death</code> from cold, <code>starving to death</code> from hunger, and <code>wild monster attacks</code>,</p>
<p>One could say that from <code>Chen Xu</code>'s introduction, it felt like the <code>protagonist</code> was <code>constantly facing</code> the <code>threat of death</code>.</p>
<p>Considering <code>Dark Souls</code>, <code>Silent Hill PT</code>, and the tear-jerking <code>The one with the big hammer</code> that <code>Chen Xu</code> developed previously, along with the <code>Death Mode</code> recently launched.</p>
<p><code>Subconsciously</code>, they immediately thought of <code>suffering</code>.</p>
<p>“<code>Difficulty</code> will definitely be present, but unlike <code>Dark Souls (informal)</code>, <code>players</code> will have choices.” <code>Chen Xu</code> explained, a little speechless.</p>
<p>Did he look like the kind of <code>game designer</code> who enjoyed tormenting <code>players</code>? It was too much; he'd lost all their <code>trust</code>!</p>
<p>“<code>Alright, let me give you a detailed explanation of this game's design direction. The game's core revolves around survival, encouraging players to explore, collect...</code>”</p>
<p>After <code>explaining</code> the <code>design philosophy</code> of <code>Don't Starve</code> to everyone, they all went back to their respective <code>work</code>.</p>
<p>In his <code>previous life</code>, <code>Don't Starve</code> could be said to be a very unique <code>small-scale game production</code>.</p>
<p>Although it was a <code>small-scale game production</code>, its <code>sales volume</code> was even more astonishing than some <code>AAA-tier game</code>s.</p>
<p><code>In his previous life</code>, on the <code>Steam Platform</code>, <code>Don't Starve</code>'s <code>sales volume</code> exceeded ten million.</p>
<p>Later, after being distributed by <code>Tencent</code> and launched on the <code>WeGame Store</code>, its <code>sales volume</code> surpassed one million in the first month, and then quickly exceeded three million in a very short time.</p>
<p>Of course, there were reasons for this booming success. Initially, <code>Don't Starve</code> was only a <code>single-player game</code>. Although it possessed a <code>unique charm</code>, it lacked a <code>breakout point</code>.</p>
<p>It wasn't until the release of the <code>Online Multiplayer Version</code> that <code>Don't Starve</code>'s <code>sales volume</code> truly experienced <code>explosive growth</code>.</p>
<p>Choosing such a game as the <code>team</code>'s next <code>development project</code>.</p>
<p>On one hand, it was due to <code>Don't Starve</code>'s excellence and charm, and on the other, it was for the future <code>strategy</code> of the <code>Nebula Games Store</code>.</p>
<p>Using <code>Don't Starve</code> as a <code>touchstone</code> to gauge <code>players'</code> <code>enthusiasm</code> for <code>survival and sandbox games</code>.</p>
<p>As for <code>sandbox games</code>, there were actually many other choices, such as the hugely popular <code>Valheim</code> from his <code>previous life</code>, and of course, <code>Minecraft</code> and <code>Terraria</code>.</p>
<p>But considering that <code>sandbox mode</code> hadn't yet become popular in the <code>Parallel World</code>, although <code>Chen Xu</code> had already noticed some <code>games with sandbox attributes</code> appearing.</p>
<p>Yet, they hadn't formed an <code>independent genre</code>.</p>
<p><code>Players</code> were still relatively unfamiliar with this <code>game mode</code>.</p>
<p><code>Launching Don't Starve</code> first was considered a <code>touchstone</code>.</p>
<p>Because compared to the <code>games</code> mentioned earlier, <code>Don't Starve</code> had one most <code>core characteristic</code>.</p>
<p>Namely, its objective was very clear.</p>
<p>As a <code>sandbox game</code> with a high degree of <code>freedom</code>, <code>new players</code> entering the game who hadn't played similar titles would very likely be directly <code>bewildered</code> and dumbfounded.</p>
<p><code>In his previous life</code>, many <code>Minecraft players</code> entered the game and at first couldn't even understand the difference between <code>Creative (mode)</code> and <code>Survival Mode</code>.</p>
<p>Not to mention all sorts of complex <code>tools</code>; many people couldn't even make a <code>crafting table</code>.</p>
<p>For most <code>players</code> just entering the game, they basically only knew two things: <code>digging dirt</code> in place and <code>chopping down trees</code>.</p>
<p>Although it was partly related to the <code>game tutorial</code>, on the other hand, it was also due to excessive <code>freedom</code>, which left <code>players</code> who were still <code>immature</code> in <code>sandbox gameplay</code> feeling <code>bewildered</code>.</p>
<p><code>Don't Starve</code>, on the other hand, was more direct, whether it was <code>survival</code>, adventure, or <code>cooperation</code>.</p>
<p>It immediately told <code>players</code> the <code>game's core</code>: to <code>explore</code> and <code>gather resources</code> as much as possible in an unknown world, <code>build</code> various <code>means of production</code>, and strive to <code>survive</code> for the longest time.</p>
<p>This directly gave <code>players</code> a <code>Main Objective</code>: <code>survival</code>.</p>
<p>Centered around this <code>Main Objective</code>, <code>players</code> wouldn't feel completely <code>bewildered</code>, because they would know that their purpose in the game was <code>survival</code>, and what they needed to do was achieve this <code>objective</code>.</p>
<p>And through this <code>objective</code>, <code>players</code> would gradually experience the <code>Gameplay</code> of a <code>sandbox game</code> and discover the rich content within <code>Don't Starve</code>.</p>
<p>There were various scene maps, including <code>plains</code>, <code>swamps</code>, <code>grasslands</code>, <code>mining areas</code>, <code>forests</code>, <code>caves</code>, and so on. Different <code>terrain</code> would <code>yield</code> different <code>production elements</code>, and the <code>monsters</code> generated on the <code>terrain</code> would also vary.</p>
<p>In addition, the game's <code>basic rules</code> also included <code>Season Settings</code>.</p>
<p>In <code>spring</code>, it would rain frequently, and <code>crops</code> would <code>grow</code> faster than in other <code>seasons</code>.</p>
<p><code>Summer</code>, combustibles would undergo <code>spontaneous combustion</code>, and the <code>character's body temperature</code> would rapidly rise, leading to a <code>Heatstroke State</code>.</p>
<p><code>Winter</code>, <code>crops</code> would <code>grow slowly</code>, the <code>character's body temperature</code> would rapidly drop, leading to a <code>Frostbite State</code>.</p>
<p>Coupled with certain <code>Random Map Generation Settings</code>, every <code>player's survival journey</code> would be a different experience.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as a <code>sandbox game</code>, another part of the fun came from various <code>MODs</code>.</p>
<p><code>In his previous life</code>, <code>Minecraft</code> was able to remain long-lasting for over a decade, and various <code>MODs</code> could be said to have <code>played a crucial role</code>.</p>
<p>In this area, the <code>Nebula Games Platform</code>'s <code>Workshop (modding platform)</code> had already <code>laid the foundation</code> through <code>Overcooked (Chinese title)</code> and <code>Fall Guys</code>.</p>
<p>Currently, <code>Overcooked (Chinese title)</code> and <code>Fall Guys</code> still maintained considerable <code>popularity</code> among <code>players</code>, primarily due to the creation of their <code>MOD community</code>.</p>
<p><code>Platform users</code> and the <code>Workshop (modding platform)</code> were all in place.</p>
<p>All that remained was to see the <code>Player Performance Feedback</code> that <code>Don't Starve</code> would bring.</p>
