<p>Chapter 311: What the heck is this black thing? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>"Haha, playing Fuze is so awesome! I declare he's officially my signature Operator now!"</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was also brimming with excitement.</p>
<p>At first, he'd thought his Operator seemed kind of dumb.</p>
<p>Slow movement speed, and compared to other Operators' Flash Shield and Greatshield skills, his own shield seemed kind of weak.</p>
<p>But he never expected his skill to be this powerful—just a few thump-thump-thumps against the wall, and enemies were blown sky-high.</p>
<p>This damage is Invincible!</p>
<p>The game experience is absolutely amazing!</p>
<p>"Regroup! Regroup! Form the Train Formation! Old Zhang, you cover the rear—don't let anyone sneak up on our backs!" At this moment, Song Ren, acting as the professional counter-terrorism team leader, immediately issued orders.</p>
<p>The opposing team had clearly started retreating from the Gym, Laundry Room, and Side Warehouse.</p>
<p>Since none of them were experienced players yet, the walls inside the rooms were either Reinforced or left untouched. No one had thought to break down walls that blocked retreat paths to allow teammates better support. As a result, after the heartbeat alarm, his other teammates had only just arrived.</p>
<p>Rat-a-tat-tat-tat...</p>
<p>A burst of gunfire—but against the Greatshield at the front, the bullets caused absolutely no damage.</p>
<p>Wang Yifan felt a bit nervous seeing the cracked Glass on the shield.</p>
<p>But as enemy fire raged on, he gradually calmed down.</p>
<p>The shield only looked like it was about to shatter, but in reality, it was incredibly sturdy—showing no signs of breaking at all.</p>
<p>And he didn’t even need to release the shield to counter with his handgun.</p>
<p>His teammates behind him occasionally took aim by peeking from the side, using him as a mobile cover to fire.</p>
<p>The only thing slightly annoying for Wang Yifan was that he had to keep holding the button, or else the shield would retract.</p>
<p>His hand was starting to get sore.</p>
<p>"Move, move, move! Form a triangular formation—Greatshield holds the front, Flash Shield covers the side. Old Zhang, you're Free to operate. Joey, you're also Free!" Song Ren laughed heartily, reached the bomb site, and placed down the defusal device.</p>
<p>Now, all that remained was to wait.</p>
<p>The five of them crouched tightly together at the bomb site, positioned right against the wall on the left side of the Small Garage.</p>
<p>It was a perfect corner spot. Operators without defensive capabilities—IQ and Sledge—were sandwiched safely in the middle.</p>
<p>The Greatshield faced the Laundry Room and the staircase from the Central Kitchen—the enemy’s main firepower output point. The Flash Shield faced the Small Garage side, guarding against anyone sneaking over from the Gym.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Fuze, wielding the primary shield, faced outward, wary of anyone sneaking in from outside.</p>
<p>Although if a defender stepped outside the designated defense area, the attackers would receive a location alert,</p>
<p>the restaurant above the Garage provided a blind spot—someone could jump down from the second-floor window. If a defender silently climbed to the second floor and suddenly dropped down, such a surprise attack might actually break their Thomas the Tank Engine Iron Barrel Formation. So constant vigilance was required.</p>
<p>"We've got this!" Song Ren grinned triumphantly.</p>
<p>"Old Song, I think we're being broadcasted!" Wang Yifan suddenly noticed something.</p>
<p>"Broadcasted? What do you mean!?" Song Ren was confused.</p>
<p>Rainbow Six Siege didn't have a Warcraft-style spectator system—or at least, not one that had been released yet!</p>
<p>There was no concept of high-level matches being streamed.</p>
<p>"It's the internet cafe's internal broadcast! A notification popped up saying we were selected as lucky customers and got a 50% discount." Wang Yifan explained.</p>
<p>"So you're saying everyone in the internet cafe can see our awesome gameplay!?" Zhang Yi and the others were stunned. They'd been so caught up in the intense action—unlike Wang Yifan, who simply held the shield and pushed forward—they hadn't noticed at all.</p>
<p>"Ugh, annoying! Soon people will probably come asking us for game experience tips again." Song Ren sighed dramatically, though inwardly he was thrilled.</p>
<p>But he was actually right. Their gameplay had drawn the attention of other players waiting for seats outside the private rooms.</p>
<p>In the main hall, a crowd was completely amused by their performance.</p>
<p>'This group actually knows what they're doing!'</p>
<p>'Yeah! And that Greatshield is practically Invincible!'</p>
<p>'I wish I could play soon—wonder when a seat opens up?'</p>
<p>'Forget it for now—I checked every other internet cafe, no seats available. Might as well enjoy the show on this big screen.'</p>
<p>'Feels like this round is already won!'</p>
<p>'Yeah, only three defenders left, and they don't even have grenades. Bullets hitting the shield don't make them lose health at all!'</p>
<p>It wasn't just the regular players outside the internet cafe—Song Ren inside the game also felt victory was certain.</p>
<p>The team had already started bragging.</p>
<p>"What do you call skill? Without a doubt, we're a professional team!"</p>
<p>"Exactly! No need for direct gunfights—we just hide behind the shield and let them shoot all they want."</p>
<p>"But watch out—when the bomb defusal countdown gets close, they'll probably make an All-in Push."</p>
<p>"Don't worry. If they dare come, we'll make sure they die!"</p>
<p>Song Ren's team was filled with laughter and joy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the defending team was feeling a bit hopeless.</p>
<p>The voice channel had already turned into a blame game.</p>
<p>"Sigh! My fault, I just handed them a free win," said the Doc, who had been killed by Fuze's Cluster Charge.</p>
<p>"Now what? Should we just charge in?" Rook, holding an MP5, was depressed. This tactic was simply too frustrating.</p>
<p>That Greatshield didn't lose health no matter what!</p>
<p>And time was almost up.</p>
<p>"I should've placed my trap near the Garage," said Kapkan, also feeling down.</p>
<p>"It's not over yet—we still have a chance," Bandit suddenly noticed a detail.</p>
<p>Previously, facing the attackers' Greatshield, both Kapkan and Rook had brought impact grenades—explosives that detonated on contact, dealing damage.</p>
<p>But the Chicago Mansion map was special—most of its structures were made of planks, and in the game, planks could be destroyed.</p>
<p>"You two keep alternating fire to draw their attention. Whether we succeed or not depends on this one push!" With only seconds left before detonation, Bandit started sprinting toward the staircase in the Central Kitchen, heading for the second floor.</p>
<p>Rook and Kapkan immediately opened fire wildly, drawing Song Ren's team's attention.</p>
<p>"The gunfire's dying down."</p>
<p>"But this timer feels a bit slow."</p>
<p>"Makes sense—after all, attacking is too easy in this game. Gotta give defenders some hope, right?"</p>
<p>Song Ren's team laughed and joked, completely unaware that danger was quietly approaching.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bandit, now at the first-floor restaurant, felt tense. He wasn't sure if this would work.</p>
<p>Just moments ago, he'd noticed something—the ceiling near the Garage had been blown open.</p>
<p>And right above Song Ren's team was the restaurant.</p>
<p>In other words, from the restaurant, you could see straight into the Garage.</p>
<p>The entire Rainbow Six Siege map was three-dimensional.</p>
<p>And Bandit's Operator came with a special equipment choice at spawn: a remote bomb.</p>
<p>Any experienced FPS player knew exactly what this thing was.</p>
<p>It was simply massive in terms of damage!</p>
<p>But how well it would work in Rainbow Six Siege remained to be seen.</p>
<p>Still, this was the only idea he had left.</p>
<p>"Keep shooting! Cover my footsteps and draw their attention!" Bandit shouted into the voice channel.</p>
<p>The next moment, Rook and Kapkan opened fire like crazy—switching from rifles to handguns when out of ammo.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bandit on the second floor quietly approached the broken ceiling.</p>
<p>As competent FPS players, Song Ren's team had one defining characteristic—they never looked up.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Bandit didn't aim at people. Instead, he pulled out the remote bomb and dropped it through the gap in the rebar from the second floor.</p>
<p>Still busy bragging, Song Ren and the others suddenly saw a black, cube-like object with a beeping sound falling from above.</p>
<p>It landed right in the center of their group.</p>
<p>"What the heck is this black thing?"</p>
