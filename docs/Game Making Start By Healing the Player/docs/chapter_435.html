<p>Chapter 434: Game Launch (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>After viewing the information released by Nebula Games, many players and game designers in the industry were greatly surprised.</p>
<p>Initially, both players and industry designers had instinctively assumed that <em>Uncharted</em> would be an open-world action-adventure game.</p>
<p>After all, within the gaming industry, if anyone could best represent open-world games, without a doubt, every player and designer would mention Chen Xu.</p>
<p>But who could have imagined that this was actually a linear game?</p>
<p>Although this did explain why the graphics in <em>Uncharted</em> were so explode-worthy, the real question remained: would players accept it?</p>
<p>Even NetDragon, upon learning that Nebula Games’ new work <em>Uncharted</em> was a linear game, was equally stunned.</p>
<p>After all, the prevailing trend in the gaming industry over the past two years had been open-world games—especially since it had only been a few months since the launch of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>.</p>
<p>Many game designers believed players still had strong enthusiasm for open-world experiences.</p>
<p>Yet under these circumstances, Nebula Games had gone ahead and developed a linear game?</p>
<p>One could only say—truly worthy of Nebula Games!</p>
<p>Inside Atari’s <em>Element World</em> project team, lead designer Antorini sighed with emotion.</p>
<p>Two years ago, his project <em>Beautiful World</em> had lost out to <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, but he felt that although the game had lost, he personally had not.</p>
<p>After all, in terms of gameplay, <em>Beautiful World</em> had actually received praise from some players.</p>
<p>He believed that if Atari had fully trusted him back then, leveraging the attention-grabbing concept of cowboys battling robots, he might have successfully pivoted the game’s direction.</p>
<p>Why go head-to-head with <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> on pure cowboy and Western themes when Antorini felt he might not stand a chance?</p>
<p>But the key was, you didn’t have to fight directly.</p>
<p>Add a multiplayer mode, create DLC with subsequent story content,</p>
<p>and lean into the core idea of robots versus cowboys.</p>
<p>Later on, they could even drift toward science fiction—perhaps adopting a sci-fi Western aesthetic.</p>
<p>Another regret Antorini had from last year was that Chen Xu hadn’t developed a VR game, leaving him without a chance to reclaim his pride. This had left him with considerable disappointment.</p>
<p>But who would have thought—this time, fate had brought them face to face again!</p>
<p>The only difference was that this time, the genre of the game was different.</p>
<p>Antorini felt he held a significant advantage with his open-world theme!</p>
<p>Even if he won, though, it would feel somewhat like an unfair victory!</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>At Nebula Games, Chen Xu remained unaware of Antorini’s confident mindset over at Atari.</p>
<p><em>Uncharted</em> continued its steady promotional campaign.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Atari’s marketing efforts didn’t let up either.</p>
<p>Across the gaming industry, the top two hot topics were completely dominated by <em>Uncharted</em> and <em>Element World</em>.</p>
<p>As for NetDragon’s <em>Shadow Operations: Communication Interrupted</em>, its promotion was moderate—some warm-up, but not large-scale—maintaining steady popularity.</p>
<p>Clearly, they were trying to avoid going head-to-head with the new releases from Nebula Games and Atari.</p>
<p>Other game developers adopted the same strategy.</p>
<p>After all, Nebula Games and Atari had long been fierce rivals.</p>
<p>Under the watchful eyes of global players, <em>Uncharted</em> was the first to announce its official launch date.</p>
<p>It would be published on May 1st.</p>
<p>After Nebula Games made this announcement,</p>
<p>Atari, which had previously been aggressively competing in promotion, suddenly fell silent.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because their progress simply couldn’t keep up!</p>
<p>Looking at <em>Uncharted</em>’s release date, inside the <em>Element World</em> project office at Atari, Antorini felt like he had punched straight into cotton.</p>
<p>At the current pace, <em>Element World</em> would need at least another half a month to finish development.</p>
<p>And even after development was complete, the game still couldn’t launch immediately—it would require pre-release testing.</p>
<p>Although <em>Uncharted</em> was a linear game, which naturally involved much less workload than an open-world game,</p>
<p>how could Nebula Games be moving this fast?</p>
<p>Did you guys strap rockets to your backs?</p>
<p>Antorini felt deeply depressed.</p>
<p>As for promoting <em>Element World</em>?</p>
<p>Better take a break for now.</p>
<p>Promoting at this point would only end up helping Nebula Games.</p>
<p>With <em>Element World</em>’s marketing going quiet, online players were equally speechless.</p>
<p>Many had expected <em>Element World</em> to quickly follow up by announcing its own release date, setting the stage for a direct showdown with Nebula Games.</p>
<p>But now, suddenly—silence?</p>
<p>Judging from Atari’s earlier behavior, they had clearly seemed bold and confident—surely not afraid of Nebula Games.</p>
<p>So why had they suddenly gone silent?</p>
<p>The only possible explanation was that the game simply wasn’t finished yet.</p>
<p>If that was the case, why had they promoted it so intensely before, as if the entire world should be focused on them?</p>
<p>Were they just clowning around? Making everything seem so real!</p>
<p>Many players who had eagerly awaited <em>Element World</em> now felt deeply disappointed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fans of <em>Uncharted</em> were celebrating with drums and fireworks.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone was purely excited—some players felt a bit apprehensive.</p>
<p>During the promotional period, <em>Uncharted</em> had revealed quite a bit of information to players.</p>
<p>Technical and gameplay details were secondary; what worried players the most was the game’s subtitle.</p>
<p>Like <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>,</p>
<p><em>Uncharted</em> also had a subtitle, which had been announced during promotion: <em>A Thief’s End</em>.</p>
<p>The moment this title was revealed, many players felt a chill run through them.</p>
<p>Under Chen Xu’s official Weibo account, numerous players left comments.</p>
<p>But this time, Chen Xu showed absolutely no intention of replying.</p>
<p>Instantly, many players fell into pessimistic emotions.</p>
<p>They declared that ‘Nathan Drake’ was already doomed. The only thing left to wonder was how exactly Nathan Drake would meet his end in the game.</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games’ lounge, Yang Xin and others looked at Chen Xu with astonishment as he casually browsed the official Weibo.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, players online are misunderstanding you so badly this time—aren’t you going to reply?” Ruan Ningxue asked curiously.</p>
<p>In the past, whenever players had wrongly accused him, Chen Xu would always respond immediately.</p>
<p>Now, before the game had even launched, players had already assumed the protagonist would die—yet they all knew that <em>Uncharted: A Thief’s End</em> was completely different from what players imagined. It was actually a joyful story. Why wasn’t Chen Xu stepping in to clarify?</p>
<p>“When players believe they’re about to play a game that will break their hearts,” Chen Xu smiled, “only to discover a happy ending, that’s when they’ll truly feel sufficient surprise.”</p>
<p>Of course, there was another unspoken thought in his mind.</p>
<p>Right now, players misunderstood him. But the moment the ending was revealed, that misunderstanding would turn into guilt. And the label of being a ‘heartbreaker’ in the eyes of players would naturally blur.</p>
<p>Everything is under control!</p>
