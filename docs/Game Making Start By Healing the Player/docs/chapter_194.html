                <p>Chapter 193: New Directional Arrangements (6th update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Emerging from the office, Chen Xu arrived at the lounge area.</p>
<p>Many people were playing <em>Dark Souls</em> in Death Mode.</p>
<p>However, judging by their screens, it was clear they were all dying quite miserably.</p>
<p>“Still playing? But neither of you has even beaten the first phase!” Chen Xu said with a smile as he opened a can of coke and approached Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, this is too hard! Why don't you give us a demonstration?” Ruan Ningxue offered him the controller, gesturing.</p>
<p>“I can play, but there’s no need. This game has a leaderboard function, and if I, the designer, played, wouldn’t players question behind-the-scenes manipulation? To protect my good reputation, I can’t do such a thing,” Chen Xu firmly declined.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, you're overthinking it. Among players, your reputation is practically enough to make children cry at night!” Yang Xin retorted.</p>
<p>“Oh, right, Mr. Chen, will our next game apply the latest AI technology?” Yang Xin continued to ask.</p>
<p>“No, judging by the performance of 'Death Mode,' it's still quite a distance from the imagined level. The reason players feel it's difficult is mainly due to the combat rhythm and related data. The BOSSes are indeed stronger than the original, but the extent to which AI alone makes BOSSes stronger is quite limited. It still needs further research and optimization for a period before it can be truly applied to games,” Chen Xu said, gently shaking his head.</p>
<p>After chatting for a while with Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and Qin Yi and others who came over upon hearing the voices.</p>
<p>Chen Xu returned to his office, leaning back in his chair, slowly twirling a ballpoint pen in his hand.</p>
<p>Currently, he wasn't immediately starting a new game.</p>
<p>Because there were still two aspects of work.</p>
<p>One aspect was the subsequent DLC content for <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>In <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em>, Chen Xu had directly integrated the original DLC content into the main game.</p>
<p>As for the prequel, which was originally <em>Dark Souls 3</em>, considering the game's plot, progress, and related difficulty.</p>
<p>Thus, The Ringed City and the Painted World were not directly brought to players.</p>
<p>Now, they could be used for subsequent updates to complete all of <em>Dark Souls</em>' content.</p>
<p>As for many players in his previous life questioning the 'retcon' setting in The Ringed City.</p>
<p>But in reality, whether it was <em>Dark Souls 1</em> or <em>Dark Souls 3</em> as the final installment, the entire story of Linking the Fire was ambiguous.</p>
<p>Whether it was a conspiracy, or Gwyn's selflessness, and what exactly The Abyss and the Dark Souls were, there was no clear statement.</p>
<p>Moreover, <em>Dark Souls 1</em> itself was an IP that spanned ten years in his previous life. Initially, there were things in the game that weren't explicitly stated, but through various discussions among Souls scholars and a growing number of players taking sides, they subtly became what players considered 'truth'.</p>
<p>But frankly, it was still just player speculation, not genuinely confirmed by the official developers.</p>
<p>And there's no need to rush the development of these two DLCs. They can be released slowly, eventually offered to players as a half-sale, half-giveaway.</p>
<p>After all, it's simply to complete the overall worldview of Dark Souls.</p>
<p>As for the plot, players can just guess for themselves, just like they do now.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it was about the AI technology from Galaxy Smart Tech.</p>
<p>The current Death Mode applied the latest AI technology, although it sufficiently tormented players worldwide.</p>
<p>However, in terms of actual performance, it was still far from what Chen Xu had envisioned.</p>
<p>Moreover, there was a significant difference compared to when Chen Xu had previously observed it. Evidently, a simple demonstration differs from actual in-game application.</p>
<p>The AI still required continuous optimization and development. However, considering the golden item he drew last year, the loading time hadn't fully decreased yet, so Chen Xu estimated it was likely still in an incubation state.</p>
<p>Regardless, at least the current performance of AI in games was definitely not enough to be a core selling point.</p>
<p>Leaning back in his chair, Chen Xu closed his eyes, deep in thought.</p>
<p>What remained was the arrangement for new titles.</p>
<p>Looking back at the past two years, the blockbusters brought forth included the <em>Dark Souls</em> duology. As for <em>It Takes Two</em>, even on the Nebula Games Platform alone, it could barely be counted.</p>
<p>Coupled with various promotional activities in between, and the accumulated success of <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em>, Nebula Games Platform's current user base was definitely not small.</p>
<p>As for active users, it still relied on these two games, <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em>.</p>
<p>It couldn't compare to large platforms, but in the realm of independent platforms, it was already considered top-tier.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the two <em>Dark Souls</em> titles had also successfully established Nebula Games' reputation.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the games until the end of the year, Chen Xu wasn't planning to focus on blockbusters.</p>
<p>On one hand, time wasn't entirely sufficient, and on the other hand, since <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em> had just been released, there was truly no need to seamlessly follow it with another blockbuster.</p>
<p>At the same time, Chen Xu already had a predetermined direction in mind for subsequent game development.</p>
<p>That was to focus on maintaining the player base of the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>From nothing to something, Nebula Games had already laid a sufficiently solid foundation.</p>
<p>Next was the time to gradually lay the foundation and then tentatively explore outwardly.</p>
<p>As for the game types, Chen Xu already had a draft in mind.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Monday, in Nebula Games' conference room.</p>
<p>“Next, I'll briefly discuss the upcoming direction. First, Lin Tao will establish a dedicated team to develop subsequent <em>Dark Souls</em> DLC content. I will provide the corresponding design concept documents, and the development time is quite generous, so there's no need to rush. If necessary, we can even wait until next year's National Day holiday for launch, as that will coincide with Dark Souls’ third anniversary,” Chen Xu said with a joke.</p>
<p>“After that, our next actions will primarily revolve around the Nebula Games Platform, developing some small-scale games,” Chen Xu stated.</p>
<p>“Small-scale, low-cost games?” Hearing Chen Xu's words, Qin Yi and the others were a bit taken aback, and also slightly disappointed.</p>
<p>“Don’t underestimate small-scale, low-cost games. While large games certainly have their advantages, small-scale, low-cost games also have their unique characteristics.”</p>
<p>“Don't forget <em>Fall Guys</em>. In terms of sales, how many so-called blockbusters can surpass it?” Chen Xu said, smiling at everyone.</p>
<p>After hearing Chen Xu's words, everyone's expressions also became serious.</p>
<p>At the same time, some people who thought further ahead understood the meaning behind Chen Xu's words.</p>
<p>Clearly, the upcoming games were primarily intended to advance the development of the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>They also clearly understood what it would mean if the Nebula Games Store could take off.</p>
<p>“Alright, let's take a look at the new titles to be developed next,” Chen Xu said with a smile, then connected his laptop.</p>
<p>A design concept document appeared on the large screen in the conference room.</p>
<p>On it was written the game's title: <em>Don't Starve</em>.</p>
