<p>Chapter 588: Is This Still The Witcher? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>At dawn, just like every other regular Witcher player, Grayson immediately logged into <em>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</em>'s two DLCs through Huanyu VR.</p>
<p>Although he had been persuaded during the previous meeting to agree to a delay, in a way, that meant he had already conceded defeat.</p>
<p>Losing to Chen Xu wasn't embarrassing, but the fact that he had backed down before even facing the full game—let alone just a DLC—was something he found slightly unbearable.</p>
<p>Thus, this time, he entered the game immediately, eager to conduct his own investigation.</p>
<p>However, Grayson quickly noticed something unusual.</p>
<p>The new expansion content allowed players to start a completely new save file without inheriting any previous progress.</p>
<p>Moreover, Geralt wouldn't start at Level 1. Instead, players could directly allocate skill points and choose their Signs and playstyles right from the beginning.</p>
<p>This design immediately made Grayson's expression grow serious.</p>
<p>There was only one reason for such a design choice:</p>
<p>To maximize player immersion into the story content of <em>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</em>'s expansion.</p>
<p>Although <em>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</em> was an open-world game, its RPG elements were still dominant.</p>
<p>But now, giving players such a high starting level—was this cutting down on progression elements?</p>
<p>Grayson quietly speculated.</p>
<p>"Blood and Wine and Hearts of Stone... I'll try Blood and Wine first."</p>
<p>Looking at the two different expansions, chronologically, Hearts of Stone came before Blood and Wine.</p>
<p>Judging by the order, the developers clearly intended players to experience Hearts of Stone first, then proceed to Blood and Wine.</p>
<p>Yet Grayson decided to test things out by starting with Blood and Wine, as he hadn't been completely unaware of the context.</p>
<p>From Nebula Games' Direct Presentation Launch Event held at the theme park, he knew that while Hearts of Stone focused on a darker narrative, Blood and Wine was set in an entirely new region—Toussaint.</p>
<p>This new map was completely different from Kaer Morhen, Velen, Novigrad, and the Skellige Isles.</p>
<p><em>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</em> had always given players a cold and oppressive atmosphere.</p>
<p>But Blood and Wine's portrayal of Toussaint was entirely opposite—warm, joyful, and breathtakingly beautiful.</p>
<p>In terms of style, many players found it refreshing and surprising. However, as a game designer, Grayson understood clearly that such a shift carried significant risk.</p>
<p>Different styles could easily result in a jarring, unnatural feeling.</p>
<p>If not handled carefully, this wouldn't be a highlight—it would be a flaw.</p>
<p>Yet, as soon as Grayson truly entered the game, he realized his concerns might be unfounded.</p>
<p>Through concise dialogue and political exposition, the game instantly explained to players why Toussaint was so unique.</p>
<p>Why? Because Toussaint had a powerful protector.</p>
<p>Anna Henrietta, the current Duchess of Toussaint, was a cousin of the Emperor of Nilfgaard.</p>
<p>Under the Empire's protection, Toussaint remained completely untouched by the continent's conflicts, becoming a secluded paradise.</p>
<p>Moreover, Toussaint's geography was exceptionally favorable, and its wine industry was renowned across the continent. All these factors combined to make Toussaint feel like an idealized realm.</p>
<p>The people here also deeply revered chivalric culture.</p>
<p>Knights were expected to uphold the Five Virtues.</p>
<p>As for why Geralt arrived here, it was to investigate a case.</p>
<p>In the year 1275—three years after the main events of <em>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</em>—a series of bizarre murders occurred in Beauclair, the capital of Toussaint.</p>
<p>Two noble victims had been killed, their bodies torn apart as if by a wild beast. The public thus nicknamed the mysterious killer the 'Beast of Beauclair'.</p>
<p>With the upcoming Tourney in Beauclair, the Duchess, seeking to quickly identify the culprit and calm public unrest, called upon the legendary Witcher: Geralt of Rivia.</p>
<p>Under the escort of two respected knights, the player thus arrived in Toussaint—a land resembling a fairytale world.</p>
<p>"Is this really still The Witcher?" Grayson couldn't believe his eyes.</p>
<p>It was simply too different.</p>
<p>Especially given how the game was filled with humorous Easter eggs throughout.</p>
<p>For example, right at the beginning, a knight could be seen charging at a windmill—only for a monster to appear behind the windmill and brutally beat the knight.</p>
<p>This was a clear reference to Don Quixote. Additionally, when Geralt investigated underwater, he could find a note with the initials 'DLC'—a playful nod from the developers.</p>
<p>Truly, every moment brought a new surprise.</p>
<p>..................</p>
<p>Grayson wasn't alone. All players who had entered the game and chosen to experience Blood and Wine first shared the same feeling.</p>
<p>"Does this even feel like <em>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</em> anymore?"</p>
<p>'+1. If the protagonist wasn't still Geralt and the UI interface wasn't clearly from <em>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</em>, I'd think I was playing a completely different game!'</p>
<p>'Toussaint's architecture seems inspired by Southern France.'</p>
<p>'Yeah, the giant behind the windmill at the beginning speaks 'pté'—which is French for pâté (meat paste).'</p>
<p>'Toussaint is literally a fairytale world!'</p>
<p>Online, players who had just entered the game were eagerly expressing their amazement and discussing it across various communities.</p>
<p>It wasn't just the shift in visual style and tone, but also the gameplay experience.</p>
<p>In White Orchard, Velen, and Novigrad, people's attitudes toward Witchers were uniformly unfriendly.</p>
<p>They were feared, regarded with dread, or even seen as freaks. Whether nobles or common folk, nearly everyone treated Witchers like Geralt with extreme hostility. To most people, Witchers were essentially Tool-men—hired only when terrifying monsters appeared and no one else could deal with them. Otherwise, they were avoided at all costs.</p>
<p>But in Toussaint, things were completely different. The people here weren't just slightly more welcoming toward Geralt the Witcher—they were genuinely kind.</p>
<p>The locals didn't harbor any hatred toward Witchers. This stark contrast in treatment was enough to make one sigh with emotion.</p>
<p>The people of Toussaint were the complete opposite of those outside.</p>
<p>................</p>
<p>Grayson continued playing. Initially, he had been amazed by Toussaint.</p>
<p>But as the story progressed, his designer instincts kicked in. He敏锐ly realized that while the surface had changed, the core tone of the game had never wavered. Beneath the new exterior, <em>The Witcher</em>'s profound, distinctive essence remained intact.</p>
<p>No matter how beautiful and radiant a place appeared, there would always be something dark and corrupt lurking beneath. Even a fairytale paradise like Toussaint was no exception.</p>
<p>Returning to the main quest, Geralt headed to a nearby abandoned vineyard. But upon arrival, he discovered a female Vampire had already gotten there first, slaughtering all the guards.</p>
<p>After a fierce battle and defeating her, Geralt could finally examine the victims' corpses.</p>
<p>Gaining some clues, he then resolved a monster-induced crisis at the Tourney arena before finally meeting the Duchess.</p>
<p>He reported his findings, and to his surprise, the Duchess generously gifted him the White Raven Vineyard—where the bodies were kept—and promised a large sum of money upon completion of the task.</p>
<p>Afterward, Geralt questioned the captain of the guard and began piecing together the killer's motive: to expose the dark side of Toussaint's veteran knights.</p>
<p>Here, knights were expected to uphold the Five Virtues: Honor, Wisdom, Generosity, Courage, and Mercy.</p>
<p>The first two victims had both engaged in immoral acts. One's corpse was left hanging on the gallows at the execution ground, symbolizing a violation of Honor. The other was dressed in pajamas, made to look absurd and ridiculous—implying a betrayal of Wisdom.</p>
<p>Thus, the Beast's ultimate message was clear:</p>
<p>The old knights of Toussaint have abandoned the Five Virtues!</p>
