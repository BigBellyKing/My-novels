                <p>Chapter 295: The Dust Settles (7th update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)</p>
<p>Chen Xu's live stream room and a commentator's live stream room on Shark TV were both extremely lively. Before this, no one had imagined such a situation would occur. Moreover, in a situation of population disadvantage, they were even stronger than having a larger population. After all, generally speaking, in RTS, the more population usually means the stronger you are. Who could have imagined that with a population disadvantage, he would pull off a Cyclone strategy.</p>
<p>“Brother Sun!” In the official commentary booth, Huang Donglai looked at Sun Yixie beside him.</p>
<p>“Brother Huang, we’re in trouble!” Sun Yixie ran a hand through his hair. Why did he have to run his mouth again? In that instant, his mind recalled a game that had once made it difficult for him to breathe.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the RTS Group Chat, a group of pro gamers and high-end master players felt a new door had opened for them.</p>
<p>“So Night Elves can be played like this! Truly eye-opening, they had no power to retaliate!”</p>
<p>“A bit of hindsight, mainly it’s also because Guadi didn’t know this strategy. Not to mention starting with a Far Seer, at least as a second hero he would pick a Tauren, and also upgrade the Tauren Totem early, instead of waiting for the opponent's Raptor Druids to be fully formed, and only having two Spirit Walkers.”</p>
<p>“Also, the items on the map are very important. Unaware of the strength of this strategy, Guadi didn’t buy a Potion of Invulnerability; otherwise, with a fully geared Blademaster who had consumed an invulnerability potion, he could have at least cut down two before being blown away.”</p>
<p>“But speaking of it, Mr. Chen played four rounds tonight, showcasing the characteristics of each race. But damn it, he didn’t showcase the Orcs!”</p>
<p>“Now that you mention it, I remember too! Why are only our Orcs getting hurt?”</p>
<p>Both players and some RTS masters were engaged in a heated discussion. Especially game designers who had been closely following this balance crisis in Warcraft were now silent.</p>
<p>Especially in Hero Entertainment’s office, Zhou Qi’s face was ashen. How are you supposed to compete with Chen Xu like this? When their games had balance issues, they would carefully make small numerical adjustments, fearing a backlash from players. But you, Chen Xu, on the other hand, had balance issues.</p>
<p>All you players say Orcs are strong, right? Then I’ll go do a live stream to prove it, and not only did I prove it, I even hammered the Orc pro gamer. Now, do you say it’s your technique and game understanding that’s problematic, or is his game balance problematic? In essence, this was a form of sophistry. Because player understanding inevitably conflicts with the game's initial settings, leading to seemingly balanced crises. In such situations, designers generally only have two choices.</p>
<p>The first is to directly nerf hero stats or even rework skills based on current player understanding. And then, when the player base's understanding deepened, they would revert those changes. This created a feeling of constant flip-flopping for players. But in reality, this was feedback given by designers based on the understanding of the larger player base.</p>
<p>The second option is to simply nerf, for example, if players feel a certain race is too strong, they directly cut its power, or simply buff the other three weaker races. But in this situation, it's very likely that as players delve deeper into the game, heroes initially considered strong by players would plummet into obsolescence.</p>
<p>But now? Chen Xu directly used his performance to show players that he actually understood the game Warcraft. Naturally, this also fostered a sense of trust among players. At the very least, if your skill hasn't reached Chen Xu's level, how can you have the nerve to trash Warcraft's balance? And this was precisely something other designers couldn't emulate.</p>
<p>After the game, seeing the screen full of bullet comments strongly requesting him to play two more rounds, Chen Xu stretched and limbered up, then responded. “Let’s not play two more rounds; that’s enough for today. I’m not a professional streamer or pro gamer. Besides, Warcraft will have a rather special update later, which should interest most players. Alright, that’s all for today.” Chen Xu said.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu’s words, countless players were stunned. Not a professional streamer or pro gamer? But you damn well hammered a pro gamer! However, after expressing their speechlessness, many players focused on another point in Chen Xu's words. A new version of Warcraft!? But what the heck is a 'special update'? Could it be a new race? The Naga from the previous campaign? Or perhaps a Warcraft campaign storyline? Many players sent bullet comments, preparing to ask questions. However, the next second, something bewildering happened to countless people. The live stream screen went black. A line of large characters appeared in the center. ‘The streamer you follow has ended broadcast!’ Countless players had question marks on their faces. What the heck, Monster Hunter: World’s demo version had a cliffhanger, then Warcraft’s trial version also had one, and now he’s showing them the balance, only to end with another cliffhanger? Is there any humanity left?!</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>The next day, Chen Xu's Warcraft live stream became the hot topic of the day. It was clearly a huge hot topic. Of course, it was accompanied by bald photos of two famous professional commentators. Many players who were previously unaware of this were stunned when they saw the news released by gaming media. At the same time, across the entire Warcraft ladder, countless players simultaneously chose the Night Elf, Undead, and Human races. There was no helping it; Chen Xu only played these three during his live stream, after all. Just like most people feel an itch to start the game and play around after watching exciting video highlights. All the players who watched Chen Xu's live stream felt the same. Moreover, after selecting their race, these players followed consistent playstyle scripts. Night Elves started with Beastmaster, Undead barrack produced Crypt Fiends, and Humans rushed into the opponent's base with a group of Peasants. However, when these tactics fell into the hands of ordinary players, they created a very bizarre scene. Night Elf players started with Beastmaster to harass the opponent's base, resulting in the death of summoned units and heroes. They used Ancient of War to creep large neutral camps for leveling up, but the aggro and health weren't managed well. With insufficient Huntresses, the Ancient of War was directly destroyed by an A-move command. They produced Firelords from neutral taverns, and took a group of Peasants to build Guard Towers in the opponent's base, but one tower collapsed after another, and none of the Peasants they brought survived.</p>
<p>However, for many RTS masters, Chen Xu's playstyles also greatly benefited them. They earnestly began to study units and unit types that they had previously overlooked. This time, they completely understood that Warcraft was truly a game that could not be comprehended with conventional RTS game experience. Because even the same tactic would yield different results depending on the map's various spawn points. Furthermore, Chen Xu's playstyles weren't simply effective when directly copied. Using the Cyclone strategy against Orcs on small maps was very effective because it facilitated harassment and scouting, and it directly countered the Orcs' Wolf Riders. But on large and open maps, the Orcs' Wolf Rider tactics could achieve a complete reversal. Utilizing the Wolf Rider's mobility for continuous harassment and containment, the most powerful early to mid-game 50-food push of the Cyclone strategy couldn't be executed at all, leading only to a resentful defeat. The same goes for the multi-expansion strategy and Fire-Demon Towers; they all have pros and cons, requiring a discretionary choice. And this was the charm of Warcraft. During this period, no one was saying which race was too weak or too strong. Because all players understood that different races each possessed their own unique characteristics. Chen Xu had already demonstrated this through his actions. There are no invincible races, only the strongest players who use appropriate tactics to deal with different situations. However, although not many people were discussing Warcraft's balance anymore. Another matter, however, became a point of discussion for many players. That was the new version update mentioned by Chen Xu during yesterday's live stream.</p>
<p>Those still playing WAR3 are simply too strong. I've specifically practiced Fire-Demon Towers, Cyclone strategy, Frost Armor Spider, and multi-expansion on the Warcraft platform. I experienced Fire-Demon Towers from a victim's perspective, and as for the other three, I got beaten severely before they even fully formed... [Of course, it's also because these tactics are too old and not suitable for the current version (it's definitely not because I'm too bad!)]</p>
