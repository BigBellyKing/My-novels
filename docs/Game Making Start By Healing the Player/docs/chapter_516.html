                <p>Chapter 515: How Important Are the Intimate Scenes in The Witcher? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games, Chen Xu was finalizing the content development for The Witcher: Wild Hunt with various departments.</p>
<p>After all, this series was simply too massive; in terms of workload, it was comparable to the previously developed Red Dead Redemption.</p>
<p>Dark Souls and Bloodborne couldn't even compare to The Witcher: Wild Hunt.</p>
<p>This is because the former employed a fragmented narrative structure, presenting the game's background and worldview in pieces, without needing to provide a complete explanation to players.</p>
<p>However, The Witcher: Wild Hunt was different. As an open-world ARPG, it needed to fully present the game's worldview and story.</p>
<p>Chen Xu confirmed every detail with the team, from the settings of Witchers and Witchers, to the game's focus on Ciri and her Elder Blood.</p>
<p>This included the artistic scene design in the game. For example, Velen, located in the no-man's-land, would draw inspiration from the living conditions of medieval commoners in history.</p>
<p>The Skellige Isles, known for their fierce inhabitants, would be shaped with historical Norse villages as a reference.</p>
<p>In addition, there were many iconic locations, most of which would refer to similar styles, allowing players to genuinely experience the game's world.</p>
<p>There was also a large amount of script literature in the game, which would be adapted from Slavic folk tales and vampire stories, integrated into the Witcher's worldview.</p>
<p>Even the game's protagonist, Geralt, important characters Yennefer, Triss, and Ciri, as well as several key NPCs, all had substantial roles.</p>
<p>As an ARPG, it also required players to feel a strong sense of immersion. However, the previous life's The Witcher: Wild Hunt had already provided an excellent solution for this.</p>
<p>That was intimate relationships and immersive perspectives.</p>
<p>In the game, players could not only control Geralt of Rivia but also experience Ciri's journey, allowing them to better immerse themselves in her character's adventure.</p>
<p>Of course, due to space and pacing, many of the game's contents and settings related to Ciri were not fully elaborated.</p>
<p>For instance, Ciri's Elder Blood setting—some careless players didn't even grasp the intricacies of it until the very end of the game's completion.</p>
<p>For this part, Chen Xu planned to subtly mention it in the upcoming easter eggs for players.</p>
<p>The rest included Ciri's past stories, such as the rose tattoo on Ciri's inner thigh.</p>
<p>In the original game, Ciri simply mentioned that it was a tattoo commemorating someone.</p>
<p>But in reality, the story behind this tattoo was very important to Ciri, as this rose tattoo symbolized Ciri's dark past and was proof of her transformation.</p>
<p>At that time, she was living with the Rats, and this Ciri was not yet the Daughter of Space and Time who had grown through blood and slaughter.</p>
<p>Instead, she suffered severe psychological trauma from the Thanedd Coup before traversing worlds.</p>
<p>And regarding the Thanedd Coup, there was another crucial character linked to Geralt: Keira, the first character players could have an intimate encounter with while controlling Geralt in The Witcher: Wild Hunt.</p>
<p>Geralt and Keira met there, which led to their mutual assistance and ultimately, the story of their intimate encounters in the small woods in Wild Hunt.</p>
<p>During this time with the Rats, Ciri's mental state gradually improved after meeting another female member, Mistle, and they developed a romantic relationship—this was the origin of Ciri's thigh rose.</p>
<p>But good times didn't last; Ciri soon encountered the bounty hunter who brought her endless nightmares: Leo Bonhart.</p>
<p>Leo Bonhart, this bounty hunter, was once Ciri's inner nightmare. He forced Ciri to watch him chop off the heads of her lover and friends, and then imprisoned her, forcing her into gladiatorial combat.</p>
<p>Of course, the original author was not a psychopath and didn't stage a drama of 'you spare my life, I spare yours, and then we forgive each other and cry on our knees.'</p>
<p>Finally, in Stygga Castle, Ciri confronted her inner darkness and killed Leo Bonhart, her former nightmare.</p>
<p>She truly became a powerful witcher like Geralt, facing all challenges without fear.</p>
<p>Regarding these details, Chen Xu also planned to convey Ciri's story to players through narration and fragmented memories in the game and easter eggs, allowing them to better understand this character.</p>
<p>As for Yennefer and Triss, these two important female characters in Wild Hunt, the game offered a brutal yet highly effective method.</p>
<p>That was intimate scenes!</p>
<p>For other games, such as extracting red souls in God of War, it was more of a seasoning.</p>
<p>But in The Witcher: Wild Hunt, the so-called intimate scenes were quite important.</p>
<p>In the game, these contents were not dispensable. They existed to make players immerse themselves in Geralt of Rivia's perspective and inner world.</p>
<p>Players needed to understand how important characters like Yennefer and Triss were to Geralt of Rivia.</p>
<p>However, players were not Geralt, nor did they know the stories of Yennefer and Triss.</p>
<p>So, how could players understand how important Triss and Yennefer were to Geralt, and why Geralt had to help them when they encountered difficulties?</p>
<p>The answer was simple: make players understand their relationship with Geralt of Rivia.</p>
<p>And the most direct and simple way to express this was through such intimate contact.</p>
<p>Its existence was to make players understand how intimate Geralt was with these people, and how important these people were to Geralt of Rivia.</p>
<p>The unicorn scene with Yennefer, the lighthouse with Triss, and Shani on the small boat in the lake during Hearts of Stone.</p>
<p>These plotlines also served to help players better understand what kind of witcher Geralt of Rivia truly was.</p>
<p>It could be said that these intimate scenes in The Witcher: Wild Hunt were not created for lewd purposes.</p>
<p>These elements immersed players in Geralt of Rivia's emotions.</p>
<p>And led to subsequent plot developments.</p>
<p>For example, the night with the sorceress Keira in the forest made players understand why Geralt of Rivia would ask Keira to go to Kaer Morhen.</p>
<p>Of course, ignoring her fate or killing her personally would lead to different developments.</p>
<p>And these scenes were meant to better advance the game's story.</p>
<p>What about Sasha, the Iron Maiden of the Skellige Isles, or Syanna, dancing in the clouds in Blood and Wine, you ask?</p>
<p>Wasn't that just to better highlight Geralt's character traits?</p>
<p>It's already good that you're not like The Witcher 1, where you could even have intimate encounters with non-human races.</p>
