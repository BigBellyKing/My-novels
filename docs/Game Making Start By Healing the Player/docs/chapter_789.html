                <p>Chapter 788: Dragon Language Event</p>
<p>Alongside the momentum generated by The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's promotional video.</p>
<p>More and more players began discussing it across various communities and forums.</p>
<p>For gamers, any topic that could spark a debate would become something they eagerly discussed.</p>
<p>It could be said that players were a very persistent group; they could interpret profound meanings from even the tiniest details.</p>
<p>It was much like doing reading comprehension in junior high: a single punctuation mark or Chinese character could be analyzed into an essay of several hundred words.</p>
<p>As the scope of discussion expanded, it was no longer limited to just the player community.</p>
<p>Even some scholars specializing in linguistics joined in the excitement.</p>
<p>After all, linguistics was a relatively niche field; most people probably didn't even know such a discipline existed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Dragon Language in The Elder Scrolls did indeed hold some relevant meanings, and combined with Nebula Games' popularity, it wasn't too surprising.</p>
<p>“Obviously, the Dragon Language in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a fictional language, but from the content shown so far, it seems to have drawn inspiration from Germanic languages.”</p>
<p>“The plural form of 'kell' is 'kelle', which is common in Germanic languages. Additionally, the combination of 'dov' and 'k' perfectly forms 'dovahki' mentioned in the video, meaning Dragonborn, where 'k' in English refers to 'kin'.”</p>
<p>As more and more analyses appeared, countless players were stunned.</p>
<p>So, there was actually some truth to it?</p>
<p>Regarding the language in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.</p>
<p>It quickly became a trending topic.</p>
<p>After all, creating a language was quite fascinating.</p>
<p>Of course, this was also because The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim truly had no other content for players to discuss.</p>
<p>Although the promotional video and materials made players feel that the game's background setting was quite grand, it was still difficult to analyze the specifics based solely on a trailer.</p>
<p>However, the Dragonborn theme song in the trailer, combined with the Dragon Language lines, clearly offered many more avenues for discussion and hype.</p>
<p>“How could creating a language be so simple? And this is just a promotional trailer.”</p>
<p>“Exactly, what can you tell from just one promotional trailer?”</p>
<p>“Heh heh, didn't you see the professor's repost on the official Weibo not long ago? Linguistic experts are more knowledgeable than keyboard warriors, aren't they?”</p>
<p>“If you know so much, why aren't you a professor?”</p>
<p>“Damn it, you guys only read the front and not the back. Language isn't hard; the key is acceptance and completeness. You're taking things out of context, aren't you?”</p>
<p>On various community websites, while players were exploring, there were naturally also endless arguments.</p>
<p>Even within Nebula Games, Chen Xu was somewhat surprised watching the myriad discussions online.</p>
<p>The promotional video for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was solely intended to generate buzz for the game.</p>
<p>There was nothing remarkable about this aspect, but what surprised Chen Xu was that players' attention was entirely captivated by the Dragon Language in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.</p>
<p>From a linguistic perspective, while the Dragon Language in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim wasn't entirely fabricated.</p>
<p>It still wasn't capable of forming long stretches of complex words.</p>
<p>Compared to the Quenya created by Tolkien and the Klingon language from Star Trek in his previous life, it still lacked some depth.</p>
<p>However, for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, building some basic structures posed no issue.</p>
<p>“We can certainly capitalize on this in our promotions.” Watching the heated discussions online, and recalling Atari's previous promotional ad for a new game, Chen Xu suddenly thought of something and smiled slightly. He called over the head of the Marketing Department, and after discussing for about twenty minutes, sent out an official Weibo post.</p>
<p>Soon, players who were still discussing topics related to the Dragon Language online discovered this new content updated on Chen Xu's official Weibo.</p>
<p>“Regarding the Dragon Language, it indeed drew inspiration from languages such as Finnish, Germanic languages, and Cuneiform. Furthermore, during the creation of the Dragon Language, numerous linguistics professors were invited as consultants, so it is not a mere fabrication. Unlike the familiar 26 standard Latin letters, the Dragon Language has a total of 34 letters.”</p>
<p>“Among these, 25 monophones and 9 accents form the pronunciation of the Dragon Language, and its characters are all composed of three strokes, inspired by ancient cuneiform.”</p>
<p>“However, this so-called Dragon Language is merely a virtual language designed for the game and cannot be considered an independent language in its own right.”</p>
<p>“Furthermore, within the game, players can learn more about the Dragon Language through gameplay content. We will also introduce unique dungeons related to the Dragon Language, including a dedicated Dragon Language challenge quest with puzzle elements.”</p>
<p>“Moreover, upon the launch of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, the first player to complete the puzzle-solving challenge will receive a prize of 300,000 USD.”</p>
<p>“Additionally, in the game, we have added a large number of random, explorable Dragon Language Easter eggs. The first ten players to uncover these Easter eggs will receive a VR gaming pod as a reward, and the first 1000 will receive a Nebula Games voucher worth 299 Yuan.”</p>
<p>“Finally, here's a Dragon Language learning chart for everyone.”</p>
<p>As Chen Xu's official Weibo post was released, it instantly drew the attention of countless players.</p>
<p>On one hand, Chen Xu acknowledged the Dragon Language; on the other, Nebula Games was actually planning to add corresponding levels to the game.</p>
<p>A fixed Dragon Language challenge quest, with the first player to complete it receiving 300,000 USD?</p>
<p>And non-fixed, randomly distributed Dragon Language Easter eggs.</p>
<p>This immediately captured the attention of many players.</p>
<p>On one hand, the event rewards were genuinely generous; on the other, it was the momentum generated by the Dragon Language itself.</p>
<p>In an instant, related search terms like “The Elder Scrolls” and “Dragon Language” dominated trending headlines.</p>
<p>At the same time, in Atari's conference room, where they had originally planned to launch a game in this period but decided to delay it due to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's sudden appearance, relevant personnel saw Nebula Games' announcement online and their mouths twitched.</p>
<p>Completing puzzles for prizes – why did this feel so familiar?</p>
<p>Wasn't this the “sword-hunting event” that Atari had first organized when they developed Element World to compete against Uncharted?</p>
<p>And why was their popularity so immense, and so hardcore?</p>
<p>Playing a game now required learning a language, and a virtual one at that!</p>
<p>Watching countless players online discussing topics related to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's Dragon Language.</p>
<p>Some even started live streaming sessions specifically for learning the Dragon Language.</p>
<p>It wasn't just Atari; other game developers were also utterly bewildered.</p>
<p>Nebula Games, always managing to pull out new tricks!</p>
