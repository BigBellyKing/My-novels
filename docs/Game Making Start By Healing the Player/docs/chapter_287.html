<p>Chapter 286 Chen Xu is just a Game Designer, What the Heck Does He Know About Warcraft! (5 Updates, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Online, the topic of balance in Warcraft has drawn significant attention from many RTS game enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Especially players attracted to Warcraft—though they openly complain that the game has become unbalanced and turned into Orc Supremacy—they essentially still hope the official team will respond quickly, such as making balance adjustments for the current version.</p>
<p>Finally, these players received a response—but it was slightly different from what they expected.</p>
<p>"The balance in Warcraft has no issues whatsoever. There's no truth to the claim that the Orcs are overpowered. Each race has its own unique tactics and Gameplay. There are only the strongest players, not the strongest races. This Sunday, I will livestream Warcraft on Shark TV, engaging in friendly exchange with professional players participating in the Golden Tournament to demonstrate the game's balance."</p>
<p>As soon as Chen Xu posted this message, players quickly noticed the official Weibo account update.</p>
<p>It wasn't just players—industry professionals and even studios from Hero Entertainment took notice.</p>
<p>Zhou Qi, grinning like a sunflower, also saw Chen Xu's post and immediately looked bewildered.</p>
<p>Regarding the balance issues in Warcraft, he hadn't personally instigated this. Although Human Wars had a direct interest in Nebula Games' Warcraft due to the various channels on the Nebula Games Platform, they had long been waiting for Nebula Games to make a mistake.</p>
<p>In fact, he hadn't even planned to act yet—this wave of balance-related discussion had already started on its own.</p>
<p>Initially, he was eager to see how Chen Xu would handle this balance controversy.</p>
<p>The balance issue—well, it's both serious and not serious depending on how you look at it.</p>
<p>The key lies in how the game developers respond.</p>
<p>Typically, when balance problems arise, game designers publicly apologize to players and quickly adjust the Numerical Design, and the issue passes.</p>
<p>As for whether it's balanced afterward, that requires further testing over time.</p>
<p>After all, balance is something that requires constant adjustments.</p>
<p>Every adjustment inevitably makes some factions stronger and others weaker. Many game designers, even hardcore players, clearly understand this.</p>
<p>At this moment, Zhou Qi believed it was the perfect opportunity for Human Wars to catch its breath.</p>
<p>And he, along with most players and designers, assumed Chen Xu would immediately respond—by strengthening the Undead or Night Elf, or weakening the Orcs.</p>
<p>But they never expected Chen Xu to pull such a move.</p>
<p>Livestreaming Warcraft to prove its balance?</p>
<p>What kind of move is this!</p>
<p>Many players were stunned.</p>
<p>"Wait, if I'm understanding this right, Chen Xu actually wants to livestream Warcraft to prove the game's balance is fine?"</p>
<p>"No way, no way—Chen Xu can't seriously believe he's better than those pro gamers?"</p>
<p>"I think Chen Xu must be confident. As a Game Designer, he probably has a unique understanding, right?"</p>
<p>"Not necessarily. My mind thinks I'm a gaming master, but my hands disagree."</p>
<p>"The livestream hasn't even started—how can you already say Chen Xu can't do it? I think if Chen Xu said this, he must have some confidence. Remember Monster Hunter: World?"</p>
<p>"What confidence? Back then he was fighting AI. Now he's playing against real human players—professional players! Can Chen Xu really understand balance better than pro gamers?"</p>
<p>"Why can't he? Chen Xu is a Game Designer!"</p>
<p>"You're talking nonsense. He's just a game developer—what the heck does he know about Warcraft!"</p>
<p>"Logically, if Chen Xu uses all four races and loses to the pros with each one, wouldn't that prove the game is balanced?"</p>
<p>"??????? While I'm tempted to laugh at your logic, Chen Xu isn't stupid enough to do something like that, right?"</p>
<p>Online players argued endlessly.</p>
<p>They were mainly divided into three factions.</p>
<p>The Spectator Faction waited eagerly for the livestream, anticipating Chen Xu's definitive response.</p>
<p>Another group trusted Chen Xu more, believing that since he dared to say it, he wouldn't speak aimlessly. Maybe he really has some genuine skills?</p>
<p>After all, he is a Game Designer.</p>
<p>The remaining players believed Chen Xu probably just didn't want to admit the game's balance was flawed.</p>
<p>After all, this wasn't the first time—officials often stubbornly deny problems, insisting the game is fine and the players are the issue.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>At Nebula Games, during lunch break in the lounge, a group of people were chatting.</p>
<p>The topic, naturally, was the current online buzz.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of skepticism online. Brother Qin, do you think Mr. Chen is actually really good at Warcraft?" a colleague asked Qin Yi.</p>
<p>Everyone turned to look at Qin Yi.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't know for sure, but he can easily defeat the three of us," Qin Yi scratched his head and replied.</p>
<p>After all, Chen Xu hadn't played much in front of them—only during internal testing in development, when he thoroughly crushed all three of them.</p>
<p>"So, Brother Qin, how skilled are you guys?" someone asked.</p>
<p>"Just average—combined, we're around 2,000 points," Qin Yi coughed lightly.</p>
<p>2,000 points? That sounds pretty high!</p>
<p>Hearing Qin Yi's words, everyone looked surprised, completely missing the word "combined."</p>
<p>At that moment, Lin Rou chimed in: "Brother Qin said 'combined.'"</p>
<p>Combined?</p>
<p>So does that mean you're all noobs?</p>
<p>"Ahem, never mind, look at this—Mr. Chen just earned another meme!" Under the awkward stares, Qin Yi quickly changed the subject and showed them his phone.</p>
<p>On it was a newly trending search term:</p>
<p>'Chen Xu is just a game developer, what the heck does he know about Warcraft!'</p>
<p>Seeing the term, everyone burst out laughing.</p>
<p>"Haha, what's going on here? Where did this come from?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen must feel awful when he sees this."</p>
<p>"I think Mr. Chen is probably used to it by now."</p>
<p>Everyone laughed heartily at the trending search term.</p>
<p>Just then, Chen Xu walked out of his office after finalizing details with Shark TV. Seeing the group in high spirits, he asked curiously, "What's so funny?"</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue, barely holding back laughter, handed him her phone. "Mr. Chen, stay strong!"</p>
<p>"What the heck is this," Chen Xu muttered, slightly speechless—but his mindset didn't shift much.</p>
<p>After all, he was used to it. Players always misunderstood him.</p>
<p>"But Mr. Chen, can you really beat those professional players?" Yang Xin and others asked curiously.</p>
<p>In their free time, they had seen Chen Xu play Warcraft—but only against the company's AI, not real players.</p>
<p>How skilled he truly was, they weren't sure. They just knew they couldn't beat him.</p>
<p>"I can handle the average ones. Players like Guadi, though, I'd have to rely on tactics and in-the-moment improvisation," Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>He did have some confidence in this decision. If those pro players fully understood all tactics, various playstyles, and counter-strategies, he could easily be hard-countered by their operations.</p>
<p>But this was a dimension-reducing strike. And he had a special item—that was his confidence.</p>
<p>For him, it was also an opportunity. He'd considered something similar with Monster Hunter: World.</p>
<p>Letting players realize he wasn't just a Game Designer, but also a player.</p>
<p>Establishing this identity would greatly help promote future game content.</p>
<p>After all, a designer who's also a skilled player gives players a stronger sense of identification.</p>
<p>At the very least, when confused about game content, players wouldn't immediately think, "The Numerical Design or Level Design must be wrong—the designer is acting up again."</p>
