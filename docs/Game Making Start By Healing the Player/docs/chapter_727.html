<p>Chapter 726: I Need to Prove That Shadow Fiend Isn't Suitable for This Patch (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>The launch of the new patch saw <em>DOTA</em>'s concurrent online player count reach a new high.</p>
<p>The moment Zhang Yi, Song Ren, and Wang Han teamed up and clicked to matchmake, a successful match notification popped up instantly.</p>
<p>“These AIs are quite something! Like professional players even?” Entering the hero selection interface, Zhang Yi couldn't help but exclaim.</p>
<p>Opposite them appeared a team named WINGS GAMING.</p>
<p>“What's there to be afraid of? With all their flashy stuff, just watch me, Shadow Fiend Nevermore, carry you all.” Song Ren was quite confident.</p>
<p>However, before he could make his selection, he saw an ID on the opposing AI team named 【跳刀跳刀丶Blink】 instantly pre-pick his Shadow Fiend.</p>
<p>At the same time, the other four AI players immediately picked their respective heroes: Faceless Void in the core position and Silencer as support, Skywrath Mage and Axe in the offlane, a truly menacing lineup.</p>
<p>“Holy cow, this AI is cheating! They picked five heroes right away!” Seeing the hero he wanted to play taken, Song Ren was completely bewildered.</p>
<p>Regular matchmaking involves heroes being picked in turns, so why did the AI team get to snatch heroes like this in an AI match?</p>
<p>“So, Old Song, what are you playing?” Zhang Yi and Wang Han asked, having chosen their own heroes.</p>
<p>The combination of Wraith King and Ogre Magi. Initially, Wang Han wanted to play Techies.</p>
<p>However, the hero was instantly snatched by a random player. But it was clear that the opponent was also a premade team; without a word, the two immediately picked top lane, and even went for a seemingly creative combination: Pudge and Techies.</p>
<p>Although it hadn't started yet, combining it with Techies' skills, one could immediately imagine the purpose of this combo: to hook enemies onto Techies' bombs and blow them up.</p>
<p>“What's there to fear? As someone who plays Shadow Fiend every day, I've been blown up so many times that I have some experience. This hero will definitely crush!” Song Ren confidently chose a hero: Huskar.</p>
<p>“Can this hero even work? His attribute gain is so low!” Zhang Yi questioned.</p>
<p>“Don't worry, it'll definitely work. See my second and third skills? That's the core. The second skill, Burning Spear, if cast manually before it attracts creep aggro, means that only I can attack him, but he can't attack me.”</p>
<p>“And his third skill, the lower his HP, the faster his HP regeneration and attack speed. This means as long as I don't get instantly killed, I can become a perpetual motion machine. It's just a shame this skill doesn't add magic resistance, but then again, if it did, it would be too overpowered.”</p>
<p>“Anyway, just watch. Today I'm going to prove something: that Shadow Fiend isn't suitable for the current patch. My low win rate with Shadow Fiend isn't my fault; it's the hero's fault.”</p>
<p>Starting with a Bracer and a set of Tango, Song Ren's expression was very confident.</p>
<p>In the current version of Huskar, Chen Xu still followed the re-worked version from his previous life, where his first skill was Inner Fire, which reduced healing and disarmed, instead of the original Berserker's Blood. Of course, Huskar's armor and initial attack were slightly nerfed.</p>
<p>As for the third skill, Chen Xu did not adopt the version that added magic resistance when low on health, because in that version, Huskar was truly too strong. Compared to Anti-Mage, that version of Huskar was more deserving of the name. Because a Huskar with 100 HP, if he bought a Cloak, wouldn't even die from Lina's Laguna Blade or Lion's Finger of Death.</p>
<p>So now, Chen Xu still followed the later version of Huskar, removing the magic resistance reduction.</p>
<p>As for Shadow Fiend Nevermore, he adopted the version where his ultimate ability had a fear effect, and his three Shadowrazes could stack a damage-amplifying DEBUFF.</p>
<p>Upon entering the game, Song Ren didn't check the side lanes, but focused intently on creep blocking.</p>
<p>However, his basic skills were clearly a bit shaky, and he soon missed a creep. The creep wave ended up exactly on the Dire's high ground.</p>
<p>But Song Ren didn't care, because his Huskar had learned his second skill, Burning Spear.</p>
<p>Manually casting it wouldn't attract creep aggro at all.</p>
<p>Seeing the opposing Nevermore, Song Ren didn't back down one bit and immediately started to trade hits with him.</p>
<p>One flaming Burning Spear after another struck the opponent, causing a burning effect.</p>
<p>However, the opposing Nevermore wasn't flustered at all. He simply returned fire, but being near the Dire's tower and having trees nearby, Nevermore immediately ate a Tango (Item).</p>
<p>At the same time, he used the intervals between his basic attacks to distance himself from the melee creeps. Although the ranged creeps' projectiles couldn't be dodged, Nevermore's positioning allowed him to avoid several melee creep attacks.</p>
<p>Consequently, because Nevermore had attracted creep aggro, the Dire creeps were continuously attacking the Radiant creeps. When the closest creep was low on health, Nevermore's hands suddenly shot up, and a fiery red shadow bloomed at Huskar's feet.</p>
<p>Shadow Fiend's first skill, Shadowraze (mid-range).</p>
<p>“This Shadow Fiend didn't learn Necromastery, he learned Shadowraze!?” Song Ren was utterly shocked.</p>
<p>Among the general player base, most Nevermore players still primarily focused on their second skill, Necromastery, which increased attack power upon successfully last-hitting. A level one Shadowraze generally didn't feel like it dealt much damage, and it usually took two levels of Shadowraze at level three to reach the kill threshold.</p>
<p>But now, things were a little different. Huskar's Burning Spear had a characteristic: it was like damaging the enemy a thousand while hurting oneself eight hundred. Even though he was happily attacking, he was losing quite a bit of HP himself.</p>
<p>More importantly, he had originally planned to trade health, expecting that once he hit level two and learned his third skill, he would slowly recover. But now, it was different. Although Shadow Fiend's HP was still continuously dropping, he still had a little over a third of his HP left, and only 5 stacks of Burning Spear's DEBUFF, while Song Ren's HP had already entered the kill threshold.</p>
<p>As this thought just appeared, Song Ren saw the Shadow Fiend in front of him cast another close-range Shadowraze, instantly draining his HP.</p>
<p>He subconsciously moved his hero back, but regretted it the next second. He saw Shadow Fiend raise his hand again, casting a third Shadowraze.</p>
<p>A resounding “FIRST BLOOD” echoed across the entire map.</p>
<p>Pudge: ???</p>
<p>Techies: ???</p>
<p>“Old Song?” Zhang Yi and Wang Han glanced at Song Ren's screen beside them.</p>
<p>“I was careless. I didn't expect this AI to use such a trick, learning Shadowraze. But don't worry, I'm not the kind of player who crumbles completely.” Song Ren took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“Old Song, be careful. This AI is really strong.” Zhang Yi kindly reminded him.</p>
<p>In the bottom lane, he and Wang Han's Ogre Magi weren't having an easy time, because he felt this AI was like a last-hitting robot.</p>
<p>In two waves of creeps, he only managed to last-hit three, two of which were thanks to Wraith King's third skill's built-in CD critical strike. The remaining creeps were denied by the opponent three times, completely crippling his experience gain.</p>
<p>“No problem, relax.” Teleporting to the mid-lane tower, and clearing the remaining creeps under the tower, Song Ren reached level two.</p>
<p>But by this time, the opposing Shadow Fiend had already reached level three. Although he had only put one point into Necromastery, compared to Song Ren's Huskar, this Shadow Fiend's attack damage was also a few points higher, not to mention the opponent being an AI that was practically a last-hitting machine.</p>
<p>Song Ren only managed to last-hit two low-health creeps. Furthermore, this AI Shadow Fiend would even use its Shadowraze to kill creeps and harass him, putting him under immense pressure.</p>
<p>However, he still held a glimmer of hope, because Burning Spear dealt continuous damage and was stackable.</p>
<p>If... if he could trade lives with the opponent, even though he would definitely die first and wouldn't get the solo kill experience, his economy could still recover some.</p>
<p>Huddling under the tower, soaking up denied experience, Song Ren felt suppressed, but still sensed a chance to turn the tide.</p>
<p>As King Goujian of Yue endured hardship and bided his time in ancient times, couldn't his Huskar also play defensively today?</p>
<p>Accompanied by a burst of light around him, Song Ren reached level five. Without any hesitation, he maxed out his Burning Spear, combining it with his two-level passive. A full-health Song Ren immediately started attacking Shadow Fiend.</p>
<p>The opposing Shadow Fiend didn't back down either, only retreating two steps to cast a max-range Shadowraze, then another mid-range Shadowraze, bringing Song Ren's HP down to half.</p>
<p>But at this moment, Song Ren wasn't scared at all. The less HP he had, the stronger he became!</p>
<p>He wasn't aiming for a flawless solo kill, only a one-for-one trade. He had to be careful not to get hit by the AI's close-range Shadowraze; as long as he didn't get hit by the third one, there was hope. Retreat when the enemy retreats, advance when the enemy advances, don't get greedy for damage. Watching one Burning Spear after another embed themselves in Shadow Fiend, Song Ren felt his mechanics were at their peak.</p>
<p>At this moment, he felt that if he were playing ranked, he would be Immortal-tier.</p>
<p>However, he overlooked a crucial point: although he had bought Boots of Speed just like Shadow Fiend, Shadow Fiend's base movement speed was 305, while his Huskar's was only 300. Moreover, in DOTA, there was also a mechanic called 'turn rate', and the next moment, he broke down.</p>
<p>He saw the opposing Shadow Fiend take a small step forward, ready to advance, while he was dragging Huskar, preparing to retreat. But Shadow Fiend's hands had already risen, triggering a Shadowraze.</p>
<p>His HP was instantly depleted.</p>
<p>“How did that Shadowraze hit me?!”</p>
<p>His eyes wide, Song Ren's hope turned into despair.</p>
