                <p>Chapter 409: Why is it a promotional video! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>After the entire game's physics engine framework was completed, Chen Xu and his team worked intensively on the development of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</p>
<p>All kinds of shrines, as well as the monsters and actions in the game.</p>
<p>To be honest, the previous life's The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild actually had quite a few bugs.</p>
<p>For example, the so-called 'wind bomb' technique, which itself was a bug in the game's mechanics.</p>
<p>It allowed players to use remote bombs and Link time to propel themselves high and far.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu didn't intend to fix these issues, planning instead to treat them as advanced techniques within the game.</p>
<p>After all, while it was a bug, for most players, it was the kind of thing their mind understood, but their hands couldn't execute.</p>
<p>Of course, there were also some relatively simple, benign bugs that anyone could use, such as the clever application of elemental weapons and Chuchu Jelly.</p>
<p>Facing the Ultimate Test and Advanced Test shrines, some clumsy players simply couldn't get through them. So, Hyrule's Old Rogue invented a miraculous method.</p>
<p>Using an electric elemental weapon, at the moment of swinging, switch to the menu, then drop it. This would cause the weapon to retain its electric attribute. Then, throw conductive Chuchu Jelly onto it to create electric Chuchu Jelly.</p>
<p>Finally, lure the monsters from the Ultimate Test onto the electric Chuchu Jelly, which would put them into an infinite paralysis state. At this point, players, as Hyrule bullies, could pull out kindling and flint from their pockets and put on a good barbecue show.</p>
<p>In their leisure time, they could even take photos with the Sheikah Slate.</p>
<p>Chen Xu had no intention of removing these interesting settings.</p>
<p>After all, if players couldn't defeat Lynels or Hinoxes, why shouldn't they be allowed to cheese these iron lumps and enjoy themselves a bit?</p>
<p>As the team produced more material for the game day by day, time quickly approached the end of September, with the seven-day National Day holiday just around the corner.</p>
<p>During this period, various developers' games had already begun pre-launch promotions, all hoping to achieve a strong start.</p>
<p>Apart from the two VR blockbusters from TengHua and NetDragon, scheduled to launch at the end of October and early November respectively, the most anticipated title was undoubtedly Nebula Games' The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</p>
<p>Innumerable Switch players were already getting impatient.</p>
<p>Even before this, many players had been making all sorts of guesses and predictions online.</p>
<p>They analyzed and delved into Nebula Games' actions, combining them with Chen Xu's previous statement about the game's pleasing development progress.</p>
<p>They boldly predicted that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild would arrive during the National Day holiday.</p>
<p>They spoke so convincingly that Chen Xu himself almost believed them.</p>
<p>However, while the idea was good, reality was harsh.</p>
<p>Although the development of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was progressing rapidly, it was still some time away from launch.</p>
<p>Of course, Chen Xu wasn't entirely unprepared for the National Day holiday. How about a promotional video?</p>
<p>Limited edition Switch Zelda consoles were also in production.</p>
<p>Facing the eager players, on the day before the National Day holiday, Chen Xu's official Weibo account and Nebula Games' official Weibo account silently sent out a message.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Chen Xu's official Weibo account, many players who had convinced themselves of an October release were momentarily stunned.</p>
<p>They said the game would be released in October, so why was it a promotional video? After a brief moment of confusion, many players came to their senses.</p>
<p>Oh, the October release was just something they had imagined! In that case, no problem.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, for many players eagerly anticipating this game, even a promotional video was enough to excite them.</p>
<p>And it wasn't just players; many industry designers and media outlets were also following the latest news about this game.</p>
<p>Everyone wanted to see how Chen Xu would create an open-world game on the Switch.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Innumerable players clicked on the video with excited hearts.</p>
<p>First, a stretch of melodious music.</p>
<p>A cyan-blue water surface appeared on the screen; a gentle breeze swept across the calm water, stirring a ripple. Accompanied by the soothing BGM melody, a bell chimed, and the camera slowly rose towards the sky.</p>
<p>White clouds dotted the sky, golden sands lay before the cyan-blue sea, with a few scattered coconut trees.</p>
<p>Over the cyan-blue sea, a flock of seagulls circled in the air, while distant cliffs merged with the white clouds.</p>
<p>The camera then slowly zoomed towards the cliffs, revealing a glimpse of Hyrule on the screen.</p>
<p>The warm sunlight, under the bright interplay of light and shadow, appeared dreamlike and ethereal.</p>
<p>The distant sea shimmered with the sunlight, making the scenery even more breathtaking.</p>
<p>Misty valleys, a cascading waterfall rushing down in the sunset.</p>
<p>Under the scorching sun, in the dazzling desert, several peculiar animals ran across the sandy terrain.</p>
<p>On a snow-covered mountain, snow foxes inhabiting the area traversed the vast white expanse, letting out crisp calls.</p>
<p>In a verdant forest, sunlight pierced through towering trees, illuminating a seemingly unremarkable longsword. The longsword was embedded in a stone pedestal, just like the legendary Sword in the Stone. The surrounding vegetation swayed gently in the breeze, and strange small creatures flying in the air made 'yahaha' sounds, constantly lingering around as if guarding it.</p>
<p>In the next moment, the camera shifted. On a cliff peak, a young man with golden hair, a blue tunic, and a sword, shield, and bow strapped to his back gazed into the distance.</p>
<p>There, shrouded in shadows and dark aura, lay the Royal Capital.</p>
<p>The instant his gaze met the Royal Capital, the background music suddenly changed, transforming from soothing to fervent.</p>
<p>Running across endless green grasslands.</p>
<p>Sweating as he climbed towering peaks.</p>
<p>Crossing a log bridge between mountains.</p>
<p>Rowing across a vast sea.</p>
<p>Trekking through the desert, advancing through snow-capped mountains, riding a horse to what looked like ancient ruins.</p>
<p>At the same time, an aged voice resounded:</p>
<p>'It all began in the distant past. A calamity known as Ganon descended upon the world multiple times.'</p>
<p>'These disasters also marked the history of the Hyrule Kingdom.'</p>
<p>Following the narration, the video's camera quickly cut through scenes.</p>
<p>The once-grand cities of the kingdom now reduced to ruins, dilapidated temples.</p>
<p>The camera slowly pulled back, revealing the landscape of the Hyrule continent on the screen.</p>
<p>In the forest, as the trees trembled, countless flocks of birds scattered.</p>
<p>A resting squirrel, feeling the tremor of the earth, looked curiously and anxiously towards the source of the vibration.</p>
<p>A mountain suddenly erupted, and a tall tower shot towards the sky, while simultaneously, the distant kingdom, shrouded in darkness, began to shake.</p>
<p>Black and blood-red anomalous substances formed, encircling the Royal Capital like a demonic dragon.</p>
<p>After this black and red power appeared, countless monsters, such as Goblins and Goblin Giants, became agitated, infected by the mysterious force.</p>
<p>Inside a cave, peculiar fortress-like robots shot out lasers; on the mountains, giant rock monsters; in the desert, colossal creatures lurked beneath the sand; towering Hinoxes; and unknown monsters that could spew flames.</p>
<p>The golden-haired youth from before engaged in fierce combat with them using his sword and shield.</p>
<p>Various strange abilities dazzled the eyes.</p>
<p>Innumerable terrifying monsters, the burning Royal Capital, surviving people, and everything on Hyrule flashed rapidly in the video.</p>
<p>'It seems you've completely forgotten…'</p>
<p>'Now the time has come. Let me tell you what happened 100 years ago.'</p>
<p>Guardians of the Royal Capital, once protectors, had become machines of destruction under the invasion of dark power.</p>
<p>The burning Hyrule Kingdom, the demonized monsters.</p>
<p>Zelda, Mipha, Revali, Urbosa, Daruk – the Champions and the Princesses of old continuously flashed through the video.</p>
<p>Finally, the scene settled in a dark cave.</p>
<p>'Wake up…'</p>
<p>'Link!'</p>
<p>Princess Zelda's voice echoed in his ears.</p>
<p>After a hundred years, the sleeping Link opened his eyes once more.</p>
<p>Then the video ended, and the game's LOGO appeared on the big screen, along with the release date.</p>
<p>[Switch exclusive, globally launching November 25th, please stay tuned]</p>
