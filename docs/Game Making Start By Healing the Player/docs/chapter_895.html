                <h2>Chapter 894: Vice City</h2>
<p>As early as the Huanyu New Generation VR press conference, the official announcement included the launch titles that would accompany the initial release of games.</p>
<p>Nebula Games, of course, also announced three games of different genres that would be launched under its banner.</p>
<p>Currently, both <em>Persona</em> and <em>Fate Seeker</em>, two games with RPG attributes, have already been released.</p>
<p>Their excellent quality left countless players exclaiming that Nebula Games was indeed still the Nebula Games they knew.</p>
<p>However, due to their themes and elements, these two games, when compared to fantasy and alternate reality titles like <em>Elden Ring</em>, <em>Final Fantasy</em>, and <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, still had a considerable gap in terms of audience reach.</p>
<p>And as the lineup of next-gen VR games grew stronger, many players couldn't help but look forward to the third project that Nebula Games had teased at the previous New Generation VR press conference.</p>
<p>To this day, apart from the codename 'Vice City', Nebula Games had not revealed a single shred of information to the public.</p>
<p>But while Nebula Games remained tight-lipped, various speculations about the new game were rampant online.</p>
<p>"I wonder what type and style this 'Vice City' project will be. I hope it's not another RPG. While <em>Persona</em> and <em>Fate Seeker</em> are good, I'd really like something fresh."</p>
<p>"Who knows? But I feel like it might be a modern-themed game."</p>
<p>"Hmm, that's certainly possible. But I think Nebula Games might be holding back another big move. From the information currently revealed, the next-gen versions of <em>Resident Evil</em> and <em>Bloodborne</em> weren't actually made by Nebula Games' headquarters, and <em>Fate Seeker</em> and <em>Persona</em> aren't that massive in scale. Compared to previous games released by Nebula Games, it feels like they haven't put all their resources into these two games for such a long time."</p>
<p>"That sounds very reasonable, but we still don't know the specifics. With so many 'master artists' leaking info online, it feels like everyone's saying something."</p>
<p>"Just take those 'master artists' with a grain of salt. They're all just guessing. If they guess right, they brag; if they don't, they just chuckle."</p>
<p>"Think about it, if it really is a modern setting, what kind of genre would it be? RPG? Action-adventure? Or open-world?"</p>
<p>"If it's an open-world next-gen VR game, just imagining the effect is exciting!"</p>
<p>Many players online were discussing related topics, with all sorts of guesses.</p>
<p>But the specific genre, theme, and launch date remained a mystery for now, as Nebula Games' plans were unknown to anyone outside the company.</p>
<p>However, with the release of a promotional trailer, players finally got a clear idea of the game's genre and style.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>In a coffee shop on a coastal street, a middle-aged man in a sky-blue shirt pushed open the door and walked in.</p>
<p>"Alberto, a cup of coffee..."</p>
<p>But before he could finish his sentence, a scruffy-looking胖子 rushed from the counter towards him, pushing the middle-aged man against the doorframe.</p>
<p>"Dad, don't give that traitor any coffee! You're a backstabbing coward, Tommy! Not only are you a traitor, but you're also a scared dog, a damn punk! Those bastards... they made fun of me! They did whatever they wanted!"</p>
<p>"No one dares to do whatever they want. They only do what you allow. Do you want someone to fix it for you? I can fix it for you, but it'll cost you. I know we're good brothers, but this is business."</p>
<p>On a moonlit beach, Tommy, aboard a speedboat, eyed a luxurious cruise ship where a party was underway. Without a moment's hesitation, he grabbed an automatic rifle from beside him and unleashed a furious spray of bullets, which clanged against the ship's hull.</p>
<p>A moment later, sirens blared as countless armed police officers, responding to the alarm, converged on the scene. After eliminating everyone on the cruise ship, Tommy immediately headed ashore. He carjacked a luxury sports car and sped through the city's streets and alleys, expertly evading the pursuing police cars.</p>
<p>With Tommy's impressive drift around a corner, the video filled with the screeching sound of tires on asphalt. As the sports car vanished into the alley, the screen flickered to black and then lit up again, showcasing an entirely different scene.</p>
<p>It was still a cinematic perspective, but the protagonist was now a Black man.</p>
<p>At the airport security checkpoint, the young Black man handed his carry-on luggage to the staff for scanning.</p>
<p>"After five years on the East Coast, it's time to come home. It's Mom... she passed away, bro."</p>
<p>Watching his luggage being cleared, the young Black man slowly walked out with his bags and got into a taxi.</p>
<p>As the taxi entered a slum, sirens suddenly wailed.</p>
<p>Several police cars followed close behind, forcing the taxi to a stop. Armed officers stepped out, guns drawn.</p>
<p>They pulled the young Black man, Carl, into a police car.</p>
<p>Looking at Carl, who was subdued beside him, the officer laughed heartily: "Welcome back home to Lost City, Carl. You must be happy to be back, right?"</p>
<p>"No, I live in Liberty City now. I've washed my hands of it; I'm a law-abiding citizen."</p>
<p>"No, you've never been clean. Well then, see you around, Carl..."</p>
<p>When the vehicle reached a deserted alley, the officer sitting next to Carl burst out laughing, opened the car door, and kicked Carl out of the car.</p>
<p>Carl tumbled two or three times on the ground, dusty and with his pants torn, revealing several scrapes on his exposed arms.</p>
<p>"Shit, I'm back here again." Carl stood up, wincing, and walked towards the alley entrance.</p>
<p>"The worst place in the world..."</p>
<p>As Carl disappeared into the alley, the scene abruptly shifted. The city, which had appeared to be from the 1990s, suddenly transformed into the 21st century, with towering skyscrapers rising everywhere, signifying immense prosperity.</p>
<p>In front of the United Savings First Bank, three masked robbers were carrying out an earth-shattering heist.</p>
<p>Flying planes, yachts, armored vehicles, intense gunfights...</p>
<p>The video showcased thrilling and diverse gameplay content.</p>
<p>Finally, the screen went black, and the game's codename, <em>Vice City (Game)</em>, appeared in the center of the screen.</p>
<p>(End of Chapter)
