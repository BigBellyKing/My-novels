                <p>Chapter 85: Is This the Peach Garden?</p>
<p>After finishing the new player tutorial, Zhang Yi and his friends officially entered the game.</p>
<p>They could see that there were already quite a few players chatting in the lobby on the main interface.</p>
<p>Evidently, these were players from the exhibition.</p>
<p>The five computers for the experience were set to private room matches by default, and the computers were not arranged side-by-side, so it was impossible to peek at other people's screens and know their identities.</p>
<p>Except for the Lord's identity, which was open, all others were hidden.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi's assigned identity was Lord, and he chose Liu Bei as his general.</p>
<p>On one hand, it provided a sense of immersion, as Liu Bei was naturally the ruler of Shu Han.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he was quite familiar with this general, having used him in the new player tutorial.</p>
<p>The ability was simply to give other players cards and also recover health.</p>
<p>As for the others, Wang Han's identity was Rebel, and she chose Zhao Yun as her general.</p>
<p>Song Ren was a Loyalist, choosing Zhuge Liang.</p>
<p>Wang Yifan, who remained, was from the Spy faction, choosing Sun Shangxiang.</p>
<p>Another girl, Joey, chose Zhen Ji.</p>
<p>Everyone was carefully reading the skill descriptions of their generals.</p>
<p>After all, they had just completed the new player tutorial and only had a rough idea of the game, not yet fully understanding their general's skills.</p>
<p>After everyone made their selections, the game officially began.</p>
<p>Upon starting, Zhang Yi, as the Lord, checked his hand cards. He equipped himself with a Zhangba Snake Spear and a Defensive Horse, then threw out a Southern Barbarian Invasion, directly deducting one health point from Sun Shangxiang.</p>
<p>As for the others, they all had an Attack card in hand, so they didn't lose health.</p>
<p>Since it was the beginning of the game and it was hard to confirm who was a Rebel, Loyalist, or Spy, Zhang Yi opted for a cautious approach—standing still.</p>
<p>After his turn, it was Wang Han's turn. Without a word, she immediately equipped herself with a Guan Stone Axe.</p>
<p>Although she didn't draw an Attack card, she had three Dodge cards.</p>
<p>She directly used Zhao Yun's skill, treating a Dodge card as an Attack card and playing it against Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>'To advance and retreat is the true magic weapon!'</p>
<p>Along with Zhao Yun's dialogue, an attack effect appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>'Dodge!' Zhang Yi calmly threw a Dodge card.</p>
<p>Then Wang Han immediately discarded two Dodge cards, activating the Guan Stone Axe's skill to forcibly deduct one health point from Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>"Zilong, ah Zilong! I didn't expect you to be the Rebel!" Zhang Yi exclaimed, watching Wang Han immediately reveal her Rebel identity, getting into character.</p>
<p>Although he lost one health point, he wasn't flustered at all.</p>
<p>After all, his Liu Bei could restore health.</p>
<p>Once he knew who the Loyalist was, he would immediately give out two cards.</p>
<p>That's generosity!</p>
<p>"Hmph! Just you wait and see how I eliminate you, incompetent ruler!" Wang Han pouted, then chose to end her turn.</p>
<p>After Wang Han's turn ended, it proceeded clockwise to Joey's turn.</p>
<p>As a Rebel, she first activated her Luo Shen skill.</p>
<p>'Like a wisp of cloud veiling the moon, fluttering like a gentle breeze amidst swirling snow.'</p>
<p>She successfully judged three times in a row, incredibly lucky to draw a Club Ace Zhuge Repeating Crossbow and a Spade 6 Contentment for Forgetfulness.</p>
<p>The third card was a Diamond Dodge, which failed the judgment.</p>
<p>After briefly examining the effects of the cards in her hand, Joey immediately declared herself a Rebel against Zhang Yi without a second thought.</p>
<p>A Contentment for Forgetfulness was played directly.</p>
<p>Then Joey was embarrassed.</p>
<p>"Why can't I attack Old Zhang?!" Joey held an Attack card but found she could only attack Zhao Yun and Sun Shangxiang next to her.</p>
<p>Hearing Joey's words, Wang Yifan complained, "Didn't the new player tutorial explain the game rules? You need an offensive horse or a weapon with an attack range greater than one to attack across positions. Your Zhuge Repeating Crossbow doesn't have enough range!"</p>
<p>"Study the new player tutorial properly; see how you're stuck now? Your identity is exposed, but you can do nothing."</p>
<p>However, as soon as he finished speaking, Zhen Ji in the game drew her blade, hitting his Sun Shangxiang with an Attack.</p>
<p>"That's what you get for talking so much!"</p>
<p>Unable to attack the Lord, and with her Rebel identity directly exposed.</p>
<p>From a public perspective, this Sun Shangxiang, whether Loyalist or Spy, was definitely not her ally, so eliminating her was the right move. Anyway, she could only attack this Sun Shangxiang.</p>
<p>From a private perspective, who told you to talk so much!</p>
<p>"No, you're just taking personal revenge!" Wang Yifan's eyes widened.</p>
<p>Who did he provoke?</p>
<p>More importantly, he didn't have a Dodge card in his hand.</p>
<p>He had a Create Something from Nothing, a Take a Goat in Passing, and two offensive horses.</p>
<p>In some ways, he had a perfect starting hand.</p>
<p>But from another perspective, this was a hellish start.</p>
<p>In his desperate gaze, a second Attack landed on him.</p>
<p>Coupled with the one health point lost to Southern Barbarian Invasion in the first round, he became the first person to be eliminated.</p>
<p>"My goodness, this general is too fierce! Wouldn't continuously judging black cards make her invincible?" Zhang Yi's eyes were wide open.</p>
<p>Fortunately, someone blocked the attack for him; he only had one Dodge card left.</p>
<p>In comparison, he felt his Liu Bei was simply garbage!</p>
<p>What was the point of giving cards to others!?</p>
<p>Wasn't that just for others' enjoyment?</p>
<p>It was like going to a foot bath city for a full service, and Liu Bei's role was: Brothers, have a good time, tonight's on me!</p>
<p>But don't just treat others, enjoy it yourself!</p>
<p>"Why are you all targeting me!"</p>
<p>Wang Yifan listened to the Bow-waisted Princess in the game, her forlorn cry of 'No... I cannot die yet...', and was utterly speechless.</p>
<p>His first journey in "Sanguosha" had ended so prematurely?</p>
<p>The key was that he hadn't even played a single card!</p>
<p>"Friendly reminder, it's not 'us' targeting you, it's only Yiyi targeting you!" Wang Han chuckled.</p>
<p>"Tsk tsk, tough luck! Good thing I'm your next player," Song Ren also said, relieved.</p>
<p>The five people on the field... no, it should be said the four people, were playing with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>And through the big screen, some players who didn't experience it themselves but only watched were also amused by this scene.</p>
<p>This was simply too unlucky.</p>
<p>But at the same time, many players also gained a general understanding of the game.</p>
<p>That is, in this game, in addition to strategy, luck also plays a significant role.</p>
<p>It could even lead to a legendary god-tier hand.</p>
<p>For example, if Zhen Ji had a Zhuge Repeating Crossbow in hand and could attack the Lord, and happened to judge a bunch of black Attack cards, wouldn't she take out the Lord in one round?</p>
<p>It required brains, but also luck.</p>
<p>Many experienced players immediately analyzed the characteristics of "Sanguosha."</p>
<p>As for ordinary players, they didn't think so much.</p>
<p>They mostly felt that the game was quite engaging and didn't seem very complicated.</p>
<p>The game continued, but the situation on the field entered a stalemate. Zhang Yi and Song Ren, one Zhuge Liang and one Liu Bei.</p>
<p>It perfectly matched their roles as monarch and minister, one Lord and one Prime Minister.</p>
<p>But it must be said that the skills of these two genuinely didn't synergize well.</p>
<p>And their positions were also quite awkward.</p>
<p>"Old Zhang! I don't know how Zhuge Liang died in history, but one thing is clear to me: my Zhuge Liang is definitely being screwed over by you!"</p>
<p>Looking at the Borrowed Knife to Kill and an Attack card in his hand, he felt like cursing.</p>
<p>Last round, he emptied his hand, and next round, he got two more cards.</p>
<p>And if you're going to give cards, at least give a Dodge!</p>
<p>His Empty Fort skill hadn't triggered once!</p>
<p>Fortunately, he had used his Observe Stars skill earlier to get a Cross the River and Demolish the Bridge to remove Zhen Ji's Zhuge Repeating Crossbow; otherwise, he would have died ten thousand times over.</p>
<p>"I can't help it, my health is a bit dangerous, just bear with it," Zhang Yi coughed lightly, looking at his recently restored three health points.</p>
<p>What could he do? He was also desperate.</p>
<p>Compared to Zhao Yun and Zhen Ji, these two Rebel generals' skills, when viewed individually, were actually pretty good.</p>
<p>But when combined, and with their turn order, it was simply idiotic!</p>
<p>"Don't struggle in vain anymore!"</p>
<p>"Exactly, just surrender."</p>
<p>Wang Han and Joey were armed to the teeth, with weapons, armor, offensive and Defensive Horses, everything. Only their health wasn't great, both at two health points.</p>
<p>"Hmph hmph, surrender? Surrendering is impossible! It's time for a comeback!" Song Ren's eyes lit up, delighted by the cards he drew.</p>
<p>"My Lord, do not panic, I, Liang, have a plan!" Song Ren dramatically shouted, fully in character.</p>
<p>Then Zhuge Liang in the game recited his dialogue.</p>
<p>'Lightning!'</p>
<p>A flash of electricity crossed the screen, and then a lightning icon appeared above Zhuge Liang's head.</p>
<p>"Excellent plan! Prime Minister, this plan is indeed brilliant! Combined with your Observe Stars, the Rebels will have nowhere to escape!"</p>
<p>Seeing the lightning icon above Song Ren's head, Zhang Yi immediately understood.</p>
<p>Although it was their first game, after the initial unfamiliarity, everyone had pretty much figured out the game rules.</p>
<p>They were invincible!</p>
<p>"Ah! No Cross the River and Demolish the Bridge or Take a Goat in Passing!"</p>
<p>"Me neither!"</p>
<p>When it was Wang Han and Joey's turn, neither of them had a Cross the River and Demolish the Bridge or Take a Goat in Passing.</p>
<p>At the same time, they tried to forcefully eliminate Zhuge Liang, but he still had a Peach, bringing him back to life.</p>
<p>"It's okay, Yiyi, we still have hope. As long as we're lucky and it doesn't strike us, we can eliminate him directly on our turn," Wang Han said.</p>
<p>"Hmph hmph, don't you dare dream. It's time for a comeback! My Great Han Prime Minister is mighty..." Zhang Yi said, gloating.</p>
<p>But before he could finish, he heard Zhuge Liang in the game recite a line of dialogue.</p>
<p>'Create Something from Nothing!'</p>
<p>??????</p>
<p>"No, Old Song, what are you doing?" Zhang Yi's eyes widened.</p>
<p>Song Ren, who had just used it and reacted, was also a bit embarrassed.</p>
<p>At first, he did remember to use Observe Stars to adjust the Lightning card.</p>
<p>But here came the crucial part.</p>
<p>He actually saw a Create Something from Nothing mixed among the four cards, so he moved it to the second position.</p>
<p>When he got the Create Something from Nothing, he subconsciously couldn't resist.</p>
<p>Drawing two cards, what a temptation that was!</p>
<p>Anyone would find it hard to resist!</p>
<p>Moreover, he saw that the fourth card, which would be the next judgment card, was actually a Bagua Array.</p>
<p>Exclusive!</p>
<p>"It's fine, it shouldn't be a big problem. Emperor Liu Bei is a fortunate man and will naturally..." But he stopped mid-sentence.</p>
<p>Because a judgment card appeared in the center of the game.</p>
<p>A Spade 7 Attack.</p>
<p>And the Lightning judgment was Spade 2 to Spade 9, so the Lightning judgment took effect.</p>
<p>Instantly, a dark cloud gathered above Liu Bei's head in the game, then thunder rumbled, and a lightning bolt struck Liu Bei directly.</p>
<p>'Is this, perhaps, the Peach Garden...'</p>
<p>Listening to Liu Bei's last words in the game, Zhang Yi remained expressionless, while Wang Yifan, who had been eliminated early, was stifling a laugh.</p>
<p>Song Ren looked bewildered.</p>
<p>Wang Han and Joey high-fived in celebration.</p>
<p>"Prime Minister, explain yourself." Zhang Yi glared at Song Ren.</p>
<p>"Ahem, how about we try "Fall Guys"! Chen Xu really wasn't lying this time, this game is really fun!"</p>
<p>Facing an extremely awkward situation, Song Ren, noticing the commotion around "Fall Guys," immediately changed the subject.</p>
<p>(Daily request for recommendation tickets and monthly passes~ It should not be short now! Hmph hmph—)</p>
