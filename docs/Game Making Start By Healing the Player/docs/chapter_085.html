                <p>Chapter 85: Could This Be the Peach Garden?</p>
<p>After finishing the new player tutorial, Zhang Yi and the others officially entered the game.</p>
<p>On the main interface, numerous players could already be seen chatting in the lobby.</p>
<p>Clearly, these were the exhibition attendees.</p>
<p>The five computers provided for the experience were set up in a private match by default. Since the computers weren't arranged side by side, there was no way to glance sideways and peek at someone else's screen to figure out their identity.</p>
<p>Only the Lord's identity was revealed; all others remained hidden.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi happened to draw the Lord role and chose Liu Bei as his general.</p>
<p>On one hand, this gave him a strong sense of immersion—after all, Liu Bei was historically the ruler of Shu Han.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he was simply more familiar with this general, having already used him during the tutorial.</p>
<p>The gameplay was straightforward: distribute cards to others and perform healing.</p>
<p>As for the others, Wang Han was a Rebel who chose Zhao Yun as her general.</p>
<p>Song Ren was the Loyalist, picking Zhuge Liang.</p>
<p>The remaining player, Wang Yifan, belonged to the Spy faction and selected Sun Shangxiang.</p>
<p>The other girl, Joey, chose Zhen Ji.</p>
<p>All of them were carefully reading through their general's skill descriptions.</p>
<p>Having just completed the tutorial, they only had a vague understanding of the game and were still unsure about their own abilities.</p>
<p>After finalizing their selections, the game officially began.</p>
<p>As Lord, Zhang Yi first examined his hand cards, equipping himself with a Zhangba Snake Spear and a Defensive Horse. He then played Southern Barbarian Invasion, immediately dealing one point of damage to Sun Shangxiang.</p>
<p>The others, however, each had a "Sha" (Attack) card and thus avoided taking damage.</p>
<p>Since it was still early in the game and unclear who the Rebels, Loyalists, or Spy were, Zhang Yi chose a safe, conservative playstyle—holding back.</p>
<p>Next was Wang Han, seated to his left. Without hesitation, she equipped herself with a Guan Stone Axe.</p>
<p>Though she hadn't drawn a "Sha," she held three "Shan" (Dodge) cards.</p>
<p>Activating Zhao Yun's skill, she used a "Shan" as a "Sha" and attacked Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>"To advance and retreat is truly a divine weapon!"</p>
<p>Accompanied by Zhao Yun's iconic line, a striking attack animation flashed across the screen.</p>
<p>"Shan!" Zhang Yi calmly discarded a "Shan."</p>
<p>Wang Han then discarded two more "Shan" cards, triggering the Guan Stone Axe's ability and forcibly dealing one damage point to Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>"Zilong, Zilong! I never expected the Rebel to be you!" Zhang Yi exclaimed dramatically, instantly jumping into character upon Wang Han's betrayal, overcome by theatrical flair.</p>
<p>Though he lost one health point, he remained calm.</p>
<p>After all, his Liu Bei could heal.</p>
<p>Once he identified the Loyalist, he'd immediately send them two cards.</p>
<p>That was true generosity!</p>
<p>"Hmph! Just wait till I take down your incompetent Lord!" Wang Han sneered before ending her turn.</p>
<p>After Wang Han's turn ended, play proceeded clockwise to Joey.</p>
<p>As a Rebel, she immediately activated Zhen Ji's Luo Shen skill.</p>
<p>"Graceful as light clouds veiling the moon, drifting like snow swirling in the wind."</p>
<p>She successfully passed the judgment three times in a row—an incredibly lucky draw—obtaining a Spade A Zhuge Repeating Crossbow and a Spade 6 card, "Indulge in Pleasure and Forget Home."</p>
<p>The third draw, a Block "Shan," failed the judgment.</p>
<p>After quickly reviewing her hand, Joey immediately turned against Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>She played "Indulge in Pleasure and Forget Home" directly.</p>
<p>Then Joey froze in embarrassment.</p>
<p>"Why can't I attack Old Zhang!?" Holding a "Sha" in her hand, she realized she could only target Zhao Yun and Sun Shangxiang, the players adjacent to her.</p>
<p>Hearing Joey's outburst, Wang Yifan grumbled, "Didn't the tutorial clearly explain the rules? You need an Offensive Horse or a weapon with an attack range greater than one to attack non-adjacent players. Your Zhuge Repeating Crossbow doesn't have enough range!"</p>
<p>"Go back and study the tutorial properly. Now you're exposed and completely helpless."</p>
<p>But even as the words left his mouth, the in-game Zhen Ji struck, playing a "Sha" directly at his Sun Shangxiang.</p>
<p>"For talking too much!"</p>
<p>Unable to attack the Lord and with her Rebel identity now exposed, Sun Shangxiang—whether Loyalist or Spy—was clearly not on her side.</p>
<p>From a strategic standpoint, eliminating her was the right move, especially since she could only legally target Sun Shangxiang.</p>
<p>On a personal level—because you just had to talk!</p>
<p>"Wait, this is just using public power for personal revenge!" Wang Yifan's eyes widened.</p>
<p>What had he done to deserve this?</p>
<p>Even worse, he had no "Shan" in hand.</p>
<p>His cards were one "Create Something from Nothing," one "Take a Goat in Passing," and two Offensive Horses.</p>
<p>From one perspective, this was a dream start—"Heaven's Blessing."</p>
<p>From another, it was a nightmare.</p>
<p>Under the weight of despair, the second "Sha" struck.</p>
<p>Combined with the damage he'd taken earlier from Southern Barbarian Invasion, he became the first player eliminated.</p>
<p>"Good grief, this general is too fierce! If you keep drawing black cards with Luo Shen, aren't you basically Invincible?" Zhang Yi's eyes widened in shock.</p>
<p>Thankfully, someone had taken the hit for him—after all, he only had one "Shan" left in hand.</p>
<p>Comparing himself, he felt his Liu Bei was utterly useless!</p>
<p>What good was giving cards to others!?</p>
<p>Wasn't this just letting everyone else have fun?</p>
<p>It was like going to a foot massage parlor for a deluxe service—Liu Bei's role was essentially: "Guys, enjoy yourselves! I'm treating tonight!"</p>
<p>But don't just pay for others—join in the fun yourself!</p>
<p>"Why is everyone ganging up on me!?"</p>
<p>Wang Yifan listened helplessly to the in-game Bow-waisted Princess's mournful cry: "No... I can't die yet..." He was utterly speechless.</p>
<p>His very first round of Sanguosha had ended in such a sudden defeat?</p>
<p>The worst part—he hadn't even played a single card!</p>
<p>"Friendly reminder—it's not that we're ganging up on you. Only Joey targeted you!" Wang Han chuckled.</p>
<p>"Tsk tsk, tragic. Lucky I'm sitting after you," Song Ren added, visibly relieved.</p>
<p>Of the five players... well, actually, four were now deeply engaged in the game.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, spectators watching via the large screen—those who hadn't played but only observed—were equally amused by the scene.</p>
<p>This was just unbelievably unlucky.</p>
<p>At the same time, many players gained a clearer understanding of the game.</p>
<p>They realized that aside from strategy, luck played a massive role in Sanguosha.</p>
<p>In fact, legendary "Heaven's Blessing" hands could occur.</p>
<p>For instance, if Zhen Ji drew the Zhuge Repeating Crossbow, could attack the Lord, and continuously judged black "Sha" cards, couldn't she eliminate the Lord in a single turn?</p>
<p>Skill mattered, but so did luck.</p>
<p>Experienced gamers quickly analyzed and identified the core characteristics of Sanguosha.</p>
<p>Ordinary players, however, didn't think that deeply.</p>
<p>To them, the game simply seemed exciting and surprisingly easy to grasp.</p>
<p>The game continued, but the battlefield entered a stalemate. Zhang Yi and Song Ren, playing Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang respectively, perfectly mirrored their historical ruler-minister relationship—one the Lord, the other the Chancellor.</p>
<p>But it had to be said—these two skills didn't synergize well at all.</p>
<p>And their seating positions were particularly awkward.</p>
<p>"Old Zhang! I don't know how Zhuge Liang died in history, but one thing's clear—I, as Zhuge Liang, will definitely be killed by you!" </p>
<p>Staring at his hand—"Borrowed Knife to Kill" and one "Sha"—he felt like cursing.</p>
<p>He had just emptied his hand last turn, and now drew two more cards.</p>
<p>At least give me a "Shan"!</p>
<p>His Empty Fort skill hadn't triggered even once!</p>
<p>Thankfully, earlier he'd used the Observe Stars skill to play "Cross the River and Demolish the Bridge," removing Zhen Ji's Zhuge Repeating Crossbow. Otherwise, he'd have died a thousand times over.</p>
<p>"Sorry, my health is a bit dangerous. Bear with me," Zhang Yi said lightly, coughing twice.</p>
<p>What could he do? He was just as desperate.</p>
<p>Compared to the Rebels Zhao Yun and Zhen Ji, their general skills seemed decent individually.</p>
<p>But combined with their seating order? They were nothing but a dopey fool!</p>
<p>"Stop your futile resistance!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, just surrender already."</p>
<p>Wang Han and Joey were now fully equipped—weapons, armor, Defensive and Offensive Horses, the works—though their health was poor, both down to two points.</p>
<p>"Hmph, surrender? Surrender is impossible! The time for a comeback has arrived!" Song Ren's eyes lit up as he drew his card, thrilled.</p>
<p>"Lord, fear not! I, Liang, have a plan!" Song Ren declared dramatically.</p>
<p>Then the in-game Zhuge Liang spoke his line:</p>
<p>"Lightning!"</p>
<p>A flash of light streaked across the screen, and a lightning icon appeared above Zhuge Liang's head.</p>
<p>"Brilliant plan! Chancellor, your strategy is truly magnificent! Combined with your Observe Stars, the Rebels will have nowhere to run!" </p>
<p>Seeing the lightning icon appear over Song Ren, Zhang Yi instantly understood.</p>
<p>Though it was their first game, after the initial confusion, they had mostly grasped the rules.</p>
<p>Invincible!</p>
<p>"Ah! No 'Cross the River and Demolish the Bridge' or 'Take a Goat in Passing'!"</p>
<p>"Me neither!"</p>
<p>When Wang Han and Joey's turns came, neither had cards to remove equipment.</p>
<p>They attempted to force-kill Zhuge Liang, but he still had a Peach and healed himself immediately.</p>
<p>"It's okay, Joey. We still have hope. As long as luck is on our side and the lightning doesn't strike us, we can eliminate him in our next turn," Wang Han said.</p>
<p>"Hmph, don't delude yourselves! The comeback has begun! Long live the Chancellor of Great Han!" Zhang Yi declared triumphantly.</p>
<p>But before he could finish, the in-game Zhuge Liang uttered a line:</p>
<p>"Create Something from Nothing!"</p>
<p>??????</p>
<p>"Wait, Old Song, what are you doing!?" Zhang Yi's eyes bulged.</p>
<p>Song Ren, just realizing what he'd done, looked equally embarrassed.</p>
<p>Initially, he had remembered using Observe Stars to position the Lightning card.</p>
<p>But here was the problem.</p>
<p>Among the four cards, he spotted a "Create Something from Nothing" and instinctively moved it to the second position.</p>
<p>When he drew that card, he couldn't resist the urge.</p>
<p>Drawing two extra cards—what an irresistible temptation!</p>
<p>Anyone would have done the same!</p>
<p>Besides, he noticed the fourth card—the upcoming judgment card—was actually a Bagua Array.</p>
<p>It was fate!</p>
<p>"It's fine, probably not a big deal. Emperor Liu is blessed with divine protection..." But before he could finish, he fell silent.</p>
<p>Because in the center of the screen, the judgment card was revealed.</p>
<p>Spade 7 "Sha."</p>
<p>The Lightning judgment condition was Spade 2 through Spade 9—so the Lightning effect triggered.</p>
<p>Instantly, a dark cloud gathered above the in-game Liu Bei. Thunder roared, and a bolt of lightning struck him directly.</p>
<p>"Could this be the Peach Garden...?"</p>
<p>Hearing Liu Bei's final words, Zhang Yi remained expressionless. Wang Yifan, already eliminated, struggled to hold back laughter.</p>
<p>Song Ren looked utterly bewildered.</p>
<p>Wang Han and Joey high-fived in celebration.</p>
<p>"Chancellor, care to explain?" Zhang Yi shot Song Ren a sideways glance.</p>
<p>"Ahem... let's try playing Fall Guys instead! Chen Xu wasn't lying this time—this game really is fun!" </p>
<p>Facing the intensely awkward moment, Song Ren noticed the commotion around the Fall Guys station and quickly shifted the topic.</p>
