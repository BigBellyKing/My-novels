                <p>Chapter 555: Resident Evil? Kidney Crisis! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>After the Nebula Games Carnival concluded, “Resident Evil Village: Blood and Wine,” “Super Mario Maker,” and the entire Nebula Theme Park all flooded social media.</p>
<p>Regarding the Nebula Theme Park, it is essentially set to open within the year.</p>
<p>As for players, their focus was clearly more on “Resident Evil Village,” “Blood and Wine,” and “Super Mario Maker”—these three main elements.</p>
<p>However, what frustrated many players was that, just like previous Nebula Games direct presentations, Chen Xu did not provide precise information, only a vague announcement that the games would launch within the year.</p>
<p>This approach not only caused a bit of 'pained expressions' among players but also left many game designers in the industry feeling a little 'confused.'</p>
<p>The DLCs named 'Blood and Wine' and 'Hearts of Stone,' although merely additional paid content, were based on “The Witcher: Wild Hunt.”</p>
<p>Secondly, even though “Resident Evil Village” is a horror game, its predecessor performed exceptionally well, and from Chen Xu's introduction at the direct presentation, it seemed he intended to introduce some new tricks and innovations in this installment.</p>
<p>Considering Chen Xu's past track record, it's safe to say no one wanted to clash with these two titles.</p>
<p>This was especially true for some game developers on the Huanyu VR Platform; after all, the Zeus segment, even if affected, still had a certain user base, primarily competing for third-party neutral players.</p>
<p>Conversely, game developers preparing for recent launches all began their promotions, vying with “Super Mario Maker,” creating a sudden feeling of games 'erupting.'</p>
<p>After all, this was a Switch platform game, so it wouldn't cause too much impact.</p>
<p>However, in the prelude to the launch of “Super Mario Maker,” something caught many players completely off guard: Chen Xu's official Weibo account actually released some data about “Resident Evil Village,” or rather, a short video.</p>
<p>The official Weibo content was very simple: 'BOSS, Countess: Alcina Dimitrescu.'</p>
<p>The short video was only five seconds long.</p>
<p>Clicking on it, one saw a scene set in what appeared to be a castle hall. Standing before them was a mature and voluptuous woman with a full and tall figure. Her face was incredibly pale, her hair black, her lips painted red, and she wore a white gown and a wide-brimmed black hat. As if noticing something, the noblewoman slowly turned, revealing not a grotesque face, but rather a smile that made one's heart flutter.</p>
<p>What the heck!?</p>
<p>Innumerable players who saw Chen Xu's and Nebula Games' official Weibo post were completely bewildered!</p>
<p>Where was the promised horror game?</p>
<p>What was the deal with this noblewoman BOSS?</p>
<p>She was truly too big!</p>
<p>Many players were stunned on the spot.</p>
<p>“Holy cow! This... this... this!”</p>
<p>“Isn't this the ‘Resident Evil’ I know? Where are the Fungal Beasts and all the disgusting monsters? Why is there such a huge noblewoman here! Mr. Chen, well done!”</p>
<p>“Kid driving a big car? Who can resist that?!”</p>
<p>“Is this the content we wanted? Yes! This is the content we wanted!”</p>
<p>Watching the Countess video released by Nebula Games' official platform, many players eagerly left comments in the official Weibo's comment section.</p>
<p>This wasn't “Resident Evil” at all! It felt more like they'd entered some 3D Zone! This had directly become a Kidney Crisis!</p>
<p>With the release of the Countess BOSS video, in just one day, major video websites were flooded with this short five-second clip. There's no telling how many Lewd Persons gathered here.</p>
<p>Many players who had never intended to buy “Resident Evil Village,” whose bottom line they thought was as solid as rock, suddenly felt a slight loosening.</p>
<p>This... seemed a little tempting!</p>
<p>Its explosive momentum even overshadowed the soon-to-be-launched “Super Mario Maker.”</p>
<p>Not only that, many fan-made secondary creations appeared on the same day.</p>
<p>Of course, the impact on the gaming industry didn't stop there.</p>
<p>On the second day after “Resident Evil Village” released this promotional video, another game developer's video climbed to the trending searches.</p>
<p>However, this time it wasn't Nebula Games, nor was it their old rivals FOW under Zeus, or Atari.</p>
<p>It was NetDragon Games, which had been cooperating very well with Nebula Games in recent years.</p>
<p>While “Dance Dance Revolution” on Switch sold very well, NetDragon wasn't entirely focused on it. In fact, NetDragon had quietly been developing a sci-fi FPS masterpiece.</p>
<p>Their original plan was to launch before the New Year, but the sudden arrival of “Resident Evil Village” and “The Witcher: Wild Hunt” DLC disrupted their plans.</p>
<p>A delay was inevitable.</p>
<p>But NetDragon was conflicted.</p>
<p>Because at the same time, some domestic and international game developers who chose to delay were scolded fiercely by players.</p>
<p>And now, they found a way.</p>
<p>It was still a delay, but others had a yellow background with black text, appearing cold and ruthless.</p>
<p>But how should they announce their delay?</p>
<p>Same yellow background with black text, but with a new twist!</p>
<p>Under melancholic background music, a pitiful blonde loli held up a 'sorry' sign, cautiously peeking at the players in front of the computer screen. The 'sorry' on the sign couldn't be a mechanical font; it had to look handwritten, with a crying emoji added for good measure.</p>
<p>Plan complete!</p>
<p>Just after Nebula Games released a horror game BOSS trailer for the Countess, NetDragon Games followed right behind with a big spectacle for their delay apology.</p>
<p>It immediately made countless players shout 'despicable.'</p>
<p>What was NetDragon Games doing? They were exploiting human concern for young creatures to achieve their ulterior motives!</p>
<p>But, for the sake of the blonde loli, we'll forgive you this time!</p>
<p>This move instantly left other game developers bewildered.</p>
<p>What kind of people are these!?</p>
<p>Everyone apologizes, why are you showing off so many tricks! </p>
<p>Chen Xu, seeing NetDragon Games' move from within Nebula Games, couldn't help but sigh with emotion.</p>
<p>“NetDragon has finally learned to do it!”</p>
<p>It had to be said, other companies' delay announcements were cold notifications, no matter how sincere, they still seemed a bit heartless.</p>
<p>But this time, NetDragon Games' delay was a textbook example!</p>
<p>Of course, this delay tactic could only be used once. If used repeatedly, it would erode players' patience.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, Qin Yi and Meng Zuo beside him remained silent.</p>
<p>When it came to 'shenanigans,' Mr. Chen, you're no slouch either!</p>
<p>Remembering the special promotional theme song they were currently tailoring for “Resident Evil Village,” Qin Yi and Meng Zuo's mouths twitched.</p>
