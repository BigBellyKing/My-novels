                <p>Chapter 164: Wrongs Have Their Head, Debts Have Their Owner—Your Husband Isn't Me! (Sixth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Whether others were scared, Li Yue didn't know.</p>
<p>At any rate, he was frozen stiff at this moment.</p>
<p>Just now, he had once again entered a new loop.</p>
<p>In the room with the locked door around the corner, the baby's cries grew louder and louder.</p>
<p>'Waaah... waaah...'</p>
<p>But once again, as he reached the wooden door at the end of the corridor, the previously open door was suddenly slammed shut and locked by an invisible force.</p>
<p>The baby's cries also abruptly ceased at this moment.</p>
<p>The only sound in his ears was the creaking, grating swing of the hanging lamp overhead, a sound that made his teeth ache.</p>
<p>And at this moment, a creaking sound came from behind him.</p>
<p>The door behind him, from which the baby's cries had come earlier, seemed to have opened!</p>
<p>Staring at the wooden door in front of him, Li Yue didn't dare to look back at all.</p>
<p>Regarding some of the game's content, combined with the radio broadcast triggered the first time he walked down this corridor, he already had some guesses.</p>
<p>That is, in the game, the sound of the crying baby very likely belonged to a murdered child.</p>
<p>And the sound of the door opening just now, could it be the pregnant wife murdered by her husband?</p>
<p>Was she standing right behind him at this moment?</p>
<p>What did she even look like?</p>
<p>Thinking this, Li Yue felt a chill run through him.</p>
<p>Standing rooted to the spot for about ten seconds, Li Yue took two deep breaths and suddenly spun around.</p>
<p>Yet, everything was utterly silent, without the slightest movement.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Li Yue relaxed slightly.</p>
<p>"So, the next step is to enter the next phase. Can I go into this room now?"</p>
<p>Looking at the ajar door, Li Yue slowly walked forward, guessing in his heart.</p>
<p>The moment his hand touched the doorknob.</p>
<p>A white figure suddenly appeared from the crack in the door, a ghastly pale ghostly face staring fixedly at him, and with a 'bang', it slammed the door shut.</p>
<p>"Holy crap!"</p>
<p>It was just like Lord Ye who loved dragons; the excellent horror atmosphere of Silent Hill PT had kept Li Yue on edge, even making him think that if he could see a ghost, then so be it—at least he'd die knowing what killed him.</p>
<p>But upon suddenly seeing it, he was immediately overwhelmed, and his innocent vocal cords also bore the undue pressure of this moment.</p>
<p>"Does this mean I can still play this game? Are my psychological fortitude and courage really that outstanding?" Li Yue swallowed hard, looking at the game screen that was still running.</p>
<p>During previous tests, some people had their tests interrupted and were sent to rest due to certain elements.</p>
<p>Back then, Li Yue had thought that was simply a sign of weakness.</p>
<p>But now, he had to admit, he had never so desperately wanted to be a weakling.</p>
<p>Because the pressure this game had put on him so far was simply too immense.</p>
<p>Whether it was the visual presentation, the sound effects, or the lighting and shadows, Chen Xu had pushed the game's horror atmosphere to its extreme.</p>
<p>Li Yue truly couldn't understand why such an "underworld" game would appear in the "world of the living"!</p>
<p>Was this a game a normal person could make?</p>
<p>Staring at the tightly shut toilet door, Li Yue took a deep breath. The previously locked door at the end of the corridor was now open again, its meaning naturally self-evident.</p>
<p>This meant he could continue into the next corridor loop.</p>
<p>But the only good news was that Li Yue could now confirm that the female ghost in the game was the victim from the previous radio broadcast.</p>
<p>Passing through the basement door again, the scene behind it was still exactly the same.</p>
<p>But the observant Li Yue noticed that there were now more cockroaches in the house.</p>
<p>And what made him feel even more eerie was that the previous baby's cries had been replaced by a woman's voice.</p>
<p>'Heh heh... uh-ah... ah-uh... woo woo woo... mm-oh... ah'</p>
<p>An incredibly bizarre sound, neither laughter nor crying, accompanied by heavy gurgling tremolos.</p>
<p>It was like someone was being strangled, groaning with saliva stuck in their throat.</p>
<p>As he moved forward, the lights grew dimmer, and the woman's voice became louder.</p>
<p>At the corner, Li Yue's body trembled.</p>
<p>Because, in the dim light further away, a tall female ghost with an indistinct face was standing there.</p>
<p>In that instant, Li Yue felt as if his heart was gripped by a large hand.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Li Yue gritted his teeth and walked straight towards her.</p>
<p>The unknown was the greatest fear; why was he so scared before?</p>
<p>Wasn't it because he didn't know there was a female ghost before? Wasn't it because he didn't know when she'd appear or what she looked like?</p>
<p>Now that the female ghost was standing right in front of him, what was there to be scared of?!</p>
<p>However, the moment Li Yue took a step, his heart grew cold, just like the lights that suddenly went out ahead.</p>
<p>First, there is the spirit, then it declines, and finally, it is exhausted.</p>
<p>The female ghost once again vanished into the darkness. The courage he had just mustered dissipated before it could be unleashed, and the unknown fear from before returned.</p>
<p>It was even worse than before, because he now knew there was a female ghost in the room, but he had no idea which corner she was hiding in, observing him.</p>
<p>Behind him, above him, behind him, in the cupboard, in the toilet cubicle… it seemed she could be anywhere.</p>
<p>Like an old lady crossing the road, Li Yue took tiny steps forward. The female ghost's gurgling voice continued, sending shivers down his spine, until he reached the spot where she had stood before, and the lights came back on.</p>
<p>The moment the lights appeared, countless cockroaches scattered, making Li Yue's scalp tingle.</p>
<p>Swallowing, Li Yue once again stepped through the basement door.</p>
<p>He finally summarized some of the content of the Silent Hill PT demo.</p>
<p>That is, with each loop, strange changes seemed to occur in the corridor.</p>
<p>So, what changes would occur in this loop?</p>
<p>The first half of the corridor was identical to before, but after turning the corner, Li Yue found that the previously closed toilet door was now open.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Li Yue entered the dark toilet and found a flickering flashlight on the ground.</p>
<p>Clearly, in this dark toilet, seeing the surroundings would only be possible with this flashlight in front of him.</p>
<p>Swallowing, Li Yue controlled his game character to slowly squat down and pick up the flashlight from the ground.</p>
<p>The moment he picked it up, he heard a 'bang' from behind him.</p>
<p>The toilet door slammed shut, and at the same time, the baby's miserable whimpering started again.</p>
<p>Following the sound, Li Yue shined the flashlight, only to see a malformed, underdeveloped fetus lying clearly in the toilet's washbasin.</p>
<p>The moment the flashlight shone on it, the soft whimpering suddenly turned into loud wailing.</p>
<p>'Thump-thump-thump...'</p>
<p>Just as the wailing began, Li Yue distinctly heard the sound of high heels from outside the door.</p>
<p>There wasn't even time for Li Yue to react.</p>
<p>'Clang! Clang! Clang!'</p>
<p>The doorknob was being frantically pulled, and with the female ghost's tugging from outside, the toilet door was continuously pried open a crack. Through that gap, he could even glimpse the ghastly pale figure outside.</p>
<p>In the dark environment, the flashlight, which was supposed to be constantly on, began to flicker again.</p>
<p>The clanging of the doorknob from outside, along with the baby's cries, instantly shattered Li Yue's psychological defense.</p>
<p>"Stop pulling! It has nothing to do with me, please, let me go!"</p>
<p>"Wrongs have their head, debts have their owner; your husband isn't me!"</p>
<p>"I didn't kill you, and I didn't harm the child. Stop pulling!"</p>
<p>The in-game Li Yue, controlling his character, crouched in the corner of the toilet, somewhat incoherently shouting to vent the fear in his heart, his shouts even tinged with a slight sob.</p>
<p>He swore that he had never been this scared since he could remember.</p>
<p>Why hadn't his connection to the VR gaming pod been forcibly interrupted yet?</p>
<p>Was this function broken?</p>
<p>Li Yue began to get carried away with wild thoughts, but just as he felt himself on the verge of breaking down, everything finally stopped.</p>
<p>The baby's cries stopped, the female ghost outside seemed to have vanished, and the toilet door, which had been locked from the inside, now had a crack.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Li Yue poked his head out and walked out; everything seemed to have returned to normal.</p>
<p>He waited in place for a while, but there was still no movement. The only constant was the door leading to the next loop.</p>
<p>It was just an ordinary door, but the feeling it gave Li Yue was like the gaping maw of a fierce beast.</p>
<p>"Prosperous, democratic, civilized, harmonious, free..." After a moment of hesitation, Li Yue silently recited the core socialist values in his mouth and took his step.</p>
<p>One more update, aiming before 1 AM.</p>
