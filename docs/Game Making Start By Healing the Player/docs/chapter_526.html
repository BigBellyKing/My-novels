<p>Chapter 525: Friend, Fancy a Game of Cards? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>In the game, Song Ren looked at the officer before him and couldn't help but feel a touch of melancholy.</p>
<p>Despite it being just the game's starting map, the various quests in White Orchard and the portrayal of the characters already gave Song Ren a sense of a chaotic era.</p>
<p>In this era, it was often impossible to definitively say whether someone was a good person or a bad person. There were only situations requiring the Witcher to make different choices.</p>
<p>Of course, sentimentality aside, the money still needed to be earned. Without money, how could he complete his Gwent deck?</p>
<p>Song Ren also noticed something: currently, he could only use a Northern Kingdoms Gwent deck in the game. He didn't have any decks from other factions, such as Scoia'tael, Monsters, Nilfgaard, or Skellige Isles.</p>
<p>Of course, the Skellige Isles deck was content from the large DLC Blood and Wine in his previous life, but Chen Xu had simply incorporated it into the main game ahead of time.</p>
<p>"Alas, there's nothing left to linger for in this White Orchard," Song Ren sighed, taking a bite of meat after buying all the innkeeper's stock.</p>
<p>In the game, healing primarily relied on food and potions. Before this, Song Ren had always depended on a potion called Swallow for healing, even grinding for a short while to get drowner brains to craft it.</p>
<p>However, he soon discovered that there was a skill in the character's skill tree called Gourmet, which was incredibly useful.</p>
<p>With this skill, the healing buff from a single piece of food lasted for a long time, and he no longer had to worry about running out of potions.</p>
<p>In fact, this skill point was also a new addition from the large DLC Blood and Wine. But considering the game's flow, Chen Xu had also integrated it into the main game.</p>
<p>Because, in reality, 'Gourmet' was a skill particularly useful in the early game, allowing players to progress through the story and explore the map more efficiently, rather than spending more time scavenging for healing potions.</p>
<p>By the mid-to-late game, the effects of Gourmet weren't as significant. With increased poison resistance, higher-grade alchemical concoctions like advanced Swallow potions became more common.</p>
<p>So, Chen Xu had directly included the Gourmet skill in the main game.</p>
<p>"Shallow waters cannot raise a dragon. The strongest Gwent player is about to leave White Orchard village!" Song Ren mused as he returned to the inn to continue the main quest.</p>
<p>It was time to venture into a wider world and challenge stronger players. A small pond couldn't nurture a dragon, and he, the future strongest Gwent player, clearly couldn't let his journey end in this small village.</p>
<p>Although, before playing, Song Ren never imagined that his motivation to push the story forward would be the lack of Gwent opponents in the area.</p>
<p>But he had to admit, this mini-game was truly addictive.</p>
<p>Unlike the Texas Hold'em in <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, which, though fun, was a real-world card game and quite mentally taxing.</p>
<p>This Gwent game was different; its rules were simple and clear, offering a mix of luck and strategy. For example, there was a Decoy card that allowed him to return a card from his field to his hand. Song Ren discovered he could use this card to trick opponents into wasting their powerful cards.</p>
<p>Once he figured that out, it became instantly addicting. Plus, after defeating a player for the first time, he could win a card from them.</p>
<p>Continuing the main quest, Song Ren returned to the small inn in White Orchard village after visiting the Nilfgaardian garrison.</p>
<p>Then, a scene that made Song Ren sigh with emotion appeared.</p>
<p>The innkeeper of White Orchard village had angered some villagers who still remembered Temeria fondly by taking down a Temerian emblem, leading to one woman beating her severely. Geralt and Vesemir intervened, dispatching the thugs, but the innkeeper showed no gratitude, instead looking at Geralt with fear.</p>
<p>Perhaps you believe what you did was good, but others may not thank you for your so-called 'kindness.' What you perceive as help might, in fact, worsen someone's situation.</p>
<p>Combined with earlier quest depictions, this made Song Ren understand <em>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</em> more clearly. Compared to other ARPGs, <em>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</em> presented a more realistic, yet somewhat oppressive, world.</p>
<p>But it was precisely this realism that made it more convincing to players. With a touch of melancholy, Song Ren refocused on the game's story.</p>
<p>After exploring White Orchard for clues about Yennefer, it was unexpectedly Yennefer herself who found Geralt, accompanied by imperial troops. Without giving Geralt a chance to reminisce, Yennefer simply instructed him to go with her to Vizima, the former Temerian capital now occupied by the empire, for a secret meeting with the emperor.</p>
<p>After bidding farewell to the old man Vesemir, on their way to Vizima, they were ambushed by the Wild Hunt, and more than half of their accompanying soldiers were killed. Finally, after a journey, Geralt, the White Wolf, arrived at the Vizima palace, ready for his secret meeting with the emperor.</p>
<p>Before meeting the emperor, Geralt had to be led by the court steward to change into formal attire and even learn some etiquette. After completing these tasks, Geralt, escorted by guards, prepared to speak with Emperor Emhyr.</p>
<p>However, in the front hall, Song Ren's steps halted because he noticed an exclamation mark on the mini-map. What did he see? An official, sitting on a long bench in the palace.</p>
<p>Song Ren, driven by curiosity, walked over and triggered the relevant dialogue. Then, his expression turned to surprise. The person before him could play cards!</p>
<p>Looking at the emperor's steward and guards waiting nearby, then at the card player in front of him, Song Ren pondered for a moment before excitedly speaking: "Friend? Fancy a game of cards? I'm the strongest Gwent player in White Orchard village!"</p>
<p>Unlike the card players in the White Orchard inn, Song Ren discovered that he could even place wagers with this Gwent player in the palace. Without hesitation, Song Ren maxed out his wager to 10 Yuan. This was simply too satisfying! He could make money playing cards!</p>
<p>Looking at the Gwent player before him, Song Ren was overjoyed. Previously, in White Orchard, his only opponent was the War Scholar, and that person was truly terrible; it was a one-sided crushing victory for Song Ren.</p>
<p>Now, a card player in the palace – surely this one would be better? Song Ren mused happily, as the wager was placed and he entered the Gwent battle interface, wondering what card his opponent would give him after the match.</p>
