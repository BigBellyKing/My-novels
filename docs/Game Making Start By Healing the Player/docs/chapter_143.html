<p>Chapter 142: New Game (Fifth Update – Please Subscribe, Monthly Pass Votes Wanted)</p>
<p>January 10th. Chen Xu returned to the company.</p>
<p>Although it wasn't a workday, everyone except those on duty—Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and Qin Yi—was already present.</p>
<p>They swarmed around the trophies being carried into the office, chattering excitedly.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, you're awesome!"</p>
<p>"Seeing these trophies in person is way more exciting than just on screen!"</p>
<p>"Are these trophies silver-plated or pure silver?"</p>
<p>"What are you thinking? How could they possibly be pure silver? They'd get dented the moment you touched them! Anyway, help me put these into the display cabinet. If nobody's busy tonight, I'll treat everyone to a nice dinner," Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Everyone cheered in response.</p>
<p>That evening, the group arrived at the restaurant Chen Xu had reserved.</p>
<p>It wasn't a large gathering—Chen Xu hadn't made an announcement in the work group chat.</p>
<p>After all, this wasn't an official company team building or company dinner.</p>
<p>Nebula Games had never held such events since its founding, except for celebration banquets.</p>
<p>Besides, it was the weekend, not a workday.</p>
<p>Most employees would probably come if invited, but there would inevitably be some who didn't really want to attend, yet felt compelled to show up just to avoid leaving a bad impression with their boss.</p>
<p>So Chen Xu only invited Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, Qin Yi, and a few others.</p>
<p>At the dinner table, they upheld Nebula Games' corporate tradition—no alcohol.</p>
<p>Everyone's drinks were either plain boiled water, coke, herbal tea, fruit juice, or corn juice.</p>
<p>"NetDragon's <em>Star God</em> really got crushed. Totally ended up as a runner-up," Qin Yi sighed at the table.</p>
<p>"Yeah, didn't even get a consolation prize," another employee chimed in.</p>
<p>"Teacher Meng is actually a pretty passionate guy in private. Let's not talk about this," Chen Xu interjected.</p>
<p>"Sister Xin, what are you looking at? So absorbed?" Ruan Ningxue noticed Yang Xin, who had been staring intently at her phone, smacking her lips.</p>
<p>Putting down her phone, Yang Xin replied, "Reading the news! There's this utterly ridiculous story—about a couple who went to get their marriage certificate in the morning, and less than half a day later, one of them already regretted it."</p>
<p>"That's… pretty extreme, isn't it?" Ruan Ningxue scratched her head.</p>
<p>"Marriage isn't a game! Rushing into marriage is unacceptable. Our country's divorce rate rises every year because many people don't realize that marriage represents not just love, but responsibility," Qin Yi sighed with emotion.</p>
<p>"Oh, come on, Brother Qin! You're still a Single person yourself, and you're calling yourself an emotional expert?" Lin Tao, sitting next to Qin Yi, grumbled inwardly.</p>
<p>"Even though I'm single, what Qin Yi said is actually quite accurate. And this is precisely connected to our next game. Qin Yi's insight is truly impressive!" Chen Xu put down his chopsticks and smiled.</p>
<p>"Huh!?"</p>
<p>"Connected to our next game!?"</p>
<p>Instantly, everyone turned to Chen Xu, eyes wide with surprise.</p>
<p>Connected to marriage?</p>
<p>"Alright, we'll discuss it during tomorrow's meeting. Let's eat for now," Chen Xu said, raising his glass with a smile, deliberately avoiding further discussion.</p>
<p>Amid laughter and clinking glasses, the conversation shifted to other amusing topics.</p>
<p>Though deeply curious about the new game, they knew they'd naturally find out when work resumed the next day.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>The next day, at Nebula Games.</p>
<p>In the meeting room, Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, Qin Yi, and everyone else had gathered.</p>
<p>They sat with eager anticipation, waiting for Chen Xu to unveil the next phase of the development plan.</p>
<p>He had already hinted at it during last night's dinner.</p>
<p>But what intrigued them most was exactly how the new game would relate to marriage.</p>
<p>On the big screen appeared a simple design concept draft—<em>It Takes Two</em>.</p>
<p>Seeing the title, everyone paused for a moment.</p>
<p>Judging by the name alone—could this be a two-player co-op game?</p>
<p>Though puzzled, no one spoke up yet. They continued watching.</p>
<p>The first page of the concept draft showed an art style concept art, featuring two cartoonish doll figures—one made of clay, the other a puppet.</p>
<p>The team immediately started discussing.</p>
<p>"A two-player co-op game?"</p>
<p>"The art style is cartoonish, kind of reminds me of last year's <em>Overcooked</em>!"</p>
<p>Chen Xu interrupted to explain, "Exactly as you guessed. This game will be a Two-Player Game with a cartoon art style, just as you see here."</p>
<p>"As for the Gameplay, let me briefly summarize: it's a two-player co-op puzzle action-adventure game. When I mention two-player mode, you probably think of <em>Overcooked</em>, which we developed last year. But <em>It Takes Two</em> is different."</p>
<p>"This will be a cinematic two-player game. The story experience and level puzzles will be equally important elements. The scale will also be larger than <em>Overcooked</em>."</p>
<p>"Players will experience various gameplay styles within the game—FPS, Platforming, and more."</p>
<p>"Of course, due to time constraints, our main focus before the Lunar New Year will be on art asset production. Core content development will begin after the holiday. Any questions?" Chen Xu asked, looking around the room.</p>
<p>"Sounds pretty interesting. Seems completely different from <em>Overcooked</em>!" Yang Xin remarked, staring at the concept art on the big screen.</p>
<p>"A cinematic two-player game… but I doubt it'll be a big seller," Qin Yi scratched his head.</p>
<p>"Before the final product is complete, any sales prediction is meaningless. While the nature of two-player games is inherently niche, and it naturally can't compete with titles like <em>Fall Guys</em> or <em>Dark Souls</em>, there's still a significant player base that enjoys this genre. If done well, it can still achieve substantial sales."</p>
<p>"Besides, this is mainly meant as a surprise for our fans. After the intense experience of <em>Dark Souls</em>, <em>It Takes Two</em> will be a delightful dessert. The only pity is we probably won't make it in time for next year's Valentine's Day. The development progress won't drag all the way to Chinese Valentine's Day, I hope."</p>
<p>"Otherwise, who knows—maybe some players might even strengthen their relationships through the game and end up together!" Chen Xu said, sounding slightly regretful.</p>
<p>But the moment he finished speaking, he noticed Qin Yi, Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, and the others all staring at him with strangely suspicious looks.</p>
<p>They didn't say a word, but their expressions clearly conveyed the same message: <em>Do you even believe that yourself?</em></p>
<p>Wasn't that the same excuse they used for <em>Overcooked</em> earlier this year!?</p>
<p>And now here comes <em>It Takes Two</em> next year, with marriage as the central theme.</p>
<p>Honestly, Qin Yi and the others were deeply worried—<em>It Takes Two</em> might end up being "Two-Player Divorce" instead.</p>
<p>Seeing their expressions, Chen Xu was utterly Speechless. He shook his head.</p>
<p>"Alright, meeting's over. Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue, stay behind with the Art Team. I'll explain in detail the different scene themes for this game and the specific art requirements."</p>
<p>"Once you start working on it, you'll understand exactly what kind of game this really is."</p>
