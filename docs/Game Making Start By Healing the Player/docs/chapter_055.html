                <h1>Chapter 55: Matryoshka-Style Spread</h1>
<p>"Is it really that exaggerated? I want to see what kind of magic this 'Outlast' has!"</p>
<p>In a residential complex in the Imperial Capital, a bare-chested, short-haired, muscular tough guy, standing at 1.92 meters tall, sat in front of his computer.</p>
<p>This tough guy, named Song Ren, was currently looking at information on a certain forum with a suspicious expression.</p>
<p>It was uniformly filled with comments about how terrifying 'Outlast' was.</p>
<p>He had always been uninterested in horror games.</p>
<p>However, knowing that this horror game was made by the designer of 'To the Moon' sparked some curiosity in him.</p>
<p>After all, despite his imposing appearance, how did that saying go? "A tiger in the heart sniffs a rose with care."</p>
<p>Outwardly, he was a pure tough guy, but even tough guys shed tears sometimes; he had cried a bucket of tears when he played 'To the Moon'.</p>
<p>So, he still paid some attention to Nebula Games and the designer Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Moreover, 'Outlast' seemed quite popular recently, so he decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>A horror game, could it really be that scary?</p>
<p>With curiosity, Song Ren bought and installed the game, then launched it.</p>
<p>"Heh... just putting on an act?"</p>
<p>In front of Mount Massive Asylum, Song Ren was brimming with confidence.</p>
<p>"Heh... is that all?!"</p>
<p>From climbing the shelves to the lights in the room going out, Song Ren's face showed disdain.</p>
<p>"Hiss... it's just a door jump scare, nothing to be afraid of."</p>
<p>A corpse came flying out the door, startling Song Ren slightly.</p>
<p>"Wait... don't come over here!!"</p>
<p>A patient in a wheelchair in the lobby demanded a "hug of love," turning Song Ren's face pale.</p>
<hr />
<p>An hour later,</p>
<p>Song Ren leaned back in his chair, breathing heavily. At this moment, he could clearly feel his heart pounding.</p>
<p>Thump-thump, strong and powerful, all from being scared by the recent scenes.</p>
<p>Looking at the nearby curtains, he silently got up and drew them open, letting the sunlight into the room.</p>
<p>"Sunshine... feels good!"</p>
<p>Looking at the bright sun outside, and at the monitor showing the game's store interface after he had exited the game, Song Ren slowly exhaled.</p>
<p>He had to admit one thing: he had lost, and completely so.</p>
<p>Thinking back to his recent gaming experience, Song Ren, still leaning in his chair and gazing at the bright sun outside, felt his legs still a little weak.</p>
<p>But then, Song Ren suddenly remembered something. After recovering from his recent fear,</p>
<p>He silently opened his phone, found his friend's account, and sent a message.</p>
<p>"Old Zhang, I found a really fun game, it's so thrilling! It's incredibly satisfying to play, I highly recommend you try it too."</p>
<p>"It's the new work by the designer of 'To the Moon', 'Outlast'. What genre? Parkour and puzzle-solving, I have to say it's super exciting!"</p>
<p>After sending it, Song Ren took a deep breath, then gazed out at the scenery beyond the window.</p>
<p>Thankfully, thankfully he played this game in broad daylight!</p>
<p>Leaning back in his chair in the room, about half an hour passed.</p>
<p>His phone on the table rang.</p>
<p>A message was sent by someone named Old Zhang.</p>
<p>A simple sentence, and three exclamation marks expressing intense excitement—'Damn it, you old bastard!!!'</p>
<p>Seeing this message, Song Ren, leaning back in his chair, laughed aloud.</p>
<p>His earlier fear had completely faded.</p>
<p>Because in his mind, he had already visualized exactly how his friend had been scared out of his wits.</p>
<p>After laughing, he saw his bright monitor screen; his account on the game platform was still on the 'Outlast' launch interface.</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, Song Ren quietly closed the platform.</p>
<hr />
<p>There were many, many players like Song Ren.</p>
<p>Initially, these players learned about 'Outlast' because of 'To the Moon'.</p>
<p>But more often, they discovered the game through forums in various game communities.</p>
<p>Like Song Ren, these players, upon seeing other players' comments, were filled with a sense of curiosity and an unwillingness to admit defeat.</p>
<p>How scary could a horror game be? Seriously? Is this just marketing by internet trolls?</p>
<p>With such thoughts, these players intended to play it themselves, then post screenshots of their completed game to boast about it.</p>
<p>After all, many players, especially when it came to courage, apart from those who truly had self-awareness, still had a mysterious confidence in themselves.</p>
<p>However, once they entered the game, they quickly realized what kind of game it truly was.</p>
<p>Not to mention the later content, just the early parts had already scared away a large number of players.</p>
<p>Some players enthusiastically entered the game, only to be deterred right at the entrance of Mount Massive Asylum.</p>
<p>Others were turned away during the first door jump scare or when they encountered Fat Guy.</p>
<p>Of course, even more were deterred in the basement, facing the pitch-black environment where they couldn't see their hand in front of their face, being chased by a madman wielding a spiked plank.</p>
<p>Naturally, a portion of players gritted their teeth and persevered.</p>
<p>But once they repaired the generator and the Priest gave them an injection, leading them into the prison stage, they realized that everything before was merely an appetizer!</p>
<p>Of course, within the game, they were deterred at different stages.</p>
<p>But after the game, they all did one thing in common.</p>
<p>That was to post on game forums, either recommending or warning other players.</p>
<p>It was like a Matryoshka doll, one nested within another.</p>
<p>After all, if I got scared, then tricking one more person is a win.</p>
<p>Everyone else should feel the same way I did!</p>
<p>Later players, seeing all sorts of information, were completely bewildered and couldn't figure out what kind of horror game 'Outlast' truly was.</p>
<p>Some people, to make their claims more believable, even specifically took screenshots of less terrifying scenes.</p>
<p>But others described it in great detail, declaring 'Outlast' to be extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>The increasing number of accounts attracted subsequent players who learned about 'Outlast', drawing them in one after another.</p>
<p>It was like a relay race: the person in front reached the finish line and passed the baton to the next athlete.</p>
<p>However, the spread among 'Outlast' players was even wider.</p>
<p>Because the player base was constantly expanding, this meant the spread of information was also continuously growing.</p>
<p>Initially, Chen Xu still needed to subtly guide the relevant directions and topics, and appropriately create memes for the players.</p>
<p>But as more and more players wet themselves from fright in Mount Massive Asylum,</p>
<p>Nebula Games no longer needed to guide them with capital.</p>
<p>The spontaneous discussions among players were enough to create hot topics, slowly fermenting and expanding their influence like a prairie fire.</p>
