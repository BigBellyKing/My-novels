                <p>Chapter 55 Matryoshka-Style Spread</p>
<p>"Is it really that exaggerated? I want to see what magic this <em>Outlast</em> holds!"</p>
<p>Inside a residential complex in the Imperial Capital, a muscular, bald-headed man standing at 192 cm sat bare-chested in front of his computer.</p>
<p>The man was Song Ren, who at this moment stared skeptically at a post on a game forum.</p>
<p>Every comment was uniformly raving about how terrifying <em>Outlast</em> was.</p>
<p>He had never been interested in horror games before.</p>
<p>But knowing that this horror game was created by the same designer behind <em>To the Moon</em> sparked a flicker of curiosity in him.</p>
<p>Despite his imposing appearance, wasn’t there a saying? "A猛虎 (tiger) gently sniffs the rose."</p>
<p>Outwardly, he was a pure brute, but even brutes shed tears. He had cried buckets during <em>To the Moon</em>.</p>
<p>Therefore, he did pay some attention to Nebula Games and its designer, Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Plus, lately, this game called <em>Outlast</em> seemed to be gaining popularity, so he decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>How scary could a horror game possibly be?</p>
<p>With curiosity, Song Ren purchased, installed, and launched the game.</p>
<p>"Heh… putting on airs?"</p>
<p>Standing before Mount Massive Asylum, Song Ren wore a confident smirk.</p>
<p>"Heh… is that all?"</p>
<p>After climbing from the shelf into the room as the lights went out, Song Ren scoffed.</p>
<p>"Hiss… Just a door jump scare. Nothing to fear."</p>
<p>When a corpse lunged at him from behind a Conduit, Song Ren flinched slightly.</p>
<p>"Wait… don’t come any closer!!"</p>
<p>Seeing the wheelchair patient in the hall reaching out for a Hug of Love, Song Ren turned deathly pale.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>An hour later</p>
<p>Song Ren leaned back in his chair, breathing heavily. At that moment, he could clearly feel his heartbeat.</p>
<p>Thump-thump, strong and powerful—entirely triggered by the terrifying scenes.</p>
<p>Glancing at the nearby curtain, he silently stood up and drew it shut, letting sunlight flood into the room.</p>
<p>"Sunlight… feels so good!"</p>
<p>Staring at the bright sunshine outside and the monitor displaying the Shop (in-game) interface after exiting the game, Song Ren slowly exhaled.</p>
<p>He had to admit one thing—he had lost, and lost completely.</p>
<p>Recalling his gameplay experience, Song Ren, still seated and gazing at the sunny world outside, felt his legs slightly weak.</p>
<p>But then, a thought struck him. Having recovered from the fear, he quietly picked up his phone, found a friend’s account, and sent a message:</p>
<p>"Old Zhang, I found an incredibly fun game—seriously thrilling! Playing it feels absolutely awesome. I highly recommend you try it too."</p>
<p>"It’s the new work by the designer of <em>To the Moon</em>, called <em>Outlast</em>. What genre? Parkour and puzzle-solving. I must say, it’s super stimulating!"</p>
<p>After sending the message, Song Ren took a deep breath and stared silently out the window.</p>
<p>Thank goodness he had played it during broad daylight!</p>
<p>Seated in his room, about half an hour passed.</p>
<p>Then, his phone on the table buzzed.</p>
<p>A contact labeled "Old Zhang" sent a message.</p>
<p>Just one simple sentence, followed by three exclamation marks expressing sheer shock—"Damn it you jerk!!!"</p>
<p>Seeing this, Song Ren burst into laughter, still leaning back in his chair.</p>
<p>The fear from earlier had completely vanished.</p>
<p>Because in his mind, he was already mentally picturing exactly how his friend had been startled.</p>
<p>After laughing, he glanced at his still-lit monitor. His account on the game platforms remained at the entry screen of <em>Outlast</em>.</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, Song Ren quietly shut down the platform.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>There were countless players just like Song Ren.</p>
<p>Initially, these players learned about <em>Outlast</em> because of its connection to <em>To the Moon</em>.</p>
<p>But more commonly, they discovered it through posts on game forums and communities.</p>
<p>Like Song Ren, upon reading other players’ comments, they felt both curiosity and a competitive spirit.</p>
<p>How scary could a horror game really be? Is it really that terrifying? Or are these just internet trolls promoting it?</p>
<p>With such thoughts, these players decided to try it themselves, planning to post screenshots after clearing the game to show off.</p>
<p>After all, many players—especially when courage is involved—aside from those with genuine Self-awareness, still harbored delusional confidence in themselves.</p>
<p>But once they entered the game, they quickly realized what kind of beast they were dealing with.</p>
<p>Not even getting into the later content, the early parts alone scared off a massive wave of players.</p>
<p>Some confidently entered the game but were immediately turned back at the gates of Mount Massive Asylum.</p>
<p>Others were scared off during the First door jump scare or upon encountering Fatty.</p>
<p>But most were defeated in the catacomb, fleeing in terror from a madman wielding a spiked plank in pitch-black darkness where you couldn’t see your own hand.</p>
<p>Of course, some players persevered, gritting their teeth and pushing forward.</p>
<p>Yet, after repairing the generators and receiving an injection from the Priest, entering the prison stage, they realized—the earlier parts were just appetizers!</p>
<p>Certainly, in-game, these players were defeated at different stages.</p>
<p>But after the game, one thing they all did was the same.</p>
<p>They left posts on game forums, recommending—or warning—other players.</p>
<p>Like Matryoshka dolls, one nested inside another.</p>
<p>Since I got scared, might as well trick someone else.</p>
<p>Others must feel exactly what I felt!</p>
<p>The flood of information left later players bewilderingly confused, unable to grasp what kind of horror game <em>Outlast</em> truly was.</p>
<p>Some, aiming to make their stories more convincing, even took screenshots of relatively non-scary scenes.</p>
<p>Others gave detailed accounts, insisting that <em>Outlast</em> was extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>The growing number of voices attracted even more players who heard about <em>Outlast</em>, rushing in one after another like an All-in Push.</p>
<p>Like a relay race, the first runner reaches the finish line and passes the baton to the next.</p>
<p>But the player community’s spread of <em>Outlast</em> was even broader.</p>
<p>Because the player base kept expanding, meaning the spread of information also continuously grew.</p>
<p>Initially, Chen Xu had to subtly guide the discourse, occasionally crafting memes to shape player narratives.</p>
<p>But as more and more players got utterly terrified inside Mount Massive Asylum,</p>
<p>Nebula Games no longer needed to steer the conversation.</p>
<p>The players’自发的话题讨论 (spontaneous topic discussions) alone were enough to ignite a hot topic, slowly spreading like wildfire and expanding their influence further and further.</p>
