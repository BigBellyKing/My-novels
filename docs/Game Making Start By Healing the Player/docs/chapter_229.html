                <p>Chapter 228: Nothing Short of a Miracle (Sixth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>While Chen Xu and his team were conducting maintenance on Minecraft, as well as developing the mobile and VR versions,</p>
<p>the unique gameplay of Minecraft attracted an increasing number of players.</p>
<p>Initially, most players focused on crafting beautiful little houses.</p>
<p>But as time progressed, many high-level players began discovering the wonders of the Redstone system.</p>
<p>Much like a puzzle, Redstone Torches continuously emit signals.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, objects like Conduits, music boxes, and dispensers activate when receiving a signal, and deactivate when the signal stops.</p>
<p>Levers and pedals are straightforward—they function as simple switches.</p>
<p>The Repeater adjusts signal strength, since Redstone signals weaken over distance; with a Repeater, the signal can be restored to maximum strength.</p>
<p>Though no players had yet created complex mechanisms like calculators or pianos,</p>
<p>simple structures such as automatic chicken farms, small minecarts, and signal doors had already been successfully built by some.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, players exploring Minecraft’s Adventure mode discovered another mind-boggling gameplay element: Enchanting.</p>
<p>Additionally, various temples could be found in forests, deserts, and even underwater.</p>
<p>Of course, some unlucky players, upon first encountering a desert temple, jumped right in without hesitation—only to be brutally taught a lesson by TNT.</p>
<p>Videos of these incidents sparked heated discussions on Minecraft’s official forum.</p>
<p>'My mom asked me why I was kneeling while watching videos!'</p>
<p>'We all paid 68 yuan for the same game—why does yours look nothing like mine?'</p>
<p>'I think I bought the wrong game. I’m playing Minecraft, but what world are you guys actually in?'</p>
<p>'Wait, you can actually play it like that?'</p>
<p>'Seriously, selling this game for 68 yuan to Mr. Chen is an absolute loss!'</p>
<p>'Holy crap! I’m still living like a caveman in the Stone Age, and you guys are already entering the Industrial Era?!'</p>
<p>'Caveman here too—I’m still struggling to build my first house, and you’re already constructing Chicken Farms and Minecarts?'</p>
<p>Watching countless videos of master players showing off their creations, many players online joked that while they were playing Minecraft, others were playing Others' World—it was practically a different game!</p>
<p>Of course, despite the jokes, none of this dampened their enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Because every player could find their own unique joy within Minecraft.</p>
<p>This was all thanks to the game’s distinctive nature.</p>
<p>The game itself doesn’t impose any specific goals—everything you do is driven solely by your own imagination.</p>
<p>This level of freedom in gameplay was truly unprecedented.</p>
<p>Coupled with its special game mechanisms, the game became filled with astonishing possibilities, sparking endless imagination among players.</p>
<p>It truly lived up to the phrase from the promotional video: the larger the player’s imagination, the more enjoyable the game becomes.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Miracle.</p>
<p>This was the term nearly every game designer in the gaming industry used to describe Minecraft over the past month.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just PC developers—game designers specializing in VR were equally dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Over the past month, Minecraft’s performance had been nothing short of miraculous, leaving everyone in awe.</p>
<p>It was simply unbelievable.</p>
<p>If the first-day sales of 3 million and first-week sales of 10 million were impressive, that would’ve been understandable.</p>
<p>After all, there had been other games in history that achieved similar results.</p>
<p>But the real shocker was Minecraft’s subsequent performance. Typically, after explosive first-week sales, the second week sees a sharp drop—sometimes even a halving.</p>
<p>Yet Minecraft was different. Although sales declined in the second week, the drop was remarkably stable.</p>
<p>This brought Minecraft’s total sales over two weeks to an astonishing 17 million.</p>
<p>And there was no sign of slowing down.</p>
<p>Not only domestically, but the overseas version of Minecraft launched a week and a half after the domestic release, priced at $14.90.</p>
<p>Initially, international players familiar with Nebula Games were confused.</p>
<p>After all, this studio had previously developed Dark Souls.</p>
<p>How did they suddenly release a pixel-style game?</p>
<p>But the moment players took notice of the game, they were stunned.</p>
<p>When Minecraft launched overseas, Target Software pulled off a massive cosplay of Nebula Games, directly translating and reposting all the mind-blowing domestic videos to international platforms.</p>
<p>Even before the game’s official release, classic domestic builds, tutorial videos, and Redstone technology demonstrations exploded in view count overseas.</p>
<p>This instantly ignited the game’s popularity.</p>
<p>Within just one week of its overseas launch, Minecraft had already sold 13 million copies.</p>
<p>Its subsequent sales trajectory mirrored the domestic trend almost exactly—steadily climbing forward.</p>
<p>Yes, sales were gradually declining, but only slightly.</p>
<p>It was as if the game possessed some extraordinary magic.</p>
<p>Although its price was comparable to most Independent Games, that hardly mattered in the face of its terrifying sales figures.</p>
<p>After Minecraft achieved this sales miracle, major media outlets overflowed with praise.</p>
<p>Even the domestic Game Department, in an unprecedented move, published an official review:</p>
<p>'There is no other game quite as special as Minecraft.'</p>
<p>'This is a game about blocks and adventure—though that description might be too narrow. In this unique game, players can explore a procedurally generated world solo and create astonishing miracles.'</p>
<p>'Whether it’s a tiny prison darkroom or a luxurious large villa, players are free to unleash their imagination and build anything they desire.'</p>
<p>'In Survival Mode, players must collect resources to build bases and weapons to face unknown dangers. Almost every player can find their own unique joy in the game.'</p>
<p>'As stated in the promotional trailer, the only limit to this game’s fun is the player’s imagination. Judging from current results, this statement couldn’t be more accurate.'</p>
<p>'If we were to define what a sandbox game is, it would undoubtedly be a game like Minecraft!'</p>
<p>This review carried immense weight—effectively, the Game Department was endorsing the game and formally recognizing 'sandbox game' as a distinct genre.</p>
<p>As for game designers across the industry, they were now deeply studying Minecraft’s design and mechanics.</p>
<p>If some designers had previously dismissed the game,</p>
<p>thinking a pixel-style sandbox game couldn’t possibly offer anything interesting,</p>
<p>no one held that opinion anymore. The facts had proven one thing:</p>
<p>Minecraft didn’t just 'play any new tricks'—it had become a phenomenon adored by millions.</p>
<p>Yet Chen Xu, the center of all this attention, wasn’t particularly focused on the industry or media reactions to Minecraft at this moment.</p>
<p>Instead, he was busy editing and producing a deeply meaningful video—</p>
<p>the first episode of a series documenting the historic milestones and major events created by players in Minecraft.</p>
