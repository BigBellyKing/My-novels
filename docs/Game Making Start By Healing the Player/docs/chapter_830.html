                <p>Chapter 829: This Familiar Style</p>
<p>After holding the online press conference, Chen Xu and his Nebula Games team gradually proceeded with the development of Elden Ring.</p>
<p>Compared to its previous life, beyond balancing some numerical values—such as the powerful Spirit Ash Mainstays like Moonveil Katana and Mimic Tear, fixing some particular bugs like the Rock Sling stuck in fog gate to kill BOSS, and more completely fleshing out side quests—much of the team's effort was actually focused on the game's guidance.</p>
<p>Exploration is the core of Souls-like games, but Elden Ring, as FromSoftware's first attempt at an open-world game in its previous life, still had many aspects that weren't well-designed.</p>
<p>For example, the item crafting system in the game, and the use of Perfumer's Bottles; many players might not even understand what these things are for, even after completing the game.</p>
<p>Moreover, a large amount of materials needed to be collected in the wilderness, and the original intention was clearly for players to explore the wilds through this. Yet, the meager rewards evidently left players with no desire to explore. Any exploration was typically to find tunnels or dungeons hidden in various corners of the map; as for simply searching for materials in the open world, most players would barely glance at them.</p>
<p>Adding to this, the need to specifically collect additional crafting manuals directly led to the item crafting and Perfumer's Bottle systems—which serve as combat system aids and can even enhance various weapon build archetypes—being completely untouched by many players even after their first playthrough.</p>
<p>The most direct cause of this was the feeling among players that the effort and reward were unbalanced. On one hand, the game intentionally integrated it as an in-game system, hoping players would engage with this gameplay content. On the other hand, various crafting manuals were hidden in every corner of the map for players to unlock. Crucially, only a small fraction of the crafted items were genuinely useful, while most felt like a chicken rib (something that has little value but is difficult to discard), leading to the awkwardness of the crafting system.</p>
<p>After all, this wasn't like Talismans, equipment, or Smithing Stone Bell Bearings, where the effects and benefits were immediately obvious.</p>
<p>As for the quest log tool present in most ARPGs, Chen Xu decided not to include it. After all, exploration in side quests is a crucial characteristic and core element in Souls-like games. If it were designed like typical ARPGs, explicitly telling players where to find an item or kill a monster, it would lose its essence.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>For many players, this period felt like living through a year in a day. Although major developers released blockbusters frequently during this time, for most players, their anticipation was unequivocally directed at one game: Elden Ring, previously announced by Nebula Games.</p>
<p>The content was simply too appealing: an open world, ARPG mechanics, an epic fantasy story, a rich variety of weapons and equipment, and puzzle elements. Combined, these aspects filled them with immense expectation just thinking about it.</p>
<p>The only pity was that, apart from the initial concept art and a game title, there had been no further news whatsoever.</p>
<p>“I wonder what Elden Ring will actually be like!”</p>
<p>“It’s like living through a year in a day, I feel like I’m about to break!”</p>
<p>“Exactly! It’s been so long, and Mr. Chen still hasn’t released any news!”</p>
<p>“Speaking of which, I wonder what the gameplay will be like. Similar to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim?”</p>
<p>“Probably, didn’t Mr. Chen already introduce the game type?”</p>
<p>“Not necessarily. I think it might be like The Witcher: Wild Hunt, but with a richer combat system.”</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s a fantasy-themed Zelda?”</p>
<p>Players had their own various ideas, as there was simply no official news about Elden Ring on any websites; what could they possibly imagine based solely on speculation?</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>And amidst the players' anticipation, the official promotional trailer for Elden Ring finally arrived.</p>
<p>Players, who had been eagerly awaiting and following its development, immediately clicked on it without hesitation. They were desperate to see what new surprises Chen Xu would bring them this time.</p>
<p>First, the Nebula Games and Elden Ring LOGOs appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>Then, a gentle female voice spoke:</p>
<p>'It happened an age ago…'</p>
<p>'But I remember it well.'</p>
<p>In the darkness, a four-armed maiden, whose face was obscured, sat cross-legged and slowly recounted:</p>
<p>'In the Night of the Black Knives…'</p>
<p>'The Rune of Death was stolen.'</p>
<p>In a nighttime forest, a squad of Black-clad Knights galloped quickly. The next moment, the sound of swords piercing flesh echoed.</p>
<p>'And Godwyn the Golden became the first of the Demigods to perish…Perhaps that is why Queen Marika was driven to madness…'</p>
<p>In the shadows, a deceased man lay, blood flowing from wounds resembling centipedes. Yet, beneath his skin, strange, worm-like creatures seemed to writhe, creeping towards his eye sockets. The next second, his closed eyes opened, oozing a strange black viscous liquid.</p>
<p>'The Shattering was a war without true victor…Who could have shattered the Elden Ring? And why?'</p>
<p>In a grand palace, several thrones stood, and a monstrous old man placed down his crown, heading towards the palace entrance with a sharp blade in hand. Beneath the Erdtree, in the magnificent capital city, two factions fought fiercely.</p>
<p>'For what purpose did the Demigods turn to war?'</p>
<p>The scene then shifted to a battlefield under the setting sun, a mountain of corpses and rivers of blood. A general standing beside two greatswords confronted a female warrior clad in armor.</p>
<p>'General Radahn, Scourge of the Stars.'</p>
<p>'Malenia, Blade of Miquella, the Severed.'</p>
<p>'The most powerful among them fought until the very last moment…'</p>
<p>On the battlefield, the Valkyrie and Radahn, Scourge of the Stars, fought each other. But compared to Radahn, Scourge of the Stars, who crushed stars, the Valkyrie was still slightly inferior. After several clashes, her arm was severed by the Greatsword of Radahn.</p>
<p>'Yet…none emerged victorious.'</p>
<p>Kneeling on the ground, the Valkyrie plunged her blade into her own chest. The next second, scarlet blood flowed from the wound, and a giant Scarlet Aeonia bloomed behind her, its crimson power sweeping across the entire continent, centered on the battlefield.</p>
<p>'Even now, the world remains in ruin…awaiting the Elden Lord.'</p>
<p>'Or perhaps…thou’rt of a mind to become one?'</p>
<p>The camera slowly ascended, showing an incomparably beautiful maiden with one eye closed, gazing calmly into the lens.</p>
<p>As her words faded, the screen went dark. 'Elden Ring', the game's LOGO, appeared in the center.</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>After watching the entire promotional trailer, many players' first reaction was that Nebula Games' CG animation show was back again! The exquisite visuals, cool camera angles, and expensive special effects made the entire trailer magnificent. Many were thrilled just by watching it.</p>
<p>But after the initial excitement subsided, and they calmed down, some veteran Nebula Games players instantly realized something was amiss. The style of this promotional trailer felt a little familiar, much like a certain type of game from their own lineup!</p>
