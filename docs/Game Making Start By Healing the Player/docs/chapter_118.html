                <p>Chapter 118: Is This F***ing for Humans?!</p>
<p>【You Died】</p>
<p>It was still the familiar death screen with those three big words.</p>
<p>At the same time, Wang Han's two words, filled with delight, came from beside him.</p>
<p>“That's it?”</p>
<p>Wang Han, watching Gundyr the Ash who had only lost about a third of his health, couldn't help but burst out laughing.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, in front of the computer, was expressionless. Because he discovered that reality and imagination were still very different.</p>
<p>In his imagination, rolling to dodge attacks and parrying for execution should have been seamless, just like the actual gameplay demonstration video at the online press conference. But after mentally picturing it, he realized it was pretty much the same as fighting with the Deprived before.</p>
<p>Facing the massive Gundyr the Ash, an inexplicable sense of oppression arose as soon as they engaged. Although he kept in mind to fight and retreat, maintaining his stamina bar, when it came to actually fighting, he completely panicked.</p>
<p>Facing Gundyr the Ash's wind-up attacks, the only thing he did was frantically press the roll dodge button. More crucially, sometimes he rolled too early, not only wasting stamina but also failing to dodge the damage. As for parrying, the price was two Estus Flasks, and he didn't even succeed.</p>
<p>Turning to look at Wang Han, who was all smiles beside him, Zhang Yi silently left his seat, a smile also appearing on his face.</p>
<p>“Your turn!”</p>
<p>As his voice fell, Wang Han's smile froze on her face.</p>
<p>One life each, the two of them started competing against Gundyr the Ash. In the midst of this, Wang Han also boldly proposed an idea. That since the pressure from Gundyr the Ash in melee was too strong, why not try ranged combat?</p>
<p>So a class named Mage entered their sight. They created a character and checked the skills: Soul Arrow and Great Soul Arrow. Just by hearing the names, they sounded powerful. The damage was indeed very high; one hit on Gundyr the Ash took down a small chunk of health.</p>
<p>But… the accuracy aside (at least there was a lock-on button), the cast time was simply too slow! And even though Gundyr the Ash was so tall and seemed a bit slow in his attacks, once distance was created, Gundyr the Ash's efficiency in closing the gap was incredibly high.</p>
<p>A leaping slash like “Split Mount Hua with Force” and a lunging sweep both taught the casting mages what it meant to be caught in melee by a warrior. It was then that Wang Han also understood why this damned character, clearly a Mage, was also equipped with a short sword and a metal round shield.</p>
<p>Besides that, there was also a Pyromancer character; throwing fireballs was indeed quite flashy, but its drawback was the same as the Mage: the casting animation was too slow. Moreover, they were quite fragile, often being sent to their demise by a leaping slash from Gundyr the Ash while mid-fireball cast.</p>
<p>Wang Han and Zhang Yi tried each class one by one and found that the Knight was still the most effective. At least in terms of fault tolerance, the Knight was much higher. Its attack power wasn't low either. As for burial gifts, the two currently found the most useful to be the ring that increased maximum health, the Goddess's Blessing which restored all health, and the Black Firebomb. Other items might be useful later, but for now, they were absolutely no help in defeating Gundyr the Ash.</p>
<p>In addition, after accumulating double-digit death experiences between the two of them, they also summarized some special aspects of the game Dark Souls. That was four words: Don't get greedy!</p>
<p>One very important thing in the game was the stamina bar. Without a stamina bar, it practically meant being at the mercy of others. And in the game, almost all actions consumed stamina. Basic attacks consumed it, parrying consumed it, running consumed it, rolling consumed it, and blocking also consumed it. And if the stamina bar was completely depleted, its replenishment speed would become slower than usual. So when attacking, one needed to grasp a certain rhythm; once they got greedy, draining the stamina bar meant facing the BOSS's counterattack at its mercy.</p>
<p>Regarding burial gifts, the two unanimously agreed on one point: choose the Black Firebomb. Although it was difficult to hit Gundyr the Ash, a successful hit dealt 120 damage. Starting with 5 Black Firebombs, hitting all of them combined with one or two basic attacks was equivalent to directly depleting half of Gundyr the Ash's health.</p>
<p>Wang Han and Zhang Yi, having been “taught” multiple times by Teacher Gundyr, finally felt they had found the correct way to clear the stage this time. Fight and retreat, make full use of items, and maintain the stamina bar. For moves difficult to roll-dodge, simply block with a Greatshield. Finally, this time, having only wasted one Black Firebomb, Gundyr the Ash's health was directly reduced by half. And Zhang Yi still had three Minute Maid Pulpy Oranges.</p>
<p>“Victory is within reach! Come on! Be steady!” Wang Han, who was watching from the side, was also a little excited.</p>
<p>“I know!” Zhang Yi replied, his eyes fixed on Gundyr the Ash's movements on the screen. But the next moment, Gundyr the Ash in the game suddenly squatted down and remained still, under Zhang Yi's terrified gaze. A large mass of black, unknown substance suddenly erupted from Gundyr the Ash's body. These black substances intertwined like flowing asphalt, then formed something akin to vines. Finally, the vines spread and continued to intertwine behind Gundyr, eventually transforming into a monster resembling a dragon and a snake, with horns and claws. Its crimson eyes stared intently at the in-game character. The transformed Gundyr the Ash was even taller than before.</p>
<p>Second phase!</p>
<p>What the heck, how does the first BOSS already have a second phase?! Before Zhang Yi could react, the Pus of Man in front swept with a claw, and his health instantly dropped by a third. Then, without waiting for Zhang Yi to create distance and drink a potion, another charge immediately depleted his remaining health. Clearly, after transforming into its second phase, Gundyr not only changed its moves but also became more ferocious in its attacks.</p>
<p>“Chen Xu, Old Geezer… Is this f***ing meant for humans?!”</p>
<p>“I knew it! Why did the actual gameplay demo at the online press conference only show half the fight? This newbie village BOSS has a second phase!”</p>
<p>Zhang Yi's somewhat desperate cries echoed in the room. In short: he was a little bit “broken.” In fact, Gundyr the Ash was considered one of the lowest-ranked BOSSes in Dark Souls. In terms of difficulty, Gundyr the Ash didn't even rank in Dark Souls; some powerful mobs were even stronger than him. Because his moves were very obvious, and he didn't have any flashy tricks. This also made his moves very easy to dodge and parry, which is where the title “Teacher Gundyr, the parry master” came from.</p>
<p>But for many new players just starting Souls-like games, this guy was definitely an unforgettable presence. Because it was so damn hard! Filled with enthusiasm, wanting to contribute to the great undertaking of Linking the Fire, only to be “taught” for half the night by Teacher Gundyr, the gatekeeper on the path to Link the Fire. Who could handle that?! The only comforting thing for players was that in online mode, every time they went to the Crystal Lizard or Gundyr the Ash, they could tell from the bloodstains on the ground that countless other players in this world were dying and reviving just like them.</p>
<p>(My little broken bowl broke today, only a torn newspaper is left, wuwuwu… Please give recommendation votes, monthly passes.)</p>
