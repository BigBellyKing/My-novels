                <p>Chapter 94: Isn't This Just Matryoshka Dolls?</p>
<p>After the official versions of <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em> were launched, their data continued to rise steadily.</p>
<p>Especially <em>Fall Guys</em>, this buy-to-play game spread at an incredibly rapid pace.</p>
<p>On major video websites, live streaming platforms, and within the player community, the term 'Fall Guys' became wildly popular.</p>
<p>Even many players who hadn't tried the game yet had already heard about it from various sources.</p>
<p>This clearly demonstrated just how hot the game had become.</p>
<p>It even sparked numerous crossovers with characters from other games.</p>
<p>A wave of secondary creation emerged, transforming classic characters from other games into 'Fall Guys'.</p>
<p>All of this greatly contributed to the promotion of <em>Fall Guys</em>.</p>
<p>And it was all thanks to <em>Fall Guys</em>' delightful art and character design, along with the casual entertainment provided by its obstacle courses.</p>
<p>Although on forums, many players joked that once you started playing Fall Guys, you quickly turned into a Grabber.</p>
<p>For the majority of players, it was clearly still a game that brought immense fun.</p>
<p>Media outlets also widely reported on the <em>Fall Guys</em> phenomenon.</p>
<p>In comparison, <em>Sanguosha</em> hadn't reached the same level of popularity as <em>Fall Guys</em>, but its performance was very stable.</p>
<p>On various forums, players actively exchanged opinions on which generals provided the highest team synergy, and which ones were公认的害虫.</p>
<p>Soon, the official data for both games was released.</p>
<p><em>Fall Guys</em>: 650,000 copies sold in three days!</p>
<p><em>Sanguosha</em>: 110,000 in gross revenue over three days.</p>
<p>These figures left industry insiders stunned.</p>
<p><em>Sanguosha</em> wasn't particularly surprising, but the sales number for <em>Fall Guys</em> truly drew attention.</p>
<p>Was this a bit too terrifying?</p>
<p>But even more jaw-dropping news was yet to come.</p>
<p><em>Sanguosha</em>'s data showed no major spikes and remained steady.</p>
<p>However, on the fourth day, after <em>Fall Guys</em> launched on third-party platforms beyond the Nebula Games Platform, its cumulative sales shot past one million.</p>
<p>And judging by the momentum, there was no sign of slowing down.</p>
<p>This number left industry professionals utterly speechless. No one could have imagined that a game like this could achieve one million sales in just four days.</p>
<p>Although the game's low selling price contributed to this, regardless of price—</p>
<p>One million sales in four days is still undeniably awesome, even if it were only one yuan per copy.</p>
<p>After the sales figures came out, industry insiders were buzzing with discussion.</p>
<p>"Did you see it? The sales of <em>Fall Guys</em> are absolutely exploding! Over a million in four days—I'm completely stunned!"</p>
<p>"How is that even fair!"</p>
<p>"And the key thing is, player reviews are also extremely high!"</p>
<p>"Don't just focus on <em>Fall Guys</em>—what about <em>Sanguosha</em>? Haven't you noticed how unique that game is too? The revenue isn't high, but look at its operation: no pay-to-win, not even pushing monetization, yet it still managed nearly 200,000 in revenue over four days!"</p>
<p>"<em>Sanguosha</em> looks simple, but it's extremely hard to copy. Hurry up and study <em>Fall Guys</em>, take inspiration from variety show obstacle course programs, and try to grab a piece of this pie!"</p>
<p>"Heh, while you're still debating, smart designers have already started working."</p>
<p>Countless designers across the industry began researching, hoping to capitalize on the <em>Fall Guys</em> hype before it faded and grab a slice of the success.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, players were focused on another highlight from the recent gameplay Expo—</p>
<p>The promotional video released by Chen Xu on the final day, and the mention of <em>Dark Souls</em> on the official Weibo account.</p>
<p>On various game forums, players were actively discussing this upcoming title.</p>
<p>'<em>Dark Souls</em>—is that the name of Chen Xu's new work? Is it a fantasy theme?'</p>
<p>'Clearly a Western fantasy style, and judging by the scale of the promotional video, this should be a true Major Production!'</p>
<p>'Fire is about to die, yet no king is seen—the story of the Firelinker sounds quite desperate.'</p>
<p>'Ha, this is getting interesting. So we, the players, will play as the Firelinker, carrying the fire of hope into a world of despair!'</p>
<p>'Ha, I can't wait to play it. Ready to pass the flame!'</p>
<p>'By the way, have you seen the original artwork screenshots from the exhibition? So cool!'</p>
<p>'So are these the Classes players can choose in the game, or impactful bosses? I'm so excited!'</p>
<p>After the official Weibo post, Chen Xu's fans—</p>
<p>Some had experienced it firsthand at the event, others learned through the official Weibo and media coverage—</p>
<p>All began discussing with great excitement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chen Xu began spending his points.</p>
<p>From after the New Year until now, he had accumulated enough points for a hundred consecutive pulls.</p>
<p>Now that he was about to develop <em>Dark Souls</em>, it was the perfect time to boost his related numerical abilities.</p>
<p>Chen Xu first opened his computer and changed the desktop background to a bright, fiery red 'Fortune' character. Then, he opened his music software and queued up the Parallel World version of 'Good Luck', playing it in the background. Though the lyrics and melody were different, the sincerity was there.</p>
<p>With everything in place, Chen Xu tore open a wet wipe, cleaned his hands, took a deep breath, and began his gacha pull.</p>
<p>'Wow! Golden Legendary!'</p>
<p>As golden light flashed before his eyes, Chen Xu's mind instantly filled in the corresponding voice acting.</p>
<p>The effect was way too realistic.</p>
<p>Regular, Regular, Regular... After over ten Regulars, a Rare finally appeared.</p>
<p>Along the way, a bunch of Memory Capsules were mixed in.</p>
<p>'Wow! Golden Legendary!'</p>
<p>A hint of excitement flashed across Chen Xu's face.</p>
<p>Though it was still his mental visualization of the voice acting, this time—he actually got something!</p>
<p>As the golden light shone, a golden item appeared before him.</p>
<p>【Mysterious Gashapon: Upon meeting the activation conditions, you will obtain a mysterious item】</p>
<p>A golden egg shimmered, and Chen Xu noticed several progress bars on it.</p>
<p>Labeled: Joy, Sadness, Resentment, and Anger—four different categories.</p>
<p>"So I pulled a gacha and got another gacha egg?" Chen Xu felt a bit speechless.</p>
<p>Isn't this just Matryoshka dolls?</p>
<p>Opening a gacha only to get another gacha egg that requires a key to open.</p>
<p>Still, Chen Xu felt a flicker of anticipation.</p>
<p>Given the high requirements and its Golden quality, it probably wasn't something ordinary, right?</p>
<p>While pondering, Chen Xu also used up the skill books he had pulled, boosting his ability values.</p>
<p>For 'Joy', <em>Fall Guys</em> had just launched and could provide a substantial amount.</p>
<p>As for 'Resentment' and 'Anger', Chen Xu estimated that once <em>Dark Souls</em> launched, those wouldn't be hard to come by either.</p>
<p>Thinking this way, the conditions might actually be pretty easy to fulfill!</p>
<p>What comforted Chen Xu even more was that this item wouldn't interfere with his points—it operated independently.</p>
<p>After exhausting all his saved-up points and studying the item briefly, Chen Xu redirected his focus back to <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>Next, he still needed to grind out the design concept drafts for <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>(Please spare some recommendation votes and Monthly Passes~)</p>
