<p>Chapter 157: Players, Good Luck to You All (Seventh Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Seeing the hesitant expressions on everyone’s faces, Chen Xu could roughly guess what they were thinking. He smiled and explained.</p>
<p>"Don’t worry. It’s not what you’re imagining."</p>
<p>"In the game, bonfires aren’t completely incapable of teleportation. As the story progresses, after players pass through areas like the Undead Burg and Blighttown, successfully ring the bell, and reach Anor Londo, they’ll obtain an item called the Lordvessel. Only then will teleportation become available."</p>
<p>"Also, players can directly level up at bonfires in the game."</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu’s explanation, everyone suddenly understood.</p>
<p>"So the Fire Keeper’s function has been integrated into the bonfire, and the teleportation ability is tied to a specific in-game item," Qin Yi quickly grasped the design logic behind the bonfire mechanics.</p>
<p>"Exactly," Chen Xu nodded. "This is precisely to let players appreciate the intricate map design in the game."</p>
<p>So teleportation still exists—but it’s locked behind obtaining a specific item.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this design choice is to emphasize the brilliance of the game’s map layout.</p>
<p>With interconnected areas, elevators, and hidden shortcuts, players can traverse from one region to another in a very short time.</p>
<p>If one were to name the peak of map design in the Souls series, it would undoubtedly be Dark Souls 1.</p>
<p>If teleportation between every area were freely available, the sense of intricate, deliberate map design would be severely diminished.</p>
<p>After explaining the prequel titled <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em>, Chen Xu kept behind Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, the Art Team, and Qin Yi’s Level Design team.</p>
<p>Next, he needed to thoroughly discuss the game’s map and level design with them.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous <em>Souls</em> titles, this prequel required meticulous and thoughtful design in many aspects.</p>
<p>"A simple trap design shouldn’t just be superficial. We already had experience with this during the development of <em>Dark Souls</em>. For example, imagine two enemies positioned ahead."</p>
<p>"Under normal circumstances, when the player enters this area, it’s a blind spot in their field of view—catching careless players off guard with a sudden sneak attack. We’ve already used such corner ambushes before; they’re basic introductory traps."</p>
<p>"But in this prequel, we can’t afford to be so basic. We need to surprise players in entirely new ways, so we must adopt reverse thinking—don’t hide the trap, make it obvious."</p>
<p>"We want the player to notice the trap right in front of them. But behind that obvious trap lies another one—a layered trap, like a thousand-layer pancake. The outer layer is meant to be discovered, but hidden in the treetops or in the shadows, there’s another enemy. That’s the real ambush."</p>
<p>"And there’s another benefit: it creates an illusion for the player—that their death was simply due to their own carelessness."</p>
<p>"As a result, after dying, players become more cautious. Through subtle, skill-based guidance, we gradually lead them deeper into more complex traps, maintaining a sense of constant challenge and allowing them to feel a sense of achievement."</p>
<p>Chen Xu sat in front of the computer, quickly sketching out a rough scenario to help everyone understand his point.</p>
<p>Qin Yi and the others silently swallowed, their throats dry. Combined with the bonfire’s lack of teleportation, these trap and level designs… this was truly inhuman!</p>
<p>Just mentally visualizing it and recalling players’ past experiences in the Dark Souls world, Qin Yi could already feel the overwhelming malice.</p>
<p>"So it’s like boiling a frog slowly, while making the player feel like they’re being clever even as they’re being sold out?" Yang Xin mused, nodding thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Chen Xu didn’t respond, merely giving her a look.</p>
<p>Why did she have to phrase it so harshly?</p>
<p>Even if it was accurate.</p>
<p>"The main goal is to enhance gameplay. Only then can players truly feel surprised."</p>
<p>What is gameplay?</p>
<p>Isn’t the gameplay of <em>Dark Souls</em> defined by unexpected level designs, intensely tense boss fights, and death traps lurking around every corner?</p>
<p>If we reduced these elements, wouldn’t that be a disservice to the players?</p>
<p>To ensure players truly enjoy the game,</p>
<p>Everything for the players—this wasn’t just something Chen Xu said; it was something he acted upon.</p>
<p>That’s what a true game developer should embody!</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu’s words, Qin Yi pursed his lips, silent.</p>
<p>The shock? Definitely there.</p>
<p>But the joy? Well… in any case, players—good luck to you all.</p>
<p>We can only silently send you our sympathy.</p>
<p>After all, just imagining what this game will be like once completed, Qin Yi admitted he was already a little afraid.</p>
<p>…………………</p>
<p>After the meeting concluded, the prequel to <em>Dark Souls</em> officially entered development.</p>
<p>However, the current primary focus remained on producing art assets.</p>
<p>While the action animations in this installment hadn’t changed much,</p>
<p>nearly the entire game map needed to be replaced.</p>
<p>Even previously used locations like the Royal Gardens, Farron Cesspit, and Anor Londo couldn’t reuse old materials.</p>
<p>After all, one setting marks the end of the Age of Fire, while the other takes place shortly after the First Flame was lit.</p>
<p>The game needed to convey a sense of vast change over time, allowing players to feel the weight of history and岁月.</p>
<p>In addition, another major task was the promotional CGI for <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em>.</p>
<p>Chen Xu had already provided the storyboard scripts to Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue.</p>
<p>All that remained was to produce the CGI.</p>
<p>The same studio responsible for the opening intro of <em>Dark Souls</em> was contracted again.</p>
<p>Their previous cooperation had been highly satisfactory, and their expertise ranked among the best in the industry.</p>
<p>For now, <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em> didn’t require Chen Xu’s constant quality control, and Zhang Yida would handle the arrangements for this year’s gameplay Expo.</p>
<p>As for preparing a brand-new game, just as they did last year, Chen Xu had no such plans this time.</p>
<p>After all, they had recently completed a sizable project, <em>It Takes Two</em>, and had just greenlit a new <em>Dark Souls</em> title.</p>
<p>Time was genuinely tight.</p>
<p>Thus, Chen Xu decided not to participate in this year’s gameplay Expo.</p>
<p>Regarding overseas distribution, Target Software contacted Chen Xu, proposing a global simultaneous release.</p>
<p>Chen Xu agreed to Target Software’s suggestion.</p>
<p>After all, <em>Dark Souls</em> had performed exceptionally well overseas last year, significantly boosting the IP’s recognition.</p>
<p>After summarizing Nebula Games’ current status, Chen Xu, leaning back on the office sofa, stretched lazily.</p>
<p>Just then, the phone on his desk rang.</p>
<p>Chen Xu picked it up and his expression turned surprised.</p>
<p>It was a call from the landline in the Game Department.</p>
<p>What did the Game Department want with him?</p>
<p>Puzzled, Chen Xu answered the call.</p>
<p>(End of Chapter) &lt;<END_OF_CHAPTER>&gt;</p>
