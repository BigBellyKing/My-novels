                <p>Chapter 256: Something Feels Off! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>As a lone Longsword Hero, Song Ren was currently hunting solo.</p>
<p>He really loved the Long Sword as a weapon.</p>
<p>In terms of strength, he personally felt it was quite solid.</p>
<p>The only major downside was that whenever Zhang Yi and Wang Han and the other companions weren't around, he had to transform into a solitary Longsword wanderer, roaming across the New World.</p>
<p>Occasionally, he'd respond to someone's distress signal, only to find the moment he entered, the other player had already died instantly.</p>
<p>This seriously damaged his fragile heart.</p>
<p>While gathering materials from the Tobi-Kadachi's body, Song Ren sighed with emotion—what had Long Sword players ever done to deserve this?</p>
<p>It's not like they were <em>that</em> cool!</p>
<p>"Though the difficulty does feel a bit higher now. For an average player facing this Tobi-Kadachi, it'd probably be pretty tough."</p>
<p>"But although it's got some tricks, there aren't many of them."</p>
<p>Looking at the Tobi-Kadachi lying on the ground, Song Ren silently mused.</p>
<p>Compared to previous monsters, this Tobi-Kadachi was definitely harder to deal with.</p>
<p>Earlier monsters hadn't posed much of a threat.</p>
<p>But this Tobi-Kadachi was different.</p>
<p>Its speed was exceptionally high—just as its name, Flying Thunder, suggested.</p>
<p>Moreover, compared to previous monsters, its aggressive intent was far stronger.</p>
<p>Double bite attacks, various lunges, the ability to climb trees, and when you attacked its tail, it'd leap into the air and use its tail to release electrical shocks.</p>
<p>The damage output was significantly higher. Also, despite the Tobi-Kadachi's relatively small size, it acted like it had ADHD. Fortunately, his weapon was the Long Sword, which wasn't too sluggish in comparison.</p>
<p>"If Old Zhang were using his Great Sword against this guy, he'd probably get tormented into a fool," Song Ren chuckled, imagining the Great Sword's slow movements clashing with the Tobi-Kadachi's agility.</p>
<p>"Long Sword really is number one!" Song Ren once again boasted about his beloved Long Sword.</p>
<p>After gathering the materials, Song Ren returned to Astera Base and headed to the workshop on the second floor.</p>
<p>There wasn't much to upgrade—mainly just the weapon.</p>
<p>He could also upgrade the helmet on his head.</p>
<p>As for the rest, he hadn't really ground materials yet, focusing instead on advancing the main quest.</p>
<p>Besides, he felt equipment didn't seem that important—just maxing out weapon attack power was enough. After all, dying in this game was extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Mixing honey and healing potions to make Mega Potions—the game's crafting system—was something he still didn't fully understand.</p>
<p>But he figured it probably wasn't that impactful anyway. As long as he could get Mega Potions, he'd study the details when he got beaten up later.</p>
<p>With full confidence, Song Ren strode toward the Research Team Leader to accept his next quest.</p>
<p>This confidence came from deep within.</p>
<p>Especially after just defeating the difficult Tobi-Kadachi in their first encounter.</p>
<p>His confidence was now overflowing!</p>
<p>And this confidence wasn't the same as when he first defeated Gundyr the Ash in Dark Souls.</p>
<p>This time, his confidence was built upon the countless bosses he'd already overcome.</p>
<p>Great Jagras, Kulu-Ya-Ku, Pukei-Pukei, Barroth, Jyuratodus, Tobi-Kadachi—so many bosses had already fallen beneath his Longsword Hero.</p>
<p>He'd mastered the three-hit Spirit Gauge State, learned Helm Breaker, and though Foresight Slash wasn't quite perfected yet, it was only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Moreover, he'd discovered a small trick with the Long Sword—by using a slope, he could quickly activate Spirit Gauge State via a jumping slash.</p>
<p>Having learned even such a subtle technique, Song Ren felt only three words could describe him now.</p>
<p>Strong. Invincible!</p>
<p>"Forest Brute Anjanath? Isn't that the Tyrannosaurus Rex-like monster that swallowed the Great Jagras earlier?"</p>
<p>Looking at the newly accepted quest objective, Song Ren suddenly remembered.</p>
<p>At the beginning, the receptionist and he had been attacked by a Great Jagras.</p>
<p>Then the Anjanath suddenly appeared and swallowed the Great Jagras whole.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Research Team Leader arrived in time and drove the Anjanath away.</p>
<p>"Well, what a coincidence. Though you did help me out by swallowing that Great Jagras, I'm sorry—I'm a Hunter, the future Azure Star. So you'll have to fall beneath my blade. But I'll make sure to give you a quick death," Song Ren declared confidently.</p>
<p>Glancing at the bullet comments, Song Ren smiled.</p>
<p>Filled with strong confidence, Song Ren headed to the dining area, approaching the bun-haired receptionist.</p>
<p>"Why does this bun-haired girl never join me on missions? She just sits here eating all the time. Could it be the story hasn't reached that point yet? I still haven't gotten any NPC Teammates."</p>
<p>Looking at the receptionist holding a chicken leg, Song Ren felt a bit strange.</p>
<p>But he didn't dwell on it.</p>
<p>Being alone wasn't a problem—he could handle it.</p>
<p>One man, one Long Sword, becoming the legendary Azure Star!</p>
<p>"Though honestly, these companion Hunters are always slacking off!" After eating a Felyne Canteen meal, Song Ren scratched his head.</p>
<p>The First Fleet's Investigators—those scholars studying ecology and plants—well, they were intellectuals, so that was understandable.</p>
<p>But what about the others?</p>
<p>The fierce-looking Palico cooking in the cafeteria, the Commander-in-Chief who was always in meetings and never seen fighting, and the clearly powerful Big Bro of the First Fleet who spent all day on the third-floor cafeteria eating with the receptionist, his mouth never stopping.</p>
<p>The Second Fleet were all craftsmen, the Fourth Fleet handled logistics, always bringing subpar items while claiming they were good.</p>
<p>Song Ren felt the stuff he took from Astera Base was worth far more than what they brought in.</p>
<p>As for the Third Fleet, he'd only heard rumors—never seen them, didn't even know where they were.</p>
<p>And the Fifth Fleet? Aside from himself and the receptionist, he'd only seen the Mohawk-haired guy and his female teammate twice. Never during actual missions.</p>
<p>After a bit of inward grumbling, Song Ren confidently began his new quest.</p>
<p>Entering the wilderness map, it was similar to before.</p>
<p>Players had to search for Anjanath's traces themselves and pinpoint its location.</p>
<p>Soon, following clues on the map, Song Ren, guided by Scoutflies, arrived near the Anjanath.</p>
<p>Then the story triggered.</p>
<p>The Anjanath, resembling a Tyrannosaurus Rex, was feeding on a dead Great Jagras. Its powerful limbs, though not covered in scales like the earlier Barroth, exuded a unique sense of impact.</p>
<p>As the Anjanath fed, the Hunter cautiously approached, used an item to create noise and attract it, then, while the Anjanath was distracted, shot the vine tethering a giant boulder above its head with a crossbow, severing it.</p>
<p>With a roar, stones scattered. The Anjanath emerged unscathed from the rubble and fixed its gaze intensely on the Hunter.</p>
<p>At the same time, the game's UI interface appeared—now the player could control the character.</p>
<p>"Wow, it's huge! Even bigger than the Barroth before!"</p>
<p>Song Ren couldn't help but exclaim.</p>
<p>Visually, this Anjanath was incredibly imposing.</p>
<p>Its thick legs alone were larger than the Hunter in-game.</p>
<p>"Come on! When paths cross, only the brave prevail—whoever runs is a coward!" Song Ren swung his Long Sword and charged.</p>
<p>Hunt dragons by finding weaknesses—that was a small trick he'd figured out through playing.</p>
<p>'-8, -11'</p>
<p>Two consecutive strikes landed on the Anjanath's big toe, yielding two meager white damage numbers.</p>
<p>Then a slash to the tail produced an orange -24.</p>
<p>"As expected, large-volume bosses always have weak butts! Let's start by attacking the tail from behind!" Song Ren said, creeping toward the Anjanath's rear.</p>
<p>But the next moment, he saw the Anjanath's thick tail suddenly lift and slam down toward him.</p>
<p>The tail attack carried a wind pressure effect, striking Song Ren hard.</p>
<p>His health bar dropped by roughly one-sixth. Then the Anjanath spun around, its head smashing into him.</p>
<p>Song Ren, who had just gotten up, was knocked flying before he could react.</p>
<p>"Damn it! This health bar!"</p>
<p>Song Ren's eyes widened in shock.</p>
<p>He saw his health bar in the top-left corner—now reduced to half.</p>
<p>One tail slam and one bite—his health halved!?</p>
<p>Song Ren immediately executed two rolling maneuvers to create distance. Fortunately, at that moment, the Palico's skill triggered, and some honey bugs appeared out of nowhere, replenishing his health.</p>
<p>"Something's wrong! This Anjanath is acting strange—how the hell is its attack power so high!?"</p>
<p>Thinking back to his health bar being halved in an instant, a sense of dread crept into Song Ren's heart.</p>
<p>This kind of bleeding state—hadn't he experienced it before in another game?</p>
<p>&lt;<END_OF_CHAPTER>&gt;</p>
