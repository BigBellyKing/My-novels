                <p>Chapter 642 I Cannot Accept This! (Please subscribe for monthly passes)</p>
<p>“Hey, Old Song, look over here, there’s another BOSS!”</p>
<p>The group advanced, but then Zhang Yi noticed a unique monster at the end of a fork in the road to the left: Miner Johnson.</p>
<p>A monster with its own name, completely out of place among the Overseers and Miners nearby. He looked like a minor leader.</p>
<p>“Let’s take him out on the way,” Song Ren didn’t give it much thought.</p>
<p>Kill them all, burn them all, loot them all.</p>
<p>They weren’t planning to leave a single monster in the dungeon anyway.</p>
<p>Just like before, Song Ren and the others cleared the mobs bit by bit. The monsters here had also leveled up to 17-18.</p>
<p>Their attack power had increased, but the threat wasn't significant. Three to four at a time posed no real pressure.</p>
<p>After clearing the surrounding ordinary miner mobs, Song Ren and the others finally pulled the aggro of this elite monster.</p>
<p>“This monster is too weak, just a normal little elite,” Song Ren had been quite cautious when they initiated the fight.</p>
<p>But after a brief skirmish, he was speechless.</p>
<p>From the damage dealt and the percentage deducted from its health bar, Song Ren had roughly estimated it.</p>
<p>The monster before them had just over a thousand health points.</p>
<p>It had a bit more health than Lakzo’s two henchmen, but that was about it.</p>
<p>“Old Song, go loot the gear!” As Miner Johnson fell, Zhang Yi eagerly urged Song Ren, chuckling.</p>
<p>“So annoying! I’m not looting! I need to save my good luck for the BOSS later! I can’t use up my luck in advance!” Song Ren actually really wanted to loot, but at this moment, he restrained himself.</p>
<p>Not just from a superstitious belief perspective, but also from a scientific one.</p>
<p>Lakzo, with all his health, hadn’t dropped anything good, so what good could this thousand-health, useless miner boss possibly drop?</p>
<p>However, as soon as that thought arose,</p>
<p>The next demand interface popped up.</p>
<p>[Gilded Shield (Rare)]</p>
<p>Off-hand (Shield).
471 Armor, 9 Block, 5 Stamina, 2 Agility, Requires Level 15.</p>
<p>Song Ren stared blankly at the popping information.</p>
<p>What the heck?</p>
<p>Blue-tier equipment?</p>
<p>And it’s a shield, damn it?</p>
<p>‘Holy cow, it dropped blue-tier equipment?’</p>
<p>‘Old Zhang is amazing!’</p>
<p>Wang Yifan and Joey, who were next to him, also looked surprised at the interface that appeared.</p>
<p>“Impossible! This is impossible! This is unscientific! Who are you if not Old Zhang?!” Song Ren finally couldn’t hold back.</p>
<p>The BOSS hadn’t dropped anything good, so how did this small elite monster drop blue-tier equipment?</p>
<p>Although this shield definitely seemed to belong to him, the warrior.</p>
<p>At this moment, he wasn’t that happy.</p>
<p>He even found it a bit hard to accept.</p>
<p>Because did this mean he truly was an unlucky person? And more critically, it was Old Zhang who had looted it.</p>
<p>They used to have a resounding nickname: African Twin Chiefs.</p>
<p>Were they now transforming from unlucky Africans into lucky Europeans?</p>
<p>“Old Song, I think you can safely hand over the right to loot corpses to me from now on!” Zhang Yi said with a grin, then clicked “Abandon.”</p>
<p>“I cannot accept this! Let’s go, go, go, on to the next BOSS! I need to prove myself!” Song Ren, who had clicked “Need” and equipped the new shield, felt a surge of indignation. Yet, at the same time, he was filled with a strong sense of confidence, striding back to the intersection and deeper into the mine.</p>
<p>With the first blue-tier equipment on the team, he had risen!</p>
<p>His health would no longer be a rollercoaster.</p>
<p>Now, all he needed to do was prove whether he truly was an unlucky person!</p>
<p>A minute later, a familiar scene reappeared.</p>
<p>The voice channel fell into a brief silence.</p>
<p>“Old Song, can you explain?” Zhang Yi spoke.</p>
<p>“So you just got a blue-tier shield, not a whole set of blue-tier equipment,” Wang Han chimed in, echoing her husband.</p>
<p>Before Wang Yifan and Joey could continue to criticize him, Song Ren launched a preemptive strike.</p>
<p>“I relinquish all rights to loot corpses from now on! Also, come to my place for roast duck this Saturday night, my treat.” As the culprit for the party wipe, Song Ren silently took all the blame.</p>
<p>“But even though I’m taking the blame, I still have to say, Mr. Chen is really insidious! When a foreman falls, shouldn't the subordinates scatter like birds and beasts? What the heck is this, acting like rabid dogs?” Song Ren said, somewhat broken.</p>
<p>The scene just now was quite brutal.</p>
<p>With his new shield, he felt more confident in his tankiness and also wanted to prove he wasn’t an unlucky person.</p>
<p>So he charged forward aggressively.</p>
<p>However, the monsters in this area were different from before.</p>
<p>There were patrolling mage monsters, and Song Ren accidentally pulled the aggro of a patrolling monster. After killing it,</p>
<p>The other miners went berserk, like they were high on stimulants. Although they were all miners with about four hundred health points, an army of ants can still kill an elephant!</p>
<p>So they were tragically wiped out again.</p>
<p>“No big deal, we’ll definitely clear it this time! We just learned another little lesson,” Song Ren again gave them a motivational speech.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>At the same time, in Nebula Games’ break area.</p>
<p>Chen Xu, Qin Yi, Yang Xin, and Ruan Ningxue were playing World of Warcraft together, showing that after development was complete, the company could generally enjoy some leisure time.</p>
<p>But despite playing, everyone’s levels weren't high.</p>
<p>No one was serious about grinding levels or running dungeons for gear.</p>
<p>After all, as game developers, if their levels or gear were at the top, it would easily cause player suspicion if exposed.</p>
<p>And even if players didn't think much of it, other game developers probably wouldn't mind trying to smear them.</p>
<p>So Chen Xu and the others mainly just experienced the content.</p>
<p>They just needed to keep pace with the majority of players.</p>
<p>During the development of World of Warcraft, the massive project kept everyone working overtime day and night, all to release this great game as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Chen Xu had no plans for any major new projects for the immediate core team in the short term, so it was relatively relaxed.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, is this dungeon too difficult? I just checked the backend data, and only 13% of players have successfully cleared the dungeon based on account ratios,” Qin Yi asked Chen Xu through the voice channel while running through The Barrens in the game.</p>
<p>“It’s fine, dungeons aren’t the only way to play the game,” Chen Xu smiled, unconcerned, upon hearing Qin Yi’s words.</p>
<p>Was World of Warcraft’s dungeon difficulty high?</p>
<p>Very high. In its previous life, World of Warcraft had some extremely difficult dungeons, so much so that no one had ever achieved a first kill until the official difficulty was lowered.</p>
<p>Because World of Warcraft’s dungeons didn’t test individual heroism.</p>
<p>They tested teamwork.</p>
<p>Just like warfare.</p>
<p>Without disciplined soldiers and a strategic general, victory was impossible.</p>
<p>Basically, players attempting a dungeon for the first time, without consulting guides, would typically wipe out due to various elements.</p>
<p>But although the learning curve for dungeons was high, World of Warcraft, as an MMORPG, offered more than just dungeon gameplay.</p>
<p>At least for current players, it was. As its name suggested, it combined these various gameplays to create a world.</p>
<p>Class and race settings, talent specializations, as well as an economic system and worldview quests.</p>
<p>It could be said that World of Warcraft fully presented what Azeroth should look like.</p>
<p>Even without running dungeons, players could spend a long time being a Fisherman, miners and herbalists, exploring maps, and doing side quests.</p>
<p>Moreover, the transitional equipment provided by quests wouldn’t leave players unable to defeat monsters of their current level; of course, selling gear to learn skills or do other things was another matter.</p>
<p>Naturally, as levels increased, players would inevitably encounter dungeons.</p>
<p>Because some of the more exciting quests were linked to dungeons, brought to players through them.</p>
<p>But by then, players would generally have a sufficient understanding of World of Warcraft, and with hardcore players pioneering the content, ordinary players could tackle dungeons using the guides these pioneers summarized, which would greatly reduce the difficulty.</p>
