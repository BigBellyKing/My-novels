<p>Chapter 321: Ten Years Making Games, Nine Years Making CGI (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>The development progress of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was proceeding very smoothly.</p>
<p>Although this was the team's second large-scale VR game, </p>
<p>they had prior experience from Rainbow Six Siege, and thanks to the strategic cooperation with NetDragon, which also provided substantial technical support, </p>
<p>they didn't encounter any particularly difficult challenges.</p>
<p>The remaining issue was the art resources. Currently, Nebula Games had only developed Rainbow Six Siege, so the accumulated resources weren't extensive.</p>
<p>Moreover, the player experience between the two games was completely different.</p>
<p>All action systems, including shooting mechanics, were entirely incompatible.</p>
<p>After all, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare needed to deliver an intense, swift, and exhilarating fast-paced experience to players.</p>
<p>Regarding the vast amount of art resources, apart from the core designs, the rest could be fully outsourced to external developers.</p>
<p>For game development, content outsourcing—especially art resources—was a common practice, </p>
<p>as it could save the team a significant amount of time.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>While Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was quietly under development, </p>
<p>NetDragon was also making big moves. First, they announced the PC version of Rainbow Six Siege </p>
<p>and simultaneously planned to host related esports tournaments.</p>
<p>Chen Xu didn't get too involved in this, </p>
<p>since organizing competitions was something NetDragon had plenty of experience with, given their portfolio of competitive games.</p>
<p>Moreover, Nebula Games was primarily responsible for subsequent content operations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, information about Atrai's Storm Action continued to flow steadily into the domestic market through the Channel Alliance.</p>
<p>After all, it was a popular IP and Zeus's flagship title.</p>
<p>Clearly, Atrai had a well-thought-out plan.</p>
<p>Simultaneously with the announcement of the Storm Action game, </p>
<p>the film's production company also revealed news about a sequel to Storm Action.</p>
<p>It was evident they were aiming for a powerful collaboration to boost popularity.</p>
<p>The domestic Channel Alliance also placed high hopes on this blockbuster, especially since Nebula Games Platform's market share was continuously expanding.</p>
<p>An increasing number of third-party game developers were choosing to launch their games first on the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>Although the Channel Alliance had gradually reduced its revenue share, it made no difference.</p>
<p>Coupled with games like Warcraft, Minecraft, and Rainbow Six Siege continuously strengthening Nebula Games' player base, </p>
<p>they were now slowly eroding the alliance's influence.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Channel Alliance also held high expectations for the Storm Action blockbuster.</p>
<p>Besides offline showcases and press conferences, </p>
<p>more and more information about Storm Action was emerging.</p>
<p>First, the actors who played the lead roles in the film would participate in motion capture for the game, ensuring the characters remained true to the original.</p>
<p>Then came related gameplay details and materials, revealing scenes from the movie and Easter eggs.</p>
<p>This excited many fan players.</p>
<p>After all, several years had passed, and there were still many players who had seen Storm Action and missed it.</p>
<p>Now, with news of a new movie, the game adaptation, and those familiar scenes, </p>
<p>it instantly felt authentic to them.</p>
<p>"The fidelity is so high! And it even looks better than the movie!"</p>
<p>"Indeed, but I wonder which timeline and story phase it covers."</p>
<p>"I'm more interested in the gameplay!"</p>
<p>"No need to doubt that—Atrai still has the capability!"</p>
<p>"I wonder if they can recreate the epic-scale battles from the original film, especially the scene where the protagonist escapes the building, and then the entire building gets blown up—absolutely spectacular."</p>
<p>"I think there might be even bigger scenes?"</p>
<p>Players, seeing the information Storm Action released, expressed great anticipation.</p>
<p>After all, for such an adapted IP game, </p>
<p>the first impression for players was always about the quality of the graphics and how faithfully the game recreated the original work.</p>
<p>Atrai clearly understood this. Otherwise, there would be no need to spend so much money acquiring the license.</p>
<p>All the released materials were centered precisely on these points.</p>
<p>In an instant, it gave these fan players a powerful boost of confidence.</p>
<p>The gameplay might still be unclear, </p>
<p>but in terms of graphics and fidelity, expectations were already maxed out.</p>
<p>This was a very standard IP warm-up promotion.</p>
<p>However, just as Atrai and the domestic Channel Alliance were continuously promoting and building hype for Storm Action, </p>
<p>Chen Xu's official Weibo account was updated after a long hiatus.</p>
<p>The post featured a picture of a barren wasteland.</p>
<p>Heavy machine guns, shoulder-mounted rocket launchers... various weapons were displayed.</p>
<p>There were also group photos of staff members.</p>
<p>The caption was just a simple sentence:</p>
<p>"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare—a game that defines the theme of contemporary warfare—will launch on the Huanyu VR Platform!"</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>As soon as this Weibo post went live, players instantly exploded with excitement.</p>
<p>Because this post was a direct statement!</p>
<p>Mr. Chen had been quiet for a while—clearly, he was making another new game!</p>
<p>And it was a contemporary warfare-themed game.</p>
<p>Judging from the images, Mr. Chen's ambition this time was unprecedented!</p>
<p>Heavy machine guns, shoulder-mounted rocket launchers—did this mean the game would feature these real combat weapons?</p>
<p>Immediately, all players lost their composure.</p>
<p>"I lack culture, so all I can say is 'Damn it!'"</p>
<p>"As expected, Mr. Quick Shooter won't stay idle—he's planning something big!"</p>
<p>"The surprise came too fast, catching me off guard!"</p>
<p>"So he's going head-to-head with Atrai now!"</p>
<p>"A game that defines contemporary warfare? Mr. Chen is so bold—but I love it!"</p>
<p>"Judging from this momentum, is it almost finished developing!?"</p>
<p>Countless players were extremely excited and thrilled.</p>
<p>Even though they had no idea what the game looked like, and only a theme and title had been announced, </p>
<p>over the years, Nebula Games had accumulated enough popularity and reputation to make them eagerly anticipate it.</p>
<p>While countless online players were celebrating, Nebula Games was discussing with Qin Yi how to better showcase actions and VR chamber force feedback systems in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, </p>
<p>when Yang Chen from the Game Department called.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen? How's the development progress of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare? You must ensure the game's quality. Don't worry about tight deadlines—Zeus overseas is progressing at a similar pace to us, or possibly even slower. So Storm Action, which is supposed to support Zeus, isn't developing as quickly as imagined," Yang Chen said, clearly anxious.</p>
<p>Although Huanyu VR's supporting games weren't limited to just Nebula Games, </p>
<p>the initial impression given to players was also important.</p>
<p>Yang Chen was worried that Chen Xu might rush development to gain an early advantage over Atrai and capture attention, thus compromising the game's content.</p>
<p>Hearing Yang Chen's words, Chen Xu smiled knowingly. "Don't worry, Minister Yang. I would never joke with Nebula Games' reputation. The development of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is going very smoothly, and the quality is absolutely guaranteed. As for racing against them? We never even considered it."</p>
<p>After a few more exchanges with Yang Chen, Chen Xu hung up the phone and smiled.</p>
<p>Chen Xu naturally wouldn't neglect game content just to rush progress.</p>
<p>After all, as the old saying goes, no one remembers a garbage game released on schedule.</p>
<p>Whether it's released on time, delayed, or even reverse-delayed with an early launch, as long as the quality satisfies players, everything is fine.</p>
<p>Otherwise, no matter if you release on time, delay, or reverse-delay with an early launch, players will roast you so badly your own mother won't recognize you.</p>
<p>As for now? Let's just say it's being made, it's being made.</p>
<p>For Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, although the game's progress had only completed about one-sixth of the total, </p>
<p>the progress on CGI was like a heifer riding a rocket—lightning fast.</p>
<p>After all, in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Chen Xu chose to use CGI to mask most loading transitions to ensure outstanding visual effects.</p>
<p>Combined with the various operator CGs from Rainbow Six Siege and the CGs from Warcraft, </p>
<p>Chen Xu could confidently say that Nebula Games was absolutely professional in this area!</p>
<p>Ten years making games, nine years making CGI.</p>
<p>This was the previous online evaluation of Nebula Games, and Chen Xu was determined to live up to it.</p>
<p>Otherwise, how disappointed would the players be?</p>
<p>After all, he, Chen Xu, was a game developer who never lied and never disappointed players.</p>
