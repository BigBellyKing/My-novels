<h2>Chapter 65: Player Discussions</h2>
<p>The next day, an exclusive interview article featuring Chen Xu was already published on Game Timespace.</p>
<p><em>"Love in Transmission: Every Game is Filled with My Passion for Players"</em></p>
<p>This was the full title of the Game Timespace article.</p>
<p>Opening the article, the content was mostly what Chen Xu had discussed with Wu Tian.</p>
<p>Of course, certain parts and topics had been removed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some content had also been polished.</p>
<p>It mainly focused on the positive side—for example, difficulties encountered during game development, even moments when giving up seemed inevitable, but ultimately, the Team overcame the obstacles and delivered a perfect game brimming with passion to the players.</p>
<p>The artistic embellishment process was so convincing that, had Chen Xu not known it was mostly fabricated, he might have been moved to tears himself.</p>
<p>As a top-tier domestic gaming media outlet, Game Timespace held considerable influence among the player community.</p>
<p>At least in terms of traffic, that was certainly true.</p>
<p>After this exclusive interview was released, player comments flooded in almost instantly.</p>
<p>'No wonder Chen Xu calls himself a Warrior of Love—so that's where it comes from!'</p>
<p>'Wait, why do I get the feeling this is all just hype?'</p>
<p>'+1, I feel like the editor who conducted this interview got completely swindled by Chen Xu.'</p>
<p>'If I only look at <em>Undertale</em> and <em>To the Moon</em>, the title Warrior of Love fits perfectly. But <em>Outlast</em>… 233333!'</p>
<p>'I still think Chen Xu’s entire explanation for <em>Outlast</em> was pure nonsense meant to fool us!'</p>
<p>'The thing is, the nonsense actually sounds kind of reasonable!'</p>
<p>'Let’s not just argue whether Chen Xu is a fraud or not—aren’t you guys curious about the new game mentioned in the article?'</p>
<p>'Yeah, Chen Xu’s new game is called <em>Overcooked</em>. Is it actually a cooking game?'</p>
<p>'How would anyone know? With just a title, who can guess what it’s really about? Like <em>Mirror (Game)</em>—just from the name, could you ever imagine how explosive the content would be?'</p>
<p>'Let’s not even talk about it. I hereby declare it the ultimate Gentleman's Game—still unmatched to this day. Played it too much; now I’m basically broken.'</p>
<p>'Sigh, what can you do? Chen Xu’s path in gaming just keeps getting smoother and smoother.'</p>
<p>The article’s release brought more players awareness of Chen Xu, but otherwise didn’t cause much of a stir.</p>
<p>Although <em>Overcooked</em> was mentioned, there wasn’t much actual information beyond the game’s title.</p>
<p>And Chen Xu wasn’t yet a major figure—certainly not at the level where players would become desperate to play his games and uncover every last detail just from hearing his name.</p>
<p>With the New Year approaching, game developers of all sizes were also launching their own promotional campaigns.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, aside from Chen Xu’s hardcore fans, most random players didn’t pay much attention to <em>Overcooked</em>.</p>
<p>Chen Xu, however, didn’t mind much.</p>
<p>After all, <em>Overcooked</em> hadn’t even officially started promotion yet.</p>
<p>In terms of production cost, <em>Overcooked</em> was only one-third the cost of the previous <em>Outlast</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, this excluded server and related infrastructure expenses, which weren’t solely dedicated to <em>Overcooked</em>.</p>
<p>They also served the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>For Chen Xu, two months of development time—viewed from a mature perspective—meant the game’s core strengths and flaws were already crystal clear.</p>
<p>As a result, development progress was incredibly fast.</p>
<p>Compared to the earlier primitive version, which had only one or two themes and relied heavily on free engine materials, the current <em>Overcooked</em> was now extremely polished and complete.</p>
<p>Moreover, unlike before, this time Chen Xu had specifically shot a promotional video for <em>Overcooked</em>.</p>
<p>Instead of relying solely on his official Weibo account for promotion as he had previously.</p>
<p>After all, <em>Overcooked</em> represented the true debut of the Nebula Games Platform into the player market.</p>
<p>Its significance was entirely different.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>Time moved forward. On Chinese New Year's Eve, across the country, the annual spectacle known as the Spring Festival travel rush began.</p>
<p>At Nebula Games, the annual holiday had also begun.</p>
<p>Still, some employees chose to stay behind.</p>
<p>After all, <em>Overcooked</em> was scheduled to launch on the third day of the Lunar New Year, and with the Nebula Games Platform and its community operations involved, someone needed to remain on-site to handle any potential emergencies.</p>
<p>Of course, Chen Xu was generous with overtime pay—showing no hesitation in rewarding those who stayed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on various gaming forums and online communities, players were discussing the new games released during the Spring Festival.</p>
<p>'There doesn’t seem to be any good games launching this New Year!'</p>
<p>'Yeah, I checked—nothing particularly interesting.'</p>
<p>'TengHua Games’ new work <em>Age of Gods</em> seems pretty good.'</p>
<p>'Yeah, and NetDragon’s blockbuster <em>Demon God</em> is highly anticipated!'</p>
<p>'Sure, they’re exciting, but both are VR blockbusters. In my small fourth-tier county town, the VR experience store won’t be open during the holidays.'</p>
<p>'Don’t entertainment venues usually stay open during the holidays?'</p>
<p>'Well, mine isn’t. What can I do?'</p>
<p>'VR blockbusters are only fun if you have plenty of time. During the holidays, I barely have time to play. I’ll just look for PC games instead.'</p>
<p>'There are quite a few games being released on PC too.'</p>
<p>'Check Chen Xu’s official Weibo! He’s got a new game, and it’s apparently a couple's game!'</p>
<p>'I saw it—looks so heartwarming! Perfect to play with my girlfriend. Is Chen Xu finally living up to the Warrior of Love title?'</p>
<p>'<em>Overcooked</em>? So it really is a cooking game? Cooking with my girlfriend?'</p>
<p>'A couple's game? You’re telling me about couple's games when I’m a Single person?'</p>
<p>'Bro upstairs, even Single people have dreams. Besides, this game doesn’t necessarily require a girlfriend—you can play it with a bro too!'</p>
<p>'Exactly! Plus, the Nebula Games Platform is offering a New Year special—buy one, get one free!'</p>
<p>During the Spring Festival, game developers launched their titles with full force.</p>
<p>The most eye-catching releases, naturally, were the two blockbusters from TengHua and NetDragon.</p>
<p>Both were domestic gaming giants and long-time rivals, competing not only in games but also in distribution platforms.</p>
<p>Their simultaneous releases during the holiday season naturally drew massive attention.</p>
<p>However, both companies had focused on VR blockbusters this year, leaving the PC market largely untouched.</p>
<p>On the PC front, however, the release of <em>Overcooked</em>’s promotional video—on major gaming media sites and Chen Xu’s official Weibo—began attracting significant player attention.</p>
<p>I’m short~ [I’ve done the complaining for you]</p>
