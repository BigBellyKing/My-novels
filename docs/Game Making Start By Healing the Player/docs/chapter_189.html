<p>Chapter 188: Death Mode! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>While <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em> was achieving global sales success, the number of players clearing the game continued to rise.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous installment, this game's map design was undoubtedly more malicious.</p>
<p>But there was no denying that once guides became available, rookies actually had a much better experience than in the previous game.</p>
<p>Take the first boss players faced—the Asylum Demon.</p>
<p>In the previous game, Gundyr the Ash had virtually no cheese strategies.</p>
<p>Even if players chose ranged attackers like the Pyromancer or Mage who could create distance, they still had to be cautious.</p>
<p>After all, Gundyr the Ash possessed the ability to rapidly close the gap.</p>
<p>And the Black Firebomb—each player’s starting burial gift—could only deplete Gundyr’s health to his second phase, not instantly kill him.</p>
<p>But <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em> was different.</p>
<p>A single Plunging Attack at the start could halve the Asylum Demon’s health.</p>
<p>If players also had the Black Firebomb, a few extra swings would end the fight.</p>
<p>Moreover, unlike the previous game where increasing Estus Flask count was extremely difficult and required grinding for Estus Flask Shards, in <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em>, players could kindle humanity at bonfires to increase their Estus Flask count from the initial 5 to 10.</p>
<p>Though each bonfire was independent, humanity wasn’t too hard to grind.</p>
<p>After defeating the Three-Sticker Family in the Catacombs and learning the Fire-kindling technique, players could even increase their flask count to 20, significantly improving the player experience.</p>
<p>Combined with veteran players’ guides on obtaining powerful weapons like the Gravelord Sword and Guandao early on, players could access these high-damage weapons from the start.</p>
<p>While it was still easy to die to monsters and bosses if careless, compared to the old days of taking two hits to die while needing twenty hits to kill a monster, wielding these weapons in the first playthrough was pure delight.</p>
<p>For players who had suffered miserably due to the game’s malicious map design, these changes clearly brought them great satisfaction.</p>
<p>After all, this was <em>Dark Souls</em>!</p>
<p>Now they could actually experience killing a boss in just ten swings—what a sensation!</p>
<p>It was precisely because of these guides and the availability of very powerful weapons early on that many players who hadn’t persevered in the original <em>Dark Souls</em> now found the strength to endure even the more malicious setting of this prequel.</p>
<p>In a residential complex in the Imperial Capital, Song Ren, Zhang Yi, and Wang Han were having a gathering, joined by Wang Yifan and Joey, who had recently returned from a business trip and were recovering from injuries.</p>
<p>"See this? To get the Gravelord Sword, roll down here and run straight in. Be careful with the Wedge Demon—it requires two rolls. Grab the item and hide inside a coffin. You’ll need a bit of luck to avoid being spotted. Enter, sign a covenant with the Gravelord to obtain the Gravelord Sword, then use a Bone Shard to return to Firelink Shrine. OK, now things get simple."</p>
<p>Seated, Song Ren demonstrated the early-game guide to Wang Yifan and Joey.</p>
<p>Though nearly two weeks had passed since the game’s launch, the two had been too busy to keep up.</p>
<p>Watching Song Ren’s operations, they couldn’t help but praise: "Brother Song, you’re amazing!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, your positioning is so smooth!"</p>
<p>Zhang Yi grumbled inwardly: "Oh, come on. He’s practiced this on countless new save files. The First Playthrough Maniac never does second or third playthroughs—how could he not be familiar?"</p>
<p>"I call it accumulating strength for a burst. Besides, the map and bosses don’t change in second or third playthroughs. Once I’ve mastered everything, high New Game+ will be easy," Song Ren lightly coughed twice, defending his actions.</p>
<p>"Plus, my first playthrough is so much fun—sometimes I play agility, sometimes strength, sometimes even dabble with the Mage."</p>
<p>Repeatedly challenging the first playthrough, first securing the Gravelord Sword, then launching into a Musou performance—that was his style.</p>
<p>And with so many playstyles available, the game wasn’t limited to just one approach.</p>
<p>He had tried the second playthrough briefly. Though weapon reinforcement made fighting monsters easier, enemy damage spiked dramatically.</p>
<p>Especially the Mad Dog creature—two of them attacking at once nearly killed him.</p>
<p>Simply put, the second playthrough gave him that familiar feeling again, that authentic 'Souls-like flavor'.</p>
<p>"Hey! The game just updated!? And it’s a big one!" After finishing the Gravelord Sword demonstration, Song Ren was about to exit the game and launch <em>Fall Guys</em>—an excellent party game—for everyone to enjoy, when he suddenly noticed something unexpected.</p>
<p><em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em> had actually updated, and the patch was massive.</p>
<p>If this were a purely online game, such a large update wouldn’t surprise him much.</p>
<p>But <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em> was a single-player game!</p>
<p>Why had it suddenly updated, and so significantly?</p>
<p>"What’s going on? An update?" Hearing Song Ren, Zhang Yi and Wang Han were taken aback and walked over to look at his computer screen.</p>
<p>Curious, Song Ren opened the update version announcement in the <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em> store interface on Nebula Games.</p>
<p>'New Gameplay Mode "Death Mode" for <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em> has newly launched, offering Undead everywhere a brand-new challenge.'</p>
<p>'The long-lost sword dance and heart-pounding sensation will return in Death Mode.'</p>
<p>'Have you regretted never crossing swords with legendary figures like the full-power Sun King Gwyn, Artorias, or the Witch?'</p>
<p>'Have you wondered what combat power Giant Yhorm would possess if he hadn’t gone mad?'</p>
<p>'The全新 Death Mode will fulfill every kindler’s regrets. Details of this update are as follows...'</p>
<p>After reading the entire update list, Song Ren, Zhang Yi, and the others roughly understood what Death Mode was.</p>
<p>This new Death Mode was essentially a unique gameplay mode, similar to the previous game’s random mode, added for players to experience.</p>
<p>What was surprising, however, was that the original <em>Dark Souls</em> also received this mode, while the new game simultaneously launched a more entertainment-oriented random mode.</p>
<p>Death Mode, on the other hand, was a gameplay style resembling an arena.</p>
<p>It allowed players to freely challenge specific bosses from <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>Upon defeating these bosses, players would receive special item rewards.</p>
<p>Additionally, a dedicated leaderboard would record players’ ranking achievements.</p>
<p>Players could choose solo or multiplayer team-up, supporting up to three players per team.</p>
<p>According to the description, the bosses in this mode would utilize Nebula Games’ latest Game AI Performance Technology.</p>
<p>Their health and Poise stats would also be enhanced.</p>
<p>In team mode, monster health would scale proportionally with player count.</p>
<p>However, unlike the random mode, which required creating an entirely new save file, Death Mode required players to use their existing save.</p>
<p>Of course, Death Mode required always online connectivity, and weapons and stats would undergo some stat adjustments.</p>
<p>Compared to higher-level characters with heavily reinforced weapons, characters who had just cleared their first playthrough wouldn’t be at too much of a disadvantage.</p>
<p>In short, skill mattered more than just raw stats.</p>
<p>Moreover, unlike the random mode’s focus on pure entertainment, Death Mode introduced a ranking system, making it far more appealing to many players.</p>
<p>The first kill list and fastest completion records for each boss, along with corresponding IDs, would be displayed in a corner of Firelink Shrine for all future players to see.</p>
<p>The entrance to Death Mode was located right there as well.</p>
