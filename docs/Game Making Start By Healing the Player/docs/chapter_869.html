                <p>Chapter 868: This Game Is So Easy!</p>
<p>"This is awesome!"</p>
<p>Watching the cutscene before him, Song Ren couldn't help but sigh with emotion.</p>
<p>He had already watched this particular cutscene countless times over the past few days.</p>
<p>Yet experiencing it in VR mode felt slightly different, especially since it featured classic IP characters he was so familiar with.</p>
<p>He didn't skip it. Only after seeing Kirby gaze upon a collapsed world and the Super Smash Bros. logo appear did Song Ren officially enter the game.</p>
<p>Amidst the stirring background audio, several options appeared before him.</p>
<p>The entrance to Smash Battles against AI; the single-player story mode, Spirit 'World of Light'; and the multiplayer mode for online player-versus-player content.</p>
<p>Additionally, there was a training mode for players to practice gameplay, as well as unique victory conditions specific to each Fighter.</p>
<p>What surprised Song Ren the most, however, was the ability in Smash Bros. to customize a personal Fighter—just like in Super Mario Maker—by using character customization to create a unique avatar.</p>
<p>Still, Song Ren didn't choose to create a custom Fighter.</p>
<p>After all, the game was called <em>Super Smash Bros.</em></p>
<p>With so many beloved IP characters available, why would anyone bother making a custom one?</p>
<p>At the very least, he'd wait until he'd grown tired of all the existing characters before even considering it.</p>
<p>"Let me try a quick AI match first. I'll use Cloud as my first Fighter."</p>
<p>Contentedly, Song Ren opened Smash Bros., ready to test the waters.</p>
<p>Though he wasn't entirely sure yet which Fighters were in the game,</p>
<p>one thing was certain: Cloud had to be in it. After all, he'd appeared in the promotional CG animation.</p>
<p>And why choose Cloud?</p>
<p>Well, wasn't he just incredibly handsome? Plus, he looked a lot like Song Ren—giving him a strong sense of immersion.</p>
<p>"Huh? Can't I just pick him directly? Do I have to unlock them one by one?"</p>
<p>After selecting the standard Smash option and creating a room with default rules, the display made Song Ren taken aback.</p>
<p>Instead of being presented with a massive roster of Fighters to choose from,</p>
<p>he only had eight available.</p>
<p>They were Mario, Donkey Kong, Link, Yoshi, Kirby, Bowser, and two characters from Switch platform games included in the premium membership: Fox McCloud from Star Fox, and Samus Aran from Metroid.</p>
<p>Unlike regular fighting games, Smash Bros. only offered a few initial characters at the start—players had to choose one to begin with.</p>
<p>The remaining characters would be unlocked gradually as players progressed through the game.</p>
<p>The single-player story, World of Light, used a different unlocking system—players controlled Kirby, exploring levels and rescuing Fighters trapped in various locations.</p>
<p>This design helped players become familiar with the game and understand how to use different Fighters.</p>
<p>It also gave players a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>For many new players, such a system was essential.</p>
<p>The available characters ranged from easier ones like Kirby, Bowser, and Donkey Kong, to more complex ones like Link, Fox, and Samus.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the game included some RPG elements. After each battle, players earned gold coins.</p>
<p>These coins could be spent in the in-game store to buy randomly refreshed clothing, additional music tracks, Spirits, and snacks for training Spirits.</p>
<p>Unlocking new Fighters and purchasing collectibles with coins helped redirect the frustration players might feel after losing—after all, Smash Bros. was still a competitive action game.</p>
<p>But as a player, Song Ren didn't need to overthink these design choices.</p>
<p>Though he was disappointed he couldn't use Cloud for his first match, he still approached the game with anticipation.</p>
<p>Looking at the eight available Fighters, Song Ren paused, then selected Kirby as his character.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Wasn't it obvious?</p>
<p>In the game's CGI, Kirby was the central protagonist.</p>
<p>Samus was certainly attractive, but Kirby was strong!</p>
<p>Otherwise, why would he be the one chosen to save the world?</p>
<p>Besides, this pink demon was incredibly powerful—able to swallow anything and copy their abilities.</p>
<p>After confirming his choice of Kirby, Song Ren faced nine difficulty levels of AI opponents.</p>
<p>Without the slightest hesitation, he confidently selected the easiest: Level 1 AI.</p>
<p>"Even a towering building starts from the ground." As someone who struggled with fighting games, he still had self-awareness.</p>
<p>"This map... the details are absolutely packed!"</p>
<p>His opponent was Link, and the stage was the Great Plateau from Breath of the Wild.</p>
<p>The VR perspective, compared to traditional first-person or third-person views, felt a bit odd with its scroll-style map.</p>
<p>Yet the map's details were incredibly rich.</p>
<p>In the game, maps were divided into three modes: Normal Mode, Battlefield, and Final Destination.</p>
<p>In Normal Mode, the map would change naturally during gameplay, and random events could occur mid-battle.</p>
<p>Simply put, Normal Mode introduced many variables—the stage hazards could drastically affect the outcome of a match.</p>
<p>Battlefield Mode featured a fixed layout with platforms to stand on, making it a more standard competitive map.</p>
<p>Final Destination had no platforms at all. Players didn't need to worry about platform positioning, making fights more intense and action-packed, though platform movement techniques became irrelevant.</p>
<p>Song Ren had chosen Items + Normal Mode.</p>
<p>The dust kicked up by the Fighters' movements, and the swaying of plants and animals in the wind, were all rendered with excellent dynamic feedback.</p>
<p>Moreover, the in-game camera wasn't fixed.</p>
<p>It dynamically zoomed in and out based on character movement—perfectly executed.</p>
<p>If judging purely by graphics, Song Ren—who had played top-tier blockbusters like <em>The Elder Scrolls</em> and <em>Uncharted</em>—could only say that Smash Bros. wasn't mind-blowingly impressive.</p>
<p>Yet it was undeniably rich, with every detail meticulously crafted.</p>
<p>Especially the recreation of character actions—truly unmatched.</p>
<p>As for Kirby, Song Ren had only cleared the Switch version of <em>Kirby's Dream Land</em> without delving deeper.</p>
<p>But he was extremely familiar with <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>. As one of Hyrule's Old Rogues, he'd poured hundreds of hours into it.</p>
<p>The computer-controlled Link—whether drawing his sword, charging attacks, shooting arrows, or throwing bombs—was almost perfectly recreated.</p>
<p>What excited Song Ren even more, though, was the gameplay feel.</p>
<p>"Just as I thought—Kirby is so strong!"</p>
<p>In the game, Song Ren was absolutely dominating Link.</p>
<p>He felt an indescribable thrill. Of course, he subconsciously ignored the fact that he was fighting a computer-controlled opponent—and the easiest one at that.</p>
<p>These lowest-tier AI opponents weren't like typical AI that couldn't defend, attack, or dodge.</p>
<p>Because that kind of AI was no different from a training dummy.</p>
<p>Chen Xu, a designer who deeply understood player psychology, knew well that such lifeless AI wouldn't bring players much joy. Thus, the game's AI had been carefully modified.</p>
<p>This was true not only for higher difficulties, but for lower ones as well.</p>
<p>Though it was only Level 1 AI, it was surprisingly competent—even capable of reading player inputs.</p>
<p>Much like the lion boss in <em>Elden Ring</em> from his previous life: if the player shot arrows at it, the lion would sway side to side. If you shot directly, you'd never hit. You had to predict its movement.</p>
<p>A clearer example was Psycho Mantis from <em>Metal Gear</em>—a boss who could read the player's controller inputs via the 1P port and dodge attacks. Only by switching to the 2P controller could the player finally defeat him, as Psycho Mantis would then be unable to read inputs and become a sitting duck.</p>
<p>The low-level AI in Smash Bros. gave players the feeling that every move they made was effective—"every hit lands."</p>
<p>With such careful design, first-time players like Song Ren could only feel one thing: satisfaction!</p>
<p>Controlling Kirby and relentlessly attacking the AI-controlled Link—even with just basic attacks—</p>
<p>the combo attacks' visual effects and the gaming pod's vibration feedback left him with a single overwhelming sensation: <strong>satisfaction</strong>!</p>
<p>Charged strikes, Side Special, up special, and the dazzling finishing move after building up energy.</p>
<p>Song Ren had never felt such exhilaration playing a fighting game before.</p>
<p>Especially with Smash Bros.' streamlined controls—no need to input complex commands.</p>
<p>In most fighting games, he could barely execute even basic skills, let alone special moves.</p>
<p>His only option was usually just basic attacks.</p>
<p>"This game really feels so simple!"</p>
