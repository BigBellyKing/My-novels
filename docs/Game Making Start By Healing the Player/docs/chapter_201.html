                <h2>Chapter 200: Life is Getting Better (Sixth update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</h2>
<p>Entering the second day’s daylight, Wang Han used the available materials to craft an axe and a pickaxe, then began searching for materials to make a bonfire and torches.</p>
<p>By this first night, she had more or less figured out some of the game's settings.</p>
<p>Having a bonfire or torches during the night meant safety.</p>
<p>However, the atmosphere was rather uncomfortable—vision was narrow, and the background audio felt eerie.</p>
<p>Without torches, the glowing-eyed monsters she’d seen at night could become life-threatening.</p>
<p>Therefore, for safety, gathering more materials to craft torches was a better idea.</p>
<p>Anyway, the most reliable approach was to quickly collect resources and arm herself as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The large forest nearby had turned into blackened, charred branches due to her earlier fire-setting.</p>
<p>Chopping them down with her axe yielded some charcoal, a collectible material—though she wasn’t sure what it was used for.</p>
<p>Glancing at the materials in her inventory, Wang Han suddenly realized she now had enough to craft a Science Machine.</p>
<p>Returning to the spot where she’d lit the bonfire the previous night, Wang Han chose to build.</p>
<p>Soon, a green, windmill-like machine was hand-crafted by Wilson in the game.</p>
<p>With the Science Machine now in place, Wang Han discovered several new functions had been Unlocked.</p>
<p>Such as Magic (attack type), Equipment, and crafting recipes like planks.</p>
<p>"So many resources needed!" Wang Han stared at the dazzling list of items, feeling slightly overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Besides the axe and pickaxe, she couldn’t currently craft a single thing.</p>
<p>Moreover, many of the required materials were ones she’d never even seen—such as manure and spider silk.</p>
<p>"Never mind, I should quickly find something to eat first." Looking at the resources in her inventory, Wang Han decided to temporarily ignore the machine and focus on gathering supplies to survive today and tonight.</p>
<p>Previously, she’d been surviving on Berries, but she now had very few left.</p>
<p>Her hunger value was still over half, but she had no Berries remaining.</p>
<p>Even more crucially, last night she had performed an All-in Push of setting the forest on fire, directly igniting many trees and Berry Bushes.</p>
<p>And she hadn’t harvested the Berries beforehand—so now, she had no Berries to eat at all.</p>
<p>Opening the map, Wang Han randomly picked a direction and began Search &amp; Destroy.</p>
<p>Along the way, she chopped trees, collected stones, did some Mining, and dug up carrots—her inventory quickly filling up.</p>
<p>As evening approached, just as Wang Han was about to return to the Science Machine to see what she could craft with her current materials, a wild boar’s howl rang out in her ears, followed by a strange roar.</p>
<p>Curious, she followed the sound and witnessed a surprising scene.</p>
<p>A group of Walked Upright Pigmen were fiercely fighting a group of green Murlocs, shouting at the top of their lungs while battling.</p>
<p>‘Ah! Ah!’</p>
<p>‘Ah! Ah!’</p>
<p>‘Pigmen shall now unleash carnage!’</p>
<p>‘Woltergroot!’</p>
<p>‘Gulu-pu! Klang-pi-ge-lapu!’</p>
<p>‘Ah! Ah!’</p>
<p>The Pigmen’s speech was understandable, but the Murlocs’ words were completely unintelligible.</p>
<p>The two groups seemed to have arranged a fight, with about eight or nine members each, wildly swinging their fists.</p>
<p>Looking at their towering figures, then at Wilson’s scrawny limbs, Wang Han decided it was best not to get involved.</p>
<p>However, just as she was about to leave, she suddenly spotted something exciting.</p>
<p>As the two groups clashed, the defeated monsters actually began to drop meat.</p>
<p>"Meat dropped! I can finally improve my diet!" Seeing the meat on the ground, Wang Han’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Up until now, her in-game diet had been almost entirely vegetarian—Berries, carrots, flower petals, and some mushrooms.</p>
<p>Petal consumption seemed to increase her health value, while certain mushrooms actually decreased it—she didn’t know why.</p>
<p>Her main food source remained Berries.</p>
<p>She had tried hunting rabbits for meat before, but they were far too fast—she couldn’t catch up at all.</p>
<p>Now, she actually saw fresh meat lying on the ground.</p>
<p>While the two monster factions fought, Wang Han sneaked over and stole a piece of meat from the ground.</p>
<p>But she accidentally attracted a Murloc’s Aggro and quickly fled in fright.</p>
<p>Luckily, the Murloc was incredibly dumb—unlike earlier bees and other monsters.</p>
<p>Before attacking, it actually paused—so as long as she ran without looking back, she didn’t have to worry about getting hit.</p>
<p>Once the Murloc’s Aggro faded, Wang Han sneaked back, waited for the fight to end, and then collected all the dropped fish and meat from the ground.</p>
<p>"This life… these little days… are getting better and better! I actually have meat to eat now!"</p>
<p>After cleaning up the Battlefield, night fell quickly. With a long way back home, Wang Han decided not to move and instead built a bonfire right where she stood, planning to spend the night here.</p>
<p>This time, she didn’t set the forest on fire—she realized these trees would eventually be her own property.</p>
<p>If she burned them all now, later she’d have to run far just to gather wood.</p>
<p>Also, being too far from a bonfire caused her Sanity to decrease. Though she didn’t know what negative effects low Sanity would bring, Wang Han decided it was best not to wander recklessly.</p>
<p>She found gaining Sanity quite difficult—so far, only picking flowers increased it, and by very little.</p>
<p>Unlike hunger, which could be easily satisfied by eating almost anything.</p>
<p>After successfully surviving the second night, Wang Han returned to her base, looking at her collection of materials and feeling suddenly wealthy.</p>
<p>"This game is actually pretty interesting!"</p>
<p>Checking the required materials, Wang Han crafted two more axes and pickaxes, resuming her new journey as a lumberjack and miner, while continuing to explore new areas of the map.</p>
<p>As she explored further, Wang Han discovered some intriguing locations.</p>
<p>In certain map regions, a Wormhole appeared.</p>
<p>When the player approached and jumped into the Wormhole, they could teleport to another area of the map.</p>
<p>After jumping through, she spotted a creature called a Tallbird.</p>
<p>Besides its height, Wang Han couldn’t see how this big-eyed creature resembled a bird.</p>
<p>But the large, white egg beside it caught her attention—it looked delicious.</p>
<p>As Wang Han continued exploring the game, time quickly reached the seventh day.</p>
<p>During this period, she discovered several small tricks—for example, she found that food in the game could actually be cooked.</p>
<p>Simply dragging it from the inventory into the bonfire was enough.</p>
<p>This discovery amazed her.</p>
<p>She had never thought of such an operation before.</p>
<p>"Hmm, collect a bit more resources, craft a Grass Suit and spear, then I can start exploring the outside world." Wang Han reviewed her inventory and summarized her progress.</p>
<p>Although she had already spent seven days in the game and was entering the eighth, she had been somewhat careless during this time, not gathering many materials.</p>
<p>Sometimes she wandered outside for an entire day.</p>
<p>Now, she felt she had a decent grasp of the general gameplay and it was time to open a new chapter.</p>
