<h2>Chapter 747 Simply a Master of Digging Holes!</h2>
<p>Listening to Kratos’s words to Atreus, Zhang Yi couldn’t help but take a deep breath, his heart filled with emotion.</p>
<p>Having played the earlier Greek trilogy, Zhang Yi clearly understood the meaning behind Kratos’s words.</p>
<p>For Kratos, his life had been nothing but tragedy.</p>
<p>From the moment of his birth, his fate seemed already sealed.</p>
<p>Prophecies, being used as a pawn by the gods, manipulated by Gaia and Athena—</p>
<p>Kratos had always played the role of a Tool-man.</p>
<p>But Atreus was different. As a completely new god, Atreus had Kratos himself protecting him from behind.</p>
<p>He didn’t need to retrace Kratos’s old steps. What kind of god he would become depended entirely on Atreus himself.</p>
<p>This journey of Adventure wasn’t just about Atreus’s growth—it was also Kratos’s growth.</p>
<p>There was no epic, blood-pumping story like in the Greek trilogy, yet the father-and-son journey to the peak of the Nine Realms was unforgettable.</p>
<p>Of course, aside from that, one thing that stirred a sense of sorrow and unease in Zhang Yi was the character of Freya.</p>
<p>Actually, Zhang Yi quite liked Freya—not just because of her appealing Modeling.</p>
<p>Mainly because, in the game, Freya wasn’t someone you disliked. Though her pathological maternal love was hard to agree with, throughout the game she helped Atreus and Kratos immensely: the Black Breath, curing Atreus’s illness, and even the revival of Mimir’s head…</p>
<p>One could even say that without Freya, Kratos and Atreus would never have completed this journey.</p>
<p>But now, it seemed that Freya would turn dark and become an enemy?</p>
<p>Thinking of Freya, who had just left holding Baldur’s corpse, Zhang Yi’s mind was speculating wildly about the subsequent work.</p>
<p>After all, Freya wasn’t a simple character. Though now she merely watered flowers and raised them like livestock in the forest, her divine power—shown when she stopped the battle between Kratos and Baldur—was clearly explosive. It was only due to Odin’s curse that she couldn’t unleash her true strength. Yet, from previous lines (dialogue) and exchanges, it was clear Freya had once been the leader of the Valkyrie legion.</p>
<p>After bidding farewell to Freya, the rest of the journey proceeded smoothly. Forget about boss battles—there weren’t even any mob elite encounters.</p>
<p>Using the World Tree realm teleport, then having Mimir’s head open the Conduit to Jötunheim, Kratos and Atreus ascended the light staircase to Jötunheim.</p>
<p>Nothing dramatic, not even a single mob. Through the realm teleport, using Mimir’s head to open the Conduit to Jötunheim, ascending the light staircase to Jötunheim.</p>
<p>At the mountainside, resting on a giant’s finger, Kratos gazed at the distant sun, slowly unwrapping the bandages from his arm.</p>
<p>Beneath them were the permanent marks left by the Blades of Chaos, impossible to erase.</p>
<p>Once, he didn’t want Atreus to know. But now, there was nothing left to hide.</p>
<p>Kratos looked at Atreus beside him, carefully removing Laufey’s Ashes from his waist and handing them over.</p>
<p>Now, he fully acknowledged Atreus’s abilities.</p>
<p>Moving steadily toward the summit, they passed through a temple filled entirely with giant statues—or petrified giants.</p>
<p>But just as Kratos and Atreus prepared to continue upward, Atreus accidentally touched the wall. At that moment, a shocking scene unfolded.</p>
<p>The sand and stone on the wall fell away, revealing—behind it—a mural.</p>
<p>And the content of the mural? It was the entire adventure journey of Kratos and Atreus, vividly depicted.</p>
<p>It was already carved out—this was a prophecy!</p>
<p>Or more precisely, a prophecy specifically about Atreus.</p>
<p>Everything matched up perfectly.</p>
<p>Baldur hadn’t originally come searching for Kratos—he had come for Laufey.</p>
<p>But by then, Laufey had already turned to Ashes. Combined with Kratos’s messy negative history and his status as an outsider, Kratos naturally assumed Baldur was after him.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Kratos who had kept secrets—Laufey had too.</p>
<p>And what troubled Zhang Yi even more was the final mural that Atreus didn’t see.</p>
<p>In that mural, Kratos’s corpse lay in Atreus’s arms, and the grieving Atreus spat out a massive serpent from his mouth.</p>
<p>Kratos, is going to die again!?</p>
<p>Zhang Yi’s mind was filled with confusion.</p>
<p>But in the game, Kratos simply stared silently, then turned and walked away.</p>
<p>At the peak of the highest mountain in the Nine Realms, Atreus took out his mother’s Ashes and handed them to Kratos.</p>
<p>Together, father and son scattered the Ashes into the air.</p>
<p>Their faces showed complex emotions. Tears welled in Atreus’s eyes, and faint reflections shimmered in Kratos’s.</p>
<p>Indeed, they had endured so much to reach this moment.</p>
<p>Along this journey, Kratos had been striving to teach his son how to become a god, while Atreus had been teaching Kratos how to be a human.</p>
<p>‘Goodbye, Faye.’</p>
<p>With Kratos’s farewell and the subsequent appearance of subtitles,</p>
<p>it was clear this chapter of Atreus and Kratos’s adventure had ended.</p>
<p>In terms of story, after this conclusive scene, he knew it was truly over.</p>
<p>But for Zhang Yi, his focus wasn’t on the conclusive scene at all.</p>
<p>Instead, it was entirely on the exploits dug by the game.</p>
<p>Besides the mural predicting Atreus’s future and the one hinting at Kratos’s potential death, the moment the two left revealed an even more monumental revelation:</p>
<p>The name ‘Atreus’ was given by Kratos, in memory of a Spartan comrade.</p>
<p>But Atreus’s mother had given him another name: Loki.</p>
<p>Though not deeply familiar with Norse mythology, Zhang Yi still understood some basics.</p>
<p>For instance, the World Serpent and Fenrir the Wolf were both sons of Loki. Combined with the earlier image of Kratos collapsing in Atreus’s arms, and Atreus vomiting out a serpent—it was enough to make one speculate wildly.</p>
<p>Additionally, there was the giant serpent seen earlier at Lake of the Nine, and Tyr—both seemed to be hinting at something. Perhaps the serpent had come from the Future Era?</p>
<p>That would explain why, in the game, the World Serpent was so friendly toward Kratos and Atreus.</p>
<p>Filled with endless confusion, Zhang Yi exited the game, his mind still swirling with the story. After all, the number of exploits was simply overwhelming.</p>
<p>First, Kratos’s wife—Laufey.</p>
<p>This character who never appeared—was she good or evil?</p>
<p>Why, knowing the prophecy, did she not directly tell Kratos? Why not reveal her identity as a Giantess to him?</p>
<p>Why did she make them scatter her Ashes from the highest peak of the Nine Realms after her death?</p>
<p>And combining Kratos’s tree-chopping with Baldur’s sudden arrival—everything now connected.</p>
<p>The golden handprint on the tree Kratos chopped, and Baldur showing up right after—before that, Atreus and Kratos had lived in peace. Was this all calculated?</p>
<p>Odin sent Baldur to hunt the Giant race, aiming to prevent Ragnarök. Yet, because Kratos and Atreus used mistletoe to kill Baldur, they unintentionally triggered the conditions for Ragnarök ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>Add to that the mural of ascending the highest peak of the Nine Realms—everything was a foreknown prophecy. One mural even showed Laufey arguing with other Giants.</p>
<p>If all of this was pre-planned—from Laufey marrying Kratos, to giving birth to Atreus—could it all have been calculated in advance?</p>
<p>Prophecy, fate, the destruction of the gods—this mirrored Kratos’s experience in Greek mythology. Only this time, the one foretold was Atreus.</p>
<p>In an instant, Zhang Yi felt his brain was about to overload. This was simply a master of digging holes!</p>
<p>And worse—only digging, never filling them!</p>
<p>Though the game’s story continued, the credits had already appeared. For players who had experienced games before, this was naturally familiar—it meant the main quest had ended.</p>
<p>One could still explore the Nine Realms, but clearly, Kratos’s adventure had reached a temporary pause.</p>
