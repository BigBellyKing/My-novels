<p>Chapter 337: Remember, No Russian (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>However, this thought didn't last long. Soon, Zhang Yi was completely attracted by the current level in front of him.</p>
<p>Because he actually stood together with Soap on a cliff ledge only about two meters wide.</p>
<p>Beneath his feet was thick snow. One more step forward would plunge him into an unfathomable, bottomless abyss.</p>
<p>The path ahead was even more extreme—only a narrow trail wide enough for someone to pass sideways.</p>
<p>"Damn it!"</p>
<p>Letting out a cry, Zhang Yi's legs immediately weakened.</p>
<p>As a player with even a slight fear of heights, this scene was truly overwhelming.</p>
<p>In the previous <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, although there were high-altitude perspectives, they were mostly inside places like airplanes, and throughout, he could just keep shooting.</p>
<p>That greatly distracted his attention. But now?</p>
<p>He genuinely felt his legs go weak.</p>
<p>Especially under the新时代's incredibly high VR sense of immersion, he felt utterly shaken.</p>
<p>The ice-climbing segment, with ice axes striking the frozen surface and visible cracks spreading, made his heart pound with fear.</p>
<p>Slowly advancing toward the cliff's summit.</p>
<p>In the howling wind, Soap and Roach reached a flat section of the cliff.</p>
<p>To continue climbing, they had to leap across this gap.</p>
<p>As team leader, Soap was a seasoned veteran. With a leap, accompanied by a 'Click Sound', his ice axe embedded perfectly into the ice layer, and he pulled himself onto the ledge.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath and seeing Soap waving at him, Zhang Yi controlled Roach to jump as well.</p>
<p>But unlike Soap's smooth landing, Roach was clearly far less fortunate.</p>
<p>The ice axe planted in the ice developed a terrifying crack. The ice surface couldn't support Roach's weight and shattered explosively.</p>
<p>"Holy crap, I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die!"</p>
<p>The sudden scene sent Zhang Yi's heart racing. Especially when he glanced downward—the sight of the endless abyss beneath made his legs go completely numb.</p>
<p>But at that moment, as snow tumbled down from above, a man grabbed an ice axe and firmly pulled Roach back to safety.</p>
<p>'Got you!'</p>
<p>The familiar voice came from Soap. Then, tilting his head, Soap signaled, and Roach quickly drove his ice axe into the ice, scrambling upward.</p>
<p>At this moment, Zhang Yi felt a slight tingling on his scalp.</p>
<p>That familiar line—back in the first installment, Captain Price had saved Soap exactly the same way!</p>
<p>And considering that in the first game, the protagonist he controlled was Soap himself, in that instant, the emotional bond between character and player was instantly forged.</p>
<p>An indescribably powerful feeling.</p>
<p>As Soap and Roach advanced deeper into enemy territory, that familiar sensation made Zhang Yi increasingly excited.</p>
<p>During combat, teammates' voices through walkie-talkies gave him direction.</p>
<p>During escape, they helped him clear obstacles.</p>
<p>When caught in a trap, your teammate was your last fuse.</p>
<p>Of course, what made Zhang Yi feel even better was the combat segment—he felt it offered far more choices than the previous game.</p>
<p>Silenced rifles, heart-rate sensors, and thermal scopes—essential for stealth.</p>
<p>Amid the blizzard, Roach and Soap moved like ghosts through the snow, piercing straight into enemy territory.</p>
<p>Deep inside the military base, Roach successfully located their target.</p>
<p>Yet in the end, Soap was discovered by the enemy in the warehouse.</p>
<p>But Soap didn't panic at all—he still had Plan B. As Roach triggered the detonator, the pre-planted bombs outside exploded. Taking advantage of the enemy's distraction from the blast, Roach and Soap launched a counterattack.</p>
<p>The two regrouped and, under the cover of the blizzard, began their retreat.</p>
<p>But due to the blizzard and the excessive number of anti-air defenses at the enemy base, the rescue Gyrocopter could only land on another hillside.</p>
<p>Here, a deadly high-speed chase unfolded—Roach and Soap hijacked a snowmobile and began a life-or-death escape.</p>
<p>Especially during the final stretch, controlling Roach on the snowmobile, accelerating downhill with the throttle fully open, they roared toward a steep cliff ramp, launching into the air like a bird with wings spread wide.</p>
<p>This sent Zhang Yi's adrenaline soaring.</p>
<p>He had waited ten days!</p>
<p>This heart-pounding sensation was exactly what he wanted!</p>
<p>Yet after this exhilarating experience, the next level delivered another kind of震撼ing impact.</p>
<p>One even greater than the nuclear explosion scene from the last game.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Zakhaev International Airport. This time, Zhang Yi's perspective shifted to Joseph Allen.</p>
<p>But now, he was known as Alexei Borodin—the undercover alias he was using.</p>
<p>【Note: The content of this level may cause discomfort. Would you like to skip it, or watch it as a CG video?】</p>
<p>Below were three options: Skip, Watch as Video, and No.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Was this level particularly special?</p>
<p>Wasn't this game already rated for adults?</p>
<p>Zhang Yi felt puzzled but still selected 'No'.</p>
<p>For a game hailed as groundbreaking, he didn't want to miss a single detail.</p>
<p>The screen faded in—inside an elevator.</p>
<p>Beside him stood a group of teammates. One of them Zhang Yi recognized instantly.</p>
<p>Makarov!</p>
<p>In the previous game's Operation Croaker, he had seen the man's photo.</p>
<p>Now, everyone carried assault rifles and wore bulletproof vests.</p>
<p>They seemed ready for some kind of operation.</p>
<p>'Remember, no Russian!' Makarov turned and looked at the group.</p>
<p>Then, the elevator doors opened.</p>
<p>Outside lay the terminal hall—a vast, open space filled with countless ordinary civilians. The noise was a bit chaotic but still orderly.</p>
<p>But the moment Makarov and his men stepped out, order collapsed.</p>
<p>Amid Zhang Yi's dumbfounded stare and the civilians' terrified screams in the game,</p>
<p>Makarov and his men raised their guns and opened fire on the crowd.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi never expected such a scene to appear in a game.</p>
<p>Watching Makarov and his men massacre innocent civilians, Zhang Yi instinctively raised his own weapon and aimed it at them.</p>
<p>He fired. In previous games, shooting at teammates would instantly trigger a mission failure screen, along with the famous message: 'Harming teammates is not allowed.'</p>
<p>But in this level, if the player does this, they would simply be gunned down in a hail of bullets by Makarov's men.</p>
<p>Blocking their path would result in the same fate—death.</p>
<p>Throughout, Zhang Yi merely followed woodenly behind Makarov and the others, not firing a single shot.</p>
<p>Moreover, compared to his previous life, Chen Xu had made many changes here.</p>
<p>For example, on the second floor of the airport, players previously had to kill two security personnel near a flowerbed—a level requirement.</p>
<p>Now, players could choose to go through the entire level without firing a single shot.</p>
<p>At this moment, Zhang Yi finally understood why there had been that initial warning.</p>
<p>Before this, Zhang Yi had never given much thought to so-called terrorist organizations.</p>
<p>His Aggro toward Zakhaev in the last game stemmed mostly from the fact that Zakhaev had killed Gaz, Griggs, and other comrades he trusted with his life.</p>
<p>But now, it was different.</p>
<p>Such inhumane actions were simply too震撼ing—even in a game.</p>
<p>Woodenly following behind Makarov, a waiting ambulance had already arrived to extract them.</p>
<p>"Well done, you've succeeded! Get in quickly! Makarov, we've sent a loud message with this attack!" The extraction member seemed ecstatic, patting Makarov on the shoulder.</p>
<p>"That wasn't the message," Makarov said, expressionless, extending his right hand toward Allen, the last one to board.</p>
<p>As an undercover agent, Allen, who believed his cover was flawless, had no suspicions.</p>
<p>But the next moment, Makarov pulled out his pistol and shot Allen straight through the heart.</p>
<p>"This is the message."</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The screen instantly turned red. Makarov coldly kicked Allen in the chest.</p>
<p>Allen's body went limp and collapsed heavily to the ground.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was completely stunned.</p>
<p>What was going on?</p>
<p>The screen grew increasingly blurry, leaving only Makarov's faint voice echoing in his ears.</p>
<p>"The Americans thought they could manipulate us. But when they find this body, all of Russia will roar for revenge."</p>
<p>The truth? That doesn't matter. All that's needed is a pretext to start a war—and that's enough.</p>
<p>In an instant, Zhang Yi understood.</p>
<p>This was a conspiracy!</p>
<p>A setup designed to use Allen's identity as an American to provide a justification for war following this disaster.</p>
<p>Just as there were those who wanted war with America, there were also those who desired peace.</p>
<p>But now?</p>
<p>With the Zakhaev Airport incident, whether it was a conspiracy or not no longer mattered.</p>
