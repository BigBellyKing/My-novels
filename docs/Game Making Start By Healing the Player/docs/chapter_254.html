<p>Chapter 253: Officially Launched (Seventh Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, online, players were delighted because of Chen Xu's post on the official Weibo account.</p>
<p>After all, Chen Xu had directly responded to their feedback.</p>
<p>Moreover, many players noticed a particular detail—an information point Chen Xu mentioned in the official Weibo post.</p>
<p>In the late game, a brand-new type of monster would appear: the Tempered monster.</p>
<p>According to the explanation, "Tempered" referred to monsters that had survived countless battles, precisely utilizing Nebula Games' latest AI technology.</p>
<p>This caught the attention of many players.</p>
<p>Previously, players had personally tried out the demo version of <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, especially since it was free.</p>
<p>During earlier promotions, Nebula Games had highlighted a specific AI performance effect, which also drew significant attention.</p>
<p>For common creatures like Herbivores, Crown-crested Dragon, and Small Jagras, the effect wasn't particularly noticeable.</p>
<p>However, when facing the Jagras, many players sensed a distinct difference.</p>
<p>Compared to low-intelligence creatures like Crown-crested Dragon and Herbivores, Jagras genuinely gave the illusion of being capable of thought.</p>
<p>It seemed as if it were actually assessing the threat level of Hunters or other animals before making decisions.</p>
<p>Many observant players also noticed that every creature in <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> had unique ecological habits and behavioral patterns.</p>
<p>Simply put, the Ancient Forest was a self-sustaining world.</p>
<p>For example, Jagras didn't remain stationary at a fixed location, even though the demo version's quest only involved Jagras.</p>
<p>Moreover, the entire Ancient Forest region wasn't fully accessible to players.</p>
<p>The only explorable area was the limited zone provided in the trial version.</p>
<p>Still, there was some exploration possible.</p>
<p>Many players discovered that Jagras wasn't a fixed-location BOSS waiting passively for players to attack.</p>
<p>All monsters in the game roamed freely.</p>
<p>They also hunted prey.</p>
<p>Furthermore, their hunting methods varied depending on the target.</p>
<p>For instance, when confronting the most docile and weakest creatures—the Herbivores, which players slaughtered the most—Jagras would charge directly and swallow them without hesitation.</p>
<p>But its behavior toward Crown-crested Dragon was entirely different.</p>
<p>Instead of immediate attack, it would first observe from the side.</p>
<p>Moreover, Jagras tended to target smaller female Crown-crested Dragons rather than larger males.</p>
<p>It also prioritized isolated individuals.</p>
<p>Compared to nearly defenseless Herbivores, groups of Crown-crested Dragons possessed some aggression and posed a greater threat, so a reckless attack could endanger the Jagras.</p>
<p>Additionally, many players noticed that after being attacked, Jagras didn't always flee toward its nest.</p>
<p>Instead, it escaped based on the current map environment.</p>
<p>These behaviors were subtle details.</p>
<p>Many players didn't notice them during their initial playthrough.</p>
<p>Such nuanced AI performances weren't overly obvious, and at first glance, they could easily be mistaken as pre-scripted events.</p>
<p>During their first attempts, players were so focused on fighting monsters that they completely overlooked these details.</p>
<p>However, due to the limited content in the demo, many players, after completing it, felt unsatisfied and replayed it—sometimes choosing different weapons to fight monsters again.</p>
<p>It was then that they began noticing details they had previously missed.</p>
<p>These observations heightened their anticipation.</p>
<p>After all, this was only the demo, and Jagras was merely a tutorial BOSS.</p>
<p>Players hadn't yet encountered Anjanath or Rathalos shown in the promotional videos, let alone the Nergigante featured in early promotions.</p>
<p>All of this intensified players' excitement, and they began looking forward to the Tempered monsters powered by advanced AI in subsequent content.</p>
<p>For many players, <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> now seemed like a game perfected beyond perfection!</p>
<p>First, its worldview was uniquely crafted, creating a vivid and lifelike New World.</p>
<p>Second, the Combat System was exceptionally well-designed, with each weapon possessing distinct characteristics.</p>
<p>The Hunting Horn, evoking sorrowful melodies across vast distances.</p>
<p>The Dual Blades, delivering visceral strikes and Demon Dance with unmatched flair.</p>
<p>The Long Sword, wielding Foresight Slash like the wind, never fainting.</p>
<p>The Sledge, spinning like a top, and the Lance, charging forward with fearless thrusts.</p>
<p>Each weapon offered unique Gameplay and style.</p>
<p>Previously, many players had complained the game was too easy.</p>
<p>After all, they barely died, monsters seemed weak, and Palico companions were overpowered—how could they possibly get Carting?</p>
<p>But now, Chen Xu's official Weibo post mentioned upcoming new difficulties.</p>
<p>Especially the description of Tempered monsters, which thrilled hardcore players craving greater challenges.</p>
<p>Suddenly, <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> appeared to have captivated players across all skill levels.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>On August 7th, amid players' eager anticipation,</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter: World</em> was officially launched.</p>
<p>Players who had pre-ordered the game waited anxiously for its unlock.</p>
<p>On various forums and chat groups, discussions were heating up.</p>
<p>"Half an hour left, damn it! I'm really experiencing the feeling of time dragging!"</p>
<p>"Bro, what weapon are you picking? Let's add each other! I'm playing Long Sword!"</p>
<p>"Long Sword +1!"</p>
<p>"I think the Sledge is more imposing!"</p>
<p>"I still prefer Bow and Arrows—ranged damage output is super fun!"</p>
<p>"Some veteran players have already tested in-game. On paper, Great Sword has the highest damage, and Bow is also very strong, but it demands good positioning. Charge Blade is brutally powerful, but to achieve ultra-high damage output, you need Super Amped Element Discharge, and gathering phials is a bit troublesome. As for Heavy Bowgun and Light Bowgun, it seems to depend on bullets—probably limited resources in the early game."</p>
<p>"Bro upstairs, your data analysis is super convincing, but I'm still going with Long Sword!"</p>
<p>"Exactly! You may dominate temporarily, but I'll stay stylish forever!"</p>
<p>Players enthusiastically debated which weapon to choose.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Long Sword received the most votes.</p>
<p>After all, it was simply too cool.</p>
<p>In the early game, practically any weapon could be used—differences were merely in efficiency when fighting monsters.</p>
<p>Although weapons varied in difficulty, everyone was still in the learning phase. Since the demo only featured Jagras, players felt confident in their chosen weapons.</p>
<p>As for the future?</p>
<p>Well, perhaps only Long Sword players would eventually feel a bit lonely.</p>
