<p>Chapter 73: Development Direction (Special thanks to veteran player 'Weixia Guozi' for becoming Alliance Master)</p>
<p>With Chen Xu's post on the official Weibo account going live,</p>
<p>it sparked endless grumbling from countless players and was reposted across various gaming communities.</p>
<p>Under Chen Xu's official Weibo post, an army of players gathered.</p>
<p>The sentiment expressed by these players was essentially the same: 'Yeah, right!'</p>
<p>Communication, tolerance, patience?</p>
<p>It sounded reasonable, but somehow felt like they were being misled.</p>
<p>Among the players, some believed Chen Xu's explanation, while others didn't.</p>
<p>But one thing remained unchanged: <em>Overcooked</em>, a game that looked incredibly cute and heartwarming,</p>
<p>quickly flooded major live streaming platforms, video websites, and related gaming communities after Valentine's Day.</p>
<p>Suddenly, everyone was talking about this unique cooperative game.</p>
<p>Sales figures for <em>Overcooked</em> also steadily climbed.</p>
<p>One week after launch, sales officially surpassed 450,000 copies.</p>
<p>Compared to previous titles such as <em>Undertale</em> and <em>To the Moon</em>, or even <em>Outlast</em>—a game that the gaming industry wasn't particularly optimistic about—</p>
<p><em>Overcooked</em>'s 450,000 sales didn't seem as high as imagined.</p>
<p>However, it's worth noting that of these 450,000 sales, 340,000 came from the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>This meant they had given away 340,000 copies of the game.</p>
<p>Even more importantly, unlike <em>Outlast</em> and <em>To the Moon</em>, <em>Overcooked</em> had, as previously planned,</p>
<p>brought a significant number of new users to Nebula Games.</p>
<p>Although, to be honest, these users currently had little stickiness,</p>
<p>they were still users.</p>
<p>At the very least, the Nebula Games Platform was now installed on their computers, and they had registered a Nebula Games Pass.</p>
<p>This was something <em>Outlast</em> had completely failed to achieve.</p>
<p>Moreover, in terms of playtime, <em>Overcooked</em> significantly outperformed <em>Outlast</em>.</p>
<p>After all, very few players actually had the courage to play through <em>Outlast</em>.</p>
<p>Most players who bought <em>Outlast</em> essentially considered watching a playthrough the same as playing it themselves.</p>
<p>But <em>Overcooked</em> was different.</p>
<p>Playing it with close friends created an entirely different kind of enjoyment.</p>
<p>With the success of <em>Overcooked</em>, both Nebula Games and Chen Xu entered the spotlight for many people.</p>
<p>Previously, whether it was <em>Undertale</em> sparking a meta-game trend in the independent gaming community, or Chen Xu winning first prize in the Sci-Fi Gaming Competition with <em>To the Moon</em>,</p>
<p>these achievements, while impressive, weren't seen as particularly significant by most companies in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>But the consecutive popularity of <em>Outlast</em> and <em>Overcooked</em> created a completely different level of buzz.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>The office of Nebula Games.</p>
<p>Chen Xu, leaning back on the sofa, grinned as he looked at his points.</p>
<p>Undeniably, <em>Overcooked</em> had performed quite well.</p>
<p>The rate at which points accumulated was even comparable to <em>Outlast</em> when he'd used items.</p>
<p>In just one week, he'd already saved up enough for 20 consecutive pulls.</p>
<p>Looking at the current points displayed on the UI interface, he decided after some thought not to pull yet.</p>
<p>The previous dozens of consecutive pulls had scared him straight—</p>
<p>nothing but common items and rare items.</p>
<p>Better to save up. With a larger pool, something valuable would eventually drop.</p>
<p>As for his next new work, he hadn't quite decided what kind of game to develop yet.</p>
<p>His current abilities were sufficient for now. He could wait until he had a real need before doing any pulls. After all, points wouldn't grow wings and fly away.</p>
<p>Additionally, with the New Year bringing new energy, the company had already expanded once during National Day last year.</p>
<p>But personnel were still slightly insufficient.</p>
<p>Next, they needed staff dedicated to game operation. Unlike <em>Undertale</em>, <em>To the Moon</em>, and <em>Outlast</em>, <em>Overcooked</em> was an online multiplayer game, and future updates would include the Workshop (modding platform) and new versions.</p>
<p>Someone needed to handle game operations, and the platform itself required operational staff.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the future, he would definitely develop true multiplayer games, which would require an even more robust operations team.</p>
<p>After all, he needed to cultivate an operations team that embodied Nebula Games' philosophy.</p>
<p>For any game, operation was absolutely critical—especially for multiplayer games, where operation could sometimes even outweigh the game's quality.</p>
<p>Secondly, the development team also needed further expansion.</p>
<p>Music, animations, and art—the office had previously mentioned they were feeling the strain. Recruitment was necessary.</p>
<p>Approximately 15 more people were needed.</p>
<p>The office space also needed expansion; it was already getting cramped.</p>
<p>Fortunately, an entire floor above their current office in the building seemed vacant. He'd contact the landlord later to arrange a sublease.</p>
<p>After roughly finalizing these plans, Chen Xu called over the office staff and instructed them to begin recruitment.</p>
<p>Filling all the positions quickly wasn't realistic, but Chen Xu wasn't in a rush.</p>
<p>A couple of months would be fine.</p>
<p>However, during this period, aside from handling recruitment, Chen Xu received an unexpected call—the number belonged to Meng Zuo from NetDragon, someone he'd met briefly before.</p>
<p>But clearly, the other party wasn't calling just to socialize.</p>
<p>Instead, Meng Zuo was representing NetDragon in expressing interest in acquiring Nebula Games.</p>
<p>After all, the success of several consecutive projects—though none were Major Productions—had all been major hits.</p>
<p>Especially recent titles like <em>Outlast</em> and <em>Overcooked</em>, which had generated considerable popularity.</p>
<p>As one of the giants in the gaming industry, NetDragon naturally had taken notice of Nebula Games.</p>
<p>And the very next day after NetDragon expressed their acquisition interest, TengHua somehow obtained his contact information and also requested a discussion.</p>
<p>In the current gaming industry, these two companies were direct competitors.</p>
<p>Simply put, whenever TengHua planned to do something, NetDragon would try to interfere.</p>
<p>The reverse was equally true.</p>
<p>Yet Chen Xu, the target of both companies' pursuit, wasn't thinking too deeply about it.</p>
<p>Selling? Definitely not.</p>
<p>But this was a perfect opportunity to see how both companies truly viewed Nebula Games.</p>
<p>"But regardless, the pace of development needs to accelerate!"</p>
<p>Chen Xu hung up the phone, chin resting on his hand, lost in thought.</p>
<p>In terms of big money, Nebula Games currently didn't have a huge amount.</p>
<p>But with steady, methodical growth like this, funds weren't an issue.</p>
<p>So far, cumulative sales of multiple games—<em>Mirror (Game)</em>, <em>Undertale</em>, <em>To the Moon</em>, <em>Outlast</em>, and <em>Overcooked</em>—had already surpassed ten million.</p>
<p>And sales were still steadily increasing.</p>
<p>Among these games, some had high development costs, others low.</p>
<p>But overall, every single one was profitable.</p>
<p>After accounting for the company's regular expenses—employee salaries, bonuses, rent, etc.—</p>
<p>Nebula Games' corporate account held nearly 200 million yuan in liquid assets.</p>
<p>The average development cost for large-scale games on the VR platform ranged from roughly 50 to 150 million USD.</p>
<p>Of course, that was the average. Top-tier blockbusters could go even higher.</p>
<p>For AAA-tier games on the PC platform, development costs generally ranged from 10 to 40 million USD.</p>
<p>In theory, funding such projects was possible, but for Chen Xu, it still carried some risk.</p>
<p>After all, that was just the development cost.</p>
<p>Marketing and promotion weren't included.</p>
<p>Surely he couldn't develop a blockbuster and then skip promotion entirely?</p>
<p>Moreover, the current team size was indeed stretched thin, making expansion essential.</p>
<p>And even if he were to develop a AAA-tier game next—especially one for the PC platform—</p>
<p>it would inevitably need to boost visibility for his own platform.</p>
<p>What was the fastest and most effective way to bring the Nebula Games Platform into the mainstream players' awareness and attract users?</p>
<p>The best method, undoubtedly, was exclusive games.</p>
<p>A conventional strategy, but a highly effective one.</p>
<p>But if he pursued exclusivity, sales would inevitably be impacted.</p>
<p>Originally, Chen Xu's plan had been to continue focusing on mid-to-small-scale projects, progressing steadily.</p>
<p>Gradually stabilizing the Nebula Games Platform while expanding its game library.</p>
<p>Now, however, he needed to carefully reconsider his future development direction.</p>
