<p>Chapter 11 Who Can Empathize With Someone Like This!</p>
<p>A certain residential complex in Modu.</p>
<p>“Xiaoxue, are you really not considering making games with me?” Yang Xin sat on the sofa, her two legs propped up on the coffee table in front of her, saying to Ruan Ningxue, who was sitting next to her coloring a manuscript.</p>
<p>“Sister Xin, your little boat is full of holes and leaking, about to sink.” Ruan Ningxue put down her paintbrush and rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“Ahem, it’s just a temporary difficulty, and I still have three employees here! And look at your studio, Xiaoxue, how can you call this a studio? Have you ever seen a studio with only one person?” Yang Xin immediately retorted.</p>
<p>“Well, at least I can make a profit! And Sister Xin, didn't you have eight employees three months ago?!” Ruan Ningxue suddenly realized something and said.</p>
<p>“Everyone has their own ambitions; my employees are chasing their dreams, I can't just stop them, can I? By the way, Xiaoxue, how's your junior brother's game doing?” Yang Xin, feeling a bit awkward, asked Ruan Ningxue, changing the subject.</p>
<p>“I haven't been following it; maybe the results aren't too good.” Hearing Yang Xin's words, Ruan Ningxue gently shook her head.</p>
<p>“So your studio is about to become two people?” Yang Xin said, seemingly remembering something, a little curious, clearly aware of the agreement between the two.</p>
<p>“Probably, but Chen Xu is probably in a very bad mood right now,” Ruan Ningxue sighed.</p>
<p>During this time, she hadn't actively contacted Chen Xu.</p>
<p>After all, after their previous collaboration, she had consulted Yang Xin, and the latter hadn't been optimistic at all.</p>
<p>Even though her sister had made three games and was almost out of funds, she was still a professional in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Plus, she had developed three games, so she must have accumulated some experience from failures, right?</p>
<p>During the month of game development with Chen Xu, Ruan Ningxue could clearly feel Chen Xu's passion.</p>
<p>She could also feel the unique joy that gaming brought, especially being able to personally operate and gradually advance the game content.</p>
<p>This feeling was indeed wonderful, and at that time, she could understand why Chen Xu said he wanted to develop games.</p>
<p>So during this period, she hadn't inquired about the game's results, especially since he had previously stated that he would pay her for her work as soon as the game succeeded and he received funds.</p>
<p>Although she didn't care about the money herself, she couldn't just tell Chen Xu to forget about it.</p>
<p>After all, it wasn't just about money, nor was it solely her business.</p>
<p>Furthermore, she was quite busy with her own comic industry work, so she hadn't paid too much attention to the game aspect.</p>
<p>She was planning to use this time to let Chen Xu calm down and adjust, and then she would talk to him again.</p>
<p><em>For this junior brother, I'm truly worrying myself sick!</em> Yang Xin thought with emotion.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to be done about it. Many newcomers think 18R-rated games are simple, but it's only that the risk is relatively low; game development isn't actually that easy. By the way, Xiaoxue, what's your junior brother's game called? I'll take a look.”</p>
<p>Yang Xin spoke with emotion, using the tone of an experienced person.</p>
<p>This reminded her of her three previous failures.</p>
<p>Although she had never met Ruan Ningxue's junior brother, Yang Xin somehow had a peculiar feeling.</p>
<p>That was, she could understand his feelings at this very moment.</p>
<p>Especially after Ruan Ningxue mentioned that he had burned his bridges, investing all his funds into it.</p>
<p>This made her even more certain that he must be someone who loves games, just like herself.</p>
<p>Thinking back to the frustration she felt when her first game failed after launch, at this moment, Yang Xin even felt a little sympathy for Chen Xu.</p>
<p>If it weren't for her company's funds being almost depleted, Yang Xin would want Ruan Ningxue to introduce him to her company right now.</p>
<p>Such a talented person, passionate about games, was exactly the employee she wanted!</p>
<p>“Don't worry, Xiaoxue, when the time comes, I'll use myself as a negative example to comfort your junior brother.” Yang Xin patted Ruan Ningxue's shoulder.</p>
<p>They were fellow sufferers; she could understand such pain of failure.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Sister Xin. By the way, the game's name is Mirror (Game), but the platform it launched on seems to be an overseas version platform,” Ruan Ningxue told Yang Xin.</p>
<p>Although she hadn't asked Chen Xu about the game's launch, she had secretly kept an eye on it. However, when she checked, the ratings and everything weren't unlocked yet, so she wasn't sure how it was performing.</p>
<p>“Mirror (Game)? Why does that game sound a little familiar?”</p>
<p>“I feel like I've heard it somewhere before?”</p>
<p>“Wait… this game!”</p>
<p>After getting the game's name from Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin mumbled as she opened the official game platform and started searching.</p>
<p>She didn't know why, but the game sounded a little familiar.</p>
<p>She opened the overseas version platform, typed in the name, and searched.</p>
<p>Then Yang Xin fell silent, turning her head to stare intently at Ruan Ningxue.</p>
<p>“Damn it, Xiaoxue, is this what you meant by 'the results aren't too good'?! Is this what you meant by a junior brother who 'doesn't know anything about making games for the first time'?!”</p>
<p>“Are you kidding me?!”</p>
<p>She wondered why it sounded so familiar!</p>
<p>Earlier, when she was browsing game forums, she had seen someone mention this game.</p>
<p>Then she looked at the game's product page.</p>
<p>Rating: 9.6, Number of ratings: 1724</p>
<p>Yang Xin couldn't stay calm.</p>
<p>Sympathy, empathy?</p>
<p>Who the heck can empathize with someone like this?!</p>
<p>Who the heck would sympathize with someone like this?!</p>
<p>A 9.6 rating, and that many reviewers!</p>
<p>It had only been how many days, and it already had over 1700 reviews?</p>
<p>She had never experienced anything like this!</p>
<p>“So Chen Xu’s game was actually successful?” Ruan Ningxue asked Yang Xin.</p>
<p>“It's more than successful; it's a huge success! You know, this is an 18R-rated game! And it's only been a few days, with such a high rating and so many reviewers. I estimate its future sales will surpass the highest-selling of my three previous games!”</p>
<p>Yang Xin said to Ruan Ningxue with an envious expression.</p>
<p>Looking at the number of reviews below the game store interface, she felt completely unwell.</p>
<p>Especially when she remembered what she had just told Ruan Ningxue about using herself as a negative example to comfort him.</p>
<p>Well, this time she really had become a negative example!</p>
<p>However, this awkward emotion was quickly thrown aside. Yang Xin stood up and grabbed Ruan Ningxue's arm.</p>
<p>“Xiaoxue, please! You absolutely must introduce this gaming master to me!”</p>
<p>“Let me learn from him!”</p>
<p>As the saying goes, the pavilion closest to the water gets the moon first.</p>
<p>Well, it's a bit strange, but the meaning is there.</p>
<p>When you can't be a pillar of strength yourself, and you discover someone who might be, why not lean on them?</p>
