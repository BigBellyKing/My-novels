                <p>Chapter 446: Assassin's Creed (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>“Ugh, players still lack trust in our Nebula Games!”</p>
<p>Looking at the trending search terms online related to ‘Vacation Agency’ and ‘travel’, Chen Xu couldn't help but sigh.</p>
<p>Travel? Non-existent. This is all for work!</p>
<p>From Florence to Vatican City, a full month of location scouting—do you know how exhausting that is? And to secure landmarks, we also had to visit various tourist attractions, no, I mean historical sites preserved since ancient times, to truly feel the profound sense of history they embody. Besides, who said we weren't developing games just because we were in Italy? Nowadays, the internet is so advanced that even half a world away, we can still handle official business! Otherwise, how did the <code>Outlast</code> VR theme, which filled players with pleasant surprises, get launched during this period? But now, that trust is completely gone! Although some people did mention that Nebula Games might be out scouting locations for a game, it didn’t make any waves.</p>
<p>Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue, among others, remained silent as they watched Chen Xu sigh with emotion. Lack of trust? Isn't that something you've slowly discarded, Mr. Chen! But we originally thought Italian cuisine would be delicious, and now? It's not as good as Chinese cuisine!</p>
<p>“But Mr. Chen, will our new work be set in Italy?” Meng Zuo asked Chen Xu with curiosity. It looked like they were on vacation, but in reality, they did a lot of work, such as conducting on-site investigations in areas like Florence Cathedral. While it's possible to experience these places through photos and VR, Chen Xu’s actions during this time clearly showed he wanted them to experience it firsthand.</p>
<p>“That’s right.” Chen Xu nodded with a smile. He had actually been thinking about a new work for a long time. However, due to limitations in his abilities, Chen Xu hadn't started production. Now, it was almost time. At the same time, the performance of the new era Huanyu VR would also allow this title to provide players with a more immersive experience.</p>
<p><code>Assassin's Creed</code>.</p>
<p>Of course, strictly speaking, it should be the Ezio Trilogy and Altaïr’s story.</p>
<p>In his previous life, <code>Assassin's Creed</code> was also a large IP with sales in the tens of millions. However, the story of this major IP was relatively convoluted, from the initial highly anticipated release to the Waterloo of <code>Unity</code>. Although many content fixes were made later, making <code>Unity</code> itself quite good, its 'infamy' had already spread. This led many casual players to instinctively name <code>Unity</code> as the worst <code>Assassin's Creed</code> game, even though the later <code>Syndicate</code> received mixed reviews. In this situation, a major reform of the series emerged.</p>
<p>Starting with <code>Origins</code>, peaking with <code>Odyssey</code>, and concluding with <code>Valhalla</code>, the Mythology Trilogy began a new chapter. The <code>Assassin's Creed</code> series was no longer confined to assassins. Many players used to jokingly call <code>Assassin's Creed</code> a 'Berserker's Creed', and with the Mythology Trilogy, it truly became that. Bayek, who had ‘a happy family’, Kassandra, who had ‘harmonious siblings’, and Eivor, the ‘master of stealth’ – all offered players a brand new experience. If the original <code>Assassin's Creed</code> was closer to action gameplay, then the Mythology Trilogy was pure RPG gameplay. And from a broader perspective, the <code>Assassin's Creed</code> series actually began trying to separate itself from the assassin concept very early on.</p>
<p>Ezio's Trilogy was a slight attempt. Haytham Kenway, the father of Connor, the third assassin protagonist, was a bold experiment. His father was an assassin, his son was also an assassin, but he himself became a Templar Knight. Later, the character Shay appeared, who was first an assassin and then became a Templar Knight. His appearance directly shattered the ingrained perception that assassins were always good, Templar Knights were always bad, and that assassins and Templar Knights were inherently incompatible. This concept was heavily emphasized in later games, such as <code>Origins</code> and <code>Odyssey</code> after the major reform.</p>
<p>The reason for choosing the <code>Assassin's Creed</code> Ezio Trilogy as the next development direction was simple. Ezio is the most fully developed character in the Assassin series, and the story of the trilogy can be considered the series' peak. Indeed, every protagonist in the Assassin series leaves a deep impression on players: Altaïr the “White Strip in the Waves”, Ezio the “Chaste”, Master Connor the “Frail”, Haytham the “Filial Son”, Arno Dorian the “Peerless Warrior”, Edward Kenway the “Money Grubbing”, Jacob Frye the “Law-Abiding”, Shay Cormac the “Loyal to the Organization”, Bayek the “Happily Married”, Deimos the “Harmonious Sibling”, and Eivor the “Stealth Master”. Behind each of these names lies a poignant story. But if there’s one protagonist who left the deepest impression on players, it is undoubtedly Ezio. After all, he is a character featured in three games, plus an animated short film. His youth, middle age, old age, and twilight years were perfectly portrayed, naturally leaving an unforgettable impression on countless players. Therefore, Chen Xu reserved the protagonist role of the first <code>Assassin's Creed</code> game for Ezio. Of course, Altaïr must also be mentioned, as Ezio’s story cannot be discussed without referencing the story of this Assassin Master. This time, by coming to Italy, Chen Xu wanted everyone in the team to personally experience the Florence Cathedral and other classic Renaissance landmarks in reality.</p>
<p>After all, one of the most important aspects of <code>Assassin's Creed</code> is its historical authenticity. It is no exaggeration to say that in his previous life, the <code>Assassin's Creed</code> series was absolutely the best at recreating a sense of history, bar none. In his previous life, if you asked a player which game truly made them feel history, many would undoubtedly answer: <code>Assassin's Creed</code>. For example, the Notre-Dame fire, which in turn made <code>Assassin's Creed Unity</code> incredibly popular, with some even claiming that the Notre-Dame Cathedral in <code>Unity</code> might have played a role in its post-disaster restoration. Although this was merely a rumor, and a rather ignorant one at that, it still reflected the <code>Assassin's Creed</code> series' level of historical and cultural architectural recreation. Some university professors in relevant history departments even used <code>Assassin's Creed Origins</code> and <code>Odyssey</code> as teaching materials when lecturing on Ancient Greek and Egyptian cultures. It can be said that one of the true charms of <code>Assassin's Creed</code> is its ability to transport every player back in time, to the historical junctures of major events. It allows players to participate in these historical moments and experience the culture of that era: Pericles' speeches, Socrates' debates, the grandeur of holy Jerusalem, the majesty of the ancient Egyptian pyramids, the romance of the Renaissance, and the stories of Leonardo da Vinci and Copernicus.</p>
<p>Chen Xu hoped that the entire team, including himself, could personally see what these buildings, which would exist in the game, truly looked like, rather than relying solely on data, documents, and photos. As for tourism? That was just a bonus. The truly important goal was to recreate that sense of history in <code>Assassin's Creed</code>.</p>
