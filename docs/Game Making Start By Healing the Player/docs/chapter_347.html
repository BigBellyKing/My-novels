                <p>Chapter 346: Two Plans (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>While major media outlets and players were still marveling at the content of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>.</p>
<p>Chen Xu was also making subsequent arrangements.</p>
<p>There were two main plans.</p>
<p>The first was the multiplayer mode for <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>.</p>
<p>Chen Xu had no intention of making <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> an annual release, unlike its predecessor in his previous life. There was simply no need for it. The <em>Call of Duty</em> series in his previous life was essentially a new game every year, but if you asked if there were any major changes, there really weren't.</p>
<p>The single-player story content was also criticized by countless players for getting worse year after year. In fact, in the 15th installment, the single-player mode was directly canceled.</p>
<p>As for the content in the multiplayer mode, it could actually be released as a new version, building upon the original game. Therefore, Chen Xu planned to develop <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> as a game that could be continuously operated long-term.</p>
<p>In addition, the highly acclaimed Zombie mode from his previous life was also planned for a later release. However, it still required some detailed adjustments. After all, with the immersive experience of the new generation VR, the original Zombie mode from his previous life would be no less terrifying than a horror game. Even if players could 'bang bang bang' at zombies, the incredibly dark environment, combined with terrifying sound effects and an oppressive atmosphere, would be enough to scare most players out of their wits.</p>
<p>Besides the regular multiplayer mode, Chen Xu also planned to add another mode: Warzone. To put it more bluntly, it was Battle Royale.</p>
<p>Speaking of Battle Royale, it can be said that this was an innovation in game design philosophy. H1Z1 was the first to cash in on the Battle Royale craze, but it died a spectacular death due to its own terrible decisions. Then came the more refined <em>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</em>, and later <em>Apex Legends</em>, among others.</p>
<p>It can be said that the Battle Royale mode has been constantly evolving. For example, <em>Fortnite</em>, in addition to Battle Royale, primarily focused on building. Combining building with Battle Royale gameplay gave it a completely different feel.</p>
<p><em>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</em>, on the other hand, was a slow-paced, relaxed game where players rarely engaged in combat unless actively seeking it out. For the most part, in the early stages, you wouldn't see many people; instead, players would scavenge for equipment before engaging in firefights. Besides that, there were the fast-paced <em>Apex Legends</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>.</p>
<p>Each Battle Royale game, so to speak, had its own core essence, and of course, its own advantages and disadvantages. <em>Fortnite</em> was undoubtedly one of the most difficult games to pick up because it involved building structures. Playing well, besides good marksmanship, required proficiency in building.</p>
<p><em>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</em> was more of a socially-driven game. Why do I say that? Because the pace of <em>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</em> was the slowest among all the Battle Royale games mentioned. During the long journey of scavenging for equipment, if you didn't chat and joke around with your teammates, creating social enjoyment, then the frustration you'd feel when you've spent 20 minutes looting only to be eliminated immediately would be much greater.</p>
<p><em>Apex Legends</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>, on the other hand, were more akin to traditional FPS games. At the same time, the sense of frustration was smaller, because a fast pace meant a lower sunk cost.</p>
<p>Launching <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em> at this time was primarily because the existing <em>Call of Duty</em> related content was readily available and there was no reason not to use it; it mostly involved rule modifications. As for the map, the art resources currently produced for <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> were completely sufficient. Furthermore, the existing influence of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> was another crucial factor.</p>
<p>Besides the plan for the <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> multiplayer mode, Chen Xu's second plan was acquisitions.</p>
<p>Nebula Games' current scale seemed already large, but it still lacked significant foundational strength. Taking <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> as an example, during its development, NetDragon also provided considerable assistance. Otherwise, the development progress wouldn't have been so fast.</p>
<p>It could be said that compared to veteran game developers, Nebula Games still lacked some specialized technical capabilities. Currently, Nebula Games' forte was undoubtedly the feel of action games. But this was experience accumulated from two <em>Dark Souls</em> games and one <em>Monster Hunter</em> title.</p>
<p>Next was the shooting feel, which was learned from NetDragon and accumulated through the development of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>. Therefore, Chen Xu had to plan ahead for this area. Because in the future, Nebula Games couldn't just develop games in these two areas, nor could they always cooperate with NetDragon.</p>
<p>This time, the cooperation was mainly due to the previous favor from <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, coupled with NetDragon not having a corresponding project during this period, which led them to help with contract manufacturing. They were partners now, but that might not always be the case in the future.</p>
<p>And for Chen Xu, waiting for Nebula Games to slowly accumulate other types of technology was a bit too slow. So the best method was acquisition, even though it would definitely cost more than slowly cultivating it themselves. But what's the big deal?</p>
<p><em>Minecraft</em>, <em>Warcraft</em>, <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, and the upcoming multiplayer mode. Plus, the Nebula Games Platform, which was on the right track and gradually becoming a cash cow.</p>
<p>Currently, Nebula Games' cash reserves could be said to be quite ample. Can something that can be solved with money even be called a problem?</p>
<p>"30 million USD? Hmm, this Swiss company is worth that price." In the office, Chen Xu nodded lightly as he looked at a document in Lin Rou's hand.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, the total amount we've spent on acquiring these game companies has already reached 510 million USD," Lin Rou said with some hesitation. Over this period, one of her tasks was to acquire game developers and studios globally. The main focus was on companies with experience in racing, flight simulation games, and character performance. For this, Nebula Games had already invested nearly 510 million USD.</p>
<p>Although it didn't significantly impact the company's operations, this figure was quite substantial. Coupled with the daily salary expenses of these companies' internal teams, the annual expenditure in this area was a huge sum. At least this year, no such large-scale acquisition had occurred in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>"Everything is worth it, and it's not like we can't afford it," Chen Xu said, smiling at Lin Rou.</p>
<p>In Chen Xu's view, these acquisitions were all worthwhile. Chen Xu didn't just decide on a whim; this was a well-thought-out strategy, and he had held several meetings with the finance and other departments beforehand. It absolutely wouldn't affect the normal operations of Nebula Games. At the same time, the selection of these game developers and studios was quite particular.</p>
<p>Many of them were essentially struggling contractors or bankrupt companies. Simply put, they had the technology but weren't doing well, with every game they made resulting in a loss. Or they were the type whose self-developed games all failed, leaving them with nothing. However, the games they developed as contractors for others, while not becoming huge hits, were at least profitable.</p>
<p>They all possessed certain technical skills but were not large in scale. They were the kind Nebula Games could easily acquire without overextending itself.
