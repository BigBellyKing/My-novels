                <p>Chapter 346: Two Plans (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>While major media outlets and players were still sighing with emotion over the content of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>,</p>
<p>Chen Xu was already making arrangements for subsequent work.</p>
<p>There were two main plans.</p>
<p>The first involved the multiplayer mode of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>.</p>
<p>Regarding <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, Chen Xu had no intention of turning it into a yearly-release title, as it had been in his previous life.</p>
<p>Because honestly, there was no need. In his previous life, <em>Call of Duty</em> had essentially released one title per year.</p>
<p>But if one were to ask whether there had been any major improvements, the answer would be no.</p>
<p>The single-player story content had been constantly criticized by countless players, declining in quality year after year.</p>
<p>By the 15th installment, the solo mode had been canceled altogether.</p>
<p>As for the multiplayer content, it could have easily been released as new versions built upon the original game.</p>
<p>Therefore, Chen Xu intended to treat <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> as a game capable of long-term, continuous operation.</p>
<p>Additionally, the highly praised Zombie mode from his previous life was also planned for release in the future.</p>
<p>However, some fine-tuning would still be required.</p>
<p>After all, under the immersive experience of next-generation VR, implementing the original Zombie mode from his previous life would undoubtedly result in a horror game-level thriller.</p>
<p>Even if players could shoot the zombies to pieces, the pitch-black environment combined with terrifying sound effects and oppressive atmosphere</p>
<p>would be enough to scare most players out of their wits.</p>
<p>Besides the regular multiplayer mode, Chen Xu also planned to introduce another mode:</p>
<p>Warzone.</p>
<p>To put it more plainly: Battle Royale.</p>
<p>Speaking of Battle Royale, it was undoubtedly an innovation in game design philosophy.</p>
<p>H1Z1 was the first to reap its benefits but died quickly due to its own impressive tricks.</p>
<p>Later, more refined titles like <em>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, and others emerged.</p>
<p>It could be said that the Battle Royale mode had evolved gradually over time.</p>
<p>For example, <em>Fortnite</em> focused primarily on building. By combining construction mechanics with Battle Royale gameplay, it created a completely different feel.</p>
<p><em>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</em>, on the other hand, emphasized a slow, relaxed pace. Unless players actively sought combat, most of the early game involved scavenging for gear in solitude before engaging in firefights.</p>
<p>Then there were <em>Apex Legends</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>, which leaned toward a fast-paced style.</p>
<p>Each Battle Royale game had its own unique core, along with respective strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Among them, <em>Fortnite</em> was undoubtedly the hardest to master, primarily due to the building mechanics.</p>
<p>Skill in the game depended not only on marksmanship but also on the ability to construct structures effectively.</p>
<p><em>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</em> was more of a socially driven game. Why?</p>
<p>Because it had the slowest pace among all the aforementioned Battle Royale titles. During the long gear-scavenging phase, if players didn’t engage in constant banter and social interaction with teammates,</p>
<p>the frustration of spending 20 minutes searching only to die instantly upon encountering enemies would be far greater.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <em>Apex Legends</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em> leaned more toward traditional FPS gameplay,</p>
<p>with relatively lower frustration levels.</p>
<p>The fast pace meant lower sunk costs per match.</p>
<p>The main reason for launching <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em> now was simple: the existing <em>Call of Duty</em> content was ready to use—essentially, only rule adjustments were needed.</p>
<p>As for the map, the existing art resources from <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> were more than sufficient.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the established influence of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> itself was another key factor.</p>
<p>Besides the multiplayer mode plans for <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, Chen Xu’s second major plan was acquisition.</p>
<p>Although Nebula Games appeared large in scale currently, it still lacked substantial depth.</p>
<p>Take <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> as an example—NetDragon had provided significant support during its development.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the progress could never have been this fast.</p>
<p>Compared to veteran game developers, Nebula Games was still missing certain specialized technical capabilities.</p>
<p>Currently, Nebula Games excelled most in the feel of action games,</p>
<p>an expertise accumulated through developing two <em>Dark Souls</em> titles and one <em>Monster Hunter</em> game.</p>
<p>Second was the shooting feel, learned partly from NetDragon and further refined through development of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>.</p>
<p>Therefore, Chen Xu had to plan ahead.</p>
<p>In the future, Nebula Games couldn’t possibly limit itself to only these two genres, nor could it rely on collaboration with NetDragon forever.</p>
<p>This time, the collaboration happened because of prior goodwill from <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> and because NetDragon had no overlapping projects at the time, allowing them to assist with contract manufacturing.</p>
<p>They were partners now, but that might not last.</p>
<p>Allowing Nebula Games to slowly accumulate expertise in other genres would be too slow for Chen Xu’s ambitions.</p>
<p>Thus, the best solution was acquisition—despite the higher cost compared to nurturing talent internally.</p>
<p>But how big of a deal was that?</p>
<p><em>Minecraft</em>, <em>Warcraft</em>, <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, and the upcoming multiplayer mode,</p>
<p>along with the Nebula Games Platform, now running smoothly and gradually becoming a cash cow.</p>
<p>Nebula Games’ cash reserves were more than sufficient. If money could solve it, was it really a problem?</p>
<p>"30 million USD? Hmm, this game developer from Switzerland is worth that price." Chen Xu nodded lightly, looking over a document in Lin Rou’s hands inside the office.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, the total amount we’ve allocated for acquiring game developers has already reached 510 million USD," Lin Rou said hesitantly.</p>
<p>Recently, she had been assigned a task: to acquire game developers and studios worldwide.</p>
<p>The primary focus was on studios with expertise in racing games, flight racing games, and character performance animation.</p>
<p>To date, Nebula Games had already invested nearly 510 million USD in this effort.</p>
<p>Although it had little impact on company operations, the figure was undeniably massive.</p>
<p>Added to that were the regular salaries and operational expenses of the acquired teams.</p>
<p>The annual expenditure in this area alone was enormous.</p>
<p>At least this year, no other company in the gaming industry had conducted acquisitions on such a scale.</p>
<p>"Everything is worth it, and we can certainly afford it," Chen Xu smiled at Lin Rou.</p>
<p>In Chen Xu’s eyes, every acquisition was justified.</p>
<p>He hadn’t made these decisions on a whim. They were the result of thorough deliberation, with multiple meetings held in advance with the finance and other departments.</p>
<p>These acquisitions would not disrupt Nebula Games’ normal operations.</p>
<p>Moreover, the selected developers and studios were carefully chosen.</p>
<p>Many were essentially underpaid workers or failed studios—technically skilled but poorly managed, releasing one flop after another.</p>
<p>Or those who lost everything, even their underwear, developing their own games,</p>
<p>yet consistently produced profitable titles when working as contractors for others.</p>
<p>They possessed certain technical capabilities but remained small in scale—perfectly digestible for Nebula Games without causing strain.</p>
