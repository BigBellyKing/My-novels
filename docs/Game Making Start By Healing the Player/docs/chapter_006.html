                <p>Chapter 6: This is the Judgment of a Professional Game Developer</p>
<p>Days passed one by one.</p>
<p>He completed the final CG illustration and edited the corresponding audio and subtitles. Chen Xu looked at the game source files generated on his computer, a look of excitement on his face: “It’s done!”</p>
<p>“So, now we need to find a game publisher?” Ruan Ningxue, standing nearby, was also a little excited. After all, this was a project she had worked hard on for the past month. Well, even though she hadn’t received a single cent in wages from Chen Xu.</p>
<p>“No.” Hearing Ruan Ningxue’s words, Chen Xu gently shook his head.</p>
<p>“Eh?” Ruan Ningxue was a little surprised.</p>
<p>Although she didn’t understand games, she knew that Chen Xu should now be considered an independent game producer. Wasn’t it like drawing comics or making movies, where you’d find a publisher or a film distribution company?</p>
<p>“Games are a bit different. Also, this game won’t be released on domestic platforms, but on overseas official game platforms.”</p>
<p>“Domestic players can also connect directly…”</p>
<p>“After all, there’s no other way. It’s like selling Doujinshi; it’s mostly done on overseas platforms. Mirror (Game) is 100% an 18R game, and this genre is actually quite awkward.” Chen Xu explained to Ruan Ningxue.</p>
<p>“Then why are you still making this kind of game, Chen Xu?”</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue was puzzled. According to what he said, it felt like the game would be stillborn before it even launched. Although, if that were true, it would mean Chen Xu could become her assistant. But honestly, Ruan Ningxue’s thoughts had changed a little from before, after spending this month with Chen Xu. She had a much better impression of him, and she had also gained a basic understanding of the gaming industry, finding it quite interesting. Moreover, her own efforts were invested in it, so she genuinely hoped it would succeed.</p>
<p>“You have to eat your meal one bite at a time. For Mirror (Game)’s subsequent preparations, I have ample plans. Senior Sister, just wait for my good news. I’ll definitely give you a big red envelope then!” Chen Xu smiled faintly.</p>
<p>“Alright, then I’ll be waiting.” Ruan Ningxue looked at the confident Chen Xu, and though perplexed inwardly, she nodded along.</p>
<p>In a certain residential complex in Modu. A woman dressed in a white shirt and jeans leaned back in Ruan Ningxue’s home.</p>
<p>“Xiaoxue, are you really not considering coming to help me? With your art skills combined with my game design abilities, we could definitely make a big name for ourselves in the gaming industry!” Looking at the enthusiastic Yang Xin in front of her, Ruan Ningxue placed the juice she was holding on the coffee table. At this moment, she felt like she could understand Chen Xu’s feelings.</p>
<p>“Sister Xin, I don’t mean to discourage you, but you’ve developed three games, and it seems all of them have lost money, right?” Ruan Ningxue rolled her eyes. She hadn’t known much about games before, but after working on one with Chen Xu for a month. Even though for her, her work was no different from drawing Doujinshi before – still drawing. Yet, she had learned a bit about games, and then she discovered that Yang Xin, who used to brag so much to her, hadn’t made a single game that broke even.</p>
<p>“Next time, it’ll definitely be a big seller! As long as you come help me, Xiaoxue!” Yang Xin said with a face full of confidence.</p>
<p>“Oh, come on. Didn’t Uncle Yang and you, Sister Xin, agree that he wouldn’t inject more capital once the startup funds ran out? So, Sister Xin, you’re…?” Ruan Ningxue, sitting on the sofa, looked at the confident Yang Xin with suspicion.</p>
<p>“Ahem, by the way, how’s that game your Junior Brother made, Xiaoxue? Did he find a publisher? Should I introduce one?” Yang Xin lightly coughed, changing the subject.</p>
<p>“No need for that. Chen Xu said he’s launching directly on the official platform and not looking for a game publisher.” Ruan Ningxue shook her head, recalling what Chen Xu had told her earlier.</p>
<p>“Not looking for a publisher? That’s a huge disadvantage! Without promotional resources from a third-party platform, relying solely on the official platform’s new game recommendations, it’ll be hard to stand out unless the quality is absolutely explosive.” Yang Xin said, speaking as someone with experience.</p>
<p>“Uh, Sister Xin, Chen Xu said the game doesn’t seem to have new game recommendations, and it’s being uploaded to an overseas platform.” Ruan Ningxue recalled some of the things she discussed with Chen Xu yesterday.</p>
<p>“No new game recommendations? An overseas platform? An 18R game?! No wonder he sought you out, Xiaoxue. But your Junior Brother is taking too much for granted; a game that’s just about selling sex is hard to make popular.” Yang Xin, who was quite knowledgeable about the gaming industry, immediately understood the game’s type upon hearing Ruan Ningxue’s words. Even some bloody or violent games generally still get new game recommendations on official platforms, as long as they’re not too extreme. But if it’s not launching on domestic platforms, choosing an overseas platform, and still not getting new game recommendations, it’s pretty much guaranteed to be an 18R game.</p>
<p>“No way? Chen Xu should have his own plans, right? And Mirror (Game) isn’t just a simple 18R game; it also has quite rich story content.” Ruan Ningxue said with some uncertainty, remembering Chen Xu’s confident demeanor.</p>
<p>“How could I not understand? You said your Junior Brother’s artistic skill isn’t worse than yours, right? He sought you out precisely because he wants to use the art as a selling point. But a game can’t succeed solely on art. As for content? What kind of content can an 18R game have?” “This is a judgment from a professional game producer! Plus, no new game recommendations and no third-party publisher means that unless he heavily advertises himself, it’s very likely to make no splash at all.” Yang Xin bravely made her judgment.</p>
<p>“So, Sister Xin, do you think that game’s sales could exceed 50,000?” Ruan Ningxue asked, looking at the confident Yang Xin.</p>
<p>“Impossible!” Even though she hadn’t seen the game Ruan Ningxue was involved in, Yang Xin confidently issued a death sentence for its prospects. After all, based on the information she had: a small-budget independent game, no publisher, an 18R game, only two people involved, and the other person was previously a comic artist who only did some outsourced work for games. While 18R games always have many potential users—who isn’t an LSP, after all?—the competition in this category is also quite intense. So, how could such a combination possibly produce a successful game? One must remember, she herself had developed three failed games and deeply understood the difficulties of the gaming industry.</p>
<p>“While 50,000 is impossible, 18R games are generally priced cheaper, and with your artistic skill, Ningxue, if the quality is decent and it gets a high bonus, 10,000 sales might be achievable. At least it wouldn’t lose money.” “From a risk perspective, 18R games are indeed relatively low-risk,” Yang Xin said, offering a bit of comfort to Ruan Ningxue.</p>
<p>“This is a judgment from a professional game developer!” After a moment’s thought, Yang Xin added another sentence.</p>
<p>“I see.” Ruan Ningxue, who currently had only a superficial understanding of the gaming industry, showed some worry on her face.</p>
