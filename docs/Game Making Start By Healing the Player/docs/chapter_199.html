<h3>Chapter 198: Official Taunt! (4th Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</h3>
<p>"Everything requires materials—flint, wood, grass, spider silk, and gold nuggets..."</p>
<p>As she chopped down trees across the map, Wang Han picked up flint, flowers, grass, and berries scattered on the ground.</p>
<p>Gradually, the items in Wang Han’s inventory increased.</p>
<p>Through the function panel on the left, she realized there weren’t many things she could craft yet.</p>
<p>Axes, hoes, torches, and campfires—basic tools—but combat equipment still required additional materials.</p>
<p>Many grayed-out, Unlocked items required a prerequisite: building something called the Science Machine.</p>
<p>But that item required one Gold Nugget, four pieces of wood, and four Shelter Stones.</p>
<p>Wood wasn’t an issue; she’d already gathered more than enough from chopping down several trees.</p>
<p>As for Shelter Stones, she hadn’t found any yet, but judging by the hoe’s description indicating they could be dug up, they clearly weren’t rare.</p>
<p>The only problem was the Gold Nugget—she had no idea where to find it.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous life version of Don't Starve, Chen Xu had added some beginner guidance hints.</p>
<p>For example, when Wang Han first approached a tree, Wilson from the game gave a prompt, indicating she needed an axe.</p>
<p>At that moment, a small arrow would point toward the Inventory panel.</p>
<p>The same applied to ores and other resources.</p>
<p>This helped players understand the most basic in-game guidance operations, instead of forcing them to figure everything out through trial and error.</p>
<p>For most low-budget games, the biggest issue isn’t necessarily Gameplay Content or mechanics.</p>
<p>Rather, it’s often the finer details of the player experience.</p>
<p>Beginner tutorials are a perfect example.</p>
<p>Many Independent Game designers adopt an unconventional, individualistic style, creating unique gameplay experiences akin to indie films, yet often fall short in polish and attention to detail.</p>
<p>Moreover, games and films are different mediums—films are passive experiences, but games demand active participation.</p>
<p>With major games, regardless of whether they’re fun or have excellent story, at least the experience never leaves players confused about how to play.</p>
<p>Even hardcore titles like Dark Souls might make players sigh with emotion over their difficulty, but fundamental operations—attacking, defending, rolling, lighting a bonfire—are made crystal clear so players quickly understand how the game works.</p>
<p>Regarding Don't Starve’s beginner guidance, Chen Xu didn’t go the mobile games route, bombarding players with instructions or holding their hands through every step.</p>
<p>Instead, he adopted a phased approach. For example, when a player discovers ore, Wilson would prompt them to build a pickaxe, accompanied by a line of dialogue: "Perhaps these rocks contain some gold."</p>
<p>By combining Wilson’s dialogue with subtle hints, players received gentle guidance.</p>
<p>Of course, for Wang Han at this moment, what she was doing could best be described as… picking up trash.</p>
<p>She clicked on every interactive object—loose stones, Tall Grass, berries, saplings—anything she could interact with.</p>
<p>Midway, she spotted some butterfly-like insects, but whether due to unmet conditions or other reasons, she couldn’t catch any.</p>
<p>She also noticed rabbit holes in the grasslands. When she clicked on one, Wilson delivered a corresponding line, helping her understand that rabbits ate carrots.</p>
<p>If she could make a trap using carrots, perhaps she could catch one.</p>
<p>"Hmm, this is kind of interesting… though the map is really huge!"</p>
<p>Wang Han wore an expression of curiosity.</p>
<p>Though she hadn’t played long, her sensitivity to games allowed her to sense that this game’s Gameplay was completely different from Chen Xu’s previous titles.</p>
<p>What surprised her most, however, was just how massive the game map was.</p>
<p>After opening the map and scrolling with her mouse wheel, she realized her current location was just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>In percentage terms, she had probably explored less than 0.1%.</p>
<p>Wang Han used her collected materials to craft another axe and a hoe, then began wandering across the map.</p>
<p>She still didn’t clearly understand how to play the game, so for now, she simply roamed, exploring new areas and collecting various materials.</p>
<p>Gathering materials was, in itself, a somewhat boring activity.</p>
<p>Yet Wang Han found herself oddly enjoying it.</p>
<p>Mainly because she could clearly see her Inventory filling up, growing richer with each collection.</p>
<p>Moreover, the sound effects for actions like chopping trees or picking berries were incredibly engaging.</p>
<p>And of course, there was an even more crucial factor—picking up trash was genuinely addictive.</p>
<p>At this point, Wang Han had completely forgotten her initial goal: finding gold to build the Science Machine.</p>
<p>Now, she just kept running across the map, collecting all sorts of ‘trash’.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, tools like the axe and hoe had durability.</p>
<p>Once their durability reached zero, the tools would break.</p>
<p>But since the raw materials were easy to obtain, breaking them wasn’t a big loss.</p>
<p>"Huh! What’s this? A beehive?"</p>
<p>While chopping trees and scavenging near a river, Wang Han heard a buzzing sound through her headphones and noticed a structure resembling a beehive.</p>
<p>"I wonder if attacking it will drop honey!" Staring at the beehive, Wang Han gripped her axe, barely able to resist.</p>
<p>She stepped toward the hive and swung her axe directly at it.</p>
<p>As the axe struck, a loud buzzing erupted, and five or six Killer Bees burst out from the hive.</p>
<p>"Wait! Not bees—Killer Bees!?"</p>
<p>Staring at the Killer Bees, axe in hand, Wang Han’s eyes widened. That name gave her a terrible feeling.</p>
<p>The next moment, the Killer Bees charged straight at her.</p>
<p>The screen flashed red repeatedly, and the health value in the top-right corner plummeted.</p>
<p>Wang Han didn’t immediately flee. Instead, she stood her ground, stubbornly trying to fight back with her axe.</p>
<p>But to her Taken Aback surprise, each swing felt completely ineffective. After two or three hits, not a single bee was killed.</p>
<p>"This is insane! How am I supposed to fight this!?"</p>
<p>Wang Han was stunned. She finally decided to run.</p>
<p>But it was already too late.</p>
<p>With the final sting from a Killer Bee, Wilson collapsed onto the ground.</p>
<p>【Day One】
(Everyone has their First (achievement). While that’s true, dying this quickly is admittedly a bit awkward.)</p>
<p>Staring at the achievement screen that popped up, Wang Han’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p>
<p>Official Taunt!</p>
<p>This was definitely Official Taunt!</p>
