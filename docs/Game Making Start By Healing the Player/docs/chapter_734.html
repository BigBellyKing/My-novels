                <p>Chapter 733: Pre-order, Can't I Just Pre-order It Already! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Zhang Yi looked at Kratos's actions, his face full of surprise.</p>
<p>He had completely underestimated Kratos's willingness to do such a thing.</p>
<p>Protagonists who were outright villains, Nebula Games hadn't actually shied away from them before. However, they would always cloak their actions in a layer of justification.</p>
<p>For example, in The Last of Us, Joel could actually be described as a typical villain. If one were to view Joel from a moral and legal standpoint, there would be no way to associate him with being a good person. It was just that Joel's past misdeeds weren't shown in the game, and his later wrongdoings had Ellie as a medium, making it easier for players to empathize with Joel's perspective and thus not perceive his actions as excessively evil.</p>
<p>But the Kratos currently before him was much more direct; saving the captain seemed like a simple task, yet he didn't do it, instead leaving the captain to his own devices. Coupled with the previous violent visual impact, it immediately made Zhang Yi feel the brutality within this game.</p>
<p>And what followed was exactly as Zhang Yi had anticipated. Slaughtering various monsters, the crimson blood made Kratos's deep-seated memories surge forth once again.</p>
<p>Now, he served the Olympian gods, placing all his hopes in them. Because no matter how much he drank, how many people he killed, or how many women he slept with, the nightmare-like memories from his past lingered persistently in Kratos's mind.</p>
<p>After finishing in the room, Kratos pushed aside the two women beside him, kicked open the cabin door, and looked up at the sky, questioning angrily.</p>
<p>“Athena!”</p>
<p>“Ten years! Athena, I have served the gods for ten years! When will you repay me, and free me from these nightmares!”</p>
<p>As Kratos angrily questioned, Athena also appeared before him.</p>
<p>“We need you to complete one final task, Kratos.”</p>
<p>“Your greatest challenge awaits you in Athens. My brother, Ares, the God of War, is attacking Athens, and even as we speak, Athens is on the verge of destruction...”</p>
<p>“Zeus forbids the gods from fighting each other, which is why I have chosen you.”</p>
<p>“Complete this final task, and all the sins you committed in the past will be forgiven!”</p>
<p>“Trust the gods, Kratos... the gods never forget mortals who have helped them...”</p>
<p>Under Athena's divine power, Kratos saw his next objective. Far-off Athens, where the flames of war engulfed the entire city. As for the culprit, it was Ares, the God of War. Seeing Ares before him, Kratos's rage ignited once more, as if he were looking at a mortal enemy. Thus, he accepted this mission, the final task entrusted to him by the gods.</p>
<p>As the screen faded to black, Zhang Yi was still anticipating what would happen next. But an unexpected pop-up window appeared before him.</p>
<p>“Demo content has ended. Would you like to pre-order God of War? God of War will officially launch on the 25th.”</p>
<p>??????</p>
<p>Demo content?</p>
<p>And he had to wait another week for the official launch?</p>
<p>Seeing the prompt, Zhang Yi was utterly stunned!</p>
<p>That's right! This wasn't the full version, it was the game's demo!</p>
<p>The combat system, a paragon of violent aesthetics, and the suspenseful story—such as Kratos's true past, and what nightmares he wished to escape after serving the Olympian gods for ten years—all created an irresistible urge to continue. It was only when he saw the prompt that Zhang Yi remembered he was only playing the demo version. But despite all that, he was already hyped up, and now he was being told it wasn't convenient today and he had to wait seven days?</p>
<p>Looking at the upcoming date, Zhang Yi glanced at the system's date and time again, and suddenly felt a sensation of pained expressions.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen, I can't outplay you!</p>
<p>Pre-order, Mr. Chen, can't I just pre-order it already!</p>
<p>But can you launch it a little faster?</p>
<p>Without a moment's hesitation, Zhang Yi directly recharged his Nebula Games Platform wallet, but then he discovered something peculiar.</p>
<p>That was, this game called God of War was not just a single title. Instead, it was divided into a trilogy. Just like the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare series. It could be bought individually, or as a collection. And buying the collection came with a discount, equivalent to a 10% off.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi didn't hesitate much and directly purchased the collection. Because the approximately one-hour demo content had completely captivated him with its ultimate violent aesthetics.</p>
<p>Looking at the interface after the demo ended, Zhang Yi smacked his lips, thought for a moment, and opened the demo again. He intended to play it from the beginning to see if it was just as satisfying on a higher difficulty. As for Song Ren, who was waiting for his gameplay experience, he had inadvertently been forgotten. What's more fun, bros or games?</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Regarding the God of War demo content, it also sparked widespread debate among players. The main reason was that Nebula Games had revealed almost nothing about it beforehand. For players, it was an enormous surprise.</p>
<p>This time, God of War completely redefined their perceptions, especially the gameplay experience, which left many players exceptionally excited.</p>
<p>“Holy crap, this God of War really feels like a hack-and-slash game!”</p>
<p>“Easy difficulty is indeed hack-and-slash, but I tried God of War difficulty, and I became frustrated!”</p>
<p>“Are you stupid? If there's an easy difficulty, why would you play God of War difficulty?”</p>
<p>“I feel like the sense of impact in this game is absolutely explosive!”</p>
<p>“+1, and it also incorporates QTE elements. The moment Hydra was blown up was simply blood-boiling!”</p>
<p>“It's simply a paragon of violent aesthetics. This must be the toughest character Mr. Chen has ever developed for a game, right?”</p>
<p>“But I feel like this Kratos isn't a good person.”</p>
<p>“Exactly, poor captain who was swallowed by Hydra. I thought Kratos would save him.”</p>
<p>“Although he's not a good guy, I have to say, he's incredibly awesome! Tearing Hydra apart with his bare hands, and those Blades of Chaos are just too cool.”</p>
<p>“So Nebula Games went too far! They suddenly dropped a demo and now we have to wait over a week for the unlock!?”</p>
<p>“Calm down, calm down, this is Mr. Chen's standard procedure. Although God of War feels like it'll give us a blast in terms of gameplay, Mr. Chen still has to mess with us outside the game.”</p>
<p>After the demo content went live, countless players, after experiencing it, expressed their views on God of War. It must be said that compared to other games,</p>
<p>Although the God of War demo content only featured a simple BOSS, and could even be completed in about half an hour if played skillfully from start to finish, this half-hour of content was enough to make players feel the unique charm of God of War.</p>
<p>Especially this time, God of War was a genuine hack-and-slash game. On the highest difficulty, it felt even harder than Souls-like games, but who told you to pick the highest difficulty? Isn't there a lowest difficulty for you to choose?</p>
<p>For hardcore players, how to utilize terrain and combo executions against monsters in the game could be glimpsed through the demo. As for ordinary players, the epic grand scenes on easy difficulty, coupled with the ultimate visual impact of violent aesthetics, were incredibly satisfying.</p>
