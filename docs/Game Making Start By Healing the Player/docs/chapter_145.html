<p>Chapter 144: Players Will Eventually Understand Their Hearts (Seventh Update—Subscribe, Monthly Pass Please)</p>
<p>After completing the explanation of the concept drafts for <em>It Takes Two</em>, the entire team began operating efficiently.</p>
<p>Elements such as characters and their associated actions—these art assets—had already been produced before the Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>Currently, the team's main focus was on level design and story presentation.</p>
<p>The family warehouse, the courtyard's Greatwood, the corrupted garden, the Snowglobe of first love, the Medieval castle built from Lego toys...</p>
<p>Chen Xu explained to Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue the unique characteristics of each thematic scene in the game.</p>
<p>These thematic scenes weren't merely standalone environments in the game—they symbolized the emotional journey and evolving relationship between the two protagonists, May and Cody.</p>
<p>"The Cuckoo Clock level needs a sharp, metallic feel. Additionally, the Special Items in this level are all time-based, implying that Cody and May can start over."</p>
<p>"The Snowglobe scene is a metaphor for Cody and May's relationship. Once, their love burned as fiercely as flames, but now, just like the scene within the Snowglobe, it's completely frozen."</p>
<p>"Yet, at the end of the Snowglobe level, the ice breaks apart—an allegory indicating that the frozen layer sealing Cody and May's relationship now has hope of cracking open."</p>
<p>"Likewise, the Magnets in this level represent how Cody and May's relationship has shifted from initial repulsion to mutual attraction, gradually drawing them closer together."</p>
<p>Chen Xu went into great detail for each scene, ensuring Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue fully understood the effects he was aiming for.</p>
<p>Once the scene requirements and the deeper meanings of the story were fully conveyed,</p>
<p>there was no need to overthink anything. They could simply follow the established guidelines, making minor adjustments based on Chen Xu's simple drafts.</p>
<p>No need for second or third revisions—no need to discard prior work and start from scratch.</p>
<p>Even though this wasn't the first time they'd experienced it—during <em>Dark Souls</em>' development, they'd already felt it deeply—the employees of the Art Team were still profoundly moved.</p>
<p>With such a work experience, it didn't matter that Nebula Games' compensation was already above average. Even if it were slightly below average, there'd still be no reason to leave.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>As development of <em>It Takes Two</em> progressed steadily, in the weeks following the Lunar New Year, many players across various gaming forums and communities found themselves lost, trapped in a game drought.</p>
<p>Although several game companies had released new titles during this period, the pre-holiday releases of <em>Dark Souls</em> and the two VR blockbusters from TengHua and NetDragon had spoiled players' expectations.</p>
<p>"Boring! Does anyone have any new game recommendations?"</p>
<p>"Nothing good lately. The few games that launched recently look pretty underwhelming."</p>
<p>"No choice. Even though some studios under TengHua and NetDragon have new projects, I don't think the quality is anything special."</p>
<p>"Yeah, at least last year we had <em>Overcooked</em>. This year, there's nothing."</p>
<p>"Don't even mention <em>Overcooked</em>—I've been washing dishes nonstop for a whole year because of that game!"</p>
<p>"By the way, it's already post-holiday. Why hasn't Chen Xu made any move?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, all the developers at the Game of the Year event had trailers for new games. Only Chen Xu hasn't made a peep—aside from the new mode in <em>Dark Souls</em>, not even a fart has come out."</p>
<p>"I bet he's saving up for a big move. Maybe the <em>Dark Souls</em> sequel is coming!"</p>
<p>"<em>Dark Souls</em> is too hard. I'd rather play some family-friendly games, like <em>Fall Guys</em>."</p>
<p>Not only were players discussing this across various communities, but on Chen Xu's official Weibo account, countless fans were @-mentioning him daily, asking about Nebula Games' next project.</p>
<p>Among them, a large number were eagerly anticipating the <em>Dark Souls</em> sequel.</p>
<p>Seeing all these @-mentions, Chen Xu thought for a moment, then decided to drop a hint.</p>
<p>He posted a new official Weibo message, which read:</p>
<p>"New game is being made—a couple's co-op game that lets you experience warmth and friendship. Latest news will drop on Valentine's Day. Stay tuned."</p>
<p>Alongside the text, Chen Xu attached an image: a clay doll and a wooden doll holding onto a dandelion, floating through the air.</p>
<p>The moment this post went live, it exploded, drawing countless replies from players who had been closely watching Chen Xu's every move.</p>
<p>"Damn it! Look what I just unearthed! A new game is coming!?"</p>
<p>"Wait! Couple's co-op? Valentine's Day!? WTF! Chen Xu, do you know I just got a girlfriend? Are you trying to make me single again!?!"</p>
<p>"Judging from the image, the cartoon art style looks super wholesome, but the blood and tears of <em>Overcooked</em> taught us—it's a huge trap!"</p>
<p>"Once a year, here you come again this Valentine's!"</p>
<p>"It's that time of year again to bring back the old meme. Everyone, fill in the blank: Chen Xu's nickname is ____?"</p>
<p>"Last year's <em>Overcooked</em> made me wash every single dish in my house. This year, are you trying to make me do all the laundry too?"</p>
<p>Players erupted into chaos—after all, last year at this time, a game with similar promises had left them with such a deep impression.</p>
<p>But jokes aside, on gaming media websites, the topic of 'Chen Xu's new game' continued to gain momentum.</p>
<p>Within the gaming industry, the news quickly spread.</p>
<p>"Heard it? Chen Xu's new game is another two-player co-op."</p>
<p>"Not the <em>Dark Souls</em> sequel?"</p>
<p>"Probably another transitional mini-game, just like last year's <em>Overcooked</em>?"</p>
<p>"I wonder if Chen Xu's unnamed game this year can break new ground?"</p>
<p>"What are you thinking? Two-player co-op—basically just last year's <em>Overcooked</em> with a new theme and mode. How much new ground could it possibly break?"</p>
<p>Industry insiders and players alike discussed Chen Xu's new game, but most impressions still centered around last year's <em>Overcooked</em>.</p>
<p>After all, the timing and the wording made it hard not to draw that connection.</p>
<p>But Chen Xu remained unfazed. Once the game officially launched, all misunderstandings would be cleared. At that moment, players would finally understand their hearts—and realize why he was called: Warrior of Love!</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>Amid intense player speculation, time quickly arrived at February 14th—Valentine's Day.</p>
<p>At noon, Chen Xu and Nebula Games simultaneously posted a message on their official Weibo accounts.</p>
<p>The message was simple: Trailer.</p>
<p>Three words, followed by a video.</p>
<p>After a brief black screen, a wooden door appeared.</p>
<p>As the door opened, a book with a face came into view.</p>
<p>At the top, it read: 'Book of Love'.</p>
<p>"This is a story of a magical kingdom."</p>
<p>The Book of Love extended its hands as if welcoming the viewers, while the camera rapidly pulled back.</p>
<p>Lighthouses, bell towers, cartoon art style—the entire scene looked like a dream.</p>
<p>"It features many wizards and warriors."</p>
<p>The camera moved into a room where two doll figures—one clay, one wooden—dressed in wizard robes and armor wielding a burning greatsword, battled a cartoon monster in an arena-like setting.</p>
<p>"This epic legend unfolds across the sea."</p>
<p>A small sailboat made of building blocks raced across the ocean, dodging a shark with its jaws wide open and a massive octopus monster with long tentacles.</p>
<p>"And it's also a journey through time."</p>
<p>A path made of countless gears appeared, seemingly inside a grandfather clock.</p>
<p>"Biubiubiu! It even includes a winter dream—building a sled and such."</p>
<p>On an icy and snowy track, a sled sped forward.</p>
<p>The next moment, countless fragmented scenes flashed by—railway tracks through tunnels, spiders in the forest, bats on platforms.</p>
<p>"Wait... did I mention there'll be a big explosion too?"</p>
<p>On a platform constructed from Brass Pipes, a rumble sounded as massive flames erupted, sending the two doll figures flying from the shockwave.</p>
<p>"Wait a second, look at these dolls... I almost forgot—they were once human."</p>
<p>The camera froze on the two flying dolls as a photo appeared.</p>
<p>A man and woman, dressed in wedding dress and suit, smiled brightly in front of a cake.</p>
<p>But the photo cracked in half, separating them.</p>
<p>"Alright, alright... you want to know the theme of this story?"</p>
<p>"It's Cody and May's story."</p>
<p>The camera focused on the two frightened doll figures.</p>
<p>"Want to turn back? Then you must first repair your relationship..."</p>
<p>"It's a story about passion..."</p>
<p>"It's a story about attraction..."</p>
<p>"It's a story about cooperation..."</p>
<p>As a rapid series of game graphics flashed by, the Nebula Games logo appeared.</p>
<p>The game title launched: <em>It Takes Two</em></p>
<p>20,000+—Didn't break my promise~ Burst updates aren't real burst updates; daily burst updates are real burst updates~ Hoping to continue tomorrow—please turn your shorts into longs</p>
