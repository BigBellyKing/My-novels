                <p>Chapter 78: This Sounds Familiar</p>
<p>Nebula Games' lounge area.</p>
<p>During lunch break, Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin leaned back in massage chairs, while others like Qin Yi were battling the claw machine.</p>
<p>“The company's benefits are getting better and better!” Yang Xin said delightedly, holding a cup of milk tea in her hand.</p>
<p>“It's mainly because the company's capital is growing stronger, and there are more and more new colleagues. I'm still not quite used to it. Would you say we're a large team now?” Ruan Ningxue also mused.</p>
<p>Looking back now, she still felt a bit unreal.</p>
<p>This time last year, she was still drawing doujinshi at home.</p>
<p>“We're not quite a large team yet; we're still in the small to medium-sized category,” Yang Xin said.</p>
<p>“Oh, Sister Xin, I heard we might be attending the gameplay Expo next?” Ruan Ningxue asked.</p>
<p>“Hmm, I heard Sister Lin mention it, and didn't Mr. Chen go to check out the exhibition venue before?” Yang Xin replied.</p>
<p>“I used to go too, but always as a spectator. Now we get to be the hosts!” Ruan Ningxue said excitedly.</p>
<p>At this moment, Qin Yi and the others, who had finally given up wrestling with the claw machine, also gathered around.</p>
<p>“We're going to exhibit too, but there's only about two months left. I wonder if Mr. Chen will have a new project?” Qin Yi said, full of anticipation.</p>
<p>A new project — this could be said to be what all employees at Nebula Games looked forward to.</p>
<p>From the perspective of psychological and spiritual satisfaction, creating a new project and seeing players give all sorts of feedback brings a strong sense of achievement.</p>
<p>And in terms of material conditions, every new project, if it succeeded greatly...</p>
<p>...would mean big bonuses!</p>
<p>With <em>Outlast</em> before the New Year and <em>Overcooked</em> after, Chen Xu had given them substantial bonuses after the success of those projects.</p>
<p>“It feels like we might not have enough time?” a new employee said at this point.</p>
<p>“Yeah, two months feels a bit tight, but you never know. After all, it's an expo, not an official release,” the new employees discussed.</p>
<p>“You guys are too young! When the project starts, you'll understand why Mr. Chen is so successful!” Qin Yi said, looking like he was calmly watching the world unfold.</p>
<p>“Exactly!” the veteran employees beside him said, their faces filled with anticipation.</p>
<p><em>Outlast</em> and <em>Overcooked</em> released back-to-back, unique game development experiences, development efficiency almost like a bug-free machine program, and team management.</p>
<p>It could be said that the veteran employees who had experienced all this were almost becoming die-hard fans of Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Everyone was still chatting when Yang Xin's surprised voice rang out.</p>
<p>“Look at the work group chat! There's a meeting this afternoon about a new project!” Yang Xin waved her hand, holding her phone.</p>
<p>“It must be for this game expo, right?”</p>
<p>“I wonder what kind of new project it will be?”</p>
<p>“It'll probably be a multiplayer game, right? Didn't we talk about the company's development direction in the previous meeting?”</p>
<p>“Who knows? Just follow Mr. Chen's lead, we'll find out this afternoon.”</p>
<p>Opening the work group chat and seeing a notice posted by Chen Xu, everyone instantly became excited.</p>
<p>They all speculated amongst themselves about what kind of project they would develop next.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>In the afternoon, employees clocked in one after another.</p>
<p>Chen Xu also brought his laptop and called everyone to the conference room for a meeting.</p>
<p>“I believe you've all heard some news. This time, we will also participate in the gameplay Expo in May, and we'll be a headliner for the sixth exhibition area.”</p>
<p>An exhibition space of about 500 square meters, though not comparable to major studios.</p>
<p>It was quite substantial compared to some medium-sized game developers.</p>
<p>This was mainly due to <em>To the Moon</em> winning the official Game Design Competition, and subsequently releasing two highly popular games.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, everyone nodded, their faces also showing a hint of excitement.</p>
<p>Chen Xu smiled, and then three folders appeared on the large screen.</p>
<p>They were labeled 1, 2, and 3, three different numbers.</p>
<p>“For this expo, we need to bring some new things to meet the players, but the task might be a bit rushed,” Chen Xu said, looking at everyone. “This time, we need to develop two games consecutively, and at the same time, we need to quickly produce a promotional animation for a truly meaningful major title that will come later.”</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, Qin Yi, and other veteran Nebula Games employees all looked bewildered.</p>
<p>As for the new employees who had just joined Nebula Games shortly after the New Year, they had expressions that clearly said, “Are you kidding us?”</p>
<p>Two months, making two games, and also taking care of a promotional animation for a major title.</p>
<p>Although everyone understood that a promotional animation for a so-called major title was different from development and could mostly be kept out of the main scope, usually only requiring simple scene design and then hiring a CG animation company for production.</p>
<p>But the key was two games in two months—how was that possible?</p>
<p>Even a donkey from the production team couldn't produce that much!</p>
<p>This included Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and Qin Yi, veteran employees who were quite familiar with Chen Xu's work efficiency, who were equally full of doubts.</p>
<p>If it were just making a playable DEMO for an exhibition, that might be possible.</p>
<p>But from Chen Xu's tone, it felt like he intended to fully develop the entire game content.</p>
<p>Can it be done?</p>
<p>Everyone listened with questions as Chen Xu explained the two new games they were about to develop.</p>
<p>“First up is <em>Sanguosha</em>. This is a strategy card battle game, and I've already completed the main rules and gameplay. You can take a quick look.”</p>
<p>As Chen Xu spoke, the corresponding rules for <em>Sanguosha</em> appeared on the large screen via the projector.</p>
<p>It was also accompanied by some rough drafts of generals and cards.</p>
<p>“In the game, there are four different factions: Lord, Rebel, Loyalist, and Spy. Players can freely choose their corresponding Three Kingdoms generals, and each general possesses specific skills.”</p>
<p>“Additionally, the game has three types of cards: Basic cards, Equipment cards, and Stratagem cards.”</p>
<p>Chen Xu briefly explained the basic rules and content of <em>Sanguosha</em> to help everyone better understand the game.</p>
<p>Time was limited, so Chen Xu didn't go into too much detail.</p>
<p>However, those present weren't completely clueless beginners.</p>
<p>Including Ruan Ningxue, who had participated in several projects since last year and had also undergone a period of learning; combined with the design proposal drafts, she could pretty much understand it.</p>
<p>Everyone quickly imagined the relevant gameplay of this game, although they weren't yet sure what the actual game experience would be like.</p>
<p>But the one thing they could understand was that this game would basically not require much effort.</p>
<p>The main time-consuming aspects would be the game's voice acting and the production of art assets.</p>
<p>And these could be handled by outsourcing.</p>
<p>If one outsourcing company couldn't finish it, then two.</p>
<p>The development difficulty of <em>Sanguosha</em> was close to none, so the key lay in the other game, and the aforementioned “major title.”</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Chen Xu, waiting for him to reveal the next project.</p>
<p>Looking at the crowd, Chen Xu smiled: “The next game will be one that allows players to greatly relieve stress and experience unparalleled joy. It can be described as quite harmonious and wholesome.”</p>
<p>If the world were a comic book world, then at this moment, a row of black question marks should have appeared on the foreheads of Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, Qin Yi, and the others.</p>
<p>“Why does that sound so familiar?”</p>
