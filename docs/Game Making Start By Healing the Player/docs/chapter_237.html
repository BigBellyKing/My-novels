<p>Chapter 236: Is This Really a Hunting Game? (Sixth update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>Chen Xu sat before his computer, chin resting on his hand.</p>
<p>Now that he had decided to develop Monster Hunter: World, he still needed to think carefully about how exactly to approach it.</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay, Monster Hunter: World was an exceptionally unique game.</p>
<p>Most multiplayer games contained at least some PVE elements.</p>
<p>But Monster Hunter: World was a purely cooperative hunting game.</p>
<p>In Dark Souls, players could invade other players' worlds.</p>
<p>And in later entries, many veteran Dark Souls players found their primary enjoyment in PVP.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter: World, however, contained no PVP content at all.</p>
<p>The game emphasized teamwork—players forming parties to hunt dragon-like creatures together.</p>
<p>As for scenarios like Demon Mode Dual Blades slicing allies, charging Lance impaling teammates, Light Bowgun blowing up a comrade's crotch, Heavy Bowgun piercing teammate defenses, or Great Hammer's three-charge home run—these were all exceptions, absolutely not part of the game's PVP design.</p>
<p>From the game's core design alone, including its narrative backdrop, Monster Hunter: World was a game with an extremely distinctive style.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the game's core selling point was its combat system and the relatively realistic hunting experience.</p>
<p>Every aspect of the game was crafted to serve the overall hunting experience.</p>
<p>In most games, battles against bosses typically lasted just a few minutes, at most ten.</p>
<p>But in Monster Hunter: World,</p>
<p>facing powerful bosses, even a fierce battle lasting fifteen to twenty minutes was considered quite normal for average players.</p>
<p>Of course, this didn't apply to speedrun veterans or hardcore grinders who had already farmed powerful gear to bully whelplings.</p>
<p>Combined with improved AI performance, Chen Xu believed he could deliver an even stronger sense of immersion in the hunting experience than the original Monster Hunter: World from his previous life.</p>
<p>Next was the game's class system—or rather, its weapon system.</p>
<p>The game didn't divide players into classes like warriors or mages.</p>
<p>Instead, it offered different weapons.</p>
<p>Much like how different weapons in Dark Souls had distinct attack styles,</p>
<p>Monster Hunter: World provided players with a wide variety of weapons, each with clearly defined characteristics.</p>
<p>Moreover, each weapon had its own set of combo attacks and Skills.</p>
<p>Similar to a Fighting Game, players needed to input commands to successfully execute weapon techniques.</p>
<p>That said, actual operations wouldn't require memorizing lengthy move lists like in traditional fighting games.</p>
<p>And even if a player didn't know how to chain attacks, they wouldn't be completely unable to play—</p>
<p>they'd just miss out on flashy, high-skill operations.</p>
<p>As for difficulty, compared to Dark Souls,</p>
<p>Monster Hunter: World was significantly more forgiving.</p>
<p>The game adopted a gradual difficulty progression.</p>
<p>Put simply, Dark Souls made you suffer first, then slowly learn the mechanics.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter, on the other hand, let you learn the mechanics first, then face the suffering—much more user-friendly.</p>
<p>Another key point was that Monster Hunter: World was an incredibly replayable game.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>After grinding hundreds of hours and still not obtaining a single Attack Jewel, you'd naturally understand why it was so replayable.</p>
<p>While the game inherently encouraged grinding, grinding alone wouldn't be enough to sustain such long playtime.</p>
<p>Ultimately, even when hunting the same monster repeatedly,</p>
<p>each hunt offered a different experience.</p>
<p>Dynamic changes in the battlefield, potential interruptions by other bosses, unpredictable teammate behavior in Team Up mode, and the monster's own attack patterns—</p>
<p>all contributed to ensuring that no two hunts felt the same, avoiding monotony.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Monster Hunter: World offered various clever strategies. Even players with subpar skills could still clear the game effectively, as long as they understood the game's mechanics.</p>
<p>Of course, success wasn't completely mindless.</p>
<p>…………………</p>
<p>After two consecutive days of work, Chen Xu finalized the general design concept drafts for Monster Hunter: World and summoned Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, and others to the meeting room for a discussion.</p>
<p>The team had gathered early, whispering excitedly among themselves.</p>
<p>"I wonder what Mr. Chen's hunting game is actually like!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I imagine it's set in ancient times, with players using weapons like spears and bow and arrows to hunt in the wild."</p>
<p>"What I'm most curious about is how the AI performance will feel in a hunting context."</p>
<p>"I'm inexplicably excited!"</p>
<p>Clearly, the team had learned over the past two days that the new work would be a hunting-themed game, and their anticipation was palpable.</p>
<p>At that moment, Chen Xu entered, and the room fell silent.</p>
<p>Taking his seat at the head of the table, Chen Xu addressed the group: "I'm sure you all already know some details about the new game, so I won't waste time with unnecessary talk."</p>
<p>"Today's meeting is about launching development on this new project. Please look at the main screen."</p>
<p>As Chen Xu spoke, the projector displayed the title: Monster Hunter: World.</p>
<p>"First, let me briefly explain the game's theme and direction."</p>
<p>"In terms of theme, this is a hunting-themed game, but the Combat System will be quite unique, setting it apart from other action games currently on the market."</p>
<p>"Additionally, we'll create a vast, living ecosystem to showcase the capabilities of AI intelligence."</p>
<p>"Finally, the monsters players will hunt will primarily be dragon species… well, that's about it."</p>
<p>Chen Xu swiped on his laptop's touchpad.</p>
<p>On the conference room's projection screen appeared a monstrous creature—huge in size, with yellow-green carapace, powerful wings, and limbs.</p>
<p>Its sharp claws and fangs looked terrifying.</p>
<p>Beside it was an introduction: [Queen of the Land—Rathian].</p>
<p>Staring at the image, the team was stunned.</p>
<p>The sense of shock brought by this wyvern was simply overwhelming.</p>
<p>"Also, in this game, players won't have class divisions. Instead, they'll choose from different weapons. In short, weapons replace traditional classes."</p>
<p>As Chen Xu explained, the projection screen changed.</p>
<p>Great Sword, Long Bow, Dual Blades, Long Sword—various weapons appeared on screen.</p>
<p>They all shared one common trait: every weapon was a melee or non-firearm weapon.</p>
<p>Judging from the Concept Art, the Hunter clad in leather armor wielded weapons that, while large, still looked like a pushover compared to the massive Rathian.</p>
<p>Additionally, there were some unfinished sketches—such as one depicting a colossal Elder Dragon with wings fully spread, covered in Spikes, and fearsome horns atop its head.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, is this new work… a Souls-like game?" Qin Yi swallowed hard, voicing the confusion on everyone's minds.</p>
<p>A massive dragon-like monster, a tiny hunter, and only melee weapons?</p>
<p>Was this really a hunting game?</p>
<p>Or was it more like monsters hunting the hunter?</p>
<p>Don't ask if there's more—because yes, there is.</p>
