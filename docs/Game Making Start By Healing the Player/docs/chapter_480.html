                <h2>Chapter 479: The Players' Dilemma (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</h2>
<p>Not just Zhang Yi, but all players who had Cleared the Game in <strong>Resident Evil</strong> were extremely surprised when they saw these two subsequent DLCs.</p>
<p>At first, they thought it might be something terrifying, and they were inclined to refuse.</p>
<p>Moreover, these DLCs didn't offer any <strong>Double Eleven</strong> or <strong>Halloween</strong> rewards.</p>
<p>But many players reconsidered—after all, they'd already survived a day trip to the <strong>Baker family</strong>'s farm. What was there left to fear?</p>
<p>Since they were already playing, they might as well finish the game. After all, that would make the experience complete.</p>
<p>The ending cinematic dialogue between <strong>Ethan</strong> and <strong>Mia</strong> from the main game had also felt somewhat eerie, hinting that it might tie into the DLC content.</p>
<p>For various reasons, many players decided to dive into these two DLCs.</p>
<p>And then, they were instantly hooked.</p>
<p>In <strong>Zoe's Ending</strong>, players controlled an old man named <strong>Joe Baker</strong>, the younger brother of <strong>Jack Baker</strong> (the infamous "father-in-law" from the main game).</p>
<p>This old man embodied the definition of a badass—fighting his way through with iron fists, smashing the skulls of <strong>Fungal Beasts</strong> and even crocodiles.</p>
<p>Later in the story, players could even acquire a literal pair of iron fists.</p>
<p>Wooden planks? Smashed. Iron doors? Obliterated. Fungal Beasts? One-punch head explosions. It was pure, unadulterated bliss.</p>
<p>The once-terrifying monsters became nothing more than punching bags. Some players even complained that there weren't enough Fungal Beasts to beat up.</p>
<p>As for the other DLC, <strong>Not a Hero</strong>, players took control of <strong>Chris Redfield</strong>, the man who appeared briefly at the end of the main game.</p>
<p>Like Joe Baker, Chris was an absolute beast, delivering an exhilarating experience.</p>
<p>If hand-to-hand combat techniques could be quantified, Chris would be a straight <strong>MAX</strong>.</p>
<p>Except for gunfire, monster vomit, and the bombs set by Ethan's brother-in-law <strong>Lucas</strong>, every attack could be countered with a <strong>Parry</strong> and <strong>execution</strong>.</p>
<p>Just like the hidden blade counters in <strong>Assassin's Creed</strong>, Chris could block an attack, shove the monster away, and finish it off with a single strike.</p>
<p>However, compared to Joe Baker's rampage, Chris's journey wasn't as smooth.</p>
<p>Well, "not smooth" mostly applied to his teammates—much to the dismay of players.</p>
<p>Right from the start, three teammates went missing. The first one was found, only to be killed right in front of Chris within minutes.</p>
<p>The second teammate lasted longer but still ended up dead.</p>
<p>The third teammate had it worst—just as he muttered "Thank God, I thought you'd abandoned me," he followed his brothers to the grave.</p>
<p>Many players couldn't help but pity these poor <strong>Tool-man</strong> teammates.</p>
<p>But then again, wasn't this <strong>Mr. Chen</strong>'s way of showing mercy? In a typical horror game, the protagonist, heroine, or major supporting characters would have to die to hit players hard.</p>
<p>But if only minor characters bit the dust, players wouldn't feel as devastated!</p>
<p>This cathartic DLC experience thrilled countless players. After being tormented for so long, it was finally their turn to torment the Fungal Beasts!</p>
<hr />
<p>"Old Song, have you played the <strong>Resident Evil</strong> DLCs yet? Absolutely exhilarating! Punching Fungal Beasts, kicking the brother-in-law—one word: <strong>Satisfying</strong>!" Zhang Yi laughed heartily as he opened a call with Song Ren.</p>
<p>On the other end, Song Ren sounded bewildered.</p>
<p>He had already sealed the game away—wasn't this supposed to be a <strong>horror game</strong>?</p>
<p>What did "satisfying" even mean here?</p>
<p>"Damn it, this is <strong>Resident Evil</strong>?!" Song Ren was stunned after seeing the <strong>screenshot</strong> Zhang Yi sent.</p>
<p>It was ultra-violent! Stomping Fungal Beast heads, punching them into oblivion—nothing like the <strong>Resident Evil</strong> he remembered!</p>
<p>"Exactly! Highly recommend you try it. Super stress-relieving, and no jump scares either." Zhang Yi chuckled.</p>
<p>"Say no more, I'm logging in right now!" Song Ren's interest was piqued.</p>
<p>The setting was still dark, and the enemies were still Fungal Beasts, but the feeling of hunting them down instead of being hunted was entirely different!</p>
<p>He hung up immediately, leaving Zhang Yi momentarily speechless.</p>
<p>"Ah... I forgot to tell Old Song that you have to <strong>Clear the Game</strong> to unlock the DLCs." Zhang Yi scratched his head, staring at the blackened phone screen.</p>
<hr />
<p>Returning to the <strong>Baker family</strong>'s farm, Song Ren found himself in an awkward situation.</p>
<p>After scouring the <strong>UI interface</strong>, he couldn't find the DLC entrances Zhang Yi mentioned. A quick search online revealed the truth:</p>
<p><strong>You had to Clear the Game first?!</strong></p>
<p>He hadn't even met the brother-in-law yet in his playthrough!</p>
<p>Of course, he wasn't the only one struggling. Many players were caught in the same dilemma.</p>
<p>Most weren't expecting <strong>rewards</strong>—those had been snapped up within six hours of the game's launch.</p>
<p>The remaining players were either curious or aiming for the guaranteed three-game reward bundle, which was a decent perk if redeemed on the <strong>VR platform</strong>.</p>
<p>But many had also quit halfway, too scared to continue.</p>
<p>Yet giving up now felt like a waste!</p>
<p>According to those who had Cleared the Game, <strong>Resident Evil</strong> was truly a masterpiece.</p>
<p>And after finishing it, players could turn the tables and beat up Fungal Beasts.</p>
<p>But these DLCs were locked behind the <strong>Cleared the Game</strong> requirement.</p>
<p>So... maybe endure a little longer?</p>
<p>With this mindset, many players gritted their teeth and pressed on—though whether they'd succeed was another matter.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Chen</strong>, however, suspected not many would make it.</p>
<p>Based on backend data, the game's <strong>Clear Rate</strong> was abysmal.</p>
<p>On the <strong>PC platform</strong>, only <strong>31.7%</strong> of players had earned the <strong>Cleared the Game</strong> achievement.</p>
<p>On <strong>VR</strong>, that number plummeted to a pitiful <strong>5.1%</strong>.</p>
<p>Chen Xu couldn't help but sigh at the figures.</p>
<hr />
<p>Though few players had personally Cleared the Game, many were still deeply invested in the lore.</p>
<p>Sharp-eyed players noticed subtle world-building details in Chris's DLC, hinting at <strong>Resident Evil</strong>'s expansive <strong>worldview</strong>.</p>
<p>For instance, Chris belonged to an organization called <strong>BSAA</strong>, while his teammates were from <strong>Umbrella Corporation</strong>, identifiable by its blue <strong>umbrella logo</strong>.</p>
<p>Yet, Chris clearly distrusted Umbrella.</p>
<p>Dialogue suggested Umbrella had once caused a catastrophic disaster, leading to a restructuring that stripped them of armed forces. Now, they outsourced biohazard containment to <strong>BSAA</strong>, with Chris as the liaison.</p>
<p>Chris even remarked that the <strong>Baker family</strong> incident barely ranked among the horrors he'd faced.</p>
<p>Combined with the post-credits scene after defeating <strong>Evelyn</strong>, players realized <strong>Resident Evil</strong> wasn’t just a <strong>Halloween</strong> "surprise" from <strong>Mr. Chen</strong>.</p>
<p>It felt like the setup for a much larger narrative!</p>
<p>Online, alongside terrified players, many were dissecting <strong>Resident Evil</strong>'s deeper themes.</p>
<p>What kind of company was <strong>The Alliance Corporation</strong>? What was <strong>BSAA</strong>? What had <strong>Umbrella</strong> done to earn Chris's distrust?</p>
<p>And what was the true fate of <strong>Ethan</strong> and <strong>Mia</strong>?</p>
<p>These unanswered questions gnawed at players, and the more they dug, the more <strong>huge traps</strong> they uncovered!</p>
