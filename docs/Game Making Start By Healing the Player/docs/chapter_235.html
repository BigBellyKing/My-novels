<p>Chapter 234: New Game Plans (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>For twenty-four hours, countless people closely watched the performance of the Nebula Games Platform, especially regarding whether games not developed by Nebula Games could achieve decent results on this platform.</p>
<p>This was something all industry designers were concerned about, as well as every major channel provider.</p>
<p>By noon the next day, Chen Xu had already posted the previously compiled data online.</p>
<p>Excluding games under Nebula Games.</p>
<p>The best-selling title was a game called <em>Demon and Deity</em>, a new release from a domestically small but well-known Independent Game studio.</p>
<p>A side-scrolling action game where the core Gameplay involved players acquiring various Skills and corresponding BUFFs as they progressed. The game featured two distinct paths, and ultimately, the player's choices in Skills, BUFFs, and story decisions determined whether they followed the Demon Route or the Deity Route.</p>
<p>Priced at 48 Yuan, it sold 112,000 copies on its first day, making it the highest first-day sales among all games launched on the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>The second best-selling title was a simulation game titled <em>The Vagrant</em>, where players assumed the role of a homeless person striving to improve their life. Supported by an online multiplayer mode and being particularly streamer-friendly, it was a game boosted significantly by live streaming. Although its player rating was slightly lower than <em>Demon and Deity</em>, it still achieved an impressive first-day sale of 71,000 copies.</p>
<p>Additionally, several older titles also performed well, such as <em>Love Dreamland</em>, a text-based Adventure Game brought onto the Nebula Games platform by a minor channel partner.</p>
<p>Thanks to excellent character development and story, it achieved first-day sales of 31,000 copies.</p>
<p>After these figures were released, they sent shockwaves throughout the domestic gaming industry.</p>
<p>Previously, many Game Designers had hesitated to join the Nebula Games Platform, primarily due to concerns that while it looked promising, players might still only buy games developed by Nebula Games themselves.</p>
<p>Now, however, all the data clearly showed that the Nebula Games Platform's ecosystem was perfectly healthy.</p>
<p>Admittedly, some games underperformed, but that was due to quality issues.</p>
<p>Even if those same games had been released on TengHua or NetDragon's platforms, unless heavily promoted, their results would likely have been similar.</p>
<p>Designers who had previously been on the fence were now excited, rushing to publish their games on the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>They hoped to take advantage of the relatively low number of early releases to secure better recommendation slots.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, major channel providers were left in despair, yet completely powerless.</p>
<p>By this point, Nebula Games had simply become too formidable.</p>
<p>With <em>Minecraft</em> thriving at its peak, there was no way to counter it.</p>
<p>And there was an even more significant reason: the Game Department had actually reposted Chen Xu's official Weibo account.</p>
<p>Though no official statement was made, the implication was obvious.</p>
<p>A week later, major game channels successively announced their new policies.</p>
<p>They shifted from the original 50-50 split, or even channel 70%, developer 30%, to developer 70%, channel 30%.</p>
<p>Yet even so, many game developers still chose to leave.</p>
<p>Clearly, with the emergence of the Nebula Games Platform, the era of channels reigning supreme was over.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>The online world remained turbulent, with both players and industry designers still discussing the Nebula Games Platform and the recent channel upheaval.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu had been quite relaxed lately.</p>
<p>Within Nebula Games, there was still a recruitment plan in the works, as the company's transformation into an open platform significantly increased costs related to community maintenance.</p>
<p>Customer service for refunds, community management, and Workshop censorship could mostly be outsourced, but the final review process would still need to be handled internally by Nebula Games.</p>
<p>Lost in thought, Chen Xu took a cup of coke and walked into the rest area.</p>
<p>Seeing Chen Xu arrive, Ruan Ningxue and the others, who rarely took a break from building dark rooms in <em>Minecraft</em>, were instead gathered together chatting. Upon noticing Chen Xu, Ruan Ningxue excitedly said, "Mr. Chen! Other Game Designers in the industry are now calling us the 'Dragon-Slaying Heroes'!"</p>
<p>The other employees nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Clearly, the massive impact Nebula Games had made on the entire gaming industry had made it hard for them to contain their excitement.</p>
<p>"Alright, settle down. 'Dragon-Slaying Heroes'—it's fun to hear, but remember this: while we may have changed some aspects of the gaming world, what matters most to us is creating more interesting games. Building the platform was simply so we wouldn't have to worry about pleasing channels anymore," Chen Xu said, his expression turning slightly more serious.</p>
<p>In truth, this was half sincere and half strategic.</p>
<p>Chen Xu genuinely disliked the domestic channel platforms, but he never intended to completely eliminate them.</p>
<p>Because on some level, channels were still necessary—they provided a platform for designers lacking marketing resources.</p>
<p>The problem lay in the original 50-50 split, or even the channel 70%, developer 30% model, which was clearly distorted.</p>
<p>But did that mean platforms shouldn't make money?</p>
<p>The answer, of course, was no.</p>
<p>Chen Xu had no intention of running a charity.</p>
<p>The 25% commission rule was the result of rigorous internal discussions.</p>
<p>Under this model, Nebula Games still made a profit.</p>
<p>And as game sales and profits increased, they would earn even more.</p>
<p>Chen Xu's goal had never been to destroy all channels, but rather to offer more Game Designers a better choice.</p>
<p>Now that he had the resources, capability, and personal motivation, he stepped forward.</p>
<p>It was that simple.</p>
<p>"Alright, don't look so serious. Make games happily, then collect your bonuses happily. Don't overthink it," Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Also, weren't you all curious about what our next new work would be?"</p>
<p>"Well, let me give you a little hint—our new game will incorporate our latest AI technology," Chen Xu said, smiling at the group.</p>
<p>Hearing this, everyone's eyes widened with curiosity.</p>
<p>"New technology? When will development on the new game start, Mr. Chen!?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah! What kind of game will it be?"</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin looked extremely curious.</p>
<p>Although Chen Xu had already hinted that a meeting to initiate the project wouldn't be far off—after all, before announcing the platform's transformation, he had already suggested their upcoming development plans would focus on large-scale games.</p>
<p>But the thing was, if he wasn't going to say anything, fine. Now that he'd dropped this hint, it was like being tickled—utterly unbearable!</p>
<p>"Alright then, I'll give you one more clue," Chen Xu said, flashing a knowing smile. "The theme of the new game will be... hunting." With that, he turned and walked away.</p>
