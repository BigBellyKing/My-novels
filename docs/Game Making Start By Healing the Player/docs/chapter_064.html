<p>Chapter 64 Promotion Interview</p>
<p>"Qin Yi, the rice is already burnt, and you're still chopping vegetables!"</p>
<p>"What am I supposed to do? You said you'd wash the dishes, but there's not a single plate left to wash! If I don't chop, what else can I do?"</p>
<p>"I'm so mad I could die!"</p>
<p>"I'm dying of anger too!"</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games' office, Zhao Zhuo, responsible for Level Design, and Qin Yi, responsible for Numerical Design, had the above conversation.</p>
<p>This was the fourth incident observed during testing after the game's DEMO release.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, are you sure our game is really meant for couples to strengthen their relationship?" Yang Xin looked at Chen Xu with a strange expression.</p>
<p>Beside her, Ruan Ningxue didn't say anything, but her head bobbing like a woodpecker clearly indicated she shared Yang Xin's thoughts.</p>
<p>"Ahem, of course it's not just for couples—friendship and brotherhood can also be nurtured through this game," Chen Xu solemnly summarized.</p>
<p>"The situation with Qin Yi and Zhao Zhuo is simply due to their strong competitiveness," Chen Xu added.</p>
<p>"I just feel like something's off," Yang Xin muttered, staring at the <em>Overcooked</em> game graphics in front of her.</p>
<p>At first, she thought this game was universally lovable.</p>
<p>But now?</p>
<p>She was holding back her judgment, since she had actually tried playing it herself.</p>
<p>Getting through on easy difficulty and clearing the levels wasn't much of a problem.</p>
<p>But aiming for three stars? That immediately spiked her blood pressure. There were moments when she barely managed to hold herself back.</p>
<p>"Alright, for the promotional video, Sister Xin and Senior Sister, you two keep an eye on it. I've got a media interview to attend to."</p>
<p>Chen Xu changed the subject as the two women looked ready to continue discussing <em>Overcooked</em>.</p>
<p>"A media interview?" Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue were slightly surprised.</p>
<p>"It's an exclusive interview with Game Timespace, also part of the new game's promotional preparations," Chen Xu explained.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, the two nodded in understanding.</p>
<p>After exchanging a few more words with Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin, Chen Xu walked toward the office.</p>
<p>Although this interview was primarily intended to promote <em>Overcooked</em>,</p>
<p>in truth, quite a few media outlets had recently shown interest in him.</p>
<p>After all, within the broader gaming industry, compared to top-tier game designers and masters, Chen Xu still had some way to go in terms of fame.</p>
<p>But at least in the independent gaming community, the name Chen Xu carried some weight.</p>
<p>"Teacher Chen, what an honor! What an honor!"</p>
<p>Pushing open the office door, Wu Tian, editor from Game Timespace, greeted Chen Xu with an excited expression.</p>
<p>Ever since he accidentally discovered <em>Undertale</em> and experienced the profound impact it left on him,</p>
<p>he had quietly followed Chen Xu's work. And Chen Xu had never disappointed him.</p>
<p><em>To the Moon</em> moved him so deeply that even a tough guy like him shed tears.</p>
<p>As for <em>Outlast</em>,</p>
<p>although subjectively speaking, he wasn't particularly fond of horror games,</p>
<p>he had to admit it was undoubtedly an excellent horror game—one capable of making even the bravest man pee his pants.</p>
<p>In short, Wu Tian had long admired Chen Xu, the game designer.</p>
<p>So when he learned he had a chance to interview him, he immediately requested the opportunity from the editor-in-chief.</p>
<p>"No need to call me Teacher Chen. Just use my name," Chen Xu said, feeling slightly awkward.</p>
<p>Although in his previous life, with the rise of countless new talents, the glory associated with "Teacher Chen" and his hard drive full of legendary content had long faded,</p>
<p>in the photography world, "Teacher Chen" was still considered a pioneering master.</p>
<p>So whenever someone addressed him as "Teacher Chen," it always felt a bit off to him, somehow not quite legitimate.</p>
<p>Wu Tian paused, momentarily at a loss. To him, "Teacher" was just an honorific—common and perfectly normal within the gaming industry.</p>
<p>"Um… alright then, Mr. Chen. First of all, thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to grant us this interview."</p>
<p>After a moment of thought, Wu Tian changed his tone. Though he didn't understand why Chen Xu disliked the "Teacher" title, calling him by name felt too informal.</p>
<p>"No need to be so tense or formal. Let's just chat casually for now," Chen Xu smiled, pulling a bottle of coke from a nearby box and handing it to Wu Tian, then taking one for himself.</p>
<p>"Um… o-okay," Wu Tian stammered, instinctively accepting the coke, placing it in front of him, and responding meekly as he looked at Chen Xu's friendly smile.</p>
<p>"Then let's start by talking about <em>Undertale</em>. Since we couldn't report much on <em>Mirror (Game)</em> previously, with <em>Undertale</em>, I mainly noticed a gap in the market—a lack of games with meta-concepts, which had previously appeared mostly in novels and films. So I wondered, why not apply this mode to games? And in terms of sense of immersion, games actually have a greater advantage."</p>
<p>"As for <em>To the Moon</em>, I believe countless players have already given their answers in their hearts. Regarding <em>Outlast</em>, I truly developed it with immense passion. Judging from player feedback, they clearly felt it too."</p>
<p>"When players want something, and the market lacks it, we step in and make it. That's exactly why I say I see myself as a Warrior of Love. Every one of our games overflows with passion for players—passion as intense as a volcano about to erupt."</p>
<p>"The same goes for our new game. Within this new game, too, lies my 'love' for players."</p>
<p>A new game!?</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, Wu Tian's eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Finally, a sensational hot topic! Though he understood that Nebula Games' main goal was likely promoting their new game,</p>
<p>at least now there was a bombshell—something exclusive to publish.</p>
<p>Eagerly, Wu Tian asked, "Mr. Chen, could you share a bit of information about the new game?"</p>
<p>"Of course. The new game will be a cooperative game suitable for all ages, launching on February 14th—Valentine's Day."</p>
<p>"We hope this game deepens the relationships between couples. And even if you don't have a partner, you can still enjoy it with your best friends, siblings, or close buddies. Together, experience the joy this game brings."</p>
<p>Chen Xu spoke with a warm, sincere smile.</p>
<p>At the same time, Chen Xu showed two concept art pieces from <em>Overcooked</em>.</p>
<p>The adorable Crocodile Chef, the Onion King, and Kevin the Dog. In a lively kitchen, two chefs wearing chef hats smiled brightly.</p>
<p>In four words: harmonious and loving.</p>
<p>Another four: joyful and warm.</p>
<p>At a glance, the game radiated warmth, clearly one of those must-play titles among friends.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>The interview didn't last long—less than twenty minutes.</p>
<p>With a smile as soothing as a spring breeze, Chen Xu personally escorted Wu Tian to the main entrance, watching him step into the elevator.</p>
<p>"Young people these days!" Chen Xu sighed, full of emotion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, inside the elevator, Wu Tian held his voice recorder and the unopened bottle of coke.</p>
<p>He finally snapped back to reality, reviewing the entire interview in his mind.</p>
<p>He felt a little dizzy.</p>
<p>Shouldn't he have been the interviewer? Why did he feel more like a stenographer?</p>
<p>Looking at the recorder and the coke in his hand, Wu Tian fell into deep thought.</p>
<p>When exactly had he lost control of the conversation?</p>
<p>Perhaps it started with this bottle of coke?</p>
<p>"But anyway, it's not like I gained nothing. The scoop about Chen Xu's new game is substantial. I'd better start drafting the news article quickly!"</p>
<p>"I'll use 'The Transmission of Love' as the main headline. And judging from the concept art, <em>Overcooked</em> looks incredibly heartwarming. Looks like players with girlfriends this Spring Festival are in for a wonderful holiday!"</p>
