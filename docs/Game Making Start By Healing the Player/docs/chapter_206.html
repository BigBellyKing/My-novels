                <p>Chapter 205: Doubts About the Design Concept Drafts (Fourth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>The people present in the meeting room were somewhat stunned.</p>
<p>Before this, they had understood that Chen Xu would soon lead them into developing a new project, and it was basically confirmed to be a sandbox game.</p>
<p>They had imagined various themes and related gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p>But now, looking at the building blocks toy Chen Xu placed on the table—used as a clearer example—both Qin Yi and Ruan Ningxue were somewhat baffled.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, is our next project a block-building game?" Yang Xin asked curiously, looking at the building blocks in front of her and the simple Concept Drafts displayed on the projector screen.</p>
<p>Although Chen Xu hadn't fully explained the detailed contents of the design concept drafts yet, Qin Yi and the others had already grasped some of the characteristics of the game titled <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>
<p>First, in terms of Art, the game adopted a pixel style.</p>
<p>Everything in the game was essentially composed of Pixel points and could be destroyed.</p>
<p>For instance, the basic pixel block in the game measured 1×1; thus, a large rock might be made up of four 1×1 blocks.</p>
<p>The same principle applied to all other elements.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, isn't the content of <em>Minecraft</em> too simple? I'm not referring to the extended combinations within the game, but rather the fundamental direction of the game itself," Qin Yi continued after Yang Xin, carefully choosing his words.</p>
<p>He didn't finish the sentence, but everyone present understood his implication.</p>
<p>Compared to <em>Don't Starve</em>, <em>Minecraft</em> didn't seem to have a clearly defined gameplay.</p>
<p>"Moreover, Mr. Chen, a large number of sandbox games are likely to launch soon," Zhang Yida spoke up. This was the aspect he, as the operations lead, cared about most.</p>
<p>It was also a critical core issue.</p>
<p>Other Game developers were all trying to capitalize on the sandbox game trend sparked by <em>Don't Starve</em>.</p>
<p>Some might produce inferior titles, but others could create excellent quality titles, all of which would impact <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>
<p>Additionally, there was another crucial factor: <em>Minecraft</em>, also a sandbox game, was launching too soon after <em>Don't Starve</em>.</p>
<p>If its quality fell short of <em>Don't Starve</em>, it could negatively affect Nebula Games' reputation.</p>
<p>"Also, regarding the game's art aspect, Mr. Chen, why are we using a pixel art style? It feels a bit strange," Ruan Ningxue, responsible for Art, voiced her confusion.</p>
<p>Pixel-style games were actually quite rare nowadays.</p>
<p>After all, pixel art often represented retro aesthetics. In the past, pixel game graphics were used due to limitations in display devices and console memory size.</p>
<p>Moreover, creating a high-quality pixel game was genuinely difficult. Pixel art, essentially bitmap, consisted of individual square Pixel points. To do it properly, artists had to meticulously place each pixel, which was even more labor-intensive than standard artwork.</p>
<p>Therefore, unless a game specifically targeted nostalgia or vintage appeal, developers nowadays generally avoided the pixel art style.</p>
<p>Yet <em>Minecraft</em> chose to adopt this style, which made Ruan Ningxue feel puzzled.</p>
<p>After all, judging from the design concept drafts, <em>Minecraft</em> didn't seem to be a retro game capitalizing on nostalgia.</p>
<p>One after another, everyone voiced their doubts.</p>
<p>Clearly, at this moment, developing such a sandbox game—especially one with a pixel art style—was confusing to them all.</p>
<p>After listening to everyone, Chen Xu smiled.</p>
<p>He didn't mind their skepticism.</p>
<p>In fact, he saw it as a good thing—everyone was actively thinking.</p>
<p>"First, recall what I previously told you about the core of <em>Don't Starve</em>. Survival provides players with a strong objective, but it's not the game's inner core. Creation is the true core of sandbox games."</p>
<p>"And in <em>Minecraft</em>, everything revolves around this central gameplay mechanic: 'creation'."</p>
<p>"This creation isn't just about stacking building blocks. It's about using <em>Minecraft</em> as a platform to enable players to invent their own gameplay."</p>
<p>"In fact, if other sandbox games launched at the same time all take <em>Don't Starve</em>'s survival mechanics as their reference point, they've already taken the wrong path. They might become excellent survival or cooperation games, but they won't become excellent sandbox games," Chen Xu explained to Qin Yi and the others.</p>
<p>Qin Yi pondered deeply. "So, a sandbox game is fundamentally based on creation and freedom—everything else can be discarded."</p>
<p>"Exactly. Of course, I wasn't sure earlier whether players would accept this unique sandbox gameplay. That's why <em>Don't Starve</em> served as a Trial Run. Judging from player feedback and results, it seems quite successful."</p>
<p>"Regarding the art style, I need to correct a misconception first. It's not that <em>Minecraft</em> must use a pixel art style, but rather that <em>Minecraft</em> needs to be pixelated! The pixelation is a sacrifice made for the sake of freedom and creation, because the gameplay of <em>Minecraft</em> dictates that this world must consist of countless blocks, just like building blocks," Chen Xu said.</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue suddenly understood.</p>
<p>These were two entirely different concepts. A pixel-style game simply adopted this art style, but <em>Minecraft</em> was different. It required the game world to be pixelated—meaning the world had to be divided into countless cubes, equivalent to the Pixel points in standard pixelation.</p>
<p>The foundational concept was completely different.</p>
<p>To put it simply, sandbox games like <em>Don't Starve</em> were like partially assembled toys.</p>
<p>When you bought such a toy, you had to assemble it, then customize its appearance and colors. But the fundamental structure remained unchanged.</p>
<p><em>Minecraft</em>, on the other hand, was like clay and Sand—seemingly ordinary at first glance, but what you could shape it into, whether beautiful or ugly, depended entirely on the player's creativity.</p>
<p><em>Don't Starve</em> operated within a predefined world with set rules, while <em>Minecraft</em>, true to its name, allowed players to create their own world.</p>
<p>The meeting room fell into deep silence, as everyone absorbed and reflected on Chen Xu's words.</p>
<p>"I see," Qin Yi nodded deeply.</p>
<p>Based solely on the design concept drafts, Qin Yi had felt <em>Minecraft</em> didn't seem particularly special.</p>
<p>But after Chen Xu's thorough breakdown, he now fully understood.</p>
<p>Although he couldn't be certain whether such a game would gain acceptance from players and the market,</p>
<p>one thing was certain:</p>
<p>Chen Xu had clearly thought through <em>Minecraft</em> very carefully.</p>
<p>"Besides, pixel art doesn't have to be primitive. It can also be beautiful," Chen Xu said, looking at Ruan Ningxue.</p>
<p>Pixel style indeed symbolized retro aesthetics,</p>
<p>but that didn't mean it had to be retro.</p>
<p>Couldn't modern artistic techniques be applied to pixel art?</p>
<p>Of course they could. In Chen Xu's previous life, there was a famously renowned pixel game that perfectly integrated modern technology into pixel art—Square Enix's <em>Octopath Traveler</em>. (Due to SE's pricing, players nicknamed it <em>50 Per Square</em>.)</p>
<p>Its traditional narrative and fragmented ensemble storytelling weren't flawless, but its music and the fusion of modern technology with pixel art were truly outstanding.</p>
<p>Moreover, in Chen Xu's previous life, <em>Minecraft</em> could be enhanced with various HD texture packs and lighting and shadows effects, giving players a visual experience comparable to AAA-tier game graphics. This proved that pixel art didn't necessarily mean outdated graphics.</p>
