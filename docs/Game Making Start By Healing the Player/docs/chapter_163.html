<p>Chapter 162: The Looping Corridor (Fourth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>Before Chen Xu was darkness, and not a single sound reached his ears.</p>
<p>At the same time, Li Yue felt a chill sweep over him.</p>
<p>The semi-enclosed gaming pod came with its own cooling system, which players could choose to turn on or off. Some games could even regulate the temperature automatically.</p>
<p>‘Be careful, the crack in that Conduit… it’s a parallel reality.’</p>
<p>‘I am who I am. Are you sure you’re the only you?’</p>
<p>Two lines of subtitles appeared before Li Yue, leaving him slightly bewildered.</p>
<p>But before he could make sense of what those words meant, the game graphics appeared.</p>
<p>At the start of the game, it was clear the protagonist had just awakened from a cold floor. Combined with the cooling effect from the VR gaming pod, Li Yue involuntarily shivered.</p>
<p>And as he shivered, the in-game visuals synchronized with the movement.</p>
<p>A highly realistic cockroach crawled past right in front of him, causing Li Yue’s lips to twitch.</p>
<p>Although he stood at 185 cm tall, creatures like cockroaches and Broodmothers still unsettled him.</p>
<p>It wasn’t fear, exactly—just a deep sense of disgust.</p>
<p>At that moment, the tightly shut Wooden Door in the room suddenly creaked open by itself with a ‘creak’.</p>
<p>Yet Li Yue’s mind remained completely unperturbed.</p>
<p>After all, the game had just begun, and such scenarios weren’t uncommon. So Li Yue stayed calm.</p>
<p>He looked around. The starting area was a pitch-black room with bare cement walls on all sides. Directly ahead was a Wooden Door slightly ajar, and above the doorframe hung an incandescent bulb.</p>
<p>But it emitted only a weak, ghastly pale light.</p>
<p>He didn’t rush forward. Instead, Li Yue performed some basic operations in place.</p>
<p>He found he could only perform fundamental actions—walking, using his hands for simple operations, and crouching.</p>
<p>Actions like crawling, jumping, or sprinting elicited no response, clearly indicating the game hadn’t implemented such mechanics.</p>
<p>There were no UI prompts or anything similar, which didn’t surprise Li Yue. After all, this was just a test DEMO, not a full game.</p>
<p>He hoped the upcoming content would be more intense, more interesting.</p>
<p>Right now, Li Yue’s mood remained relaxed.</p>
<p>He pushed the door open. Outside lay a narrow corridor.</p>
<p>The space was barely wide enough for two people to walk side by side. Incandescent lights flickered along the walls and at the end of the corridor.</p>
<p>Yet the reach of the light was unnaturally small. Where the light touched, the area was bright.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, everything was deeply shadowed.</p>
<p>The stark contrast between light and darkness gave the game graphics a deeply eerie quality.</p>
<p>Li Yue also noticed something else: the murals on the walls. Some were clear, while others appeared deliberately blurred, making it impossible to discern what they depicted.</p>
<p>Thanks to the massive performance improvements of the new version VR equipment, the most direct result was that the game’s VR presentation felt increasingly lifelike.</p>
<p>This hyper-realistic graphics, combined with the unsettling Atmosphere, instantly amplified the tension.</p>
<p>Still, as a carefully selected tester, Li Yue had seen his share of intense situations. He paused only briefly in place, surveyed the surroundings, and then continued forward.</p>
<p>Midway down the corridor, on the right-hand side, was a recess containing a table.</p>
<p>On it sat a digital clock, displaying the time—23:59.</p>
<p>On the wall above the clock hung several extremely blurred paintings. One appeared to depict a U-shape, with a black dot in the center—an image that looked deeply unsettling.</p>
<p>Next to the table corner lay a pile of empty liquor bottles, hinting the room’s owner might have been an alcoholic.</p>
<p>Nothing seemed particularly significant.</p>
<p>Yet something felt off.</p>
<p>Mainly, the surroundings were too silent.</p>
<p>Each footstep echoed on the floor, reverberating as if treading directly on Li Yue’s heart.</p>
<p>This silence, broken only by footsteps, made the entire gameplay experience feel oppressive.</p>
<p>After confirming the digital clock held no special significance, Li Yue continued forward along the corridor.</p>
<p>Soon, he reached the end of the corridor—a corner.</p>
<p>Beyond the corner stretched another narrow corridor.</p>
<p>To the left stood a wooden cabinet in disarray.</p>
<p>It held a seemingly damaged telephone, a photo of what appeared to be the house’s male and female owners, and scattered across the table were numerous white pills—everything in chaos.</p>
<p>Just like before, Li Yue found nothing unusual and continued walking forward.</p>
<p>At the corner stood a tightly shut door that wouldn’t open. Ahead, a large doorway leading to the catacomb stood open. To the left was a coat rack; to the right, a framed photo of the couple, a radio, and a pile of cigarette butts.</p>
<p>Directly above, a dimly lit chandelier hung from the second floor.</p>
<p>As Li Yue approached, a burst of static noise erupted from the radio, gradually sharpening into clarity.</p>
<p>It seemed to be broadcasting a news report.</p>
<p>‘On the day of the tragedy, the father went to the trunk of his car, retrieved a hunting rifle, and shot his wife who was cleaning the kitchen after lunch.’</p>
<p>‘When his 10-year-old son came to investigate the noise, the father shot him too.’</p>
<p>‘His 6-year-old daughter cleverly hid in the bathroom, but the report stated he told her it was just a game and lured her out. She was shot point-blank in the chest.’</p>
<p>‘The wife, killed by her husband, had been pregnant at the time.’</p>
<p>‘After neighbors made alarm calls, state police arrived at the scene. They found the father sitting in his car, listening to the radio.’</p>
<p>‘In the days before the tragedy, neighbors said they heard the father loudly repeating a sequence of numbers, as if chanting a strange incantation.’</p>
<p>‘Last month, another family in the same state suffered a similar shooting. And another case occurred last December.’</p>
<p>‘A man used a hunting rifle and a meat cleaver to murder his entire family. In each case, the perpetrator was the father.’</p>
<p>‘State police say these family tragedies appear unrelated, though they might stem from common real-world issues like unemployment, child-rearing stress, and other societal pressures.’</p>
<p>Li Yue stood still, waiting. From the radio broadcast, he gathered crucial information.</p>
<p>Could it be that the house he was in was the very one where that tragedy occurred? And was he playing the role of the father who committed the murders?</p>
<p>Privately, Li Yue glanced around. Just like before—nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>Yet still, a faint unease stirred in his chest.</p>
<p>Because he couldn’t shake the feeling that a monster might suddenly appear and scare him.</p>
<p>Yet so far, there hadn’t been any high-intensity scenes.</p>
<p>He had played Chen Xu’s Outlast before, and while many parts startled him, it was just jump scares.</p>
<p>But this simple DEMO called Silent Hill PT gave him a completely different sensation.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just because it was a VR game. More importantly, it was the game’s overall Atmosphere.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Li Yue forced himself to stop dwelling on these chaotic thoughts and focused his attention entirely on the game ahead. After all, he was here to test it.</p>
<p>He crept forward step by step, slower than an old man strolling through a park.</p>
<p>Passing through the open doorway, descending the stairs, and opening another door, Li Yue froze completely.</p>
<p>Because everything before him felt painfully familiar.</p>
<p>It was the same long corridor from the beginning of the game.</p>
<p>He… had returned?</p>
<p>Two lights shone, one ahead and one behind. The blurred mural on the left wall still hung there. The digital clock read 23:59.</p>
<p>A supernatural loop?</p>
<p>Suddenly, Li Yue felt a chill run through his entire body.</p>
<p>Up to this point, the entire game had remained within the confines of this corridor.</p>
<p>Aside from the cockroach at the beginning, no other moving entity had appeared. Yet already, a deep sense of oppression and a creeping panic had begun to take root in his heart.</p>
