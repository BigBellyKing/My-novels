                <h1>Chapter 38 The True Meaning of Going to the Moon</h1>
<p>Why did Johnny want to go to the moon?</p>
<p>Because even though his childhood memories had been blurred by beta-blockers,</p>
<p>even though he had already forgotten that he had actually met Liva long ago,</p>
<p>he still remembered that one promise.</p>
<p>【What if we get lost, or forget?】</p>
<p>【Then let's meet on the moon!】</p>
<p>During the days after Liva left Johnny, this thought slowly surfaced from the depths of his memory.</p>
<p>He had forgotten everything—how he and Liva first met, their conversations.</p>
<p>But the one thing he still remembered was that he needed to go to the moon, because Liva had already vanished from his life, and he had to find her on the moon.</p>
<p>Similarly, why did Liva keep folding paper bunnies throughout her life?</p>
<p>Because from Johnny's words, Liva realized that Johnny no longer remembered their very first meeting.</p>
<p>So throughout her entire life, Liva kept folding paper bunnies, using her own way to remind Johnny that they had actually met long ago.</p>
<p>Likewise, Liva was willing to sacrifice her health just to build houses, all in an effort to make Johnny remember everything.</p>
<p>Because during their first meeting, Liva had opened her heart to Johnny, comparing stars to lighthouses gazing at each other from afar.</p>
<p>And Johnny sensed something special about Liva—something he deeply needed.</p>
<p>And it was also because they had already met before.</p>
<p>All the mysteries were finally unveiled.</p>
<p>What Johnny truly wanted wasn't to go to the moon—what he truly wanted was to reach Liva's side.</p>
<p>I can't express my inner feelings in words, but I'll spend my entire life trying to make you remember—shining like a beacon, guiding you. It's an obsession, a kind of obsession no one else understands.</p>
<p>Even if I've lost all memories of you, I've never once forgotten our promise to meet on the moon.</p>
<p>Seeing Liva holding the platypus, gazing at the distant moon—</p>
<p>in that instant, the eyes of every player blurred with tears.</p>
<p>‘Damn it, what kind of game is this! I can't see the game graphics anymore!’</p>
<p>‘Can't see the game graphics +1.’</p>
<p>‘F***, my eyes are burning! Must be from watching the live stream for too long!’</p>
<p>‘Earlier parts of the game felt kinda boring, but now I just want to scream—WHY!’</p>
<p>‘Tears bursting! I just can’t hold back anymore!’</p>
<p>‘Men, cry, cry—it's not a crime! Look, the boss’s eyes are red!’</p>
<p>‘What does “tough guy crying” mean? This right here is what it means!’</p>
<p>‘I’m overwhelmed! I completely was overwhelmed!’</p>
<p>The game employed the flashback technique, starting with the mystery of going to the moon, stirring up players’ curiosity and confusion.</p>
<p>Gradually, it peeled back layer after layer of secrets, finally showcasing the truth before the players.</p>
<p>Combined with the game's background audio, it instantly moved countless players.</p>
<p>Especially emotional players—when everything was revealed, they couldn’t help but burst into tears.</p>
<p>Whether male or female,</p>
<p>all were deeply touched by the story between Liva and Johnny.</p>
<p>‘What the heck, I never expected this game to wreck me like this!’ Grabbing a napkin from the side, Dong Zhen blew his nose, his eyes red from holding back tears.</p>
<p>Yet, what surprised everyone was that the game hadn’t ended here.</p>
<p>As Dr. Neil and Dr. Eva continued their conversation, everyone suddenly remembered—</p>
<p>this was all within Johnny's memories.</p>
<p>They still had a contract with Johnny: go to the moon.</p>
<p>Neil: ‘What if they really did get lost? ... Wait, does this mean?’</p>
<p>Eva: ‘Don’t tell me you didn’t see it coming.’</p>
<p>Neil: ‘I thought this would turn into an inspirational fairy tale…’</p>
<p>Eva: ‘I should’ve known some Little Sister would show up and turn it into a farce… I think now we know exactly how to send him to the moon.’</p>
<p>Neil: ‘Wait, you’re not seriously thinking of doing that! You wouldn’t!’</p>
<p>Eva: ‘It’s our job, Neil… It’s our contractual obligation.’</p>
<p>Neil: ‘Damn it… Eva, wait!’</p>
<p>As the two conversed, Eva’s figure disappeared from Johnny’s childhood memories.</p>
<p>Then Neil chased after her.</p>
<p>Sitting in front of the computer, Dong Zhen suddenly felt a bad premonition.</p>
<p>‘Wait, what does this female doctor plan to do?’</p>
<p>Through memory, Neil located Eva in Johnny’s high school days.</p>
<p>At the same time, the game’s background music grew tense and urgent, and the graphics shifted to a dark yellow, old-photo filter style.</p>
<p>Neil: ‘I know what you’re planning to do!’</p>
<p>Eva: ‘Listen, our contract requires sending him to the moon. The only way to achieve that is to give Johnny motivation to go to the moon.’</p>
<p>Neil: ‘So you mean removing Liva? But if we do that, what’s the point of going to the moon? The real reason he wants to go is precisely because Liva left him!’</p>
<p>Eva: ‘I understand, but we’re bound by law and contract, especially…’</p>
<p>Neil: ‘Screw your %￥# contract! My job isn’t to make him suffer more! Eva! I don’t know about you, but I do this job so those odd old men can leave this world in peace and happiness! What about you?’</p>
<p>As their dialogue unfolded, Dong Zhen’s dreadful suspicion was finally confirmed.</p>
<p>This female doctor actually intended to remove Liva!</p>
<p>Even though her reasoning seemed perfectly justified,</p>
<p>players who had spent hours experiencing Johnny and Liva’s story simply couldn’t accept such an outcome.</p>
<p>‘What the heck, how can this old hag be so heartless!’</p>
<p>‘Why’s this old hag so rigid!’</p>
<p>‘I can’t take this anymore! I just can’t!’</p>
<p>The more deeply players had been moved by Liva and Johnny’s story before,</p>
<p>the angrier they were now.</p>
<p>Dong Zhen, live streaming, couldn’t help but slam the table.</p>
<p>And in the live stream room, bullet comments flooded the screen.</p>
<p>Clearly, no one could accept this situation.</p>
<p>What the hell!</p>
<p>Who cares about contracts or laws!</p>
<p>Johnny doesn’t need to go to the moon—he needs Liva!</p>
<p>And now, this old hag actually wants to erase Liva? How is that bearable?</p>
<p>Yet, whether it was the viewers watching the live stream, players like Dong Zhen, or even Neil inside the game—none of them seemed able to stop what was happening.</p>
<p>With higher system authority, Eva kept removing and modifying Liva from every corner of Johnny’s memories.</p>
<p>And during this process, she even set up numerous traps to block Neil.</p>
