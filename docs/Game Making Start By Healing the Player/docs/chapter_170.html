<p>Chapter 169: Players Might Be a Bit Emotionally Excited (Fourth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>In Modu, at the fifth exhibition of gameplay Expo, many staff members were busy working.</p>
<p>Different from last year's participation, this year Nebula Games' booth had moved to the third exhibition area.</p>
<p>After all, with both Dark Souls and It Takes Two under its belt, Nebula Games’ reputation and scale could no longer be considered that of an Independent Game developer.</p>
<p>As for TengHua and NetDragon, they each still occupied one exhibition area, just like last year.</p>
<p>The third exhibition area was mostly filled with second- and third-tier Game developers.</p>
<p>The booth sizes were distributed fairly evenly, and Nebula Games’ booth space was about the same as last year’s.</p>
<p>"It feels like the surrounding Game developers really respect us!" Ruan Ningxue sighed with emotion while arranging the booth.</p>
<p>As she spoke, Yang Xin chimed in: "Yeah, it feels like they’re watching us closely. Some designers even came over earlier to probe for information and fish for details!"</p>
<p>"Well, Mr. Chen took all the spotlight last year," Lin Tao chuckled from the side.</p>
<p>"But this year, I feel like we’re just here to fill space. The only thing we can really show is the promotional trailer for the Dark Souls prequel," Ruan Ningxue said with some regret.</p>
<p>"Can't be helped. We didn't have enough time. Besides, Mr. Chen already released Silent Hill PT online ahead of schedule. If we'd saved it for the exhibition, just imagine how surprised the players would’ve been!" Yang Xin sighed with emotion.</p>
<p>Nearby, a group of cosers rehearsing their performance stumbled mid-step upon hearing this.</p>
<p>Most of these cosers were also game players, so naturally they couldn't have missed the recent online sensation—the so-called scariest DEMO, Silent Hill PT.</p>
<p>Even those who hadn’t downloaded and played it themselves had still learned about it through gaming media, videos, or livestreams.</p>
<p>If that thing had been brought to the exhibition, the players would’ve been absolutely thrilled.</p>
<p>As the team continued setting up, they suddenly saw Chen Xu and Qin Yi approaching the booth entrance, leading a group of staff members pushing a small cart.</p>
<p>"Hey! Mr. Chen, are these new COS props? Why do they look so weird?"</p>
<p>"Yeah! What’s going on here? Inflatable hammers and fishbowl sofas? What even is this!?"</p>
<p>Seeing the props Chen Xu and Qin Yi had brought over, Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, and the others grew curious.</p>
<p>The props delivered on the cart looked custom-made.</p>
<p>There were four black, tank-like sofas, each about 80 centimeters high—just reaching Qin Yi’s mid-thigh.</p>
<p>Inside each fishbowl-shaped sofa sat a large construction sledgehammer, though these were inflatable versions.</p>
<p>At this peculiar sight, everyone grew even more intrigued.</p>
<p>"We made a mini-game in our spare time with Qin Yi. We’ll set it up here at the booth these few days just to fill space. These are the game’s props, meant to enhance the player’s sense of immersion," Chen Xu explained with a smile.</p>
<p>"Ah, I see!" Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin exclaimed, suddenly understanding.</p>
<p>Still, they remained curious about exactly what kind of game Chen Xu had created.</p>
<p>When Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin pressed him for details, Chen Xu simply shrugged and smiled without answering.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Qin Yi stood staring at the four fishbowl sofas and the four hammers, looking like he wanted to say something but hesitated.</p>
<p>After a moment’s thought, Qin Yi quietly walked over to the booth’s staff members to talk.</p>
<p>"Could we possibly get extra security assigned to our booth tomorrow? The players’ emotions might get… a bit intense."</p>
<p>The security guard on duty was clearly a Dark Souls fan. Upon hearing Qin Yi’s words and spotting the game badge on his chest, he grinned: "No problem! I totally get it! You’re doing a trial demo for the Dark Souls prequel, right? Of course players will be excited—it’s been way too long!"</p>
<p>Seeing the guard’s cheerful, expectant expression, Qin Yi’s face grew even more complicated.</p>
<p>Demo? Was there even such a thing?</p>
<p>And the kind of excitement you’re thinking of… is completely different from what I meant!</p>
<p>…………………</p>
<p>On the day of the exhibition, gameplay Expo was once again packed, just like last year.</p>
<p>Many local Modu players had come, along with others who had traveled specially from out of town, hoping to try out some new games at the event.</p>
<p>At the entrance, players were discussing:</p>
<p>This year, game developers NetDragon and TengHua didn’t have any major highlights. Aside from titles from their third-party studios, there were no blockbuster announcements to stir excitement.</p>
<p>Still, they remained the top destination for most players, simply because they had more games.</p>
<p>As for Nebula Games, a significant number of players headed straight there too. After all, Chen Xu had already announced on the official Weibo account that the latest news about the sequel would be revealed at gameplay Expo.</p>
<p>Added to that was the recent online buzz generated by Silent Hill PT, which had brought Nebula Games even more attention.</p>
<p>Of course, there were also many loyal fans of Nebula Games.</p>
<p>"I wonder what Chen Xu will bring this year!" Zhang Yi said, full of anticipation.</p>
<p>"How about something like Silent Hill PT!" Wang Han replied from the side.</p>
<p>"Anything new is fine, as long as it’s not another horror game," said Song Ren, tall and broad-shouldered.</p>
<p>"By the way, didn’t Wang Yifan and Joey come this year?" Wang Han asked curiously.</p>
<p>"Joey broke his leg and couldn’t make it. Wang Yifan’s on a business trip this month and couldn’t get time off," Song Ren explained.</p>
<p>But as soon as Zhang Yi and Song Ren arrived at the Nebula Games booth, they were utterly bewildered.</p>
<p>Because there were just too many people.</p>
<p>The entire hall was packed. Although security guards were maintaining order and everyone was queuing up voluntarily, the sheer volume of people was overwhelming.</p>
<p>From a distance, the stage seemed nearly empty aside from the performing showgirls and cosers.</p>
<p>But soon, Zhang Yi and the others understood why.</p>
<p>After the opening cosplay performance ended, a familiar figure stepped onto the stage.</p>
<p>"Hello, everyone!" Chen Xu took the microphone and smiled, greeting the audience.</p>
<p>The crowd waved back enthusiastically.</p>
<p>‘Finally got to see Chen Xu in person!’</p>
<p>‘When will he announce the Dark Souls prequel news?’</p>
<p>‘Is Silent Hill PT just a DEMO?’</p>
<p>The players chattered excitedly, voicing all sorts of thoughts.</p>
<p>Chen Xu gestured for quiet, then continued: "I believe the reason most of you came here first is for this!"</p>
<p>As Chen Xu spoke, the crowd erupted into excited cheers.</p>
<p>On the large screen behind him, an icon appeared.</p>
<p>The bonfire from Dark Souls, with the Coiled Sword stabbed into it!</p>
<p>An Undead in Armor, kneeling before the bonfire, slowly emerged into view.</p>
<p>As the video played on the screen, the crowd gradually fell silent, leaving only the background audio from the booth’s speakers.</p>
<p>The video didn’t end there. The bonfire continued to burn.</p>
<p>As the flames intensified, the画面 began to distort and blur.</p>
<p>The Undead kneeling on the ground slowly faded away,</p>
<p>Eventually dissolving into a white mist.</p>
<p>The flames burned brighter, and the mist gradually covered the entire screen.</p>
<p>Then, in the midst of the players’ uncontrollable cheers, an old, weathered narration began.</p>
