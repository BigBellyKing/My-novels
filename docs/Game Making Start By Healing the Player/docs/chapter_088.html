                <p>Chapter 88: Don't Nebula Games Players Have Their Own Booth?</p>
<p>It could be said that <em>Fall Guys</em> is an incredibly addictive game.</p>
<p>In Chen Xu's previous life, as a game developed by a small studio, it sold over 2 million copies within its first week of launch, and over 10 million in a single month.</p>
<p>That was truly exaggerated.</p>
<p>It could definitely be called a phenomenon-level game.</p>
<p>Although later on, due to various reasons on the part of the game developers, the game failed to sustain that level of popularity for very long, </p>
<p>from the perspective of the game's inherent attributes, its success was inevitable.</p>
<p>Where exactly lies the true magic of this game?</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay, apart from <em>Fall Guys</em>, no other game has successfully combined variety show obstacle course challenges with video games.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game mechanism of eliminating players immediately upon losing allows participants to seamlessly enter the next match, greatly reducing negative feedback from players.</p>
<p>Before players grow tired of the levels, the rich and diverse obstacle course challenges—similar to those seen on variety shows—function like a collection of mini-games, offering extremely high replay value.</p>
<p>Of course, once players do grow tired of it, that becomes another issue altogether—players then perceive the content as being too repetitive.</p>
<p>Therefore, the best way to maintain the popularity of <em>Fall Guys</em> is to continuously release new maps or special modes to keep players feeling fresh and engaged.</p>
<p>When the official version of <em>Fall Guys</em> launches, in addition to the Workshop (modding platform), the game will also include a Daily Map Rotation Mode.</p>
<p>This ensures that players experience a different map every single day, further enhancing the game's sense of novelty.</p>
<p>In terms of visual art, the cartoon-style Fall Guys characters, combined with exaggerated and comical actions and the chaotic sixty-player obstacle course races,</p>
<p>fill the game with entertainment value. Moreover, the sound effects used in the game have also been carefully selected,</p>
<p>adding to the atmosphere of pure joy.</p>
<p>For many players, the first impression of experiencing <em>Fall Guys</em> is simply one word: fun.</p>
<p>In contrast, while <em>Sanguosha</em> may have greater depth in terms of content compared to <em>Fall Guys</em>, in terms of initial impression, <em>Fall Guys</em> clearly surpasses the former.</p>
<p>As a result, many players who had tried <em>Fall Guys</em> quickly became addicted.</p>
<p>'Anyone want to Team Up?'</p>
<p>'Come on, let’s play together!'</p>
<p>'This Fall Guy is so adorably silly!'</p>
<p>'Yeah, walking like a wobbly weebles!'</p>
<p>'Hey hey, who keeps pulling me? I’m about to get eliminated!'</p>
<p>'Feels like I can’t stop playing at all! And there are quite a few levels too!'</p>
<p>At the same time, these players brought <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em> with them to other developers’ booths, creating a wave of popularity across the entire exhibition.</p>
<p>After all, although Nebula Games’ booth was bustling with activity, live streams, and various cosers dressed as Fall Guys to liven up the atmosphere,</p>
<p>the number of playable games was still relatively limited. Moreover, both games had mobile versions available to play.</p>
<p>Previously, people wandered around aimlessly mainly because the waiting time in queues was simply unbearable.</p>
<p>But now, things were different.</p>
<p>Now they had games to pass the time!</p>
<p>At NetDragon’s booth, codenamed 'Star God (Game Title)', Meng Zuo and staff members were maintaining order.</p>
<p>Looking at the long, snaking queue, he felt an overwhelming sense of excitement.</p>
<p>Judging from on-site player feedback, 'Star God' did have some aspects that needed improvement.</p>
<p>But overall, player comments were overwhelmingly positive.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, NetDragon had brought a brand-new VR blockbuster to this year’s gameplay Expo, making them the coolest kid on the block.</p>
<p>The only slight drawback was that due to the rivalry between NetDragon and TengHua, the latter had also brought a new VR game.</p>
<p>And according to reports from his staff, that game was also performing exceptionally well.</p>
<p>Clearly, it was going to be their biggest competitor at this gameplay Expo.</p>
<p>'Next, get press releases out quickly—publish early reviews of the game as soon as possible.'</p>
<p>'Also, buy some trending search spots, and hire some internet trolls on various forums to boost the game’s popularity.'</p>
<p>Meng Zuo instructed the staff beside him, outlining the next steps for the game’s promotion.</p>
<p>This was the first Big Project he had been in charge of since he onboarded at NetDragon.</p>
<p>Although he hadn’t single-handedly led the entire game’s development—after all, it was a large-scale VR game—</p>
<p>he was fully responsible for the final product and its subsequent marketing and operations.</p>
<p>Therefore, he deeply cared about the game’s effectiveness.</p>
<p>If it became a hit, he would surely rise rapidly in the company!</p>
<p>At that moment, Meng Zuo’s mind was filled with dreams of a bright future.</p>
<p>After finishing instructions with the staff, Meng Zuo walked toward the front of the queue, heading over to check on the situation at their 'Star God' booth.</p>
<p>Even though he had already heard most of the player feedback and seen the relevant data from his staff,</p>
<p>he still wanted to see it with his own eyes.</p>
<p>However, as he approached, he noticed something unusual.</p>
<p>'Wow, what kind of luck does this Zhen Ji have? Seven Luo Shens and a Zhuge Repeating Crossbow?'</p>
<p>'What? Seven consecutive Luo Shens? That’s ridiculous! Mine only ever draws red cards!'</p>
<p>'Ah! Who’s this Pineapple Head? So damn mean—can’t die alone, has to drag me down too!'</p>
<p>'Hurry up! Bros, Yellow Team’s score just overtook us—rush to Yellow Team’s base and steal their eggs!'</p>
<p>'LOL, that “Water Rises, Boats Float” level—only three people made it through, everyone else drowned!'</p>
<p>What was going on? What were these players even talking about?</p>
<p>After getting closer and hearing their conversation, Meng Zuo looked bewildered.</p>
<p>He understood every single word, but when strung together, he had no idea what they were saying.</p>
<p>Similarly, some players who had been patiently waiting in line looked on with curiosity.</p>
<p>'Bro, what are you guys playing?' a confused player asked.</p>
<p>'<em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Sanguosha</em>! Super fun!'</p>
<p>'What games are these? Just released? Never heard of them!' Many players were puzzled—how come so many people were playing games they’d never even heard of?</p>
<p>'They’re not out yet! These are games Nebula Games brought to this year’s exhibition,' the player replied.</p>
<p>'What!? Nebula Games? The company that made <em>Outlast</em> and <em>Overcooked</em>? Those two games already drained the last bit of my passion and willpower—no way I’m playing anything they make again!' Upon hearing the name 'Nebula Games,' the guy immediately recalled some unpleasant memories.</p>
<p>'LOL, this time it’s really different! Chen Xu isn’t tricking anyone—these two games are genuinely fun, and super convenient too. Just scan a QR code to download and play anytime. Wanna try? Scan my code with your phone and download it right now!' The player enthusiastically offered.</p>
<p>'Really? Thanks, bro—I’ll download it and check it out!' Hearing this, the player quickly became interested.</p>
<p>I can play without queuing!?</p>
<p>After downloading and going through the new player tutorial, they quickly fell in love with the games and became instantly addicted.</p>
<p>'Bro, it’s your turn!'</p>
<p>'Already me? Nah… you go ahead. I’ll just rejoin the queue. Damn it! What an idiot, why are you pulling me!'</p>
<p>Some players, already deep into the game, had finally reached the front of the queue.</p>
<p>But since the current match hadn’t ended yet, they couldn’t bear to quit.</p>
<p>Glancing at the line, they simply decided to queue up all over again.</p>
<p>Witnessing the entire scene, Meng Zuo’s eyes widened unconsciously. He was completely stunned.</p>
<p>And Meng Zuo wasn’t the only one.</p>
<p>The same situation was unfolding at TengHua’s booth and at other game developers’ booths as well.</p>
<p>Every developer watched in shock as players, having brought <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em> from Nebula Games’ booth, began playing at their own booths.</p>
<p>Then, slowly but surely, these players 'infected' the others who were waiting in line.</p>
<p>Soon, every single player was huddled over their phones, immersed in <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em>.</p>
<p>In an instant, all the developers were completely broken.</p>
<p>What the hell is going on!?</p>
<p>Nebula… Nebula Games?</p>
<p>Two new games brought by Chen Xu?</p>
<p>No need to queue—just scan a QR code, download to your phone, and play anytime, anywhere?</p>
<p>You’ve gotta be kidding me!</p>
<p>Is this even allowed!?</p>
<p>And don’t Nebula Games players have their own damn booth!?</p>
