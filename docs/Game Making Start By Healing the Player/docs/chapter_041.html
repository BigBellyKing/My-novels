                <p>Chapter 41: One Hammer, One Decision</p>
<p>As time passed, the sales of <em>To the Moon</em> continued to rise steadily.</p>
<p>At the same time, numerous domestic media outlets that had been closely following this event began releasing articles.</p>
<p><em>An Unforgettable Love Story: 'To the Moon,' a Game That Will Make You Cry!</em> </p>
<p><em>Game Review: A Game That Strikes Straight to Your Heart!</em> </p>
<p><em>Top Contender in the Game Design Competition: Can 'To the Moon' Even Be Considered a Sci-Fi Game?</em> </p>
<p><em>A Game That Makes Countless Tough Guys Shed Tears</em></p>
<p>Ever since the Game Design Competition began a week ago, it had already become quite clear which games stood a chance at winning awards, and which ones didn’t.</p>
<p>Some entries were merely participating for show, and naturally failed to generate much buzz.</p>
<p>As for those serious contenders, both players and game designers within the gaming industry already had a clear idea.</p>
<p>The top prize was essentially down to a final showdown between <em>To the Moon</em> and <em>Galaxy Heroes</em>, developed by Jianhuolei Studio under NetDragon.</p>
<p>In the player voting category, <em>To the Moon</em> had pulled significantly ahead of <em>Galaxy Heroes</em>.</p>
<p>However, the final result wasn’t determined by player votes alone—the official evaluation from the Game Department carried considerable weight.</p>
<p>While <em>To the Moon</em> held a certain advantage, it wasn’t overwhelming.</p>
<p>So everything still hinged on the official scoring.</p>
<p>During this time, players online were fiercely debating the two games.</p>
<p>'The winner will definitely be <em>Galaxy Heroes</em>. I admit <em>To the Moon</em> has a great story, but is it even a game? It has zero gameplay. Can it even be called a sci-fi game?'</p>
<p>'Seconding the previous comment—<em>Galaxy Heroes</em> winning would truly be well-deserved!'</p>
<p>'Oh, come on. What exactly do you mean by “gameplay”? Care to translate that for me? Isn’t storytelling a form of gameplay? Isn’t music a form of gameplay? Does it only count as gameplay if you’re fighting monsters or solving puzzles?'</p>
<p>'Exactly. If <em>To the Moon</em> doesn’t qualify as a sci-fi game, then most of the other entries shouldn’t either. Why don’t you ask the Game Department to disqualify them all?'</p>
<p>'La-la-la, not listening, not listening. Anyway, my vote goes to <em>To the Moon</em>.'</p>
<p>'Hehe, victory will surely belong to <em>Galaxy Heroes</em>!'</p>
<p>'Right, <em>Galaxy Heroes</em> will definitely claim ultimate victory!'</p>
<p>'Hmph, what’s all this about <em>Galaxy Heroes</em>? Look at the game designer’s name—Meng Zuo. That’s basically “Dreaming.” Winning first prize? They’ll only achieve that in their dreams!'</p>
<p>'Whoa, bro, that’s a seriously sharp interpretation!'</p>
<p>'Hey, are you guys so sure it’s just between <em>To the Moon</em> and <em>Galaxy Heroes</em>? Don’t underestimate <em>Beast of Darkness</em>, produced by the Great Demon King!'</p>
<p>'Hehe, don’t be fooled by the current player votes. <em>To the Moon</em> and <em>Galaxy Heroes</em> may be far ahead now, but I have a feeling the real winner will be <em>Ashaji</em> by Black Lily Studio.'</p>
<p>'You two upstairs—night hasn’t fallen yet. Stop daydreaming. Just leave cleanly and gracefully, okay?'</p>
<p>'+1. Please exit gracefully, you two upstairs!'</p>
<p>Every player had their personal favorite, and with the final results still unannounced, naturally everyone wanted to claim the moral high ground in various online communities.</p>
<p>But overall, it was a classic case of everyone having their own valid points.</p>
<p>Compared to the heated online discussions and debates, Chen Xu remained remarkably calm.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>The office at Nebula Games.</p>
<p>Chen Xu sat in his office, making a phone call to inform a candidate of their interview result.</p>
<p>The hires for Art and Music had already been finalized.</p>
<p>But for Numerical Design and Level Design, several candidates had been interviewed, none of whom particularly satisfied Chen Xu.</p>
<p>"Chen Xu, how can you not be anxious at all?" Yang Xin asked, watching him hang up the phone, then standing up and pacing around the office twice.</p>
<p>"Yeah, isn’t the award list supposed to be announced today?" Ruan Ningxue was also a bit excited.</p>
<p>This was the third game she had participated in developing.</p>
<p>She was no longer the clueless newcomer she once was in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>As for her earlier idea of becoming a doujinshi king and switching careers to become a cartoonist, she had long since shelved that thought.</p>
<p>Partly because she had discovered the joy of game development.</p>
<p>And partly because Nebula Games was doing so well—why would she even think about manga now?</p>
<p>"Even if I’m anxious, it won’t change anything," Chen Xu replied, exasperated. "The final result isn’t something I can control."</p>
<p>Of course he hoped to win an award, but seriously—wasn’t that out of his hands?</p>
<p>"By the way, let’s release the mobile version of <em>Undertale</em> right after today’s award announcement," Chen Xu added, as if remembering something. "Given the current trend, we’re almost guaranteed a top-two spot. Whether we win first or not, we’ll definitely have some popularity. Let’s ride our own wave while it’s hot."</p>
<p>During the time <em>To the Moon</em> was competing, Nebula Games had been focused on two main internal tasks.</p>
<p>One was porting <em>Undertale</em> to mobile. That hadn’t taken much effort and had actually been completed long ago.</p>
<p>It was only being delayed now to better capitalize on their current momentum.</p>
<p>The other task was team expansion.</p>
<p>Beyond the development team, Chen Xu planned to scale up.</p>
<p>Other departments—operations, finance, HR—were also being expanded. The foundation was essentially in place.</p>
<p>Additionally, there was the platform development team.</p>
<p>Currently, in the eyes of most players and the gaming industry, Nebula Games was still just a tiny indie studio.</p>
<p>From <em>Mirror (Game)</em> to <em>Undertale</em>, and now <em>To the Moon</em>, they had never produced a blockbuster—just small-scale independent games.</p>
<p>But Chen Xu’s ambitions clearly went far beyond that.</p>
<p>In the Future Era, Nebula Games would inevitably venture into much broader territories.</p>
<p>The current effort to build their own platform was the first step toward solidifying their foundation.</p>
<p>Would this draw attention from the industry?</p>
<p>To be blunt, right now Nebula Games was a Hammer.</p>
<p>Even if <em>To the Moon</em> won first place in this competition, it would only stir up a wave in the independent gaming community and briefly put them on the map within the wider gaming industry.</p>
<p>As for triggering wariness or hostility from industry giants?</p>
<p>That was just wishful thinking.</p>
<p>Besides, self-operated platforms weren’t uncommon.</p>
<p>After all, launching a platform didn’t automatically mean creating a channel.</p>
<p>You needed partners, a solid user base, and sufficient popularity.</p>
<p>Many mid-tier developers, independent game producers, and studios with established series and loyal fanbases already operated their own platforms—because launching on third-party platforms meant paying fees.</p>
<p>With a self-operated platform, every purchase made by players went directly to the studio.</p>
<p>After taxes, it was pure profit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as online discussions continued to swirl, the Game Design Competition reached its conclusion—decided in one decisive blow by an official announcement from the Game Department.</p>
