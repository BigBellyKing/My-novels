                <p>Chapter 511: You Won't Even Give Me 300 Bucks!? (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>This time, Song Ren was still using the Great Sword from before.</p>
<p>Although he had unlocked a Bow and Arrows, after trying it out briefly, he felt it wasn't very user-friendly.</p>
<p>Regular attacks required charging; otherwise, they wouldn't fire. Additionally, the damage and attack range varied depending on the charging duration.</p>
<p>The highest damage occurred at the moment of the charging flash, delivering peak damage, but afterward, the damage dropped.</p>
<p>As for special attacks, they looked flashy, but the damage felt underwhelming, barely scratching the skeletons.</p>
<p>The only advantage he saw was the ranged capability.</p>
<p>But now that he had two dodging opportunities, evading monster attacks shouldn't be an issue.</p>
<p>Excited, Song Ren started a new game but soon noticed something different: a divine blessing was placed right before him at the start.</p>
<p>"Just as I thought! That earlier one must've been a story kill!" Song Ren chuckled.</p>
<p>The gods were still familiar—Zeus—but after their dialogue, Song Ren was stunned.</p>
<p>'Greetings, young nephew. Most importantly, my blessings and power will ultimately aid you in finding your true home.'</p>
<p>Originally, Song Ren assumed NPC blessing dialogues were identical, but they were actually different?</p>
<p>This time, he also noticed the Skills on the interface still followed three paths: Lightning Attack, Thunderstorm Dance, and Thunder Shot, corresponding to attack, ranged, and special attack modes.</p>
<p>Yet again, he chose Lightning Attack, having experienced its dazzling effects before—sparks flying with every slash, incredibly flashy.</p>
<p>The early rooms weren't too difficult, and by the third, he encountered another deity: Aphrodite.</p>
<p>After their dialogue, several options appeared: ranged, dash, and a summoning blessing named after Aphrodite.</p>
<p>Without much thought, Song Ren instinctively picked the last one.</p>
<p>Not because the description was wordy, but because it sounded awesome!</p>
<p>Accumulate a divine power gauge to summon Aphrodite, firing a charm arrow to turn enemies into traitors.</p>
<p>Moreover, consuming the entire gauge dealt a whopping 2,500 damage—wasn't that Invincible?</p>
<p>So awesome!</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Song Ren selected this aid Skill.</p>
<p>After choosing, he noticed a new progress bar below his health bar UI, divided into four stages.</p>
<p>Clearly, filling one segment allowed one use, with fuller bars enhancing the effect.</p>
<p>But soon, Song Ren discovered a critical issue.</p>
<p>"Damn it! Why does the divine power gauge reset!?" In the previous room, through attacking and taking damage, he'd filled one segment but didn't use it.</p>
<p>In-game, Song Ren looked Frustrated. He'd assumed the divine power could be saved for the BOSS.</p>
<p>Now, he learned it was room-specific and reset afterward?</p>
<p>Realizing this mechanic left him Speechless.</p>
<p>What was the point, then?</p>
<p>Earlier, to grab an extra key for unlocking new weapons, he'd skipped the Centaur's Heart room that increased his health ceiling.</p>
<p>Now, with only 50 health, relying on taking hits to fill the divine power gauge was unrealistic.</p>
<p>"Hey! The Shop—maybe it sells health!" Eyeing his 80 gold coins and the next Shop room, Song Ren felt a flicker of hope.</p>
<p>In the Shop, he knew deity blessings appeared—though pricey at 150 gold.</p>
<p>He couldn't afford that, but right now, he cared about health, not blessings.</p>
<p>Despite having Death Defiance left, he preferred saving it for the BOSS.</p>
<p>With some anticipation, Song Ren entered the Shop and spotted something resembling fries and coke.</p>
<p>He bought it immediately, restoring a large chunk of health.</p>
<p>But glancing at the Power Pomegranate and Zeus' blessing, he sighed wistfully.</p>
<p>He wanted them!</p>
<p>But no money.</p>
<p>Then, Song Ren froze in surprise.</p>
<p>Behind Charon, inside a metal box, was a Money Pouch.</p>
<p>What? He'd never seen that before!</p>
<p>Approaching it, he was stunned.</p>
<p>'Borrow 300 gold from Charon's Money Pouch.'</p>
<p>"Damn it! You can borrow money? Is this hidden story content? My luck's insane—am I the chosen one?" Overjoyed, Song Ren felt contentedly.</p>
<p>Just when he needed cash, he could borrow 300 from Charon.</p>
<p>He figured it was like a loan in Animal Crossing, though Hades might enforce stricter repayment terms.</p>
<p>For instance, borrowing 300 gold might block further earnings until the debt was cleared.</p>
<p>But so what?</p>
<p>With borrowed money, he could upgrade a Skill and buy a deity blessing right away!</p>
<p>Beaming, Song Ren eagerly reached for Charon's Money Pouch.</p>
<p>Instantly, intense background audio blared.</p>
<p>Charon roared furiously, and the scene shifted to a lava-surrounded platform with four gleaming money jars.</p>
<p>'Uh, look, Charon, I can explain. I just, uh, got used to taking things from my father's domain. I didn't mean to steal—seriously!'</p>
<p>The Prince of the Underworld's feeble excuses were palpable even to Song Ren outside the game.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Charon bellowed.</p>
<p>Borrow from him?</p>
<p>Then go home!</p>
<p>"Screw this! It's just 300 bucks! Are you serious? You won't even give me 300!?" Song Ren was depressed.</p>
<p>Charon's damage was insane—one hit nearly wiped his full health.</p>
<p>After Death Defiance triggered, he didn't even resist with his second life, just surrendered.</p>
<p>He hadn't even seen the first BOSS before being sent packing.</p>
<p>But what really left him Speechless was Hades' mocking dialogue afterward.</p>
<p>'Ah... let's confirm, brat. According to recent reports... you tried stealing under Charon's nose? And got killed? Even for you, that's disgraceful.'</p>
<p>'Uh... I was borrowing, not stealing, okay? And why did no one tell me Charon's such a beast? I thought ferrymen were chill!'</p>
<p>"This game's so hard!" Song Ren sighed with emotion.</p>
<p>The moment he spoke, Zhang Yi echoed, "Yeah! So hard! I haven't beaten the first BOSS yet. Hey, Old Song, did you?"</p>
<p>Song Ren stiffened slightly, sipping his tea.</p>
<p>"Nope, it's too tough. But even though I keep dying, it's still fun!" He smoothly changed the subject.</p>
<p>He wasn't lying—he really hadn't beaten the BOSS!</p>
<p>Never even saw it—how could he have won?</p>
<p>(End of Chapter) &lt;<END_OF_CHAPTER>&gt;</p>
