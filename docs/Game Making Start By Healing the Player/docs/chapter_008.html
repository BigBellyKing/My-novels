<p>"Huh, this UI interface actually looks pretty nice!"</p>
<p>Upon launching the game, Jiang Ping couldn't help but feel pleasantly surprised by the game's UI interface.</p>
<p>Although he wasn't a particularly seasoned Lewd Person, Jiang Ping hadn't played many gentleman's games.</p>
<p>Still, he did have some basic experience with this genre.</p>
<p>While most of the games he'd played before were made using the Official Game Engine, their UI content was usually crude and chaotic.</p>
<p>But this game, <em>Mirror (Game)</em>, was genuinely impressive—at least in terms of its UI design.</p>
<p>"Can I only choose one character?"</p>
<p>After clicking into the game, Jiang Ping looked at the diamond-shaped selection in the center.</p>
<p>It displayed various different characters, yet only the Dark Elf was available.</p>
<p>The rest were locked.</p>
<p>"So many playable characters? This seems... surprisingly rich!"</p>
<p>Jiang Ping's face lit up with surprise.</p>
<p>At the same time, he felt a small surge of excitement.</p>
<p>Instinctively, he glanced toward the dormitory door.</p>
<p>The door was still closed—his roommates had all gone out for various reasons today.</p>
<p>He walked over and closed the dorm door, then locked it from the inside.</p>
<p>Returning to his computer, he stared at the game screen and took a deep breath, his expression turning solemn and sacred.</p>
<p>Well, at least on the outside.</p>
<p>Inside, his thoughts were quite different.</p>
<p>They start me off with a Dark Elf character?</p>
<p>How thrilling!</p>
<p>With a heart pounding with excitement, Jiang Ping followed the tutorial and clicked on an icon resembling combat.</p>
<p>'On this deep, quiet night, the secluded Blackwater Castle unexpectedly receives an uninvited guest.'</p>
<p>'The nearly invisible shadow gradually emerges.'</p>
<p>Reading the game's narrative and viewing the following choices, Jiang Ping was momentarily taken aback.</p>
<p>Wasn't this supposed to be a gentleman's game?</p>
<p>Why does this feel more like a text-based drama?</p>
<p>There's actual story content?</p>
<p>Jiang Ping scratched his head, but didn't dwell on it, casually clicking through.</p>
<p>When the game transitioned into battle, he was stunned again.</p>
<p>Wait—is this game actually a Match-3 game?</p>
<p>Earlier on the forum, someone claimed it was the best Match-3 game ever. Jiang Ping thought it was a joke.</p>
<p>But now, the actual gameplay really <em>is</em> a Match-3?</p>
<p>"Hmm, orange orbs boost physical attack, sword icons represent physical damage, stars are magic, and potions provide healing."</p>
<p>"Matching four in a row creates a boosted orb; matching five creates a Magic diamond that deals massive damage."</p>
<p>"There are also items and special Skills available, though right now only one healing item is accessible."</p>
<p>Following the新手 tutorial, Jiang Ping quickly grasped the mechanics of the game's Combat System.</p>
<p>Then he was stunned.</p>
<p>Was he playing a gentleman's game or a standard Match-3 game?</p>
<p>Why so many mechanics?</p>
<p>Jiang Ping looked utterly surprised. The gentleman's games he'd played before didn't have nearly this level of complexity.</p>
<p>Some were basically just click-click-click, then character portraits popped up.</p>
<p>And worse, some were so crude and shoddy they felt like an insult.</p>
<p>But <em>Mirror (Game)</em> was different!</p>
<p>This Combat System was excessively rich!</p>
<p>Well, at least for a gentleman's game.</p>
<p>On top of that, there's actual story content!</p>
<p>And the Lewd Person elements... they're substantial—and plentiful!</p>
<p>He pursed his lips, narrowed his eyes slightly, leaned forward, and turned off the small speaker on his desk.</p>
<p>From his drawer, he pulled out an earbud headset, plugged it into his computer, and placed it over one ear.</p>
<p>After successfully clearing a Match-3 combo and launching an attack, he heard the Dark Elf's voice reacting to damage.</p>
<p>And when her health dropped, her clothes...</p>
<p>Ah! That's right!</p>
<p>According to the previous story, this should be set in the Medieval era?</p>
<p>No wonder the clothing quality is so poor!</p>
<p>People's living conditions back then were extremely harsh. Look at how torn her clothes are. Look at how dark her skin is from the sun.</p>
<p>Matching five identical tiles creates a diamond with massive damage!</p>
<p>You can also use unique Skills and purchase supporting items to assist attacks.</p>
<p>There's even a turn limit—only 13 turns left—and this elf still has so much health?</p>
<p>After a brief trial, Jiang Ping's attention quickly shifted from the elf's clothing to the Match-3 gameplay.</p>
<p>He had to admit, this Match-3 mechanic was actually pretty fun!</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>"The quality of this game is absolutely explode (colloquial for emotions exploding)!</p>
<p>After two consecutive battles, Jiang Ping entered the PLAY mode.</p>
<p>He felt like all the gentleman's games he'd played before were a complete waste.</p>
<p>What is a gentleman's game?</p>
<p><em>This</em> is a gentleman's game!</p>
<p>What were all those previous ones even?</p>
<p>They had lewd content but no actual gameplay.</p>
<p>Well, if that were all, it might still be acceptable—after all, strong practicality could compensate.</p>
<p>But then there were those that were just crude and shoddy. Did they really think a gentleman's money wasn't money?</p>
<p>Look at <em>Mirror (Game)</em>—not only is it highly practical, but the gameplay content is incredibly rich. This is what a true gentleman's game should be. This is what a real gentleman's game ought to offer!</p>
<p>And it even includes Galgame elements?</p>
<p>It even has dual endings?</p>
<p>Jiang Ping, having just completed a Pure Love Ending, stared at the screen, contemplating the different choices.</p>
<p>Seeing that the Dark Elf character only showed 50% progress unlocked, he was visibly trembling with excitement.</p>
<p>Never in his wildest dreams did he expect that instead of finding the doujinshi he was looking for, he'd stumble upon a divine game like this!</p>
<p>"Hmm, I won't play a new character yet. Let me explore the other storyline first."</p>
<p>"Following standard game logic, the second ending should be the Dark Elf turning evil, right?"</p>
<p>Filled with curiosity, and a bit of excitement and tension, Jiang Ping clicked in once more.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Ten minutes later—</p>
<p>"Why did it end like this?"</p>
<p>Sitting before his computer, Jiang Ping's heart was filled with both excitement and deep emotion.</p>
<p>She was born into nobility, yet cared deeply for the poor and suffering, even stealing personally to help them.</p>
<p>Yet the impoverished people she aided were ugly, shameless, and repaid kindness with betrayal.</p>
<p>When the Dark Elf was captured by the devil, these people harbored only their own dark desires.</p>
<p>Though the character portraits remained as sensational as other gentleman's games, the voice acting in this game was absolutely explode (colloquial for emotions exploding) compared to the rest.</p>
<p>Still, Jiang Ping felt a complex mix of emotions.</p>
<p>Especially when he saw the Young Guard who entered later—though he still held a trace of kindness in his heart,</p>
<p>he ultimately failed to uphold his moral boundaries and reached out with evil intent.</p>
<p>That moment was like the final straw breaking the camel's back.</p>
<p>Coupled with the final image of the devil quietly laughing from beyond the wall, Jiang Ping was deeply moved.</p>
<p>Now he could understand why those renowned gentlemen on the forum spoke of this game with such reverence.</p>
<p>This wasn't just another simple gentleman's game.</p>
<p>It posed profound questions about humanity, explored the nature of good and evil.</p>
<p>In an instant, Jiang Ping found himself pondering philosophical questions.</p>
<p>Is human nature inherently good, as Mencius claimed?</p>
<p>Or is it inherently evil, as Xunzi argued?</p>
<p>Why did those people repay the elf who helped them with hatred?</p>
<p>Why, in the end, even with a spark of goodness remaining, did evil still triumph?</p>
<p>Engulfed in Philosophy Mode, Jiang Ping was thinking deeply.</p>
<p>But this was only the beginning.</p>
<p>Please support with any kind of votes. The author bows deeply in gratitude—【BANG BANG BANG】</p>
