                <p>Chapter 680: Sekiro (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Two days later, Hu Tu finally arrived at Nebula Games' headquarters.</p>
<p>After confirming with the front desk, Hu Tu headed straight to the meeting room.</p>
<p>He was genuinely excited about the upcoming plan.</p>
<p>Upon entering the meeting room, he found it already filled with many people.</p>
<p>Scanning the room, he recognized most of them as core members from Nebula Games' main studios.</p>
<p>Hu Tu was taken aback, yet also thrilled.</p>
<p>As he pondered, the meeting room door opened.</p>
<p>Chen Xu walked in, smiled and nodded at Hu Tu, then proceeded to the main seat and turned on the projector.</p>
<p>A concept art piece was displayed on the screen from the computer.</p>
<p>Under the moonlight, a vast expanse of reeds swayed like snow in the wind. A ninja and a samurai stood facing off, blades drawn within the reeds. The long swords reflected the moonlight and each other’s silhouettes, imbuing the entire scene with a chilling, lethal atmosphere.</p>
<p>At the top of the artwork, two stylized Chinese characters read: "Sekiro."</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, is your new work based on ninja themes? Is it an infiltration-type game?" Yang Xin asked curiously.</p>
<p>After all, if the protagonist was a ninja, it was natural to assume the game would involve stealth.</p>
<p>"No, it's different from typical ninja-themed games. If I had to describe it, 'ninja' is more of a role than a gameplay focus," Chen Xu replied with a smile.</p>
<p>"More accurately, this game leans toward a Jidaigeki film style, including its Combat System." Chen Xu added, then introduced Hu Tu to the group.</p>
<p>"As for the genre, everyone can take inspiration from Dark Souls and Bloodborne," Chen Xu said with a bright smile.</p>
<p>Hearing this, the group froze momentarily—then were completely stunned.</p>
<p>Dark Souls and Bloodborne!?</p>
<p>So this was...!?</p>
<p>"Don't be too surprised. I'm mainly referring to map design and Plot Design. In Sekiro, both the actions and map scenes will differ significantly."</p>
<p>"Also, to provide players with a smoother, more cinematic sword-fighting experience, this game will not feature a stamina bar," Chen Xu explained, highlighting a key point.</p>
<p>After a brief moment of surprise, the group nodded in understanding—but also felt a vague sense of disappointment.</p>
<p>No stamina bar? Then it sounded like just another standard action game!</p>
<p>Seeing their expressions, Chen Xu remained silent and simply opened the Combat System design document.</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>Compared to Dark Souls and Bloodborne, Sekiro—also a souls-like game—could be considered the culmination of the genre.</p>
<p>In Dark Souls, ordinary players are encouraged to play defensively, as shields offer the highest payoff. Many players clear the game relying solely on blocking.</p>
<p>Bloodborne discarded shields in favor of Gun Parry using firearms, which increased the game’s pace and raised player risk.</p>
<p>But in Sekiro, everything changes. Players can still block, divided into Regular blocking and perfect parry.</p>
<p>At first glance, it didn't seem special. But the key difference lies in a unique mechanic: Parry Value, or Posture Bar.</p>
<p>Unlike the stamina bar in Dark Souls and Bloodborne, actions like running and attacking in Sekiro are completely Free.</p>
<p>The only constraint is the Posture Bar. Regular blocking greatly increases posture damage, and when it fills, the player breaks hyper armor and enters a flinch/stun state. Perfect parry, however, adds minimal posture damage and won’t cause break hyper armor even when full.</p>
<p>Moreover, BOSSes also have a Posture Bar. When it fills, they become vulnerable to execution.</p>
<p>Regardless of remaining health, the BOSS’s current phase is instantly killed.</p>
<p>Thus, in Dark Souls and Bloodborne, players must carefully manage stamina, often retreating during BOSS battles.</p>
<p>In Sekiro, players don’t need to worry about that. The experience is far more fluid—skilled players can counter every move, going all-out like a Mad Dog in relentless combat.</p>
<p>Another thrilling feature is Sword Clash.</p>
<p>When player and BOSS simultaneously attack, their blades collide with a sharp 'clang'—like steel striking steel in a blacksmith’s forge.</p>
<p>At its core, despite retaining a Turn-Based rhythm, the Posture Bar mechanic truly immerses players in the intensity of blade flashes and clashing steel.</p>
<p>Adding to this is a unique setting: Land of the Dragon's Heritage.</p>
<p>This grants players one revival during combat, reducing difficulty and increasing forgiveness.</p>
<p>Each time a BOSS is executed, players gain a portion of life energy. If stored, this energy allows a second revival.</p>
<p>That means, during a single BOSS battle, players effectively have three lives—making the game remarkably player-friendly.</p>
<p>If an ordinary player were to judge Sekiro without analyzing Level Design or Combat System intricacies,</p>
<p>the most immediate response would be: satisfying.</p>
<p>Sparks flying during Sword Clash, the clang of steel during parries, the intense BOSS battles.</p>
<p>Parrying, clashing, dodge stepping, Mikiri Counter, falling, reviving, and fighting again.</p>
<p>Even death feels exhilarating—full of passion and intensity.</p>
<p>Of course, beyond the core Combat System, the Gameplay Content is equally impressive.</p>
<p>Unlike Bloodborne and Dark Souls, which feature numerous weapons and Classes, Sekiro gives players only one sword: Kusabimaru.</p>
<p>However, the game introduces the Prosthetic Arm.</p>
<p>Shuriken enable ranged attacks against Squishy enemies and can knock airborne foes off balance.</p>
<p>An axe breaks shields, an umbrella blocks powerful attacks, firecrackers restrict enemy movement, and the Flame Vent—exploiting the weakness of hairy, weak to fire enemies—burns through them.</p>
<p>These prosthetic tools can be upgraded, enabling visually stunning operations when combined with the Combat System.</p>
<p>Additionally, players can learn various playstyles and Skills.</p>
<p>The Mortal Blade that severs immortality, Senpou Temple Arts, and Puppeteer Ninjutsu that turns slain enemies into puppets after a Shinobi Execution.</p>
<p>By skillfully using prosthetics and Skills, a 100-point difficulty player experience can drop to around 70.</p>
<p>In terms of Gameplay, while Sekiro lacks the diverse skill point allocation and routine variety of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, it remains deeply brain-burning.</p>
<p>When technique falls short, wisdom must carry the fight.</p>
