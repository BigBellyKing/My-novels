                <p>Chapter 255: Happy Players (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>Of course, it's not just the Long Sword.</p>
<p>Almost every attack in the game can interrupt a teammate's damage output. In truth, the Long Sword isn't particularly lethal.</p>
<p>The Sledge's uppercut and home-run strike, or the Gunlance's Wyvern's Fire, can send a Hunter flying skyward.</p>
<p>However, although these weapons pack strong lethality, their AOE range is relatively small.</p>
<p>But the Long Sword's spinning slash? Absolutely incredible!</p>
<p>If it were just the final spinning slash, teammates could endure it—it's only one hit, after all.</p>
<p>But the problem is, most players don't understand the weapon mechanics very well.</p>
<p>Especially the difference between the Long Sword's uncharged and Spirit Gauge State—output is night and day.</p>
<p>Yet most players don't use Foresight Slash to charge the blade, relying instead on repeated Diagonal Slashes followed by a spinning slash, or simply saving up energy to use the so-called 'idiot' charge method.</p>
<p>When slashing, it's as if nothing within a five-meter radius survives.</p>
<p>This has made Long Sword players somewhat lonely.</p>
<p>After all, if a Bow and Arrows user interrupts a teammate with wide-area Arc Shot, they can just choose not to use it.</p>
<p>If a Light Bowgun user sets off a Bob-omb, teammates can simply move around it. With Gunlance and Sledge users, you can generally dodge or avoid them.</p>
<p>But the Long Sword's spinning slash? Its range is simply absurd!</p>
<p>One Spirit Roundslash, and all three teammates are knocked down.</p>
<p>In the early game, most players don't understand attributes well—and even if they did, it wouldn't matter.</p>
<p>After all, there are no Flinch Free Decorations or Rocksteady Mantle in the early game.</p>
<p>Thus...</p>
<p>Although the game has just launched, among pick-up teams, the status of Long Sword players has already plummeted.</p>
<p>You may look cool, but you're hindering your teammates!</p>
<p>Ironically, it's not players of other weapons who dislike Long Sword users the most—it's the Long Sword players themselves.</p>
<p>Imagine four Long Sword players spinning at each other—what a beautiful scene.</p>
<p>Of course, not every player refuses to team up with Long Sword users.</p>
<p>Light Bowgun, Heavy Bowgun, and Bow and Arrows—three ranged weapons—are actually quite happy to team up with Long Sword players.</p>
<p>Sometimes, because of the distance, ranged attacks can accidentally hit teammates.</p>
<p>But with a Long Sword teammate, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Many Long Sword players feel a shiver of indignation.</p>
<p>Eventually, they transform into lone Long Sword players.</p>
<p>A true warrior needs no teammates!</p>
<p>One Long Sword, one person... that's enough!</p>
<p>And even if they can't find a team, many solo players don't mind at all.</p>
<p>After all, going solo isn't difficult!</p>
<p>Whether it's Long Sword, Switch Axe, Charge Blade, or Insect Glaive,</p>
<p>Even if they know nothing about skills like Foresight Slash, Super Amped Element Discharge, or Hot-plugging,</p>
<p>They can still have a great time.</p>
<p>So what if they don't know? Just use Basic Attack all the way through.</p>
<p>There's no such thing as being stuck on a level/quest!</p>
<p>From Herbivore, Jagras, to Crown-crested Dragon, and the first BOSS, Great Jagras—many players had already experienced these during the demo version.</p>
<p>No pressure at all.</p>
<p>Even though they don't fully understand how to properly use advanced weapon skills,</p>
<p>As long as they can defeat the monster, who cares about the details?</p>
<p>As Hunters progressed through the story, they were all thrilled.</p>
<p>Because this game truly made them feel relaxed.</p>
<p>Gathering herbs, Mining, catching insects, rabbits, birds, ants, or fishing by the riverside.</p>
<p>Eyes closed, eyes opened—another day has passed.</p>
<p>Addicted to hunting, sleepless.</p>
<p>That was how many players felt.</p>
<p>Unlike other games,</p>
<p>Monster Hunter: World is essentially all BOSS battles, with no mobs.</p>
<p>The gameplay involves tracking monster signs, gathering resources along the way, finding the monster and beginning the hunt, pursuing it when it flees, and finally succeeding in the hunt.</p>
<p>Throughout this process, everything outside of combat is extremely relaxing.</p>
<p>Players felt completely at ease.</p>
<p>Some players initially felt a bit nervous about the monsters after Great Jagras.</p>
<p>But as the story progressed, monsters like Kulu-Ya-Ku, Pukei-Pukei, Barroth, and Jyuratodus appeared one after another.</p>
<p>These uniquely shaped monsters led players from the Ancient Forest to the Wildspire Waste.</p>
<p>The terrain shifted from forest to desert and swamp.</p>
<p>Yet their fear completely faded.</p>
<p>Because many players realized that although difficulty increased, it was by no means Hardened.</p>
<p>The initial Great Jagras aside,</p>
<p>Kulu-Ya-Ku, the second BOSS, was even weaker than Great Jagras.</p>
<p>As long as you avoided attacking the Shelter Stone it raised, there was virtually no challenge.</p>
<p>Pukei-Pukei wasn't very difficult either, though its venomous spit attack with poison attribute posed some minor trouble. But as long as you carried Antidote and stayed cautious, it was easily manageable. Plus, Pukei-Pukei had weak spots all over—attacking it rarely resulted in Deflect.</p>
<p>It wasn't until Barroth that players encountered some real difficulty.</p>
<p>High health, and mud coating its body like armor, causing frequent Deflect.</p>
<p>Its aggressive intent was strong, and if mud landed on the player, stamina recovery slowed dramatically.</p>
<p>Fortunately, its attack power wasn't high—even getting hit head-on by a Dragon Charge didn't drain much health.</p>
<p>These monsters quickly helped players understand the game's Gameplay.</p>
<p>Great Jagras taught players a key Part/Segment of BOSS fights: when the BOSS's health drops, it flees, and you must track it down.</p>
<p>Kulu-Ya-Ku taught players not to always confront the BOSS head-on, but to target its weaknesses—don't attack strength with weakness.</p>
<p>Pukei-Pukei taught players how to handle DEBUFFs.</p>
<p>Barroth gave players their first real concept of Dragon Charge. Compared to earlier monsters, Barroth's size and charging attack were far more imposing and powerful than previous BOSSes.</p>
<p>As for Jyuratodus, it more directly demonstrated how the environment affects hunting.</p>
<p>After all, Jyuratodus lives in a swampy mudflats. Hunters move extremely slowly within it. But similarly, Jyuratodus isn't much of a threat—its intimidation factor isn't even as strong as Barroth's.</p>
<p>But regardless, the difficulty of these monsters wasn't very high.</p>
<p>Even if some players experienced Carting, it was usually due to carelessness—health already low,</p>
<p>Yet still unwilling to use the Potion or Antidote in their inventory.</p>
<p>In such cases, who else but you should die?</p>
<p>Or players using the starting leather armor and weapons, never bothering to upgrade them.</p>
<p>By the time they reached Barroth and Jyuratodus, their defense and attack power simply couldn't keep up, resulting in a Carting experience.</p>
<p>In such situations, just head upstairs to the workshop area to upgrade gear. If that's not enough, launch a Flare to Team Up with other players.</p>
<p>There's absolutely no pressure.</p>
<p>At this stage, players experience very little frustration.</p>
<p>Difficulty is slowly increasing, but the change is barely noticeable.</p>
<p>Thus, up to this point, players remain extremely happy.</p>
<p>Hunting, gathering herbs, fishing—</p>
<p>Eyes open, eyes closed, another day has passed.</p>
<p>They haven't realized yet—the foot-soaking water has quietly gone from warm to hot.</p>
