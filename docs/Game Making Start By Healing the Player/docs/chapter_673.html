                <p>Chapter 672: Mr. Chen is an Honest Man (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Before this, many players hadn't actually expected Chen Xu to come out and respond to anything.</p>
<p>In previous games, Chen Xu rarely revealed any future game content. He even seldom explained hidden easter eggs in already released games.</p>
<p>For example, with <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Bloodborne</em>, to this day, many players are still discussing what the game's story truly means.</p>
<p>But this time, Chen Xu directly confirmed on the official Weibo account that Elizabeth would survive and that the game would even have a good ending, which greatly surprised many players.</p>
<p>However, they were also very pleased. After all, although Mr. Chen sometimes left them speechless with frustration, there was one thing they still believed:</p>
<p>Chen Xu never lied. Since he said the game's ending wouldn't be disappointing, there must be a corresponding good ending. And since he said Elizabeth was still alive and would appear in the next <em>BioShock</em> installment, subtitled <em>Rapture</em>, then Elizabeth must indeed be alive.</p>
<p>These two points delighted players and sparked widespread discussion online.</p>
<p>'So, in the next installment, Elizabeth won't be the protagonist? Players will be adventuring with a new character?'</p>
<p>'Actually, thinking about it that way, it's pretty good. At least Elizabeth will have a relatively good ending.'</p>
<p>'Yeah, Chen Xu has shown a bit of mercy this time.'</p>
<p>The players discussed animatedly. Although some veteran players familiar with Chen Xu felt something was slightly off, most players remained very optimistic.</p>
<p>During this period, more content about <em>BioShock Infinite</em> was gradually unearthed by players.</p>
<p>For instance, at the beginning of the game, the box given to Booker by the Lutece siblings had the words 'Belongs to the wounded knee soldier' written on it. The map on the wall next to the person killed in the lighthouse had a sticky note pinned to the bottom right corner, signed 'C'.</p>
<p>This indicated it was sent by Comstock, and the message 'Be ready, he is coming, you must stop him' was clearly from a killer Comstock had arranged in advance.</p>
<p>Also, in the coin-toss mini-game at the beginning of Columbia City, the player-controlled Booker was the 123rd to toss a coin, and the blackboard on Lutece's back had 122 tally marks for 'heads'.</p>
<p>This showed that 122 Bookers had already come here to toss coins before, proving that the Lutece duo had attempted 122 parallel world resets. These tidbits were constantly being unearthed, and players held high expectations for the upcoming <em>BioShock: Rapture</em>, especially after Chen Xu's official Weibo 'revelation'.</p>
<p>While players eagerly anticipated, in Nebula Games' office, Chen Xu was wrapping up some work for <em>BioShock: Rapture</em>.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, this ending is just too…” Qin Yi's expression was a mix of admiration and emotional discomfort.</p>
<p>As a participant in the game's development, Qin Yi naturally knew <em>BioShock: Rapture</em> inside and out. It was precisely because he understood the game's levels, presentations, and plot structure that he felt a twinge of emotional discomfort.</p>
<p>Even knowing what would happen, when he personally experienced one of the plotlines in the game, he still felt a knot in his stomach.</p>
<p>Just like the story of <em>BioShock Infinite</em>, this sequel, <em>Rapture</em>, was incredibly stunning in its plot arrangement.</p>
<p>The sky city of Columbia, the gigantic mechanical bird Nightingale, and other elements that were somewhat unclear to players in <em>BioShock Infinite</em> were all answered in the sequel.</p>
<p>It was like a Möbius strip, bringing the entire story to a perfect closed loop.</p>
<p>If video games are art, then among all the works Nebula Games has produced to date, <em>BioShock Infinite</em> would definitely rank among the best.</p>
<p>The only thing that bothered Qin Yi was the fate of the characters in this game. Qin Yi strongly suspected that if it were truly released, angry players might pay them a friendly greeting by adding buffs to their doors.</p>
<p>“What about the ending? Isn't it good? Although there are bad endings, there are good endings too! And unlike <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, where Arthur Morgan is fated to die regardless of the ending, this one actually has an ending where everyone survives.” Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>“No! Mr. Chen, I'm talking about Elizabeth and Booker!” Qin Yi said, looking emotionally twisted.</p>
<p>“Ah, that! Elizabeth isn't the protagonist, and the sequel indeed features Elizabeth. Haven't I made that clear to the players?” Chen Xu replied with a smile.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, Meng Zuo, Yang Xin, and the others around him were speechless.</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Chen was an honest man, but the key was that what players imagined and what he said always differed slightly!</p>
<p>“It's fine. The new headquarters will be ready in two months, and our security forces are top-notch in the gaming industry right now.”</p>
<p>Hearing Qin Yi's concern, Chen Xu patted his shoulder with a chuckle.</p>
<p>Of course, it was just a joke.</p>
<p>After all, players were still very friendly.</p>
<p>It wasn't exactly a tragedy, nor was it not a tragedy.</p>
<p>But this was an inevitable conclusion for the <em>BioShock</em> story.</p>
<p>Unlike popcorn games like <em>Uncharted</em>,</p>
<p>The story and setting of <em>BioShock</em> dictated that it would not have a universally happy ending.</p>
<p>Just like Arthur Morgan and John Marston in <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>,</p>
<p>Without death and sacrifice, the depth and richness of the entire game's storyline would diminish.</p>
<p>Some types of games don't necessarily need to be tragedies.</p>
<p>But for other types of games, their story and setting dictate that they will be tragic.</p>
<p>Clearly, the setting of <em>BioShock Infinite</em>, which runs through the entire <em>BioShock</em> series, ensured that a touch of sorrow would elevate the game.</p>
<p>And as Chen Xu spoke to his team at Nebula Games,</p>
<p>Some information and content about <em>BioShock: Rapture</em> were also revealed to players as a warm-up.</p>
<p>The displayed content, though not extensive, was enough to excite players.</p>
<p>Because in this newly released material, they once again saw the girl they deeply longed for: Elizabeth.</p>
<p>And in the publicly released video, Elizabeth appeared before them in a brand new look.</p>
