                <h2>Chapter 385: Mario and Must-Plays for Tough Guys (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h2>
<p>Next, Chen Xu and Yan Xiong continued to elaborate on some of the features of the switch.</p>
<p>Different from the switch in his previous life, Chen Xu could also incorporate content that the previous life's switch did not originally have.</p>
<p>Resolution and configuration are basic, in addition to vibration.</p>
<p>In his previous life, the switch was promoted for its unique HD vibration technology. In Nintendo’s words, if players closed their eyes, they might truly believe they were being pushed or kneaded by something, and even the appearance of real objects could be simulated through vibration.</p>
<p>However, in reality, it was mostly making grand promises. While it was indeed a better experience than ordinary motor vibrations, it wasn't as exaggerated as advertised.</p>
<p>The Parallel World's technology, however, could go a step further. Although it couldn't compare to the performance of a VR gaming pod, it could strive to give players a better experience, which phones couldn't do. After all, phones don't fully support games, whereas the switch would be a machine specifically for games.</p>
<p>For Chen Xu, what he wanted to do was build the switch into a new hardware platform.</p>
<p>Game consoles never make money from the machine itself, but from subsequent revenue.</p>
<p>Of course, Nintendo's consoles in his previous life were an exception because Nintendo could also make a fortune selling consoles. But that was due to Nintendo's years of accumulation. For Chen Xu, what was needed was to quickly push the switch to the market, and even if he could make money, Chen Xu would prefer to temporarily forgo that profit to expand the market.</p>
<p>Because a game console, like VR equipment and PC equipment.</p>
<p>Once bought, it won't be replaced for one or two years, or even longer.</p>
<p>How much can a game console profit?</p>
<p>But what about games?</p>
<p>Nebula Games' own first-party games, and subsequent third-party games.</p>
<p>Someone must like them, right?</p>
<p>You wouldn't buy a console just for collection, you'd use it to play games, right?</p>
<p>And when playing games, you wouldn't just play one game, right?</p>
<p>So, how about checking out other games?</p>
<p>No loss in buying, no getting ripped off.</p>
<p>If you don't buy more games, aren't you losing out big time with that machine?</p>
<p>Afterward, Chen Xu continued discussing the switch's content with Yan Xiong before concluding the meeting.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>After Yan Xiong left, Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and others from Nebula Games entered Chen Xu’s office, looking at him with curiosity.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, are we really making a handheld console?”</p>
<p>“So, will our upcoming games need to be adapted for handhelds?”</p>
<p>Everyone asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. Plus, some games will be handheld exclusives,” Chen Xu nodded slightly, smiling.</p>
<p>If the switch’s handheld design was a beautiful exterior.</p>
<p>Then the games it carried were its shining soul.</p>
<p>A handheld console is still a game console.</p>
<p>And what's the most important thing for a game console?</p>
<p>Of course, it's games.</p>
<p>Without games, no matter how good or high the handheld's configuration, it wouldn't be able to attract players.</p>
<p>And when the switch launches as Nebula Games' handheld console, it naturally needs some launch titles to escort it.</p>
<p>Additionally, some games will be ported to increase the launch lineup, so it doesn't look too meager. Large-scale games are not to be considered for now.</p>
<p>But games like Sanguosha, Undertale, Overcooked, Fall Guys, It Takes Two, and Minecraft are quite suitable.</p>
<p>As for Monster Hunter: World and Dark Souls, due to their large scale, they can only be grand promises for now, as there might not be enough time.</p>
<p>“Let’s not talk about these for now. During the afternoon meeting, I will focus on introducing the upcoming work arrangements.”</p>
<p>“However, moving forward, everyone’s time will be tight, and the workload will be quite high.”</p>
<p>Chen Xu looked at the crowd, giving them a heads-up.</p>
<p>And for the several games the switch needed to carry, Chen Xu already had some ideas.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>In the conference room, most people had arrived.</p>
<p>Several consecutive blockbusters, especially the epoch-making Red Dead Redemption and the highly successful Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.</p>
<p>All of them filled the team members with immense excitement and pride. At the same time, everyone was speculating about Chen Xu's next move.</p>
<p>Originally, everyone thought they would continue to delve deep into VR, but now, judging by the current stance, were they going to develop a handheld business?</p>
<p>“First, I believe everyone is already aware of the latest situation.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, next we will launch a revolutionary handheld console.”</p>
<p>“However, a handheld console is ultimately a game platform, so games are very important.”</p>
<p>“Unlike before, for this new handheld, we need to create some unique game adaptations to increase its appeal to players.”</p>
<p>“New games will be developed specifically for the new handheld platform.”</p>
<p>“Furthermore, Lin Tao and Meng Zuo, you two will be quite busy, because once the prototype machines are out, you'll need to port and optimize older games.”</p>
<p>Chen Xu looked at the team, distributing the various tasks.</p>
<p>As they entered work mode, everyone nodded with serious expressions.</p>
<p>Then, the names of the projects they needed to develop appeared on the big screen.</p>
<p>Super Mario Odyssey</p>
<p>Animal Crossing (Note: 1)</p>
<p>Looking at the two games, everyone showed astonished expressions.</p>
<p>Chen Xu had carefully considered choosing these games.</p>
<p>First, Super Mario Odyssey. In his previous life, when the switch reached 20 million sales, Super Mario Odyssey’s sales had already reached 10 million units, not including secondhand cartridge market data.</p>
<p>This meant that for every 2 switch owners, one had played this game, and its review scores were phenomenal.</p>
<p>Although partly due to the Mario series IP, the level design itself could be described as perfect.</p>
<p>Especially, its gameplay was meticulously integrated with the switch’s features, making it the best possible exclusive launch title.</p>
<p>And the second title, Animal Crossing, is a must-play for tough guys.</p>
<p>How to make a tough guy show his inner gentle side, soft as water? Very simple: go to a deserted island and pick up branches to play house.</p>
<p>This was also a huge IP with tens of millions in sales in his previous life. Selling over 10 million copies in ten days after release was terrifying, and subsequent sales of over 30 million were incredibly astonishing.</p>
<p>Moreover, the reason this game became so popular wasn’t just the influence of its previous IP.</p>
<p>It’s important to know that in his previous life, this game almost broke out of its niche in China. Before that, many players didn’t even know what Nintendo was.</p>
<p>Although heavily influenced by certain specific relationships, it still demonstrated the game’s charm.</p>
<p>Countless tough guys became obsessed with picking up branches, selling turnips for a cabbage-level price on Sunday and losing it all on the stock market on Saturday.</p>
<p>And Schrödinger's Sea Bass: the moment a large fish shadow is reeled in, through the player’s observation, the wave function collapses into a sea bass, transforming into the phrase: “It’s not a fish sauce, it’s a sea bass!”</p>
<p>When the switch launches, a lack of games is certain, so a game that can keep players engaged is needed.</p>
<p>And this 'tough guy picks branches' game is clearly the best choice.</p>
<p>At the same time, there’s another very important reason for choosing Animal Crossing.</p>
<p>That is, it’s a game that you become more reluctant to put down the more you play. If you’re not interested, you might find it very boring, but once you accept it and keep playing, you won’t want to let it go.</p>
<p>This is mainly due to its very special setting: the game's time is linked to real-world time.</p>
<p>Such a setting is perfectly matched with a handheld console, as one of the handheld’s inherent attributes is its portability.</p>
<p>Allowing players to enter their island at any time and connect with residents; boys become addicted to Isabelle's singing, while girls are charmed by Raymond's enticing meow.</p>
<p>Developing deep feelings for every little animal on the island over time.</p>
<p>The name is correct, but I won't say more~ A bit Riddler-like, those who know, know~</p>
