<h2>Chapter 168: Strict Clear Conditions (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h2>
<p>As a simple DEMO, most players initially thought it was nothing special and could be cleared easily before even trying it.</p>
<p>But reality surprised everyone.</p>
<p>Before the Gameplay exhibition, there weren't many big news stories in the gaming industry, as some developers, despite having activity, were saving their announcements for the exhibition itself.</p>
<p>And thus, 'Silent Hill PT,' the Test DEMO for the new version VR, became a focal point for many media outlets.</p>
<p>'Test DEMO "Silent Hill PT" launched for one day, clear rate at 1.76%'</p>
<p>When numerous media outlets published news based on trophy records from the Nebula Games Platform, even they were stunned.</p>
<p>It's already been a full day!</p>
<p>And judging from online player discussions, quite a few people should have played it!</p>
<p>Not even 2% clear rate achieved?</p>
<p>Could it be too difficult?</p>
<p>Or too terrifying?</p>
<p>Many media outlets grew curious.</p>
<p>Wu Tian, inside the Game Timespace, was also stunned upon seeing this data.</p>
<p>Because it was just a test DEMO, not many media outlets had reviewed it.</p>
<p>But now, seeing this clearance data, he genuinely felt curious.</p>
<p>So, driven by curiosity, he opened the Nebula Games Platform, downloaded the DEMO, and entered the game.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, Wu Tian stood up from his chair, hand clutching his chest, taking several deep breaths. With slightly trembling hands, he pulled open the curtains and let sunlight flood in.</p>
<p>Now he understood why the game's completion rate was so low!</p>
<p>How could an average player possibly endure this?!</p>
<p>Of course, if it were only about horror, quite a few players could still clear it.</p>
<p>After all, this wasn't the high-immersion VR version. PC players had plenty of tricks up their sleeve to reduce fear.</p>
<p>Replacing models of ghost characters like Lisa—well, that goes without saying.</p>
<p>After all, one wrong move, and a horror game turns into a 'shooting' game.</p>
<p>But adjusting brightness, turning off the sound and playing crosstalk or cheerful songs, or gathering a few brave guys to sit in rows, holding hands while playing—that's all valid strategies, right?</p>
<p>The key point, however, is that the clear conditions for 'Silent Hill PT' are quite strict.</p>
<p>It wasn't until the next day that hardcore players, through extensive research into the game and exchanges on forums, finally figured out the clear conditions for 'Silent Hill PT'.</p>
<p>What surprised many players was that although 'Silent Hill PT' was only a test DEMO, it genuinely told a simple story.</p>
<p>In the game's infinite loop corridor, there are a total of fourteen cycles. Each traversal triggers new story content.</p>
<p>In the second loop of the corridor, players are guided back to see a photograph of their wife on the ground. Approaching and picking it up reveals three lines of text: <em>Can you hear my voice? Can you interpret this message? If you come looking for me, I'll wait for you forever.</em></p>
<p>This is the game's first hint.</p>
<p>In various corners of the room, there are photograph shreds—eight in total, but with ten sentences. Each collected shred randomly reveals a phrase written in a different language. These ten sentences are crucial clues to clearing the game.</p>
<p>When connected, they read:</p>
<p><em>In waiting I remain still. I whisper his name softly. His fingertips brush across my hand, that hand is cold. My body trembles. Waiting for the end of this. I do not move. The hand reaching toward me gradually vanishes into the mist. I believe I heard a phone call.</em></p>
<p>Every time the player is killed by the ghost Lisa, it signifies game over, causing the game to crash and exit. However, this screen reveals a crucial piece of information: the protagonist's name in the game: J.</p>
<p>As the game progresses, the atmosphere becomes increasingly oppressive and eerie.</p>
<p>And through the story, players can learn how Lisa died.</p>
<p>During another loop, players can use the peephole in the corridor to hear sounds from the bathroom.</p>
<p>Based on the sound effects, one can speculate that Lisa had her eyes gouged out, her throat slit, and was ultimately disemboweled to remove the fetus and killed.</p>
<p>Previously, Lisa's bubbly vocalizations were also due to blood foam choking her throat.</p>
<p>The reason Lisa was killed can be learned through a mysterious, low-voiced narration: <em>You were fired, so you drowned your sorrows in alcohol. She had to take a part-time job as a cashier at the convenience store. The only reason she earned money there was because the manager liked her. You haven't forgotten, have you? Ten months ago.</em></p>
<p>From this, one can speculate why the protagonist killed Lisa—he believed she had an affair and that the child in her womb wasn't his.</p>
<p>After collecting all the information, during the final loop, completing three steps leads to a successful clear.</p>
<p>The first step: Do nothing. Wait one minute in front of the digital clock, allowing the time to reach zero.</p>
<p>This confirms a previous sentence collected with the photograph: <em>In waiting I remain still.</em></p>
<p>Then, walk forward ten steps. The baby's first laugh will sound.</p>
<p>At this point, the sound of Lisa's high heels will appear. Follow the sound to find Lisa, maintain a certain distance, then use the microphone to speak the protagonist's name collected earlier: J.</p>
<p>This confirms the photograph clue: <em>I whisper his name softly.</em></p>
<p>Lisa will then lunge at the player and possess them.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the screen gently shakes. In VR, players can feel motor vibrations transmitted through the gaming pod.</p>
<p>For the PC version, using a controller allows players to feel controller vibrations. For those using only mouse and keyboard, the screen will vibrate instead.</p>
<p>This confirms another photograph clue: <em>His fingertips brush across my hand, that hand is cold. My body trembles.</em></p>
<p>Then, eerie music begins to play. But the player must remain still, confirming the next clue: <em>I do not move. The hand reaching toward me gradually vanishes into the mist.</em></p>
<p>Once the music completely fades, the baby's second laugh appears, and the phone in the corridor rings, confirming the final clue: <em>I believe I heard a phone call.</em></p>
<p>Walk up to the phone. A voice comes from it: <em>You have been chosen.</em></p>
<p>In the next moment, the door lock clicks open, and the clear achievement trophy pops up.</p>
<p>After reading through the guides compiled by high-level players, countless players were stunned.</p>
<p>Because this was simply too strict!</p>
<p>Especially the final clear conditions—missing even one clue makes it impossible to deduce these steps.</p>
<p>As high-level players published clear guides, countless online players began discussing.</p>
<p>'I'm convinced! These strict clear conditions—if I tried, I wouldn't clear it even after playing for a year!'</p>
<p>'Bro upstairs, be more confident. You'll never clear it in your entire life. You've got 0.1 hours on record—how the hell are you clearing anything?'</p>
<p>'Hehe, 0.1 hours? You're giving him too much credit. That's the Nebula Games Platform's default minimum recorded time. He definitely just entered, took a quick look, and quit! What, you ask how I know? Because that's exactly what I did!'</p>
<p>'Strongly suggest some big sponsor support this game—I think it's on par with extreme sports!'</p>
<p>'Your death will exceed your imagination!'</p>
<p>Although DEMO walkthroughs have been released, player discussions about 'Silent Hill PT' haven't stopped.</p>
<p>And on live streaming platforms, even with guides available, streamers still get scared as much as anyone.</p>
<p>A simple DEMO has brought countless players indescribable psychological trauma.</p>
<p>Some players even joked they developed PTSD symptoms, afraid to walk alone down the corridor to the toilet at night, terrified that opening the bathroom door would reveal yet another endless corridor of their own home.</p>
<p>If there's any news that could help players relax and turn their mood joyful...</p>
<p>It's probably that this year's Gameplay is finally about to begin.</p>
<p>The prequel to 'Dark Souls' they've been anticipating will finally reveal more information!</p>
<p>More tonight~</p>
<p>(End of Chapter) &lt;<END_OF_CHAPTER>&gt;</p>
