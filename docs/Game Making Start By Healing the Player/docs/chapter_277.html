                <p>Chapter 276: First Experience (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Sitting in front of his computer, Zhang Yi was also looking forward to the unlocking of the Warcraft demo experience.</p>
<p>"Sigh, why did Nebula Games make an RTS game this time?" Wang Han, sitting next to Zhang Yi, was scrolling through information on her phone, chatting with Joey.</p>
<p>As for RTS games, neither Wang Han nor Joey particularly liked them. They had played them but couldn't get into them.</p>
<p>They felt the controls were too complicated. At most, they would play against AI opponents.</p>
<p>"I feel that Warcraft might be different," Zhang Yi said.</p>
<p>He occasionally played RTS games himself, but he wasn't very good; he was just an average player. He was the type to silently mass-produce units, then drag a box around them and A-move towards the enemy base. One push decided the victory: if all his units died, then his opponent won. If his units didn't die out, then, sorry, the opponent's base was gone.</p>
<p>"Exactly, the multiplayer battles in Warcraft are hard to say, but I feel the Single-Player Mode should be pretty good," Song Ren and Wang Yifan said in the voice channel.</p>
<p>"What kind of story can an RTS game have? The single-player story in that 'Human Wars' almost put me to sleep," Wang Han said.</p>
<p>She had tried some RTS games before, thinking if she couldn't win multiplayer, and simple AI opponents were boring, she'd try the single-player story. The result was truly subpar, described in one sentence: The enemies are coming, what should we do? We defeated the enemies and won, but new enemies are coming again. It really almost made her fall asleep.</p>
<p>"You can't compare other developers to Chen Xu. I still have a lot of faith in him, even though he always pulls some stunts," Zhang Yi was quite confident about Warcraft.</p>
<p>Especially that CG animation really shocked Zhang Yi. He had never seen any game company invest so much in an RTS game before. And the short one-minute CG promotional animation for Warcraft at the time also made Zhang Yi very curious.</p>
<p>Because he felt that, unlike typical RTS games that turned their so-called single-player stories directly into new player tutorial levels, this Warcraft seemed to genuinely have a complete single-player story. Connecting this to Chen Xu's earlier mention of 'subverting the RTS genre' and '700 million Yuan in development costs,'</p>
<p>Zhang Yi had a bold guess: would Warcraft really put a lot of effort into its story? Like most players, he thought that Chen Xu, venturing into the RTS genre for the first time, might struggle with balance in multiplayer mode. But the single-player story was different. This tested level design, and considering Chen Xu's level design in Dark Souls and It Takes Two, was there any doubt? So he felt that for Warcraft, Chen Xu was very likely focusing on the single-player story. He was still quite confident in games produced by Nebula Games.</p>
<p>He even secretly used his private stash of money to buy a Collector's Edition of Warcraft! Of course, Wang Han absolutely couldn't know about this, or else he might end up washing all the clothes himself in the future. After all, buying the Collector's Edition of Warcraft wasn't the crucial point; the crucial point was that he had a private stash of money.</p>
<p>"Alright, alright, you play first and I'll watch. If it's fun, I'll go try it myself, the game isn't going anywhere anyway," Wang Han said to Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>"It's time! Old Zhang, I'm muting my mic!" Song Ren's excited voice came from the voice channel.</p>
<p>"O.J.B.K!" Zhang Yi replied and immediately clicked the Warcraft icon.</p>
<p>Entering the game, accompanied by the Nebula Games Logo flashing past,</p>
<p>The first thing to appear was a CG animation. It was the same CG promotional animation that Chen Xu had previously released on the official Weibo account. Zhang Yi had seen it more than once, but this time he still chose not to skip it.</p>
<p>The CG content was relatively easy to understand. It meant that humans and orcs were not friends but opposing factions, but suddenly an evil enemy descended from the sky, forcing orcs and humans to unite. Soon the CG animation ended, and a game UI interface appeared.</p>
<p>The background behind it was an iceberg-like scene, which should be one of the game's environments. Aside from the 'Exit Game' and 'Options Settings' buttons,</p>
<p>Zhang Yi observed three different choices in the game: Story Campaign, LAN Local Multiplayer, and Online Multiplayer. However, both Online Multiplayer and LAN Local Multiplayer were currently grayed out, clearly not supported in the demo version. But this only made Zhang Yi even more excited, because from the content of this demo, Chen Xu clearly wanted players to experience the single-player story, which perfectly matched his guess!</p>
<p>"Let me see how this single-player story is!" With an excited heart, Zhang Yi eagerly clicked the Story Campaign button.</p>
<p>Story Campaign was no different from other games; before entering, one could choose the difficulty: Easy, Normal, and Hard. For this part, Zhang Yi thought seriously and chose the easiest difficulty.</p>
<p>"You're so embarrassing," Wang Han muttered from beside him. Easiest is easiest, but what's the meaning of your mouse hovering over 'Hard' and 'Normal' for three or four seconds before not choosing either?</p>
<p>"Ahem... This is Chen Xu's game, after all. Think about Dark Souls and It Takes Two. I'm just being proactive," Zhang Yi awkwardly coughed and explained.</p>
<p>After selecting the difficulty, what appeared on Zhang Yi's screen was 'Chapter One'. Clearly, this single-player story was a linear game, requiring completion chapter by chapter.</p>
<p>After clicking Chapter One, Zhang Yi was stunned. Because there were simply too many levels in this first chapter!</p>
<p>He counted briefly, and there were a full twelve sub-chapters! However, only the first one was lit up, displaying the level name: 'Thrall's Vision - Seeking the Far Seer' (The original prologue and Chapter One were merged). The rest were still gray, their names unclear.</p>
<p>"I just wonder how long each level will be," Zhang Yi became even more excited.</p>
<p>He immediately clicked on the first prologue level.</p>
<p>The screen gradually darkened, and a narration began to speak.</p>
<p>'The sands of time have run out, Son of Durotan.'</p>
<p>'The horns of war echo in the wind, specters of old poison the land, and the fierce flames of war once again scorch the world.'</p>
<p>'Leading thousands of troops to bleed on the battlefield, mortals blindly rush towards their doom, unaware that the Burning Shadow is about to devour all things.'</p>
<p>'You must rally the Horde, and lead them to their destiny!'</p>
<p>On the battlefield, human armies and orc armies were clashing, and then, just like the previous opening cutscene, countless fireballs burning with green flames fell from the sky. The next moment, the camera switched to a high ridge, where a disoriented orc, named Thrall, just awakened from a nightmare in his barracks.</p>
<p>This CG segment supplemented the content from the previous promotional CG, but it also raised many questions and curiosities for Zhang Yi. Humans and orcs are at war, what exactly is that flaming figure descending from the sky? What is the Burning Shadow? And who is that mysterious sorcerer at the end?</p>
<p>Controlling Thrall, the orc who just woke from a nightmare, Zhang Yi's heart was filled with curiosity. But curiosity aside, he quickly refocused on the game.</p>
<p>Thrall advanced under the guidance of the Far Seer. This was a basic game operation tutorial.</p>
<p>However, what surprised him most was the overall quality of the game. Zooming in the camera, he could even clearly see the exquisite modeling of the characters in the game. Even the water on the ground and the grass textures were incredibly detailed.</p>
<p>Is this really an RTS game? The quality is simply too high!</p>
<p>He hadn't even played the actual game content yet. But just the modeling and graphics of Warcraft, combined with the earlier CG, already left Zhang Yi in awe. One could only say that Warcraft's current presentation completely exceeded his expectations.</p>
<p>There was indeed a noticeable difference compared to the CG animation. But compared to other RTS games, setting aside the content, the presentation alone was far superior!</p>
<p>(End of Chapter)</p>
