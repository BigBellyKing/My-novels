<p>Chapter 276: First Experience (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Sitting in front of the computer, Zhang Yi eagerly awaited the unlock of the <em>Warcraft</em> trial version.</p>
<p>"Ah, why did Nebula Games decide to make an RTS this time?" Wang Han, sitting beside Zhang Yi, was scrolling through her phone, chatting with Joey.</p>
<p>Wang Han and Joey weren’t particularly fond of RTS games.</p>
<p>They’d played a bit, but couldn’t really get into them.</p>
<p>The operations felt too complicated.</p>
<p>At most, they’d play against Easy AI.</p>
<p>"I think <em>Warcraft</em> might be different," Zhang Yi said.</p>
<p>He occasionally played RTS games himself, though he wasn’t particularly skilled—just an average player.</p>
<p>The type who would blindly produce units, then select them all with the mouse and A-move straight toward the enemy base.</p>
<p>All-in Push to decide the outcome: if all his units died, you won.</p>
<p>If his units survived, then sorry—your base was gone.</p>
<p>"Right. I can’t say much about the multiplayer versus, but the single-player mode feels like it could be pretty solid," Song Ren and Wang Yifan chimed in through the voice channel.</p>
<p>"What kind of story can an RTS even have? The single-player story in that <em>Human Wars</em> game almost put me to sleep," Wang Han said.</p>
<p>She’d tried a few RTS games before—since she couldn’t handle multiplayer, and got tired of Easy AI—so she thought she’d give the story campaign a shot.</p>
<p>But the result was truly underwhelming. To describe it in one sentence:</p>
<p>"The enemy attacks, and we must do this and that."</p>
<p>"We defeat the enemy and win, but then a new enemy appears."</p>
<p>It nearly bored her to sleep.</p>
<p>"You can’t compare other developers to Chen Xu. I still have faith in him, even if he always pulls some stunts," Zhang Yi said confidently about <em>Warcraft</em>.</p>
<p>Especially after seeing that CG animation—it had stunned him.</p>
<p>He’d never seen a game company invest so much into an RTS before.</p>
<p>And that brief one-minute CG video released by Chen Xu earlier had left a deep impression.</p>
<p>Because he sensed this <em>Warcraft</em> would be different from typical RTS titles—where so-called single-player stories were just rebranded new player tutorial levels.</p>
<p>He felt that <em>Warcraft</em> might actually have a complete single-player story.</p>
<p>Combined with Chen Xu’s earlier mention of "revolutionizing the RTS genre" and "700 million development costs," Zhang Yi had a bold theory: maybe <em>Warcraft</em> would truly go all-in on its story.</p>
<p>Like most players, he thought that Chen Xu, stepping into RTS for the first time, might struggle with balance in multiplayer modes.</p>
<p>But a single-player story? That was a different matter.</p>
<p>It tested Level Design—and Chen Xu’s Level Design? Just think of <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>It Takes Two</em>. Was there any reason to doubt?</p>
<p>So he believed it was highly likely Chen Xu was focusing his efforts on the single-player story.</p>
<p>He had great confidence in any game released by Nebula Games.</p>
<p>He’d even secretly used his Private Stash of Money to buy a Collector's Edition of <em>Warcraft</em>!</p>
<p>Of course, he couldn’t let her find out—otherwise, he’d probably be doing laundry for life.</p>
<p>The key wasn’t buying the Collector’s Edition; the real issue was that he had secret savings.</p>
<p>"Alright, fine. You go ahead and play. If it’s good, I’ll try it myself later. It’s not like the game’s going anywhere," Wang Han said to Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>"It’s time! Old Zhang, I’m muting my mic!" Song Ren’s excited voice came through the voice channel.</p>
<p>"O.J.B.K!" Zhang Yi replied, quickly clicking the <em>Warcraft</em> icon.</p>
<p>After the Nebula Games Logo flashed by,</p>
<p>a CG animation played immediately.</p>
<p>It was the same promotional CG animation Chen Xu had released on the official Weibo account.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi had watched it multiple times, but this time, he didn’t skip it.</p>
<p>The CG content was easy to understand:</p>
<p>Humans and orcs weren’t friends—they were opposing factions. But suddenly, an evil enemy descended from the sky, forcing orcs and humans to join forces.</p>
<p>Soon, the CG animation ended, and a game UI interface appeared.</p>
<p>The background showed a scene resembling an iceberg—likely one of the game’s actual environments.</p>
<p>Besides the Exit Game and Settings options,</p>
<p>Zhang Yi noticed three main choices in the game:</p>
<p>Story Campaign, Local LAN Versus, and Online Versus.</p>
<p>However, both Online Versus and LAN were grayed out—clearly not supported in the demo version.</p>
<p>But this only made Zhang Yi more excited. This demo clearly emphasized the single-player story—just as he’d predicted!</p>
<p>"Let’s see just how good this single-player story really is!" Full of anticipation, Zhang Yi eagerly clicked the Story Campaign button.</p>
<p>Like other games, the Story Campaign allowed difficulty selection before starting.</p>
<p>Easy, Regular, and Hardened.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi thought carefully and picked the easiest difficulty.</p>
<p>"That’s so embarrassing," Wang Han muttered, speechless.</p>
<p>Picking Easy is one thing, but hovering your mouse between Hardened and Regular for three or four seconds, then not selecting either? What was that?</p>
<p>"Ahem… This is Mr. Chen’s game, after all. Remember <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>? I’m just being cautious," Zhang Yi explained awkwardly, clearing his throat.</p>
<p>After selecting the difficulty, a screen appeared showing "Chapter One." Clearly, the single-player story was a linear game, meant to be played chapter by chapter.</p>
<p>When Zhang Yi clicked Chapter One, he was stunned.</p>
<p>Because there were way too many levels in this chapter!</p>
<p>He quickly counted—twelve sub-chapters in total!</p>
<p>Only the first one was lit up, displaying the level name: "Thrall’s Vision—Finding the Far Seer" (a merge of the original Prologue and Chapter One).</p>
<p>The rest remained grayed out, their names unreadable.</p>
<p>"I wonder how long each level will actually take," Zhang Yi thought, growing even more excited.</p>
<p>Without delay, he clicked the first Prologue level.</p>
<p>The screen slowly faded to black as Narration began.</p>
<p>"The sands of time have run out, son of Durotan."</p>
<p>"The war drums echo on the wind. The remnants of the past poison the land. Once again, the world burns in flames."</p>
<p>"Mortals charge blindly into their doom, staining the battlefield with blood, unaware that the Burning Shadow is about to consume all."</p>
<p>"You must unite the Horde and lead them to their destiny!"</p>
<p>On the battlefield, human and orc armies clashed. Then, just like in the opening cutscene, countless fireballs engulfed in green flames rained down from the sky.</p>
<p>The scene shifted to a high ridge, where an orc named Thrall—just awakened from a nightmare—sat in his tent, dazed and disoriented.</p>
<p>This CG segment completed the earlier promotional footage, yet raised many questions in Zhang Yi’s mind.</p>
<p>What was that fiery figure falling from the sky during the human-orc battle?</p>
<p>What exactly was the Burning Shadow?</p>
<p>And who was that mysterious wizard at the end?</p>
<p>Controlling Thrall, the orc who just woke from his nightmare, Zhang Yi was filled with curiosity.</p>
<p>But curiosity aside, he quickly focused back on the gameplay.</p>
<p>Under the Far Seer’s guidance, the character Thrall moved forward.</p>
<p>This was a basic gameplay tutorial.</p>
<p>But what amazed him most was the game’s overall quality.</p>
<p>Zooming in, he could clearly see the exquisite modeling of the characters.</p>
<p>Even the water on the ground and the grass textures were stunningly detailed.</p>
<p>This was really an RTS game?</p>
<p>The quality was just too high!</p>
<p>He hadn’t even played the game yet.</p>
<p>But just the modeling and graphics of <em>Warcraft</em>, combined with the earlier CG, had already left Zhang Yi stunned.</p>
<p>The game’s presentation far exceeded his expectations.</p>
<p>Sure, there was a noticeable gap compared to the CG animation.</p>
<p>But compared to other RTS games? Forget content—just the visuals alone were leagues ahead!</p>
