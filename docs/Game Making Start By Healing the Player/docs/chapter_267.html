<p>Chapter 266: A Game That Could Be Called Legendary (Sixth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter: World</em> continues to sell steadily, and player enthusiasm remains exceptionally high.</p>
<p>In fact, there is still considerable work ahead for <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>.</p>
<p>Although at its core it's a single-player game, it’s a single-player game with remarkable longevity.</p>
<p>Moreover, in Chen Xu’s plan, additional versions would be gradually released in the future.</p>
<p>This includes classic monsters from the Monster Hunter series in his previous life, such as the Crimson Fatalis, Thunder Serpent, Shrieker, Safi'jiiva, and Bulldrome...</p>
<p>However, these would be rolled out gradually in the future. As for the current version of <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, the content is already quite substantial.</p>
<p>Similar to the DLC approach used in <em>Dark Souls</em>, Chen Xu also planned to establish a dedicated project team to slowly develop these additions.</p>
<p>Beyond that, it was time to proceed with the previously established strategy.</p>
<p>Further consolidating the advantages of the Nebula Games Platform, while <em>Minecraft</em> was a long-term game, for many players it leaned more toward light, casual entertainment.</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, on the other hand, currently had extremely active players.</p>
<p>However, as content deepened, the rate of player attrition would inevitably be faster than expected.</p>
<p>Therefore, Chen Xu also needed another game to eventually take over the role of <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, reinforcing user retention on the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>For this new project, Chen Xu chose a game that could be considered legendary.</p>
<p>An RTS competitive game: <em>Warcraft</em>.</p>
<p>Initially, Chen Xu had considered MOBA-style games.</p>
<p>Whether it was <em>DOTA</em> from his previous life or <em>LOL</em>, both were viable.</p>
<p>For Chen Xu at this point, both user base and capital were sufficient.</p>
<p>Moreover, the development difficulty wasn’t particularly high.</p>
<p>However, after careful consideration and market research, Chen Xu decided to temporarily hold off on the MOBA strategy.</p>
<p>There were two main reasons.</p>
<p>First, MOBA games had never emerged in this world. Even RTS games were still in a developmental phase. Releasing a MOBA game too soon might make its gameplay mode difficult for most players to grasp.</p>
<p>In this parallel world, however, RTS games were relatively popular.</p>
<p>Many key game settings that Chen Xu considered important had already been substantially refined.</p>
<p>For example, the concept of Fog of War in games.</p>
<p>In his previous life, the Fog of War mechanic originated from hardware limitations of early games.</p>
<p>Its earliest embryonic form appeared in <em>Dune</em>, with a more complete concept established in <em>Patton Versus Rommel</em>. But it was truly popularized by <em>Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, many classic game designs originated as compromises due to limited technical capabilities.</p>
<p>In this parallel world, however, Fog of War didn’t emerge from technical limitations, but was instead proposed and conceptualized by designers.</p>
<p>There was even significant controversy—for instance, lawsuits lasting years over who first invented the Fog of War design, with no definitive conclusion to this day.</p>
<p>The second point that caught Chen Xu’s attention was that the esports industry in this parallel world was significantly more vibrant compared to his previous life.</p>
<p>This wasn’t surprising, as the gaming industry here was larger and held a higher status than in his previous life.</p>
<p>Under such conditions, where prestige, fame, and attention were abundant, it was natural for a solid competitive game to spawn professional tournaments.</p>
<p>For example, the game with the highest concurrent players on the Channel Alliance was an RTS title called <em>Human Wars</em>.</p>
<p>This was also a key reason why Chen Xu chose <em>Warcraft</em>.</p>
<p>Judging from the subtle moves made by the Channel Alliance, NetDragon, and TengHua after the release of <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, it was clear they wouldn’t just sit idle.</p>
<p>Chen Xu had no intention of waiting around either.</p>
<p>It was highly probable that once he announced a new game, the Channel Alliance, NetDragon, and TengHua would immediately respond with countermeasures.</p>
<p>If that was the case, it was better to strike first.</p>
<p>When potential enemies pose a threat, eliminate them before they can become dangerous.</p>
<p>How great would that be!</p>
<p>Therefore, after comprehensive consideration, Chen Xu decided to develop <em>Warcraft</em> first.</p>
<p>After making the decision, Chen Xu stared at the computer monitor in front of him, pausing in thought.</p>
<p>He began outlining the basic framework.</p>
<p>In his previous life, there were many outstanding RTS games.</p>
<p>Early RTS pioneers like <em>Age of Empires</em> and <em>Red Alert</em>, and <em>StarCraft</em>, which became the competitive benchmark.</p>
<p>But if one had to name the most influential RTS game of all time...</p>
<p>Among players familiar with the RTS genre, nine out of ten would say <em>Warcraft</em>.</p>
<p>It was simply too iconic—especially the third installment.</p>
<p>Setting aside the story, purely from a game mechanics standpoint, <em>Warcraft</em> was truly the culmination of the series, establishing its own distinct style.</p>
<p>Food/Supply, unique tech trees and skills for each unit, enabling diverse combinations—especially the introduction of the Hero (attack type) system, which revolutionized the entire RTS genre.</p>
<p>In a way, the introduction of Heroes indirectly led to the rise of MOBA games.</p>
<p>Especially with the final expansion, <em>The Frozen Throne</em>, <em>Warcraft</em> ascended to legendary status.</p>
<p>Many players might not be familiar with the <em>Warcraft</em> storyline, but they certainly knew the two central characters from <em>The Frozen Throne</em>:</p>
<p>Illidan and Arthas.</p>
<p>Even when <em>World of Warcraft</em> was later released, many <em>Warcraft</em> fans got into the game specifically because of these two characters.</p>
<p>Although these two characters didn’t appear until <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em> and <em>The Burning Crusade</em>, and were even made into grindable bosses for players.</p>
<p>But for Chen Xu, his current plan was to only incorporate the storylines of <em>Reign of Chaos</em> and <em>The Frozen Throne</em> from <em>Warcraft 3</em> into the base game.</p>
<p>As for earlier storylines like <em>Orcs &amp; Humans</em>, <em>Tides of Darkness</em>, and <em>Beyond the Dark Portal</em>, he would gauge player feedback.</p>
<p>If enthusiasm was high, he’d release corresponding solo campaigns as DLC.</p>
<p>If interest was lukewarm, he’d follow Blizzard Entertainment’s old tradition and just release animated cutscenes.</p>
<p>Another core element was the Map Editor.</p>
<p>One game, a thousand playstyles—this was the praise later given to <em>Minecraft</em> before its release.</p>
<p>But before that, this title belonged to <em>Warcraft</em>.</p>
<p>The reason <em>Warcraft</em> in his previous life had such enduring vitality wasn’t just due to its high quality, but largely thanks to the Map Editor feature.</p>
<p>Games like <em>DOTA</em> and <em>LOL</em> were deeply connected to it.</p>
<p>After briefly outlining several development directions, Chen Xu stretched and walked out of his office.</p>
<p>Although it was an RTS game, the scale of <em>Warcraft</em> was absolutely massive. For Chen Xu, he had no intention of treating it as just another small RTS title.</p>
<p>If he was going to do it, he would make this legendary game from his previous life into the pinnacle achievable on the current Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>Just to clarify—there are currently no plans to develop <em>LOL</em> or <em>DOTA</em> after <em>Warcraft 3</em>. Even though the world championships and TI are happening now~</p>
