                <p>Chapter 602: An Absolute Masterpiece (Seeking Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>They finally arrived at their destination, the University of Eastern Colorado. Joel and Ellie continued their search for clues about the Fireflies. However, when they reached the university laboratory, they found that the Fireflies had long since left, leaving behind only infected corpses. Nevertheless, Joel and his companions obtained some crucial clues here: the Fireflies had moved to St. Mary's Hospital in Salt Lake City to the west. But just as Joel was preparing to leave, they ran into hunters who had come to scavenge for supplies. During the battle, Joel fell from the rooftop and was impaled in the abdomen by a rebar. The severe injury left Joel incredibly weak and covered in blood, but fortunately, Ellie was reliable enough to take care of the remaining enemies by herself.</p>
<p>This leg of the journey was incredibly arduous. In particular, the game's simulation of Joel's severely wounded vision made players truly feel his weakness. Finally, as the two were preparing to ride away, Joel, due to excessive blood loss, collapsed onto the ground and lost consciousness. Following a black screen, when the visuals reappeared, it was already winter.</p>
<p>First to appear on screen was a cute bunny. But before the bunny could run two steps, an arrow pierced it. It turned out to be Ellie, who was hunting. Judging by her self-talk, Joel should still be alive. This made Li Yue breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Ellie then spotted a deer, but while chasing it, she encountered two passersby. In their subsequent conversation, Ellie learned their names and intentions. The middle-aged man, David, claimed he wanted to trade items for the deer Ellie had. Ellie, without hesitation, asked them if they had any antibiotics.</p>
<p>David agreed to the trade and sent the young man next to him back to fetch the medicine. On their way, a group of infected individuals arrived unexpectedly. After an intense battle, David and Ellie warmed themselves inside a house. At this point, Ellie seemed to have lowered her guard against David. However, during their subsequent conversation, David looked at Ellie and brought up something. He mentioned that a while ago, he had sent a team out to find food, but they were all killed by a lunatic who was accompanied by a small girl. In that instant, Ellie realized that their intentions were not good, yet the man unexpectedly allowed her to leave.</p>
<p>Ellie returned to their hideout; Joel was still lying unconscious on the ground. Ellie had obtained the antibiotics to save him. But soon, the enemies arrived. Because of Ellie's actions, David and his group realized something. That is, Joel must be injured; otherwise, Ellie wouldn't be looking for medicine. Letting Ellie go was merely a ploy to follow her tracks and find Joel's location. Realizing this, Ellie immediately decided to lure these hunters away. Although she eliminated many enemies, Ellie was still outnumbered and eventually captured.</p>
<p>Waking up in a cell, Ellie discovered that the hunters outside were actually dismembering a living person. Clearly, humans were these hunters' food source. At this moment, their leader, David, appeared, revealing his true colors. This guy was an utter pervert, a child molester! Facing David's depraved intentions, Ellie remained unfazed; she even broke one of David's fingers. This infuriated David, who decided to turn Ellie directly into their food.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Just as Ellie faced danger, Joel finally woke up. Seeing Joel awaken, Li Yue was utterly delighted. The awakened Joel endured the pain of his wounds and struggled to stand. The first thing he did was call out Ellie's name, his concern palpable. After such a long time of companionship and countless life-or-death situations, Joel deeply understood what Ellie meant to him. Despite his unhealed wounds, Joel strenuously defeated David's subordinates and successfully captured two of them alive. The subsequent brutal interrogation methods didn't make players feel uncomfortable; instead, there was a satisfying sense of catharsis. However, this was followed by even greater worry, anxiousness about Ellie's current situation.</p>
<p>But Ellie, on her side, didn't wait for Joel to rescue her, unlike most game or movie scenarios. Instead, Ellie ingeniously escaped and, using the blizzard, searched for a way out of the town. This segment of the story features dual narrative threads, with the player's perspective constantly switching between Joel and Ellie. Inside the restaurant, the game's only BOSS battle would take place. The opponent was not a terrifying zombie, but another human being. Here, Ellie needed to conceal her movements, circling around David and backstabbing him three times. It was quite challenging, especially since Ellie couldn't make any sound throughout, yet there were shattered glass shards in some areas on the floor. Li Yue, not having mastered it the first time, even died once here. After successfully backstabbing him three times, David was defeated, triggering a cutscene. Confronting David, who had ambushed her from behind and knocked her down, Ellie grabbed a nearby kitchen knife and mercilessly hacked at David's head. Eleven cuts in total, clearly demonstrating to everyone the fate of a child molester. At this moment, Joel finally arrived. He hugged Ellie tightly, gently comforting her, and Ellie sobbed uncontrollably in his embrace.</p>
<p>From the Boston quarantine zone to now, on the verge of reaching St. Mary's Hospital in Salt Lake City, from summer to autumn and then to winter. Along this journey, they had endured countless hardships and life-or-death crises. At this moment, both Joel and Ellie understood how important the other was to them. By this point, the game's story was drawing to a close. Joel and Ellie's emotions, having experienced the settings of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, had also undergone significant changes. From initial indifference, to later trust, and now. The other had become an indispensable presence in their lives. Their conversations during the journey also became warmer and richer.</p>
<p>Joel told Ellie that once everything was over, he would teach her how to play the guitar.</p>
<p>Passing through corridors filled with floating dust and sunlight. The scene before them stunned everyone who played up to this point. Ahead, a giraffe was feeding, and not just one; its herd was in the distance. Ellie stood frozen. Born into the apocalypse, she had never seen such a graceful animal. Guided by Joel, Ellie gently walked forward and stroked the giraffe's neck. Countless giraffes leisurely chewed on green leaves, swinging their tails as they advanced gracefully, fully displaying the delicacy and beauty of life. The apocalypse was only relative to humanity. But for the animals, this world seemed to have become even more beautiful.</p>
<p>Here, Joel looked at Ellie and told her that at this point, they didn't necessarily have to find the Fireflies. They could go back, back to Tommy's town; it could accommodate them. However, Ellie still refused, as they had already sacrificed so much. Finally, the two successfully reached the Fireflies' base.</p>
<p>Facing Joel, Marlene, the Firefly leader who had returned to the base, seemed a little incredulous. Because she hadn't imagined that Joel and Ellie could travel thousands of miles from the Boston quarantine zone to find the Fireflies' base. However, the subsequent conversation revealed a cruel truth to the players. According to Marlene, the Cordyceps fungus in Ellie's body had mutated. That's why Ellie was immune to the virus, but this mutation had already reached Ellie's brain. To understand the principle of immunity, researchers would have to remove the Cordyceps fungus that had spread to Ellie's brain to conduct reverse research and develop a vaccine. Such research would clearly cost Ellie her life.</p>
<p>Joel asked Marlene to find others to research, but Marlene told Joel it was impossible because Ellie was the only one discovered in twenty years. So Marlene imprisoned Joel. In that instant, Joel made a choice. Joel had never been a noble person. When the apocalypse struck, he made Tommy ignore people crying for help in the streets. Because inside that car was his world, his daughter, Sarah. After the apocalypse, to survive, he had been a hunter, a smuggler. And now, he finally had a new world again. Twenty years ago, his world was destroyed; twenty years later, he would absolutely not allow his world to be destroyed again.</p>
<p>Finding an opportunity to fight back, then forcing out Ellie's whereabouts, he single-handedly confronted all the armed forces in the entire Fireflies' base. At this moment, Joel was like a wild, solitary wolf. Throughout most of 'The Last of Us' game, stealth was required to reach objectives. But at this moment, Li Yue wasn't sure if it was his imagination, he felt that the entire game's pace had changed. There was no route planning, no stealth assassinations. At this moment, both the player and Joel had only one thought. That was to find Ellie as quickly as possible. Because every second delayed meant Ellie faced the danger of death. To hell with saving the world; he only wanted to save Ellie, to save the little girl he had spent day and night with.</p>
<p>Finally, at the last moment, Joel broke through all of the Fireflies' defenses and entered the operating room, rescuing Ellie. In the parking lot, Joel killed Marlene and left the Fireflies with the unconscious Ellie. In the car, facing the awakened Ellie, Joel told a lie. He told her that there were actually many other immune individuals among the Fireflies besides her. But they couldn't offer any help; the Fireflies had given up. Next, they planned to return to Tommy's town and start a new life.</p>
<p>Finally, on the road, just before reaching the town, Ellie confided in Joel.</p>
<p>‘In Boston, when I was bitten… I wasn't alone. My best friend was there too, and she was also bitten.’</p>
<p>‘We didn't know what to do, so… she said, [Let's just wait and see. Maybe becoming crazy together would be poetic.]’</p>
<p>‘I was still waiting for my turn. Her name was Riley, and she was the first victim I ever saw.’</p>
<p>‘Then Tess, and then—’</p>
<p>Her best friend from before, Tess and Sam whom she met on the journey—all of them died from infection. If she could, Ellie wanted to change all of this, even if it meant sacrificing herself. She looked at Joel: ‘Swear to me that what you said about the Fireflies was true.’</p>
<p>Facing Ellie, Joel didn't hesitate. He looked directly at her, nodded, and solemnly said: ‘I swear.’</p>
<p>With this, the game ended. The game screen went dark, and the game's credits began to roll. But Li Yue was still immersed in the game's story. Because the entire game offered so much to ponder, so much worth savoring. Every character in the game, every hidden detail, was full of profound meaning. It wasn't a flawless story, yet it was profoundly heavy. This was a thoroughly single-threaded game, and it wasn't what players might have expected, where everything eventually turns out well. Li Yue felt there was still much content in the game he hadn't uncovered. But one thing, he could now be certain of. That is, 'The Last of Us' is absolutely a masterpiece!</p>
