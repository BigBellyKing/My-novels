                <h2>Chapter 602 An Absolute Masterpiece (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h2>
<p>They finally reached their destination, the University of Eastern Colorado.</p>
<p>Joel and Ellie continued searching for clues about the Fireflies.</p>
<p>But upon arriving at the university laboratory, they discovered the Fireflies had long since abandoned the place, leaving only infected corpses behind.</p>
<p>However, Joel and Ellie did find some crucial clues here—the Fireflies had relocated to St. Mary's Hospital in Salt Lake City to the west.</p>
<p>Just as Joel was preparing to leave, they clashed with Hunters who had come to scavenge for resources.</p>
<p>During the battle, Joel fell from the rooftop and was impaled through the abdomen by a steel rod.</p>
<p>The severe injury left Joel weak and covered in bloodstains, but fortunately, Ellie was reliable enough to take down the remaining enemies alone.</p>
<p>This segment of the journey was truly arduous.</p>
<p>Especially since the game simulated Joel's重伤 visuals, making players keenly feel his虚弱.</p>
<p>Finally, as the two prepared to leave on horseback, Joel collapsed to the ground from excessive blood loss and lost consciousness.</p>
<p>After a black screen, the画面 reappeared, now set in winter.</p>
<p>The first thing visible on the screen was a cute little rabbit.</p>
<p>But before the rabbit could take more than a few steps, an arrow pierced through it.</p>
<p>It turned out to be Ellie, who was hunting.</p>
<p>From her自言自语, it seemed Joel was still alive.</p>
<p>This relieved Li Yue greatly.</p>
<p>Ellie then spotted a deer, but while chasing it, she encountered two strangers.</p>
<p>Through conversation, Ellie learned their names and purpose: the middle-aged man was David, who wanted to trade something for Ellie's deer.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Ellie asked if they had any antibiotics.</p>
<p>David agreed to the transaction and sent the younger man back to fetch the medicine. During this time, a group of感染者 unexpectedly appeared.</p>
<p>After a fierce battle, David and Ellie warmed themselves inside a house, where Ellie seemed to lower her guard slightly.</p>
<p>But during their talk, David brought up something unsettling.</p>
<p>He mentioned that some time ago, he had sent a team out to search for food, but they were all killed by a疯子和一个小女孩.</p>
<p>This instantly alerted Ellie to his ill intentions, but surprisingly, David let her leave.</p>
<p>Ellie returned to their hideout, where Joel remained unconscious. The antibiotics were meant to save him.</p>
<p>But soon, enemies arrived.</p>
<p>Ellie's actions had revealed one thing to David and his men: Joel must be injured, or Ellie wouldn't have sought medicine.</p>
<p>They had let Ellie go to跟踪 her and find Joel's location.</p>
<p>Realizing this, Ellie immediately decided to lure the Hunters away.</p>
<p>Though she took down many enemies, she was ultimately overpowered and captured.</p>
<p>Waking up in a prison cell, Ellie saw the Hunters outside butchering a living soul.</p>
<p>Clearly, these Hunters fed on humans.</p>
<p>Then their leader, David, appeared, revealing his true colors.</p>
<p>This guy was a变态 and a炼铜术士!</p>
<p>Faced with David's肮脏目的, Ellie remained unmoved and even broke one of his fingers.</p>
<p>Enraged, David decided to turn Ellie into their next meal.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as Ellie faced危机, Joel finally awoke.</p>
<p>Seeing Joel regain consciousness filled Li Yue with惊喜.</p>
<p>Despite his伤口的疼痛, Joel struggled to his feet, his first act being to call out Ellie's name—his牵挂 was palpable.</p>
<p>After so much time together and countless生死危机, Joel understood exactly what Ellie meant to him.</p>
<p>Bearing his unhealed injuries, Joel艰难地战胜大卫的手下 and captured two of them alive.</p>
<p>The残酷审问手段 didn't discomfort players; instead, it felt cathartic.</p>
<p>But随之而来的是更多的担忧—how was Ellie faring at that moment?</p>
<p>Yet Ellie didn't wait for Joel to rescue her, as most games or movies might depict.</p>
<p>Instead, she机智地 escaped, navigating the blizzard-covered town for a way out.</p>
<p>This segment employed双线叙事, with the player's perspective constantly切换 between Joel and Ellie.</p>
<p>In a restaurant, the game's only BOSS battle took place.</p>
<p>The enemy wasn't a terrifying zombie but another human.</p>
<p>Here, Ellie had to hide her whereabouts,绕圈圈大卫, and刺杀 him three times from behind.</p>
<p>It was incredibly困难, especially since Ellie couldn't make a sound, yet碎掉的玻璃碴 littered the floor.</p>
<p>Li Yue died once here on his第一次 attempt.</p>
<p>After three successful刺殺, the剧情 was triggered.</p>
<p>Ellie, having大卫 from behind and knocked him down, grabbed a kitchen knife and hacked at his head—eleven times in total, making clear the fate of炼铜.</p>
<p>Joel arrived just in time, embracing Ellie and轻声安抚 her as she泣不成声 in his arms.</p>
<p>From the Boston quarantine zone to St. Mary's Hospital in Salt Lake City, from summer to autumn and then winter,</p>
<p>they had endured countless困难和生死危机 together.</p>
<p>By now, both Joel and Ellie understood how much the other meant to them.</p>
<p>At this point, the game's剧情 was nearing its尾声.</p>
<p>Joel and Ellie's relationship had明显改变 through the seasons—spring, summer, autumn, and winter.</p>
<p>From initial冷漠 to trust, and now,</p>
<p>they had become irreplaceable in each other's lives.</p>
<p>Their旅途中的对话 grew warmer and richer.</p>
<p>Joel told Ellie that once this was all over, he'd teach her to play the guitar.</p>
<p>Passing through sunlit corridors filled with尘埃,</p>
<p>the sight that greeted players was utterly breathtaking.</p>
<p>A giraffe stood ahead, grazing—and not just one, but an entire herd in the distance.</p>
<p>Ellie froze, having never seen such优雅的动物 in her末世-born life.</p>
<p>Guided by Joel, she approached and gently touched the giraffe's neck.</p>
<p>The herd chewed leaves leisurely, tails swaying as they moved—生命的美好细腻展现无遗.</p>
<p>The末世 was only such for humanity.</p>
<p>For animals, the world seemed to have grown even more beautiful.</p>
<p>Here, Joel looked at Ellie and suggested they didn't have to find the Fireflies.</p>
<p>They could return to Tommy's town, where they'd be welcome.</p>
<p>But Ellie refused—they'd come too far to turn back now.</p>
<p>Finally, they reached the Fireflies' base.</p>
<p>Marlene, the Fireflies' leader, was astonished to see Joel—she never imagined they could make it all the way from Boston.</p>
<p>But then came the残酷的真相.</p>
<p>According to Marlene, the Cordyceps fungus in Ellie had mutated, granting her immunity.</p>
<p>But the mutation had reached her brain.</p>
<p>To study this immunity, researchers would have to remove the fungus from Ellie's brain—a procedure that would kill her.</p>
<p>Joel demanded Marlene find another way, but she insisted Ellie was the only immune person found in twenty years.</p>
<p>Marlene then imprisoned Joel.</p>
<p>In that moment, Joel made his choice.</p>
<p>Joel was never a高尚的人.</p>
<p>When the末世 hit, he told Tommy to ignore pleas for help on the streets—his world, his daughter Sarah, was in the car.</p>
<p>After the outbreak, he became a Hunter, a smuggler—whatever it took to survive.</p>
<p>Now, he had a new world.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, his world was destroyed; he wouldn't let it happen again.</p>
<p>He fought back,逼问出艾莉的下落, and took on the entire Fireflies基地 alone.</p>
<p>This Joel was like a wild孤狼.</p>
<p>Most of The Last of Us required stealth, but here, Li Yue felt the节奏 had changed.</p>
<p>No route planning, no sneak attacks—just one goal: find Ellie, fast.</p>
<p>Every second delayed meant danger for her.</p>
<p>To hell with saving the world—he just wanted Ellie back.</p>
<p>At the last moment, Joel broke through the Fireflies' defenses and rescued Ellie from the operating room.</p>
<p>In the parking lot, he killed Marlene and carried the unconscious Ellie away.</p>
<p>In the car, Joel lied to the now-awake Ellie.</p>
<p>He told her the Fireflies had found other免疫者 but couldn't help, so they'd given up.</p>
<p>Now, they'd return to Tommy's town and start anew.</p>
<p>On the final stretch, Ellie shared her thoughts:</p>
<p>'When I was bitten in Boston... I wasn't alone. My best friend was there. She was bitten too.'</p>
<p>'We didn't know what to do, so... she said, ‘Let's wait it out. Maybe we can turn into zombies together. It'd be poetic.’'</p>
<p>'I kept waiting to turn. Her name was Riley. She was the first to die.'</p>
<p>'Then Tess, then Sam...'</p>
<p>Her best friend, Tess, Sam—all lost to the infection.</p>
<p>If possible, Ellie wanted to change that, even at the cost of her life.</p>
<p>She looked at Joel: 'Swear to me. Swear that everything you said about the Fireflies is true.'</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Joel met her gaze: 'I swear.'</p>
<p>The game ended.</p>
<p>The screen faded to black, credits rolling.</p>
<p>But Li Yue remained immersed in the剧情.</p>
<p>There was so much to ponder, so much to回味.</p>
<p>Every角色, every hidden detail carried weight—this wasn't a flawless story, but it was沉重.</p>
<p>This was a彻头彻尾的单线程游戏, not the happy ending players might expect.</p>
<p>Li Yue felt there were still layers he hadn't uncovered.</p>
<p>But one thing was certain:</p>
<p>The Last of Us was an absolute masterpiece!</p>
