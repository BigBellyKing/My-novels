<p>Chapter 341: Shepherd Must Die! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Just like Zhang Yi, countless players were filled with rage.</p>
<p>Compared to other games, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare perfectly integrated story, levels, and FPS gameplay, maintaining an impeccable rhythm.</p>
<p>Coupled with the game's highly intelligent AI performance, players were subtly immersed into the protagonist's role.</p>
<p>When the protagonist was surrounded by enemies, players felt anxious and tense.</p>
<p>At such moments, when teammates in the game came to the rescue, it deepened players’ impressions of these NPCs.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, the game continuously applied various psychological suggestions to the players.</p>
<p>For example, in the initial Team mission, players controlled Allen, a character who only survived three scenes.</p>
<p>They personally experienced the mission with Shepherd.</p>
<p>On the battlefield, Shepherd appeared exceptionally decisive and even saved Allen’s life.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, players subconsciously perceived Shepherd as a reliable commander.</p>
<p>Subsequently, characters like Soap and Ghost gradually formed emotional connections with players, rather than being flat, one-dimensional NPCs.</p>
<p>They became real, flesh-and-blood comrades capable of stirring deep emotions.</p>
<p>Although during this time Shepherd did perform some actions that seemed slightly questionable,</p>
<p>thanks to Allen’s mission, no player ever doubted this character.</p>
<p>Until that revolver fired into Ghost’s and Roach’s chests.</p>
<p>Resentment, fury, despair, and suffering flooded every player’s heart.</p>
<p>Especially because the deeper their emotional bond with Ghost and Roach had been before, the more painful and furious they now felt.</p>
<p>In the end, when Roach reached out and grabbed Shepherd, that unspoken 'Why?' echoed the players’ own unresolved anguish.</p>
<p>On the other side, Price, who had escaped from the Afghan Scrapyard, provided all players with answers.</p>
<p>It turned out Shepherd had already conspired with Makarov.</p>
<p>Allen, the 141 operative who died without ever knowing how his undercover identity was exposed, had been betrayed by Shepherd.</p>
<p>Shepherd, the Lieutenant General of Task Force 141, Shadow Company, and the Marines, was the mastermind behind it all.</p>
<p>Allen was merely a pawn sacrificed by Shepherd to help Makarov ignite war.</p>
<p>Ghost and Roach were likewise his victims.</p>
<p>Both Task Force 141 and Makarov himself were merely tools in his hands.</p>
<p>This was a one-strike-two-birds plan.</p>
<p>He could eliminate Task Force 141 while simultaneously obtaining evidence of his collusion with Makarov.</p>
<p>That way, no one would ever know Shepherd was the true instigator of this war.</p>
<p>Eventually, when he ended the war, he would emerge as a genuine hero.</p>
<p>Given his current status and authority, he could become the most powerful man of all,</p>
<p>commanding absolute loyalty and obedience.</p>
<p>Every game must have an antagonist.</p>
<p>But Zhang Yi guaranteed he had never felt such anger before.</p>
<p>Even the deaths of Gaz and Griggs had brought him more sorrow than fury.</p>
<p>But now, everything was different.</p>
<p>Griggs and Gaz died heroically,</p>
<p>because they fell in battle.</p>
<p>But Ghost and Roach were different—one was the protagonist controlled by the player, the other a trusted comrade.</p>
<p>Yet in the end, both were betrayed by one of their own.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, such an ending pushed the players’ rage level to its peak.</p>
<p>Including across various game forums, player outrage had already erupted.</p>
<p>Especially Shepherd’s past words, now dripping with irony.</p>
<p>'We would never target civilians'?</p>
<p>The one responsible for the Russian airport massacre wasn’t just Makarov—you, Shepherd, were equally to blame!</p>
<p>Every word he once spoke now reeked of bitter irony.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>And it wasn’t just the players who were angry—Soap and Price in the game were equally furious.</p>
<p>But they weren’t faring well either.</p>
<p>Task Force 141 now existed in name only. Wounded, unsupported, and falsely accused, Price and Soap had both become fugitives.</p>
<p>At this moment, Price made a mad decision—to assassinate Shepherd.</p>
<p>Though they didn’t know how to turn the situation around, nor were certain they could survive, they still resolved to carry out the assassination.</p>
<p>Not only for their own sake, but to avenge their fallen comrades.</p>
<p>And just as Shepherd once said:</p>
<p>'History is written by the victorious living.'</p>
<p>The slain side naturally leaves nothing behind.</p>
<p>So Price made a bold decision.</p>
<p>Adhering to the principle that 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend,' he sought out Makarov to learn Shepherd’s whereabouts.</p>
<p>Price believed Makarov would tell him.</p>
<p>Because at this very moment, Makarov’s situation wasn’t any better.</p>
<p>'Makarov, I know you can hear me. Tell me Shepherd’s location. We’ll clean up this mess. Otherwise, you won’t survive a week.' Price contacted Makarov through walkie-talkies belonging to Makarov’s men.</p>
<p>Makarov: 'What about you?'</p>
<p>Price: 'Have you heard the old saying? The enemy of my enemy is my friend.'</p>
<p>Makarov: 'Price, that saying has two sides. Shepherd is at H-B base. You should know where that is. See you in hell.'</p>
<p>Price: 'I look forward to it. If you get there first, say hello to Zakhaev for me.'</p>
<p>Both Makarov and Price understood that their cooperation was only temporary.</p>
<p>Later, with Nikolai’s help, Price and Soap managed to escape.</p>
<p>Now, they were going to eliminate the true mastermind: Shepherd!</p>
<p>No matter what, Shepherd must die!</p>
<p>'We only have one UMP. They have an army. We don’t even know if Makarov’s intel is accurate,' Soap said to Price aboard Price’s Gyrocopter.</p>
<p>'Price? Price?' Soap said, looking at Price sitting at the table.</p>
<p>'Normal people don’t wake up knowing they’re about to die.'</p>
<p>'But I don’t see it as a curse, but a luxury. Knowing your time is limited can be a kind of release.'</p>
<p>'Insufficient firepower, lack of manpower, no options left. It seems we can only take him down with us.'</p>
<p>'But this war-torn land will remember us because of this battle, because even knowing there’s no escape, we still walked resolutely down this one-way path.'</p>
<p>'We are like a fired bullet—moving forward without hesitation.'</p>
<p>'We are filled with righteous fury, our goal singular... We... must... kill him!' Price said, expressionless, as memories of Roach and Ghost flashed through his mind. Shepherd must die!</p>
<p>'I’ll pick you up at the extraction point in three hours,' Nikolai said, dropping Price and Soap off at the H-B base in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>But Price cleanly refused: 'No thanks, brother. This is a one-way trip.'</p>
<p>Nikolai: 'Then good luck, brother.'</p>
