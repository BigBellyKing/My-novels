                <p>Chapter 176: Dark Souls Prequel Goes Live! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>The launch date for Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame was drawing nearer.</p>
<p>On various major websites, related advertisements had slowly begun to roll out. Meanwhile, overseas Target Software had also started its pre-release promotion.</p>
<p>Compared to the domestic market, the overseas effort was more significant.</p>
<p>On one hand, the news had only just been announced at previous exhibitions, leaving little development time. On the other hand, Chen Xu had already announced early on that Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame would be launched in early July.</p>
<p>As a sequel to an IP game, and one that won Game of the Year for Best Role-Playing Game last year, with its release date clearly stated, practically no game company was 'hard-headed' enough to intentionally butt heads with it.</p>
<p>Similarly, for players, this period of waiting made them extremely anxious.</p>
<p>The promotional video shown at the exhibition had been rewatched by players countless times. Many Souls scholars even, combining various elements from the previous game, managed to produce three-hour long plot background analysis videos solely based on that roughly three-minute promotional clip.</p>
<p>Of course, besides these hardcore Souls scholars, many ordinary players were also quite afraid that Chen Xu's official Weibo account would suddenly announce a delay, stating that they decided to postpone the release to provide players with a better experience.</p>
<p>After all, game delays are quite common in the gaming industry, so these players were worried that Nebula Games would pull such a move, even though Nebula Games had never done so before. But that was also because, up to this point, Nebula Games hadn't released any large-scale games; if anything, only Dark Souls and It Takes Two qualified.</p>
<p>However, as June entered its final countdown, more Dark Souls advertisements went live, and the price of Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame was announced. Especially with the appearance of the corresponding pre-order interface in the Nebula Games Platform store, many players felt reassured.</p>
<p>This time, Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame was priced at 198 Yuan, cheaper than its predecessor's 268 Yuan. Additionally, purchases made through the Nebula Games Platform still enjoyed a 20% discount, just like before.</p>
<p>As for overseas, the price also decreased to $39.9 USD.</p>
<p>Due to time differences and relevant regional policies, the game would be launched simultaneously worldwide, with only a few regions experiencing a delay of about two days.</p>
<p>Time quickly arrived at the day nearing the game's unlock. Countless veteran Firelinkers had already pre-ordered and pre-downloaded the game, waiting for the moment they could enter.</p>
<p>In community forums and various player chat groups, many waiting Dark Souls players chatted amongst themselves, filled with anticipation for the upcoming Firelinking journey.</p>
<p>In a certain chat group, a group of people was chatting.</p>
<p>"Old Song, Old Zhang, have you guys finished downloading the game?"</p>
<p>A player with the ID Old Song replied: "Of course it's downloaded! Does that even need asking?"</p>
<p>"Exactly, I can't wait," added the person with the ID Old Zhang below.</p>
<p>Old Zhang: "By the way, Old Song, what class are you going to start with later?"</p>
<p>Old Song: "Does that even need asking? Definitely the Deprived! As a qualified Firelinker, only the Deprived can truly showcase our skills."</p>
<p>Old Zhang: "Just what I thought! How about we have a little competition to see who makes faster progress?"</p>
<p>Old Song: "No problem!"</p>
<p>Along with Old Song and Old Zhang's chat, the enthusiasm of other Firelinkers was also ignited.</p>
<p>"Almost there, almost there, just five more minutes, then we can finally play!?"</p>
<p>"I wonder if the new Dark Souls will have increased difficulty?"</p>
<p>"There's definitely an increase, but I don't think it'll be a problem for us. After all, we're all qualified Firelinkers."</p>
<p>"Exactly!"</p>
<p>The chat group was instantly filled with laughter and chatter.</p>
<p>However, five minutes later, it was as if everyone collectively lost their internet connection; there wasn't a single sound.</p>
<p>In a certain residential community in the Imperial Capital.</p>
<p>Song Ren, who was Old Song in the chat group, eagerly clicked on Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame on the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>The opening CG was the same as the one shown at the previous gameplay Expo.</p>
<p>Clearly, Chen Xu was quite frugal in this aspect, adhering to tradition. Using cutscenes as promotional videos, or promotional videos as cutscenes.</p>
<p>Although Song Ren had lost count of how many times he'd seen it, he watched it again.</p>
<p>As for the competition with Old Zhang, watching the cutscene wouldn't make much difference time-wise.</p>
<p>As the cutscene finished playing and he looked at the game's UI interface, Song Ren felt a little nervous.</p>
<p>After all, this was Dark Souls, and he had suffered quite a bit in the previous game. Moreover, according to the information Chen Xu had previously revealed, the difficulty of the new game seemed to have increased.</p>
<p>"It's just a sequel! How can it stop us Firelinkers?"</p>
<p>Cheering himself on and reciting a slogan, Song Ren entered the game.</p>
<p>The game began with the familiar Dark Souls character customization and class selection phase.</p>
<p>During the character customization, Song Ren noticed a special prompt.</p>
<p>[A save file for Dark Souls has been detected. Would you like to use your previous character customization data?]</p>
<p>"Hey, this is a pretty good feature! The face I painstakingly created before can be reused!" Song Ren was somewhat surprised, but then chose to ignore it and create a new, more distinctive face.</p>
<p>Could a Firelinking Hero's face be called ugly? That's called personality!</p>
<p>Next, regarding his starting class, although he had boastfully declared in the group that he would choose Deprived, he now silently opted for Knight.</p>
<p>After all, in the previous game, the Knight was considered the most versatile class for early-game progression.</p>
<p>Then, when it came to burial gifts, Song Ren noticed some differences.</p>
<p>Like in the previous game, Goddess's Blessing, Life Ring, and Black Firebomb were all available. But many items were also replaced, such as Twin Humanities, Telescope, Old Witch's Ring, and Master Key; these items were not in the previous game.</p>
<p>For a moment, Song Ren wasn't sure what these items were for.</p>
<p>After some thought, Song Ren chose the Master Key.</p>
<p>The Black Firebomb would definitely be very useful for early-game BOSS fights, but having already cleared the previous game, he had some confidence in his own skill.</p>
<p>And there was another very important point: having played the previous game, he knew one of Dark Souls' features, which was the presence of various shortcuts on the map.</p>
<p>But these shortcuts could only be opened later. Now that he had the Master Key, was it possible that it could open all sorts of shortcuts?</p>
<p>Of course, it could also have other uses, such as good items hidden in a certain room that require a specific key, which his Master Key could open directly, or perhaps it was related to rescuing an NPC trapped in a room, like the thief in the previous game.</p>
<p>In any case, he felt that the Master Key should be a relatively good and useful item.</p>
<p>After creating his character, Song Ren clicked to enter the game, filled with anticipation.</p>
<p>He was ready to officially begin his Firelinking journey.</p>
