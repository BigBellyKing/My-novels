<p>Chapter 176: Dark Souls Prequel, Launched! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>The launch date for <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em> was drawing ever closer.</p>
<p>Advertisements related to the game had already begun appearing gradually across various websites.</p>
<p>At the same time, Overseas Target Software had also started its warm-up promotion.</p>
<p>Compared to the domestic market, the overseas promotional efforts were even more intense.</p>
<p>This was because, during the month of July, most game developers hadn’t yet prepared to launch new titles.</p>
<p>On one hand, many had only just announced their games at the recent exhibition, leaving insufficient development time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Chen Xu had already clearly announced that <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em>, as a sequel to an established IP—and the follow-up to last year’s Game of the Year for Best Role-Playing Game—would launch in early July.</p>
<p>When a major title like this explicitly stated its launch date, few other companies were stubborn enough to risk competing head-on.</p>
<p>For players, this period of waiting was agonizing.</p>
<p>The promotional video released at the exhibition had been replayed countless times by fans.</p>
<p>Even many Souls scholars, combining clues from the original game, had created three-hour-long story background analysis videos using only that three-minute trailer.</p>
<p>Of course, aside from these hardcore Souls scholars, many regular players were also anxious, secretly fearing that Chen Xu’s official Weibo account might suddenly drop a message saying the game was delayed to “provide a better experience.”</p>
<p>After all, game delays were quite common in the gaming industry, and players dreaded the possibility that Nebula Games might pull the same stunt—even though Nebula Games had never delayed a game before.</p>
<p>But then again, up to this point, Nebula Games hadn’t released any major titles—aside from <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>It Takes Two</em>, that is.</p>
<p>However, as June entered its final countdown, more <em>Dark Souls</em> advertisements appeared, the price for <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em> was announced, and most reassuringly, the pre-order page had already gone live on the Nebula Games Platform’s shop, giving many players peace of mind.</p>
<p>This time, <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em> was priced lower than the previous game’s 268 Yuan, selling for just 198 Yuan. As before, purchases made on the Nebula Games Platform would enjoy a 20% discount.</p>
<p>For overseas markets, the price was also reduced to $39.90.</p>
<p>Due to time differences and regional policies, the game would launch globally at the same time, except for a few regions where it would be delayed by about two days.</p>
<p>Time quickly approached the moment of game unlock.</p>
<p>Countless veteran Firelinkers had already pre-ordered and pre-downloaded the game, eagerly awaiting the moment they could finally dive in.</p>
<p>On community forums and in player chat groups, Dark Souls fans chatted excitedly, filled with anticipation for the upcoming Firelinking journey.</p>
<p>In one particular chat group, a group of players were chatting:</p>
<p>"Old Song, Old Zhang, have you guys downloaded the game yet?"</p>
<p>A player with the ID Old Song replied, "Of course it’s downloaded! What kind of question is that?"</p>
<p>"Exactly. I can’t wait," added another player, ID Old Zhang.</p>
<p>Old Zhang asked, "By the way, Old Song, which Class are you picking for your starting character?"</p>
<p>Old Song responded, "What do you think? Definitely the Deprived. As a true Firelinker, only the Deprived can truly showcase our skill."</p>
<p>Old Zhang said, "Same here. How about we have a race to see who makes faster progress?"</p>
<p>Old Song: "No problem!"</p>
<p>Their conversation quickly sparked enthusiasm among other Firelinkers.</p>
<p>"Almost there, almost there! Just five more minutes until we can play!"</p>
<p>"I wonder if the new <em>Dark Souls</em> will be harder?"</p>
<p>"It’ll definitely be harder, but I don’t think any of us will have real trouble. After all, we’re all qualified Firelinkers now."</p>
<p>"Exactly!"</p>
<p>The chat group buzzed with laughter and excitement.</p>
<p>But five minutes later, it fell completely silent, as if everyone had simultaneously gone offline.</p>
<p>In a residential complex in the Imperial Capital, Song Ren—aka Old Song from the chat group—clicked on <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em> on the Nebula Games Platform with full anticipation.</p>
<p>The opening CGI was identical to the one shown at the gameplay Expo.</p>
<p>Clearly, Chen Xu had chosen to be frugal here, sticking to tradition—using the promotional video as the opening CG, or perhaps the opening CG as the promotional video.</p>
<p>Although Song Ren had watched it countless times by now, he still watched it again.</p>
<p>Besides, the time spent watching the cutscene wouldn’t affect his race with Old Zhang.</p>
<p>As the cutscene ended and the game’s UI interface appeared, Song Ren felt a bit nervous.</p>
<p>After all, this was Dark Souls. In the past, he had endured plenty of hardship in this game.</p>
<p>And based on the information Chen Xu had previously revealed, the new game’s difficulty seemed to have increased.</p>
<p>"It’s just a sequel! How could it possibly stop us Firelinkers?"</p>
<p>Cheering himself on with a battle cry, Song Ren entered the game.</p>
<p>The beginning was the familiar character customization and Class selection phase.</p>
<p>During the character customization, Song Ren noticed a special prompt:</p>
<p>[Detected that you own a <em>Dark Souls</em> save file. Would you like to use your previous character customization data?]</p>
<p>"Huh, this is a great feature! I can reuse the face I spent so much time on before!" Song Ren was pleasantly surprised, but he chose to ignore it and created a new, more distinctive face instead.</p>
<p>Could a Firelinker’s face be called ugly? No—this was personality!</p>
<p>As for Class selection, although he had proudly declared in the chat group that he’d pick Deprived, he quietly chose Knight instead.</p>
<p>After all, in the previous game, Knight was the most versatile Class for early-game progression.</p>
<p>Then came the burial gifts—the starting items. Here, Song Ren noticed some changes.</p>
<p>Just like before, items such as the Goddess's Blessing, Life Ring, and Black Firebomb were available.</p>
<p>But several items had been replaced: Twin Humanities, Telescope, Old Witch's Ring, and Master Key—none of which had existed in the previous game.</p>
<p>For a moment, Song Ren wasn’t sure what these new items did.</p>
<p>After some thought, he chose the Master Key.</p>
<p>The Black Firebomb was definitely useful for fighting bosses early on, but having already cleared the previous game, he had confidence in his skills.</p>
<p>More importantly, as someone who had played the original, he understood one of Dark Souls’ core features: hidden shortcuts scattered throughout the map that could only be unlocked later.</p>
<p>Now that he had the Master Key, could it possibly unlock these shortcuts?</p>
<p>Or perhaps it had other uses—like opening rooms with valuable loot that required a specific key, which the Master Key could open directly. Or maybe it was tied to rescuing NPCs locked in rooms, like the Thief from the previous game.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, he felt the Master Key was likely one of the better and more useful starting gifts.</p>
<p>After creating his character, Song Ren clicked into the game with excitement, ready to officially begin his Firelinking journey.</p>
<p>(End of Chapter) &lt;<END_OF_CHAPTER>&gt;</p>
