<p>Chapter 39 Then We'll Always Meet on the Moon</p>
<p>The background audio in the game changed for the first time from instrumental music to a lyrical theme song.</p>
<p>【Everything's Alright】.</p>
<p>It was as if the song voiced Liva's innermost thoughts.</p>
<p>Accompanied by the sorrowful melody, Liva was gradually erased from Johnny's life.</p>
<p>On the staircase of the teaching building where Johnny believed he had first met Liva,</p>
<p>the platypus and Liva, who had been sitting on the steps, had vanished. Only a book about lighthouses remained, rustling in the wind.</p>
<p>Here, Johnny's close friend Nicolas walked through the hallway.</p>
<p>In the library, Liva was no longer present. Joey had taken her place, and the two brothers chatted about变形战士 and space travel.</p>
<p>The copy of The Emperor's New Clothes, once Liva's favorite, was now covered in dust.</p>
<p>In front of the cinema where Johnny and Liva had watched movies together, Johnny walked in laughing and talking with his brother Joey.</p>
<p>Yes, although Liva had been removed,</p>
<p>Eva altered Johnny's memories, allowing his brother Joey to take her place.</p>
<p>She continuously guided and suggested that Johnny's dream and goal was to become an astronaut.</p>
<p>Without Liva, Johnny now had Joey by his side,</p>
<p>and his future had completely changed.</p>
<p>The horse-racing field where Johnny and Liva once galloped together was now completely empty.</p>
<p>Before the lighthouse named Anya, only endless Tall Grass remained—no trace of the couple who once stood there.</p>
<p>Even the rabbit that had been hit and killed during their wedding ceremony had disappeared.</p>
<p>In Johnny's memories, his entire future had been rewritten.</p>
<p>Through constant training and study,</p>
<p>Johnny finally received a hiring notice from the Space Agency and went to visit the base.</p>
<p>His goal was now within reach.</p>
<p>'To the Moon'—this objective now seemed only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Everything Eva had done appeared to have succeeded.</p>
<p>Yet all the players and viewers remained silent.</p>
<p>Yes, Johnny was about to go to the Moon.</p>
<p>Eva and Neil were about to complete their quests.</p>
<p>But was this outcome truly what Johnny wanted?</p>
<p>Going to the Moon—but without Liva.</p>
<p>Did it really have any meaning?</p>
<p>In the imagined future of Johnny's illusion, they arrived at the Space Agency.</p>
<p>At this moment, Dong Zhen, along with every player who had reached this point,</p>
<p>were merely mechanically controlling the character.</p>
<p>Only one feeling remained: pain!</p>
<p>But as Eva and Neil followed Johnny through the Space Agency,</p>
<p>'Not here either...'</p>
<p>'What are you talking about?'</p>
<p>'Let's just go anyway.' </p>
<p>As Neil and Eva exchanged words, Dong Zhen sensed something unusual.</p>
<p>"Wait! That old hag!"</p>
<p>"That old hag seems to be looking for something!"</p>
<p>In the waiting room, replaying the events and Eva's words in his mind, Dong Zhen formed a bold hypothesis—one he desperately hoped was true.</p>
<p>But before he could voice it in the live stream room,</p>
<p>the previously melancholic background audio suddenly fell into silence, replaced by the sound of a heartbeat.</p>
<p>Then, cheerful background audio began to play.</p>
<p>A girl with an orange-red ponytail appeared at the doorway.</p>
<p>'Ah! You're our new recruit, Liva, right? We're so glad you came,' said the nameless director of the Space Agency.</p>
<p>'Hi, I'm Johnny,' Johnny stepped forward to greet her, just as he had done before.</p>
<p>At last, the final memory shred was gathered.</p>
<p>Standing by the window, Eva let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>'Phew! I was afraid she was gone for good.'</p>
<p>'What the hell, Eva! But you... you deleted her!' Neil exclaimed in disbelief.</p>
<p>'No, I told you—I only relocated her. How she chooses to live her life still depends on... her.'</p>
<p>'This new world... was built from public data and Johnny's personal beliefs. Since Liva belongs to the personal realm, her data wouldn't be recorded in public data.'</p>
<p>As Eva explained, Neil finally understood: 'So... this was entirely Johnny's doing...'</p>
<p>Yes, Liva had still come!</p>
<p>Even though their lives had changed, even though Johnny and Liva had no connection in the past,</p>
<p>in this fictional world, Johnny still remembered that promise.</p>
<p>'What if we get lost? Then we'll meet on the Moon, silly!'</p>
<p>Yes, they would ultimately meet again on the Moon.</p>
<p>The tears Dong Zhen had held back now threatened to spill once more.</p>
<p>In the Space Agency, that piece of music was no longer titled To Liva.</p>
<p>It now bore a new name: To the Moon.</p>
<p>In the hall, as Liva watched Johnny playing the piano, she murmured, 'I like that name.'</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>In Johnny's imagined memories, the two underwent years of training and preparation.</p>
<p>Finally, the rocket was about to launch.</p>
<p>Neil and Eva invited Lily, the caretaker who looked after Johnny, along with his doctor and others, to witness this moment.</p>
<p>Under the setting sun, countless people stood on the Cross-river Bridge, gazing at the distant rocket launch base.</p>
<p>With a thunderous roar, the rocket lifted off.</p>
<p>At the same time, a heartbeat sound echoed.</p>
<p>A very dull, heavy heartbeat.</p>
<p>It was the heartbeat of Johnny in the real-world—gravely ill.</p>
<p>He was about to leave this world.</p>
<p>To the Moon, the piano piece, played as the rocket ascended.</p>
<p>Ahead lay their destination—the Moon.</p>
<p>Inside the rocket, Johnny and Liva simultaneously looked at each other.</p>
<p>Then, gently, their hands intertwined.</p>
<p>【Then we'll always meet on the Moon, silly!】</p>
<p>As the Moon appeared, the screen faded to black.</p>
<p>The next moment, Johnny's memories flashed before his eyes like a slideshow.</p>
<p>Watching these memories, recalling the story of Johnny and Liva in the game,</p>
<p>Dong Zhen, sitting before his computer, could no longer hold back. He covered his face with both hands and pulled a tissue from the side.</p>
<p>He wasn't wiping his nose—but his eyes.</p>
<p>'Damn it! Tough guy cries again!'</p>
<p>'I'm completely broken down!'</p>
<p>'Can't see the screen through my tears!'</p>
<p>'What if you really get lost? Then we'll meet on the Moon, silly!'</p>
<p>'What if you really get lost? Then we'll meet on the Moon, silly!'</p>
<p>As the game's credits rolled on screen,</p>
<p>the bullet comments in Dong Zhen's live stream room gradually turned into this single repeated sentence.</p>
<p>At that moment, everyone was deeply moved by the story.</p>
<p>Everyone had even forgotten</p>
<p>that this was actually a game submitted to the Sci-Fi Game Design Competition.</p>
<p>No one questioned anymore whether it truly counted as a sci-fi game.</p>
<p>Everyone was immersed in the story of Johnny and Liva.</p>
<p>Thank you for the 1500 tip from 'Caiji 2016'</p>
