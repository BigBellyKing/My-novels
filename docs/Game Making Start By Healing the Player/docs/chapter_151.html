                <p>Chapter 150: A Change of Heart (Sixth update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>Zhang Yi and Wang Han continued their game journey, laughing and joking together.</p>
<p>It had to be said that Rose's room was currently the most interesting scene they had experienced so far.</p>
<p>The previous space journey aside, the hopscotch scene, filled with various fun mini-games, kept astonishing them.</p>
<p>After arriving at the train station, Dr. Hakim from the Book of Love appeared once again, pulling the two into the Kaleidoscope.</p>
<p>Each scene was incredibly engaging, and naturally, all of them were connected to toys.</p>
<p>The puzzles in these scenes were also highly entertaining.</p>
<p>For example, after successfully reaching the train station and finding four corresponding dolls, they entered a new scene—Dinosaur Park.</p>
<p>Their handcart bumped into a sleeping dinosaur, forcing the two to find ways to wake it up and open its mouth so they could proceed.</p>
<p>In this section, one player controlled the large dinosaur to bite onto a handle, while the other rode atop a small red dinosaur to advance.</p>
<p>Then, they had to operate various dinosaur toys within Dinosaur Park to overcome mechanical obstacles.</p>
<p>This was essentially the most complex puzzle Zhang Yi and Wang Han had faced so far.</p>
<p>However, soon after, they were thrust into an exciting and thrilling naval battle.</p>
<p>The final BOSS battle was even a duel against the giant octopus featured in the promotional trailer.</p>
<p>It was truly exhilarating and intense.</p>
<p>After defeating the octopus, a circus performance unfolded—one person riding a bicycle while the other balanced on a beam. This tacit cooperation went far beyond the simple switch-pulling from earlier.</p>
<p>It was tighter, more coordinated teamwork.</p>
<p>After leaving the circus, this segment of the journey no longer involved puzzles—just pure cooperation to reach the castle.</p>
<p>This allowed Wang Han and Zhang Yi to relax for a while.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the castle, the guards stationed there spotted the two.</p>
<p>Cody and May decided to lie their way through, but at that moment, Dr. Hakim suddenly appeared and claimed these two were assassins sent to kill the queen.</p>
<p>The guards then imprisoned Cody and May in a prison cell.</p>
<p>There, Cody and May cooperated to escape, and in doing so, obtained a brand-new ability for this scene.</p>
<p>Each gained a different elemental magic—Cody received Ice magic, while May received Fire magic. The game’s graphics also shifted to a top-down perspective.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the gameplay transformed from action-adventure to RPG Dungeon Crawling.</p>
<p>Cody’s ability allowed him to teleport through iron bars and freeze lava, while May could perform a long-distance dash.</p>
<p>Much like most RPGs, in this level, they fought mobs, elite monsters, and finally the king and queen from chess.</p>
<p>The combat segments were actually quite simple—just the regular RPG routine.</p>
<p>Yet Zhang Yi and Wang Han were thoroughly enjoying themselves.</p>
<p>The main reason was that they never expected to play the game this way.</p>
<p>Gunfights, naval battles, Racing, martial arts—now even RPG elements had been added.</p>
<p>Combined with the abundance of mini-games, the game left them with nothing but awe.</p>
<p>However, after a brief moment of excitement, the following story segment made Zhang Yi and Wang Han feel slightly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>After escaping the castle, Cody and May encountered Little Elephant Queen Cutie.</p>
<p>‘I’m Rose’s best friend. Would you like some cookies?’</p>
<p>Cutie looked at Cody and May, forgave them, and even kindly invited them to have cookies.</p>
<p>She sensed that Cody and May seemed troubled and even initiated a warm hug.</p>
<p>But Cutie had no idea that Cody and May’s true intention was to destroy her.</p>
<p>‘My God! Why are you hurting me?’</p>
<p>‘I’m just Cutie, a lovable elephant everyone adores!’</p>
<p>‘I love Rose, and Rose loves me too!’</p>
<p>‘I don’t want to be broken!’</p>
<p>Crying out, Cutie tried to flee by rocket, but the rocket was struck down by stones.</p>
<p>Despite Cutie’s desperate pleas, Cody and May, believing their daughter’s tears would turn them back into humans, still destroyed her.</p>
<p>Compared to the original version from Chen Xu’s previous life, Chen Xu had toned down the cruelty in this segment—mainly because this story segment was essential.</p>
<p>After all, the theme of this chapter was: ‘Adults see toys as disposable objects, but to children, they are the best companions.’</p>
<p>However, in Chen Xu’s opinion, the original version’s execution, aiming for double irony by forcing players to personally act as the executioner, was simply too heavy-handed for the game’s overall tone.</p>
<p>Therefore, Chen Xu made several adjustments here.</p>
<p>Still, even with these changes, many players who reached this point felt a bit uncomfortable.</p>
<p>In the game, they discovered Cutie’s damaged form, fallen from a shelf.</p>
<p>Finally, their daughter Rose couldn’t hold back her tears and began to cry.</p>
<p>At that moment, Cody and May, instead of remorse, joyfully ran toward their daughter.</p>
<p>They even danced in the midst of her tears.</p>
<p>But to their shock, they did not transform back into humans as they had expected—they remained dolls.</p>
<p>However, beside the bed, they found a letter that seemed to contain information on how to reverse the transformation.</p>
<p>But just then, Dr. Hakim, who had been instigating and destroying things all along, appeared once again.</p>
<p>He snatched the letter and tore it into shreds.</p>
<p>At this moment, Zhang Yi and Wang Han couldn’t help but cheer for the players.</p>
<p>Throughout the game, Dr. Hakim had clearly played the role of a guide.</p>
<p>But because he had constantly ruined Cody and May’s plans and kept instigating trouble,</p>
<p>Wang Han and Zhang Yi had grown to dislike this character.</p>
<p>Yet this scene now felt extremely gratifying to them.</p>
<p>After all, the previous scene had been quite oppressive.</p>
<p>Up until that point, the game had consistently delivered joy.</p>
<p>Cody and May had been tricking each other, playing pranks on each other,</p>
<p>accompanied by the eccentric Dr. Hakim.</p>
<p>The entire game had felt like a cheerful comedy.</p>
<p>So much so that many players had subconsciously overlooked the true nature of May and Cody’s relationship.</p>
<p>But the scene with Elephant Princess Cutie abruptly brought the players back to reality.</p>
<p>Although the visuals remained highly cartoonish, without any bloodshed,</p>
<p>many players still felt deep remorse.</p>
<p>Of course, another major reason was that the previously defeated BOSSes—like the vacuum cleaner and the Toolbox—</p>
<p>had clearly shown aggressive intent.</p>
<p>But Elephant Princess had not attacked at all. She had been nothing but kind. Her guards were the only ones who had tried to stop Cody and May.</p>
<p>As for the tool insect mount Rhinoceros Beetle in the Heart of the Tree, who had originally been promised honey by Cody and May, many players had simply overlooked it—it truly lacked presence.</p>
