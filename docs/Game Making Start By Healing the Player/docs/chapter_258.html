                <p>Chapter 257: Diablos: Bottom of the Sandy Land (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Song Ren's face was filled with tension.</p>
<p>From starting the game until now, he hadn't carted even once. The only truly dangerous encounter was with the Tobi-Kadachi.</p>
<p>Because the Tobi-Kadachi's attack frequency was too high, and he had been a little greedy with his attacks then.</p>
<p>He hadn't chosen to disengage to drink potions, and was just a hair's breadth away from carting. Luckily, his Palico had given him a honey fruit then, saving his hide.</p>
<p>But now Song Ren had a premonition: facing the Anjanath before him, he might just cart!</p>
<p>Because the massive Anjanath before him was completely different from the monsters he had encountered previously.</p>
<p>Its attack power made Song Ren think of Dark Souls.</p>
<p>While it didn't have that feeling of leaving you crippled in two hits and dead in three like in Dark Souls, its attacks were far more vicious than previous BOSSes.</p>
<p>"Maybe it's just this one attack that's particularly powerful?"</p>
<p>Song Ren created some distance, then, swinging his Long Sword, charged forward again.</p>
<p>But this time, just as he got close, Song Ren saw the Anjanath let out a roar.</p>
<p>Immediately, the Hunter he controlled instinctively clutched his ears.</p>
<p>Then, the Anjanath charged, sending him flying, and his health bar dropped by a quarter instantly.</p>
<p>"This Anjanath is incredibly powerful!"</p>
<p>Continuously dodging attacks while fighting, Song Ren experienced something called a "sense of oppression" for the first time.</p>
<p>Up until now, he had always used the Long Sword's Spirit Blade combos to build up his Spirit Gauge.</p>
<p>But now, facing the Anjanath, there was no time to charge his Spirit Gauge.</p>
<p>He did try once, but was immediately kicked away by the Anjanath.</p>
<p>As he fought, Song Ren discovered an awkward situation: he had run out of Potions.</p>
<p>At that moment, the Anjanath coincidentally headed towards the large platform seen in the promotional video.</p>
<p>"The Rathalos isn't here!"</p>
<p>Looking at the large platform, and recalling the scene from the promotional video where the Anjanath and Rathalos battled, Song Ren had been hoping to encounter the Rathalos and profit from their conflict.</p>
<p>But now, it was clear the Rathalos was out and not at home.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Anjanath, having just arrived at the Rathalos's nest, also spotted Song Ren pursuing it.</p>
<p>This instantly infuriated the Anjanath.</p>
<p>"I didn't want to fight you before, I even backed off and left, and now you dare to follow me!?"</p>
<p>In that instant, the Anjanath let out a furious roar, its hind legs suddenly pushing off with force, leaping into the air and pouncing towards Song Ren.</p>
<p>A chaotic battle ensued.</p>
<p>Four characters appeared on Song Ren's screen.</p>
<p>[Fainted from Exhaustion]</p>
<p>With the appearance of the four characters, the screen went dark.</p>
<p>When the screen reappeared, he saw two small Palicos pushing him back to camp in a small cart, then simply dumping him on the ground.</p>
<p>Song Ren, having been carted back to camp for free, recalled the recent thrashing by the Anjanath, feeling a bit bewildered.</p>
<p>The Anjanath's attack power was a little outrageous!</p>
<p>Although his armor was a bit outdated and he had only reinforced his weapon, it shouldn't have been <em>this</em> bad!</p>
<p>He had even eaten a stamina-boosting Felyne Canteen meal at the start, yet the damage was still too high!</p>
<p>It made no sense at all!</p>
<p>"But it's fine. Carting back to camp only reduces the reward, and the monster's health should still be the same as before. This is like getting several chances. I'll be more careful this time and definitely defeat it!" Song Ren returned to his tent, replenishing his Potions to ten. Unfortunately, he had no honey left, so he couldn't make Mega Potions.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Song Ren continued his journey to fight the Anjanath.</p>
<p>....................</p>
<p>....................</p>
<p>In reality, it wasn't just Song Ren who felt the "water temperature" getting hotter.</p>
<p>Many players were generally having this feeling.</p>
<p>Some sensitive players already felt it when they encountered the Tobi-Kadachi.</p>
<p>And encountering the Anjanath confirmed this feeling.</p>
<p>After all, the "Newbie Killer" didn't earn its reputation for nothing.</p>
<p>Of course, to be fair, the Anjanath was actually quite easy to deal with; its tail and head could be broken.</p>
<p>And its attacks were essentially just a few repeated moves: Terrifying Roar, Head Swing Bite, Hind Leg Ground Scratch, Standing Long Jump, Dragon Charge, and Fiery Bad Breath.</p>
<p>Its attack wind-ups were also very pronounced, making them generally easy to dodge.</p>
<p>As for its fire breath, although it dealt high damage, the wind-up was very long, so it was easy to evade if you paid attention.</p>
<p>Secondly, players could also lure the Anjanath to the Rathalos's territory at the top, and then happily act as a Finisher Hunter.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Anjanath was susceptible to many elemental attributes, especially water-element weapons, which could be crafted using previously acquired materials.</p>
<p>The main reason most players carted here was that the previous monsters were too easy to fight.</p>
<p>By the time they reached the Anjanath, many players felt a bit overwhelmed facing this creature whose attack power had suddenly increased.</p>
<p>However, at this point, players only felt that something was a little off.</p>
<p>Because the game allowed for team-ups, facing the Anjanath alone was a bit difficult.</p>
<p>But with multiplayer teams, dealing with the Anjanath, which had many weaknesses and was quite cumbersome, was relatively easy.</p>
<p>And the most crucial point was that after defeating the Anjanath, the monsters players encountered often felt even simpler than the Anjanath.</p>
<p>....................</p>
<p>....................</p>
<p>"Old Song, is this what you meant by the difficulty increasing a lot? That's all there is to it? We cleared it in one go." In the voice channel, Zhang Yi chuckled as he, Wang Han, Song Ren, and Joey finished off the Odogaron in the Rotten Vale.</p>
<p>"Stop bragging! Try solo hunting this Odogaron yourself," Song Ren retorted with an eye-roll.</p>
<p>"Why would I solo hunt when I can team up? Great Sword is super popular in teams!" Zhang Yi chuckled.</p>
<p>"It's probably a game mechanic. Start simple, then insert a harder monster, and then back to simple monsters until the final BOSS," Song Ren said, subtly changing the subject.</p>
<p>He had indeed carted three times against the Odogaron.</p>
<p>The main reason was that this guy looked very small and thin, even less imposing than the Great Jagras at the start.</p>
<p>But it was practically a combination of the Tobi-Kadachi, Anjanath, and Pukei-Pukei.</p>
<p>If caught and hit, it would inflict a continuous bleeding state.</p>
<p>At the same time, the entire monster seemed to have ADHD, running around like the Tobi-Kadachi, its movements incredibly swift.</p>
<p>As for attack power, while not as high as the Anjanath, its advantage lay in its high frequency; getting caught meant a brutal combo.</p>
<p>And with the enhancement of the Game AI Performance Technology, whether it was an illusion or not, this creature felt incredibly cunning to Song Ren.</p>
<p>It would often move to its preferred home turf to initiate combat, where numerous obstacles and Miasma surrounded the area.</p>
<p>This brought extreme difficulty to the hunt.</p>
<p>So, after carting three times, Song Ren decisively opted for the Call-for-Help Tactic.</p>
<p>"Indeed, the Zorah Magdaros fight, and the Legiana and Radobaan were quite weak," Zhang Yi nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>The Zorah Magdaros was the mountain-like monster from the very beginning of the story, with its entire body made of hard rock.</p>
<p>And it wasn't a direct fight; one only needed to fly onto its back and destroy its heat-dissipating organs. The Nergigante would come to join the fun midway, but it was just a minor character.</p>
<p>As for the Legiana, its ice breath was a minor nuisance, and its movements were quite agile, but fortunately, after reinforcing equipment, its attack power wasn't very high either.</p>
<p>"By the way, are we still pushing forward with quests as a team?" Joey asked.</p>
<p>"How about we part ways for now? We can team up again if we encounter a monster we can't beat. I feel like the monsters after this should be relatively simple," Song Ren judged based on his experience. After all, it was difficult when they first encountered the Anjanath, then they had a stretch of easy BOSSes, and now with the Odogaron, he felt the difficulty had clearly risen again. So, based on previous experience, the monsters after the Odogaron should be simpler.</p>
<p>"Mhm, I'm going to farm the Anjanath again. I'm just short one material to reinforce my gear."</p>
<p>"Alright then, we'll leave the team first!"</p>
<p>With each person contributing a word, they quickly made a decision.</p>
<p>Song Ren, too, returned to the Hunter's Astera Settlement.</p>
<p>First, he ran to the Workshop in the Hunter base to see what materials his equipment needed for reinforcement.</p>
<p>After getting everything ready, Song Ren went to speak with the Investigator.</p>
<p>"Huh! It's not a single quest this time? Two appeared at once," Song Ren discovered with great surprise. This time, there were actually two quests.</p>
<p>According to the story, the Hunter inquired about the Zorah Magdaros's movements to the Ancient Dragon People, who stated that only by defeating the Rathalos and Diablos would he be qualified to learn the secret.</p>
<p>Therefore, these two quests were added to the quest list: to hunt the Rathalos and Diablos separately for the story to progress.</p>
<p>[Rathalos: Peak of the Forest] [Diablos: Bottom of the Sandy Land]</p>
<p>The Rathalos, then, should be in that spot from the promotional video where the Anjanath ran up the Ancient Tree and was disciplined by the Rathalos.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when hunting the Anjanath, he hadn't encountered the Rathalos, so he didn't know its combat prowess.</p>
<p>But Song Ren was more curious about the other one, the Diablos.</p>
<p>After all, the Rathalos had already been seen in the promotional video, but the Diablos hadn't been seen at all!</p>
<p>As for the Rathalos, he'd save that one for later.</p>
<p>And from the feel of it, the Rathalos flying in the sky should be quite difficult to fight.</p>
<p>Comparatively, he felt the Diablos should be a bit more reliable.</p>
<p>After all, the Diablos was a vegetarian, so its temperament should be relatively gentle, just like the Aptonoth.</p>
