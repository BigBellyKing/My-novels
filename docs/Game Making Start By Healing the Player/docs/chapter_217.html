<p>Chapter 216: How Can You Build a Beautiful House Without Materials? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>Hearing Zhang Yi's words, Wang Han, who was sitting there eating her Roasted Duck Rice, shot him a glare.</p>
<p>What kind of way to talk is that!</p>
<p>How is it embarrassing at all!</p>
<p>What's wrong with the name 'Master Builder'?</p>
<p>People always need hope!</p>
<p>Besides, sure it's a bit ugly, but at least it's a house, isn't it?</p>
<p>"Hmph, don't you criticize me. I think if you were to do it, it wouldn't turn out any better. This game looks simple, but actually it's pretty difficult. Just mentally visualizing the structure of a house is already quite a struggle," Wang Han retorted unconvincedly to Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>This was indeed Wang Han's most direct feeling.</p>
<p>She hadn't experienced much of the game yet,</p>
<p>but just from building houses, she felt she could play for a very long time.</p>
<p>Although the game's operations weren't particularly complicated, and the houses and castles in the promotional trailer on Chen Xu's official Weibo account looked beautiful and charming,</p>
<p>when she actually tried building a house herself, she truly felt the difficulty.</p>
<p>Because there were no reference points or comparisons, she couldn't just copy like tracing a gourd.</p>
<p>Building entirely from mental visualization of a house proved extremely challenging.</p>
<p>Especially since, when mentally visualizing a house, she couldn't help but think of real-world houses.</p>
<p>But the key point was that in the game, everything was constructed from cubes. Where things differed from her imagination, she could only use her own experience to choose which blocks to place as substitutes.</p>
<p>Thus, through one substitution after another, the final result became completely different from the image in her mind.</p>
<p>"I get it now!" While clearing the table after finishing her Roasted Duck Rice, Wang Han suddenly clapped her hands, a look of sudden enlightenment on her face.</p>
<p>"What do you get?" Zhang Yi, sitting in Wang Han's seat, looked utterly bewildering.</p>
<p>While Wang Han was eating, he had also taken her seat and tried out the gameplay of Minecraft.</p>
<p>Although he hadn't watched any new player tutorial like Wang Han, he already understood some basic operations. He had just crafted a stone hoe and was about to look for some coal to mine and make torches when Wang Han's sudden exclamation startled him.</p>
<p>"Hmph! Why do you think I built such an unusually shaped structure?" Wang Han asked Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Zhang Yi couldn't help but grumble inwardly.</p>
<p>That prison just now—could that even be called unusually shaped?</p>
<p>It was just plain ugly! And ridiculously so!</p>
<p>Of course, he wouldn't voice this thought, only putting on a listening expression.</p>
<p>"As the saying goes, a clever housewife cannot cook without rice."</p>
<p>"Though I may not yet live up to the title of Master Builder, I believe my abilities go beyond this. The real reason I built such a house is simply the lack of materials. That's why I couldn't construct the style I truly wanted!" The more Wang Han spoke, the more confident she became.</p>
<p>Looking at the wooden 'prison house' before her, Wang Han had to admit one thing—this house really was quite ugly.</p>
<p>And she began to ponder: after all, she'd used only one material throughout. How could she possibly build a beautiful house like that?</p>
<p>If she had access to more materials, the room would surely look much better!</p>
<p>As the saying goes, a clever housewife cannot cook without rice.</p>
<p>Building houses is no different.</p>
<p>Without good raw materials, how could one build a beautiful house?</p>
<p>Thus, Wang Han immediately exited the game, looked at the save seed named 'Construction Master World', and directly chose to delete it.</p>
<p>It was slightly embarrassing—a bit of negative history.</p>
<p>Then, Wang Han restarted by selecting Creative Mode and gave her character a new name: Ziqing.</p>
<p>"What the heck is this name you picked? Not calling yourself Master Builder anymore?" Zhang Yi, sitting beside her, asked curiously, staring at Wang Han's new name.</p>
<p>"Hmph, haven't you heard of the idiom 'ghostly craftsmanship'? Ziqing is the very person behind that idiom," Wang Han huffed, explaining the origin of her chosen name.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi took a sip of water and said nothing.</p>
<p>What the house would actually look like remained to be seen. The only reference point so far was the previous 'prison darkroom'.</p>
<p>But as for the name, she certainly had a story ready.</p>
<p>Ziqing? Ghostly craftsmanship? I'd like to see what you can actually build.</p>
<p>Sitting beside her, Zhang Yi fixed his eyes on the computer screen, ready to see just what astonishing structure Wang Han could possibly create.</p>
<p>"Wow, the items in Creative Mode are so rich!" Upon entering the game, Wang Han looked genuinely surprised.</p>
<p>Compared to Survival Mode, where you start with nothing, Creative Mode was entirely different.</p>
<p>Not only could she freely control her character to fly, enabling more unrestricted building,</p>
<p>but also, destroying things required just one click, and she had infinite resources at her disposal.</p>
<p>Even more importantly, she could summon all sorts of materials—many of which she had never seen before.</p>
<p>Various kinds of glass, doors and windows, carpets, and more—everything was available.</p>
<p>Seeing these materials, Wang Han felt instantly energized, gaining a sudden surge of confidence.</p>
<p>"Think my house-building skills are lacking? Let me show you what I can really do," Wang Han thought, recalling Zhang Yi's earlier remarks, her expression now serious and focused.</p>
<p>From this moment on, she would prove herself.</p>
<p>Prove that the previous prison house was absolutely just an accident.</p>
<p>Looking at the wide array of materials in her inventory, and taking advantage of her ability to fly, Wang Han quickly selected a picturesque, scenic location.</p>
<p>First, she laid the Foundation, just as before. But this time, with materials available, Wang Han felt she could afford to be a bit more extravagant.</p>
<p>She would build a larger residence.</p>
<p>She first filled the ground entirely with stone blocks. Then, memories of the various magnificent structures she had seen during her travels surfaced in her mind.</p>
<p>Selecting building materials, she erected eight pillars.</p>
<p>Then, using these pillars as load-bearing supports, she began constructing the Wall.</p>
<p>Around the Foundation, Wang Han meticulously refined the details.</p>
<p>She laid down carpets and various decorative items on the ground.</p>
<p>At the same time, Wang Han discovered a particularly fascinating Block—a Block called Glowstone.</p>
<p>It actually emitted bright light, completely replacing the need for torches.</p>
<p>Glancing at the unfinished roof, she decided to seal the entire top with Glowstone.</p>
<p>That way, the whole space would stay sparkling and bright.</p>
<p>Glass, diamonds, emeralds—anything that looked beautiful, Wang Han used it all.</p>
<p>Roughly fifteen minutes later, Wang Han felt she was nearly done. She created Distance to step back and admire her work, but in the next moment, she fell silent.</p>
<p>The house before her... was just strange.</p>
<p>While building, the image in Wang Han's mind had been magnificent and beautiful, grand and imposing.</p>
<p>But as she built, and now looking at the actual result, she couldn't figure out where it had gone wrong.</p>
<p>Somehow, without realizing it, it had diverged completely from her mental image.</p>
<p>It felt slightly unfamiliar.</p>
<p>Though clearly recognizable as a house in shape, it just looked odd no matter how you viewed it.</p>
<p>Square and symmetrical, it looked very orderly.</p>
<p>The front used a material resembling marble, with glass replacing the walls, creating a transparent effect.</p>
<p>The ceiling was entirely composed of Glowstone, shimmering with light.</p>
<p>The overall structure followed the symmetrical layout of the Forbidden City.</p>
<p>She had even特意 built a long staircase at the entrance, dug a water channel filled with water, and laid a wooden bridge across it.</p>
<p>Her vision had been perfect—like the poetic imagery of 'small bridges, flowing water, and homes.' But now, it looked more like a sewer.</p>
<p>The Glowstone ceiling sparkled beautifully, but so much Glowstone on the ceiling just looked odd.</p>
<p>And the water channel at the entrance—according to her original idea, it should have evoked a serene, idyllic atmosphere. But in reality, it felt more like a drainage ditch.</p>
