<p>Chapter 178: There's Only One Truth! (5th Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>Looking at the bonfire before the courtyard, Song Ren silently lit it, his heart filled with excitement.</p>
<p>At the start of the game, being given a bonfire clearly signified that the player was meant to challenge a BOSS.</p>
<p>Thinking back to Gundyr the Ash from the previous game, Song Ren felt a surge of anticipation for the upcoming fight.</p>
<p>Especially since right before this courtyard stood a massive stone gate—something that, for any Dark Souls player, wasn't just a hint, but practically a Direct Statement.</p>
<p>Back when he first faced Gundyr the Ash, he'd been beaten into a bloody mess. But now, having thoroughly grasped the game's rules, Song Ren felt confident he could shine.</p>
<p>"But why don't I have any Estus Flasks? Could it be that since I was imprisoned, they took my flasks away?" Song Ren grumbled inwardly.</p>
<p>He realized he didn't have a single Estus Flask on him.</p>
<p>Granted, he had woken up in a prison cell, but his Armor hadn't been confiscated—so why were the flasks gone?</p>
<p>After all, in the previous game, even after crawling out of a grave, he still had his Estus Flask!</p>
<p>Still, it was only a brief complaint. Song Ren didn't dwell on it too much.</p>
<p>It was likely just part of the game's setting—adding extra difficulty for players. Facing the upcoming Discouraging Boss without Estus Flasks naturally ramped up the challenge.</p>
<p>"But it's not very newbie-friendly," Song Ren sighed with emotion, as he pushed open the courtyard's gate.</p>
<p>With a creak, the door swung open.</p>
<p>Song Ren guided his character into the room.</p>
<p>The room was completely empty.</p>
<p>However, on the ground near the entrance, there seemed to be an in-game message he could inspect.</p>
<p>Song Ren also noticed bloodstains scattered across various corners of the room.</p>
<p>Clearly, the game retained the previous installment's message system—whenever a player died to a BOSS, a bloodstain would be left behind.</p>
<p>But where was the BOSS in this room?</p>
<p>Just as Song Ren was about to examine the message on the floor, a dark shadow suddenly dropped from above.</p>
<p>With a thunderous crash, a massive demon wielding a huge Hammer leapt down from the ceiling and landed directly in front of him.</p>
<p>At the same time, the combat UI appeared on-screen, along with the BOSS's name: Asylum Demon.</p>
<p>"Wait, isn't this the elite monster from the tower top in Farron Cesspit?!"</p>
<p>Staring at the Stray Demon before him, the player at the computer was utterly surprised.</p>
<p>The BOSS in front of him looked nearly identical to the Stray Demon encountered in Farron Keep in the earlier Dark Souls game—though slightly smaller in size.</p>
<p>Yet the Sense of Oppression it exuded was just as intense. Being indoors amplified the feeling—the Stray Demon now occupied nearly half the screen, making it look terrifyingly imposing.</p>
<p>Still, the moment Song Ren laid eyes on the monster, he actually felt a sense of relief.</p>
<p>This wasn't some brand-new enemy. It was a familiar face.</p>
<p>Back on the tower top in Farron Cesspit, Song Ren had fought the Stray Demon before. He'd died twice at first, yes—but he'd also killed it!</p>
<p>Sure, he didn't have a shield, no Estus Flasks, and was wielding only a broken sword—but so what?</p>
<p>As an excellent Ashen One, what trials hadn't he faced before?</p>
<p>A mere demon couldn't possibly stop someone determined to carry on the great undertaking of linking the fire!</p>
<p>With a swift rolling, he dodged the BOSS's massive hammer swing and repositioned behind it.</p>
<p>He swung his broken sword at the demon's back.</p>
<p>But then… a '-6' popped up from the monster's health bar.</p>
<p>Song Ren froze. That meant he had dealt a mere 6 points of damage.</p>
<p>And the BOSS's health bar? Well… maybe, just maybe, it had decreased by the tiniest sliver?</p>
<p>Staring at the long, unchanging health bar beneath the name 'Asylum Demon,' Song Ren strained to see any sign of reduction.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the bar appeared completely untouched.</p>
<p>"Could it be that my attack method is wrong?"</p>
<p>He used two quick rolls to create distance, letting his stamina bar recover, then rushed in again for two more hits.</p>
<p>This time, the damage exploded—from single digits into double digits.</p>
<p>'-11'—seeing the number appear above the BOSS's health bar, Song Ren finally confirmed a grim truth.</p>
<p>The broken sword in his hand was nothing but a massive exploit.</p>
<p>In an instant, Song Ren's Mindset shattered.</p>
<p>"Are you kidding me?! This damage—what kind of joke is this?! This is way too low!"</p>
<p>Back when he played Dark Souls, Song Ren had started as the Deprived before.</p>
<p>That character began with the Small Club, which looked pathetic, sure—but it actually hit pretty hard.</p>
<p>And its Poise Break effect was excellent. In dual-wield mode with a War Cry, he'd crippled Gundyr the Ash in just a few hits.</p>
<p>But now? He'd chosen the Knight class at the start—fine, the Armor was overencumbered, whatever.</p>
<p>But where were his shield and sword? Someone must've stolen them, leaving him with just this broken blade.</p>
<p>If only the broken sword had decent attack power, he wouldn't complain.</p>
<p>But this thing barely made the demon flinch—no visible health loss at all!</p>
<p>If not for the damage numbers, Song Ren would've thought his attacks weren't even breaking hyper armor.</p>
<p>With single-digit and low double-digit damage, how long would it take to whittle this thing down?</p>
<p>While Song Ren was still Speechless, the demon in front of him raised its massive hammer high—and brought it crashing down!</p>
<p>Distracted, Song Ren failed to dodge in time and took the full hit. His health bar instantly dropped by half.</p>
<p>"Now add this to the list—no Estus Flask either!"</p>
<p>If you're making me do foot-trimming, at least give me a nail clipper!</p>
<p>Handing me a tissue paper—how the hell am I supposed to trim my feet?</p>
<p>Maybe after attacking for a while, or after dealing some damage, a story kill would trigger?</p>
<p>Perhaps I don't actually need to kill it myself?</p>
<p>That was entirely possible!</p>
<p>But in this cramped space, without any health regeneration, one small mistake was all it took for the demon to land a single devastating blow and send him straight to the afterlife.</p>
<p>【YOU DIED】</p>
<p>The player at the computer fell silent for a moment.</p>
<p>Unfamiliar scenes, a brand-new game—yet those three Chinese characters remained so familiar!</p>
<p>As the screen faded to black, Song Ren respawned beside the bonfire.</p>
<p>This time, however, he didn't rush in immediately. Instead, he paused to think.</p>
<p>"Did I miss something? No Estus Flask, fine. But such low damage from the broken sword—did I fail to pick up some items earlier?" Standing by the bonfire, Song Ren replayed the events in his mind.</p>
<p>"Could it be that I have to beat this BOSS without drinking, slowly grinding it down with this broken sword?"</p>
<p>"No way!" Song Ren frowned deeply.</p>
<p>If that were true, this difficulty would be way higher than the original Dark Souls!</p>
<p>With that broken sword's attack power, how long would it take to kill the BOSS?</p>
<p>Only those legendary players who dared to give Yhorm a foot-trimming with an axe or clip the Ancient Wyvern's nails could possibly succeed.</p>
<p>And even then—no Estus Flask at all?</p>
<p>This difficulty was practically on par with a level-one challenge against the nameless king!</p>
<p>But those who could beat the nameless king at level one were all elite-level players.</p>
<p>How could an average player possibly manage that?</p>
<p>Clearly, this was just a gatekeeper BOSS. There was no need to make it this brutal for newcomers.</p>
<p>Moreover, Song Ren clearly remembered one thing—Chen Xu's games usually didn't torture players like this.</p>
<p>(Well… except for that hammer-swinging game that nearly made his blood vessels burst.)</p>
<p>Besides, Dark Souls was never famous for being unfairly difficult—it was difficult, yes, but in a fair and meaningful way.</p>
<p>After running through the area again and confirming he hadn't missed any items, Song Ren stared at the BOSS room before him and softly chuckled.</p>
<p>"So… there's only one truth!"</p>
