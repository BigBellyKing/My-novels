                <p>Chapter 394: The Unique Charm of Animal Forest (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Song Ren handed his Switch to Zhang Yi and Wang Han, allowing everyone to get a hands-on experience.</p>
<p>"This game seems pretty fun to play casually," Wang Han said with some emotion as she greeted the little animals on the island.</p>
<p>Especially after helping these little animals choose their houses, these little animals even gave gifts in return.</p>
<p>And each animal seemed to have a distinct personality; they were all different.</p>
<p>One could also get a glimpse of this from the screens of other players who were also playing Animal Forest nearby.</p>
<p>"It seems the game is calculated by days. There isn't much to do on the first day, and things only unlock on the second day," Joey also expressed his opinion.</p>
<p>"Hmm, it feels like this game is meant to be played long-term, not like those casual games," Wang Yifan chimed in.</p>
<p>Because from the scattered remarks of the little animals, such as Tom Nook, a lot of information could be gathered.</p>
<p>Namely, many of the game's contents needed to be unlocked by passing days.</p>
<p>"But the main task right now should be to pay off the loan quickly, so we can happily enjoy our deserted island life!" Zhang Yi said.</p>
<p>"Exactly! Being in debt feels terrible, hurry up and work to pay it back!" Song Ren echoed.</p>
<p>"Sure enough, this is a game tough guys should play. Right from the start, it's about working for money; it's so heartbreaking!" Zhang Yi joked.</p>
<p>"Haha, from being in debt to being saddled with a mortgage, I wonder if building houses later will also require a loan? Tom Nook seemed to say they were in real estate, right?" Song Ren chuckled.</p>
<p>A tough guy alone on a deserted island, with a big company controlling all the island's resources, and the tough guy player inexplicably burdened with a housing loan.</p>
<p>Of course, this sounded miserable, but the actual experience of playing the game was completely different.</p>
<p>Because the tough guys in the game, though they immediately owed Tom Nook a large sum for their housing loan upon arriving on the island,</p>
<p>They soon found, as they played, that this NPC named Tom Nook was actually quite reasonable.</p>
<p>And the most crucial point was that this housing loan had no repayment date.</p>
<p>"No interest and no repayment date, so theoretically, as long as we're thick-skinned, we can avoid paying it back forever!" Song Ren concluded based on his game experience.</p>
<p>"It seems that's really the case!" Zhang Yi also nodded.</p>
<p>"So, if only it could be like this in real life!" Song Ren said with some emotion.</p>
<p>"Stop dreaming. In reality, you'd become a deadbeat, subjected to a triple package of travel restrictions, jail time, and house auction, you know." Zhang Yi glanced at Song Ren, mercilessly shattering his fantasy.</p>
<p>Although Animal Forest is a game that never ends, one that players can continue playing for as long as they wish.</p>
<p>It also features some early-game tutorials.</p>
<p>For example, showing players how to craft tools.</p>
<p>In the game, Song Ren and the others quickly crafted tools like fishing rods.</p>
<p>Then they started fishing by the river.</p>
<p>"Haha, I knew it! Fishing is one of the indispensable elements in most games." Seeing the fishing rod in the game, Song Ren couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>"And chopping trees. But it seems you can't chop down trees in Animal Forest," Zhang Yi said.</p>
<p>"They're probably just for collecting materials," Wang Han interjected.</p>
<p>Actually, these trees in Animal Forest could indeed be chopped down, but it required upgrading the axe with a new DIY recipe.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Yi and the others were clearly unaware of this at the moment.</p>
<p>Fishing, chopping trees, and encountering two other little animals to chat with and build rapport.</p>
<p>However, Song Ren soon discovered a problem: after playing for about half an hour, collecting five different items through fishing, and helping Blathers, the museum curator, set up his tent, there wasn't much playable content left.</p>
<p>Working under the seemingly cute but actually real estate mogul, Tom Nook, to pay off loans.</p>
<p>Many players thought about grinding for a bit to pay off their housing loans as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>But as they completed the simple objectives given to them in the early game, they discovered that no new content would appear.</p>
<p>Even the house built for Blathers would take some time to complete.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Tom Nook also gave players a bag of flower seeds, which also required time to grow.</p>
<p>Coupled with the fact that the game's time was synchronized with real-world time, a curious situation emerged.</p>
<p>Namely, some players, feeling that it was just starting to get interesting and wanting to continue grinding to pay off their loans,</p>
<p>Found that there wasn't much grindable content left.</p>
<p>"This game... it seems like there's not much left to play!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, it seems like things only unlock on the second day."</p>
<p>"Ah, I feel like I can already see Tom Nook's future plans. After this housing loan is paid off, won't it just keep increasing, eventually going from 49,000 to 490,000?"</p>
<p>Players in the exhibition area who were playing Animal Forest exchanged their feelings with each other.</p>
<p>At first, it felt like nothing special, but after chopping trees, fishing, and catching bugs, how did it feel like time had been stolen?</p>
<p>Yet, just like that, when it felt like the game had them hooked,</p>
<p>Suddenly there was no more grindable content, leaving a persistent itch in their hearts.</p>
<p>This, in fact, was where the charm of Animal Forest lay.</p>
<p>Ordinary management simulation games usually give players a feeling of "pain and joy."</p>
<p>Players would initially be dropped into a desolate place, then undertake various constructions and renovations, ultimately transforming the barren land into a beautiful home they could show off.</p>
<p>At the same time, in such management simulation games, the key was to grind.</p>
<p>If one were to ask what the most grind-heavy type of game was, it definitely wasn't a "grind-heavy" game in the typical sense, but rather a management simulation game.</p>
<p>However, Animal Forest broke the norm. In terms of gameplay content, it was similar, also dropping you on a deserted island to build your own home.</p>
<p>It seemed very grind-heavy to play, yet at the same time, it restricted you from grinding to a certain extent.</p>
<p>At every stage of the game, players would owe Tom Nook a large sum of money. Coupled with Tom Nook's real estate business, many players would feel that Tom Nook was a huge unscrupulous merchant.</p>
<p>But in reality, where would you find such a good merchant as Tom Nook? He not only gives you a loan but also has no repayment date and no interest.</p>
<p>Even if you had money, he wouldn't press you to repay unless you actively did so.</p>
<p>Because the goal of this game was not repayment.</p>
<p>The core appeal of Animal Forest lay in 'living life'.</p>
<p>The entire game had no fixed core gameplay.</p>
<p>It was just like life itself, and life had no specific way of being lived.</p>
<p>How you wanted to live, or what you wanted to become, were merely goals you set for yourself.</p>
<p>The same applied in the game: if a room wasn't cleaned for a few days, it would become covered in dust.</p>
<p>If you didn't interact with your friends, or even bullied them, you would lose them.</p>
<p>If you didn't take care of yourself or go out, you would only become increasingly slovenly.</p>
<p>Similarly, as you interacted more with the little animals, even the originally introverted or tsundere animal friends would open up to you and give you various gifts.</p>
<p>Sometimes they would invite you to play together at a set time, and because the game's time synchronized with real-world time, you might even have to wake up early for it.</p>
<p>Daily life—this is what Animal Crossing aimed to achieve.</p>
<p>It wasn't like other games where you could grind day and night at the beginning, even staying up for two or three consecutive nights to push through content and progress.</p>
<p>Only to close the game and never want to open it again after all the content had been experienced.</p>
<p>Animal Crossing was different. Even if you became obsessed, you couldn't grind even if you wanted to.</p>
<p>Because the game's time followed real-world time, shops would close at a certain hour, and the animals on the island would also go to sleep.</p>
<p>It was precisely for these reasons that Animal Forest was a game that required genuine time and emotion to truly experience its unique charm.</p>
