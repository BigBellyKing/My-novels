                <p>Chapter 613: This is Way Too Real (Please subscribe and vote for monthly passes)</p>
<p>What would the world be like if artificial robots appeared in the future? Many sci-fi games, movies, and TV series have explored this. Humans living in peace, or clashing fiercely. In Detroit: Become Human, both exist. Just like wealth and poverty, good and evil.</p>
<p>Factories billowing thick white smoke lined the highway. Crossing the road, one arrived at the bustling city center. There were thriving skyscrapers, bridges, spacecraft, and flying vehicles brimming with technology, bustling commuters, and chapels with a classical architectural style.</p>
<p>Along the roadside, construction workers could be seen. However, their uniforms and the circles on their temples silently told onlookers that they were, in fact, androids.</p>
<p>Walking through the city streets, rain began to fall, and pedestrians opened their umbrellas. In a corner by the roadside, a group of androids stood under what looked like a rain shelter. They were public androids, waiting for someone to rent and use them.</p>
<p>The scene shifted. At the entrance of a shop, a homeless man leaned against the wall. A sign on his chest read: “Androids took my job, please help me!”</p>
<p>This brief journey, neither too long nor too short, primarily served to immerse players in the background of Detroit and its future world. From the bustling city center to the surrounding industrial zones, and then to the overgrown, dilapidated outskirts. Clearly, in both the future and the present, poverty and wealth remain starkly polarized.</p>
<p>Connecting this with the homeless man's sign, Song Ren suddenly understood why some humans were so hostile towards androids. With androids mass-produced and their costs driven down low enough, when they could perform most manual labor, workers would naturally be “laid off.”</p>
<p>For those rendered jobless by androids, it was clear from their perspective that androids had indeed stolen their livelihoods. This gave rise to irreconcilable conflicts between androids and ordinary people.</p>
<p>To the tune of a piano BGM, the vehicle slowly vanished into the curtain of rain. The screen plunged into momentary darkness, and just as Song Ren thought he was about to see Connor again.</p>
<p>This time, he had become another android. Not Connor, nor the female android Kara, but a nanny named Marcus.</p>
<p>Song Ren was speechless. This was completely different from what he'd imagined! Having played the demo, he'd thought this game would be a thrilling cop-and-robber title. But why had it suddenly turned into an administrative nanny simulation? A male nanny, a female nanny.</p>
<p>However, unlike before, where Kara could only observe and not move, this android named Marcus had his own mission: head to the commercial district across the park and buy the paints his owner needed.</p>
<p>Previously, Kara couldn't be controlled, and Connor's scope of movement was limited to the house due to ongoing intense negotiations, so Song Ren hadn't experienced many aspects of the game then.</p>
<p>Now, controlling the android named Marcus brought a completely different feeling. Compared to regular controller operation, the new brainwave feedback control made Song Ren a bit unaccustomed.</p>
<p>It was a little too sensitive; although the game allowed for adjustments, he was still somewhat unaccustomed to it, having just started. Thankfully, Detroit: Become Human didn't have too many complex operations.</p>
<p>Walking along the park paths, the entire park gave Song Ren a very warm feeling. In this park, Song Ren saw androids bringing about positive changes: androids caring for the elderly, androids long-distance running with fitness enthusiasts, and androids looking after children in the amusement park.</p>
<p>This couldn't help but make Song Ren exclaim, “If only there were androids in real life, I wouldn't have to worry about trivial daily chores!” For a lazy person like him, he felt that if androids existed, his future life would be incredibly happy.</p>
<p>But as soon as he exited the park, Song Ren immediately felt that the atmosphere was completely off. At the intersection to the left of the park exit, a group of androids was under construction. To the right, a Black woman sat on the ground, holding an empty cup and begging. In front of her was a sign that read: “Ban Androids! They took my job!”</p>
<p>Crossing the street, android vending kiosks, shops, and advertisements were everywhere. Consumers gathered in front of display windows to choose androids, and there were public androids similar to shared bicycles.</p>
<p>The park had initially given Song Ren the impression of seamless harmony between androids and humans. But after crossing the street, everything changed.</p>
<p>The hot dog stand owner roughly chased Marcus away, because he hated androids standing in front of his stall. Along the roadside, many homeless people could be seen, jobless due to androids. A street singer by the fountain was resisting androids with his songs, a sign in front of him read: “Human Music! For just one dollar, you can hear music with a soul.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, below the office building next to the square, there were people preaching that androids were devils who would destroy their world.</p>
<p>He made his way to the Paint Store, scanned a QR code to confirm his identity and pay, then took the paints. But just as Marcus was about to take the bus home, a group of unemployed protesters against androids blocked his way.</p>
<p>“What the heck do you think you're going, tin can!” “Hey, look, I caught a tin can!” A group of people surrounded Marcus. Before Song Ren could react, the game camera suddenly shook, and he was pushed directly to the ground.</p>
<p>Before he could get up, another person delivered a fierce kick from behind. “Look at this stupid jerk! You stole my job, and now what? You can't even stand up,” a blonde woman snarled at Marcus on the ground.</p>
<p>The surrounding people cursed him freely, and every couple of seconds, another kick landed on him. Song Ren was a bit bewildered. What was happening?</p>
<p>Feeling the feedback vibrations from the experience pod, although being hit in the game didn't hurt, it certainly made him furious! “What the heck! Let me get up, and I'll kill you all!”</p>
<p>Song Ren gritted his teeth in anger. Anyone treated like this would obviously not feel good. Moreover, in a scene like this, the greater sense of fury stemmed primarily from humiliation.</p>
<p>The humans in the game clearly viewed androids as mere machines, unaware of what emotions were. But as a player embodying an android, one could vividly experience the corresponding emotional resonance.</p>
<p>This feeling deepened even further for Song Ren when a police officer arrived nearby. “If you destroy it, I'll have to give you a ticket.”</p>
<p>The casual tone of the remark felt as if he were describing an ordinary public facility. Or perhaps everyone thought that way: androids were just tools, not to be treated as people.</p>
<p>How infuriating! “If this were Bloodborne, I'd have skewered you all already!”</p>
<p>Watching the aggressors walk away, Song Ren muttered under his breath. “Forget it, I'll just take the bus back and turn in the quest.”</p>
<p>He sighed, walked to the bus stop sign, and waited for the bus. After Song Ren boarded the bus, he suddenly felt something was amiss.</p>
<p>Because this was way too real! Song Ren was utterly speechless after looking at the bus's layout. In the spacious compartment, only a few passengers sat scattered.</p>
<p>In the back, there was a small compartment exclusively for androids, occupying only about a fifth of the entire carriage. The human seats were empty, while androids were forced to squeeze into the small compartment and stand.</p>
<p>“What the heck, they even have segregation for bus rides? This society is way too real!” Song Ren stomped his foot in anger, but this was only the beginning.</p>
<p>As Marcus's storyline concluded, the surrounding environment shifted again, and Song Ren found himself transformed back into the android named Kara. Compared to Marcus's unfair treatment, Kara's game experience also made him involuntarily complain.</p>
