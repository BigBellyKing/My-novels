                <h2>Chapter 613 This is Way Too Real (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</h2>
<p>If artificial robots appeared in the Future Era, what would they actually be like?</p>
<p>Many sci-fi games, movies, and TV shows have showcased this before.</p>
<p>Humans coexisting peacefully—or locked in fierce confrontation.</p>
<p>In <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>, both scenarios exist.</p>
<p>Just like wealth and poverty, beauty and darkness.</p>
<p>Factories belching thick white smoke by the highway give way to bustling downtown areas after crossing the road.</p>
<p>There are towering skyscrapers, bridges brimming with Tech aesthetics, spacecraft, flying vehicles, bustling commuters, and chapels steeped in classical architecture.</p>
<p>Workers can be seen along the roadside, though their uniforms and the circles on their temples silently declare their true nature: androids.</p>
<p>As the streets of the city are traversed, rain begins to fall, and pedestrians open their umbrellas.</p>
<p>In a corner by the roadside, a group of androids stand under what resembles a rain shelter—public androids waiting to be rented and used.</p>
<p>In the next moment, the scene shifts to a Shop entrance where a homeless man leans against the wall.</p>
<p>A sign on his chest reads: 'Androids stole my job. Please help me!'</p>
<p>This segment of the journey isn't particularly long, serving mainly to immerse players in the backdrop of Detroit and the Future Era.</p>
<p>From the prosperous downtown to the surrounding industrial zones, then onward to the overgrown, dilapidated suburbs.</p>
<p>Clearly, whether in the future or the present, wealth and poverty remain sharply divided.</p>
<p>Seeing the homeless man's sign, Song Ren suddenly understood why some humans harbor such hostility toward androids.</p>
<p>Mass-produced androids with costs driven low enough to replace most human labor inevitably leave workers 'laid off.'</p>
<p>From their perspective, androids <em>did</em> steal their jobs.</p>
<p>Thus, an irreconcilable conflict arises between androids and Regular humans.</p>
<p>Amidst the piano melody of the Background Music, the car gradually vanishes into the rain.</p>
<p>The screen fades to black briefly, and just as Song Ren expects to see Connor again—</p>
<p>This time, he assumes the role of another android.</p>
<p>Not Connor, nor the female android Kara, but a caretaker named Markus.</p>
<p>Song Ren was Speechless.</p>
<p>This was nothing like what he'd imagined!</p>
<p>Having played the demo version, he'd assumed the game would be an intense cops-and-robbers drama.</p>
<p>So why was he suddenly an Administrative Nanny?</p>
<p>A male nanny, no less. First a female, now a male.</p>
<p>However, unlike Kara—who he could only observe but not control—Markus came with quests.</p>
<p>Head to the commercial district across the park to buy paint for his owner.</p>
<p>Kara couldn't be operated earlier, and Connor's negotiations confined him to the house, leaving many aspects unexperienced.</p>
<p>Now, controlling Markus offered an entirely different feel.</p>
<p>The new brainwave feedback controls felt overly sensitive compared to Regular controllers.</p>
<p>While adjustable in-game, the initial adjustment period was awkward.</p>
<p>Fortunately, <em>Detroit: Become Human</em> didn't demand overly complex operations.</p>
<p>Walking along the park paths, Song Ren felt an overwhelming warmth.</p>
<p>Here, androids brought positive changes:</p>
<p>Androids caring for the elderly, jogging with fitness enthusiasts, watching over children in the Amusement park.</p>
<p>Song Ren sighed with emotion. "If only androids existed in the real world—no more fussing over life's trivialities."</p>
<p>As a self-professed lazy person, he imagined how blissful life could be with android assistance.</p>
<p>But stepping outside the park, the Atmosphere shifted abruptly.</p>
<p>To the left of the exit, a group of androids worked on construction.</p>
<p>To the right, a Black woman sat on the ground, clutching an empty cup, begging.</p>
<p>A sign in front of her read: 'BAN ANDROIDS! THEY TOOK MY JOB!'</p>
<p>Crossing the street, android kiosks, stores, and advertisements were everywhere.</p>
<p>Consumers gathered around display windows selecting androids, while public androids functioned like shared bikes.</p>
<p>The park gave Song Ren the illusion of harmony between androids and humans.</p>
<p>But beyond its gates, everything changed.</p>
<p>A hot dog vendor aggressively shooed Markus away, despising androids near his stall.</p>
<p>Homeless people displaced by androids littered the sidewalks.</p>
<p>A busker by the fountain sang protests against androids, his sign declaring: 'HUMAN Music! JUST $1 FOR Music WITH A SOUL!'</p>
<p>Nearby office buildings hosted speakers decrying androids as demons that would destroy their world.</p>
<p>Arriving at the Paint Store, Markus scanned a QR Code to verify his role, paid, and collected the paint.</p>
<p>But as he prepared to board the bus home, a crowd of unemployed protestors blocked his path.</p>
<p>'Where the hell d'you think you're goin', tin can?!'</p>
<p>'Hey, look—I caught me a tin can!'</p>
<p>Surrounded, Song Ren barely processed the scene before the camera jerked—Markus was shoved to the ground.</p>
<p>Before he could rise, a kick landed on his back.</p>
<p>'Look at this dumbass. You stole my job, but now? Can't even stand.' A blonde woman sneered at Markus.</p>
<p>The crowd hurled insults, punctuated by kicks every few seconds.</p>
<p>Song Ren was bewildered.</p>
<p>What was happening?</p>
<p>The haptic feedback from the pod didn't hurt, but the humiliation fueled his rage.</p>
<p>"Damn it! Let me up, and I'll slaughter you all!"</p>
<p>Clenching his teeth, Song Ren seethed. No one would tolerate such treatment calmly.</p>
<p>The anger stemmed largely from the dehumanization.</p>
<p>In-game humans saw androids as mere machines—devoid of emotion.</p>
<p>But players inhabiting android roles felt the sting acutely.</p>
<p>This deepened when a police officer arrived.</p>
<p>'If you destroy it, I'll have to ticket you.'</p>
<p>The officer's casual tone treated Markus like public property—or worse, a disposable tool.</p>
<p>"If this were <em>Bloodborne</em>, I'd have skewered you all by now!"</p>
<p>Grumbling, Song Ren watched the assailants leave.</p>
<p>Fine. Time to board the bus and complete the quest.</p>
<p>At the stop, Song Ren waited—then froze upon entering.</p>
<p>Because this was way too real.</p>
<p>The spacious bus stood nearly empty, save for a few passengers.</p>
<p>At the rear, a cramped compartment—one-fifth of the cabin—was reserved for androids.</p>
<p>Human seats sat vacant while androids were forced to stand, packed like sardines.</p>
<p>"Even buses enforce segregation? This society's too damn real!"</p>
<p>Fuming, Song Ren stomped his foot. But this was just the beginning.</p>
<p>After Markus's story concluded, the surroundings shifted once more—</p>
<p>Song Ren found himself back in Kara's role.</p>
<p>And if Markus's Unfair Treatment was infuriating, Kara's player experience made him grumble inwardly even harder.</p>
