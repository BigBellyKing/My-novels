<h2>Chapter 230: A Breath of Fresh Air Among MC Players (8th Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</h2>
<p>With the release of Chen Xu's unique video,</p>
<p>it quickly became a hot topic of discussion among Minecraft players and also attracted the attention of many who had heard of the game but hadn't yet played it.</p>
<p>Compared to the various previous skill-showcasing videos that left players awestruck,</p>
<p>this video felt much more relatable to players.</p>
<p>After all, while those visually stunning videos were indeed awesome,</p>
<p>for most players, it was more about enjoying the spectacle—waiting for veteran players to upload their creations to the Workshop (modding platform), then downloading and playing with them.</p>
<p>But when it came to actually creating such things themselves?</p>
<p>Sorry, no thanks!</p>
<p>This time, Chen Xu's video on the historical major events of Minecraft featured things that many players had genuinely experienced.</p>
<p>For example, not knowing how to build a house, so they simply dug a hole, placed down torches and a bed, and made do for the night.</p>
<p>Or on their first night, being chased by monsters and instinctively using the "dig-three-fill-one" technique to escape.</p>
<p>Of course, there were also unlucky persons who unknowingly dug a pit in the wrong spot, excavating three blocks only to fall directly into a massive mine shaft, losing their first life pointlessly.</p>
<p>Players from various servers who had personally participated in large-scale events felt especially energized.</p>
<p>"Haha, I'm from Server 111. We've already started rebuilding the Sky City, planning to use Glass for the entire city's ground level! But quite a few unlucky persons, not realizing the Glass was transparent, accidentally fell through while building."</p>
<p>"That's nothing! Our Server 3511 is truly awesome! We were digging, and suddenly lava burst out, setting me on fire! Plus, we've made a new decision: artificially creating a lava river! Our underground city will be called Lava City!"</p>
<p>"Haha, I'm a player from Server 2147. Everyone was fighting with iron weapons, but then someone who was farming and raising them like livestock pulled out a gun, declaring that times have changed! Hilarious! So attention-grabbing!"</p>
<p>"Bro upstairs, you're too strong! Who came up with the idea for your Merchant Alliance?"</p>
<p>"How would I know? I wasn't even part of the group when the Merchant Alliance was formed—I was the one who got shot!"</p>
<p>"Actually, that's nothing. To qualify for the next episode of the major events video, the veterans from our Server 188 have signed a ceasefire agreement and unanimously decided to focus on urban development, selecting a respected leader to guide us in growing bigger and stronger, creating brilliance together!"</p>
<p>"Damn it, awesome! I'll mark this. Bro, remember to update us if anything new happens—I'm curious!"</p>
<p>"Hey, what are you marking!? Everyone wants to be the boss; the team spirit is already broken! We originally planned for a tripartite presidential system, but now it's split into tribal mode."</p>
<p>................</p>
<p>Besides the diverse world developments across various servers in multiplayer mode, which players found highly entertaining,</p>
<p>many players in the game also began exploring different Gameplay styles.</p>
<p>Some continued building beautiful houses in solo Creative Mode, immersed in their own worlds.</p>
<p>Others gathered to experience multiplayer server Gameplay.</p>
<p>The video's release also sparked deeper exploration of the game among players.</p>
<p>For instance, they began studying the game's Tech content, the Redstone mechanisms, and some players had even discovered the existence of the Nether.</p>
<p>Some veteran players started researching the game's complex Redstone systems, aiming to create even more awesome things.</p>
<p>Even more advanced players began developing various MODs.</p>
<p>Not just the earlier types of MODs involving Redstone mechanisms or building complexes,</p>
<p>but MODs with unique Gameplay.</p>
<p>Many other players, though not creating MODs, set up custom servers, formulating specific rules for various fun mini-games.</p>
<p>For example, downloading the theme scene of Along the River During the Qingming Festival, creating period-appropriate custom skins for players, and disabling player IDs in the game.</p>
<p>In a single round, 20 regular players are placed in a designated area within the Along the River During the Qingming Festival theme scene, with two players designated as killers equipped with attack-capable weapons.</p>
<p>The remaining players must blend in with NPCs or hide in corners, surviving until the time limit.</p>
<p>Each time a killer attacks incorrectly, they lose a health point.</p>
<p>Similar custom mini-game rooms began to multiply.</p>
<p>There were also puzzle games, where a complete structure was disassembled and split into two teams to see which could reassemble it faster.</p>
<p>Though no official rules existed, through player-established conventions and server-imposed rules,</p>
<p>unique Gameplay styles continued to emerge within Minecraft.</p>
<p>This perfectly aligned with the title of the game—Minecraft.</p>
<p>Everyone has their own world.</p>
<p>Everyone has their own way of playing.</p>
<p>Thus, the charm of Minecraft was fully showcased.</p>
<p>Although, inevitably with such a large player base, there were some entitled new players and veteran players who enjoyed bullying newcomers.</p>
<p>But compared to the overall environment, thanks to Minecraft's game rules, its slightly cartoon art style, and Nebula Games' excellent community management for the game,</p>
<p>Minecraft stood apart from other games, becoming a breath of fresh air in an online era filled with hostility.</p>
<p>This positive environment continuously solidified Minecraft's popularity, attracting more players to get into the game (colloquial for starting to play a game/join a hobby).</p>
<p>The sales miracle created by Minecraft left the entire gaming industry stunned.</p>
<p>Many game designers believed they had already given Minecraft high regard.</p>
<p>But as days passed, reality proved they had still underestimated this game.</p>
<p>By mid-March, it had been exactly one and a half months since Minecraft launched. During this period, several other games were released.</p>
<p>Yet they were still overshadowed by Minecraft, with no game managing to surpass its popularity.</p>
<p>Game designers who launched their titles during this phase were practically facing widespread despair.</p>
<p>................</p>
<p>Chen Xu clearly didn't pay much attention to his peers' misfortunes.</p>
<p>In Nebula Games' office, Chen Xu emerged from the gaming pod and took the phone handed to him by Qin Yi.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, we've tested all the major mobile platforms. Optimizations are nearly at their limit," Qin Yi explained.</p>
<p>The porting for the mobile and VR versions was essentially complete.</p>
<p>It wasn't a massive undertaking—especially for the mobile version, which mainly required optimization and some content cuts.</p>
<p>The VR version's main work focused on Modeling materials and related VR operation experiences.</p>
<p>But this wasn't Chen Xu's first time developing VR; during the development of Silent Hill PT for the Game Department, he had already gained experience with VR actions and related adaptation, so it wasn't particularly difficult.</p>
<p>"Alright, that should be it. Notify the Marketing and Operations Department to prepare for release," Chen Xu said with a slight nod after briefly examining the device.</p>
