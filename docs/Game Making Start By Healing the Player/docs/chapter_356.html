                <p>Chapter 355: Masterpiece (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, are you acquiring these game developers not to expand our first-party studios lineup, but for their technology?”</p>
<p>Inside the office, Ruan Ningxue and others looked bewildered.</p>
<p>Even Qin Yi and the others beside them were surprised.</p>
<p>While Nebula Games' acquisition of numerous game developers hadn't been widely publicized externally, overshadowed by the popularity of Warzone, the employees within Nebula Games were quite aware of it.</p>
<p>Initially, they thought it was to expand the company's production scale.</p>
<p>But now Chen Xu was telling them it was just for cutting-edge technology in different fields.</p>
<p>And these technologies were only to be used for the development of a single game?</p>
<p>This really overturned their worldview.</p>
<p>“Of course, if we relied on ourselves to slowly accumulate, how long would it take to achieve such results?” Chen Xu said matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>Game development, especially the development of AAA-tier games.</p>
<p>Aside from core elements like game creativity and gameplay, industrial technology is also extremely important.</p>
<p>“More cutting-edge technology requires us to tackle development ourselves to win in the future, but for general technology, we can simply compensate with monetary investment, can't we?” Chen Xu said with a slight smile.</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu’s words, everyone was momentarily speechless.</p>
<p>Alright, they pretty much understood what Chen Xu meant: anything that can be solved with money isn't a problem.</p>
<p>No technological accumulation?</p>
<p>One word: buy.</p>
<p>It was just the amount of money that made them a little dizzy.</p>
<p>However, after a brief recovery, everyone focused more on the previously revealed content.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, do you already have an idea for a new game? What kind of game is it?” Ruan Ningxue asked curiously.</p>
<p>Everyone wanted to know what kind of game could make Chen Xu approach it this way.</p>
<p>Looking at the curious crowd, Chen Xu just smiled without answering.</p>
<p>“We won't discuss the new game for now, because before that, we still have a lot of work to do. For example, the handover with the technical personnel of various studios to ensure the use of their technology. Also, for the new game, we need to create an even more massive world, and the art production for that is crucial; we'll need to start it in advance,” Chen Xu told everyone.</p>
<p>“Of course, during this process, we can take a clever approach, for example, by letting players participate in the development process,” Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Everyone: ???????</p>
<p>They all looked puzzled, not understanding Chen Xu's meaning.</p>
<p>“The scale of the new game will be our biggest project to date. There will be a relatively long vacuum period in between, and it will involve numerous tests.”</p>
<p>“So, we can turn some of the content into a corresponding VR themed login interface. While others charge fifty or sixty Yuan for themes, we'll give it to players for free if they spend a certain amount on the Nebula Games Platform! Of course, players can also help us test it out at that time, and it's also a form of warm-up, isn't it?” Chen Xu lightly coughed twice.</p>
<p>After hearing Chen Xu's words, everyone was instantly speechless.</p>
<p>Meaning, free testers?</p>
<p>However, everyone became even more curious. It sounded like the new project would be an incredibly massive endeavor.</p>
<p>Just how massive?</p>
<p>To everyone's disappointment, after saying this, Chen Xu didn't explain further and simply returned to his office.</p>
<p>Leaning back in his office chair, Chen Xu opened his computer and drafted some simple content.</p>
<p>The game he was about to develop was actually one Chen Xu had always considered.</p>
<p>Regarding the Huanyu VR Platform, Chen Xu had privately communicated with the Game Department.</p>
<p>From the current results, it was clear that the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare trilogy had gotten off to a very good start.</p>
<p>And subsequently, major domestic developers had also successively new plans.</p>
<p>However, on the Zeus Platform side, although it had suffered a setback with Storm Action, its overall lineup was still very extensive.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the overseas market, Huanyu's influence was indeed not as strong as Zeus.</p>
<p>Beyond that was the development of the Nebula Games Platform itself.</p>
<p>While it had become the largest platform domestically, it didn't have much influence overseas.</p>
<p>After acquiring Target Software, Nebula Games also began independently building its overseas gaming platform.</p>
<p>The next overseas strategy for Nebula Games was very simple: to compete for users.</p>
<p>The impact brought by Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was significant, but one Call of Duty game was clearly not enough, so Chen Xu was prepared to unleash a trump card for the subsequent phase.</p>
<p>The chosen target was Red Dead Redemption, or rather, the second generation of Red Dead Redemption, Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>
<p>At this moment, everyone was looking excitedly at the design concept document on the large screen in the conference room.</p>
<p>It listed the name of the latest project they would be participating in:</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption.</p>
<p>“That's right, this time, your overseas division will be the backbone of this project.”</p>
<p>“A Western-themed game, set in 1899, as advanced technology and civilization flowed from the Eastern cities into the West, the outlaws on horseback will bid farewell to their era, and the untamed Wild West will face its final twilight.”</p>
<p>“A clash between savagery and civilization, a choice between ideals and loyalty, an outlaw's final redemption in this era.”</p>
<p>“This is our next story.”</p>
<p>Chen Xu slowly explained amidst everyone's excited expressions.</p>
<p>Qin Yi and the others were clearly somewhat thrilled listening to Chen Xu.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, for the new game's mode, will we make it an FPS genre or...?”</p>
<p>Qin Yi and the other employees nearby asked Chen Xu with some curiosity.</p>
<p>Because from the game's attributes, this Red Dead Redemption clearly leaned towards that kind of content.</p>
<p>After all, cowboys are always inseparable from revolvers and hunting rifles.</p>
<p>“No! This will be an open-world mode, a cinematic open-world.” Chen Xu smiled and shook his head, uttering a phrase that left everyone somewhat confused.</p>
<p>Op... open-world?</p>
<p>Seeing their confused looks, Chen Xu smiled.</p>
<p>In his previous life, the open-world mode, strictly speaking, came in three different styles.</p>
<p>One of them was a mode like Red Dead Redemption, leaning towards a cinematic style with an abundance of detailed content.</p>
<p>Secondly, there was a mode that focused on openness, map elements, and level design, such as the combination of various levels and abilities in the shrines of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</p>
<p>It also had an attraction anchor setting, combined with engine effects of various elements.</p>
<p>Finally, there were open-world designs like the Assassin's Creed series and the Far Cry series.</p>
<p>These primarily focused on collection elements.</p>
<p>Equipment, side quests, and rich collection elements—this was also a mainstream open-world design mode.</p>
