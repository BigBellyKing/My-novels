<p>Chapter 213: Playtest Experience (Fifth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>Inside the Nebula Games office.</p>
<p>Most of the previously planned buildings had already been completed, with only a few minor ones still undergoing final touches.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, look—TengHua just announced the launch date for <em>Voyage</em>! It's set for January 21st!" Qin Yi said, a bit nervously.</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it. Remember our plan—the follow-up promotion for <em>Minecraft</em> is already taken care of. I've arranged everything with the Operations Department," Chen Xu said with a cheerful smile.</p>
<p>"As for <em>Voyage</em>, it's completely different from <em>Minecraft</em> in terms of genre. And honestly, I think that launch date will make things pretty awkward for them," Chen Xu added confidently.</p>
<p>With only <em>Don't Starve</em> as a reference—and <em>Don't Starve</em> being a rather special case among sandbox games due to its strong goal-oriented survival mechanics—many game designers had focused solely on the survival aspect.</p>
<p>As a result, they overemphasized survival elements and completely overlooked the most defining feature of sandbox games: creation.</p>
<p>Take Meng Zuo's <em>Wasteland (Game)</em>, for example.</p>
<p>And now TengHua's newly announced <em>Voyage</em>—just from the promotional videos and materials—Chen Xu could clearly see that they had gone astray.</p>
<p>They had completely ignored the creative aspect, violating the core characteristics of a sandbox game.</p>
<p>If he had to describe it, based on the content they'd released so far, Chen Xu felt it leaned more toward a box garden game like <em>Shenmue</em>, aiming to craft an exquisite game world for players to explore.</p>
<p>Still, despite this misstep, Chen Xu believed these games would likely sell well.</p>
<p>One reason was their quality; the other was that even though their direction was off, they had incorporated some sandbox elements and combined them with solid gameplay, giving them a certain appeal.</p>
<p>But going viral? That probability was quite low.</p>
<p>Now, if <em>Voyage</em> had launched after <em>Minecraft</em> officially launched, or even synchronized its release with <em>Minecraft</em>'s playtest, Chen Xu wouldn't have seen much impact.</p>
<p>Because again, the Gaming Industry isn't zero-sum. Although <em>Voyage</em> was marketing itself as a sandbox game, its gameplay was entirely different from <em>Minecraft</em>'s.</p>
<p>As for now? Chen Xu could only say: "Good luck."</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>On January 3rd, <em>Minecraft</em> officially opened its playtest download.</p>
<p>It would last five days.</p>
<p>Players who had been closely following the game began downloading it en masse, eager to dive in.</p>
<p>Wang Han sat in front of her computer, her face lighting up as the game screen unlocked. She happily pulled out her phone and took a photo.</p>
<p>What? Use the in-game screenshot button?</p>
<p>No way. She was going to use her phone to take the picture—and upside down, with the focus slightly off, just to be different.</p>
<p>After snapping the photo, Wang Han sent it to Zhang Yi: "When do you get off work!? I've already started playing!"</p>
<p>Almost instantly, Zhang Yi replied from the other end: "Soon. About thirty minutes. I'll be home in over an hour. Want me to bring you something to eat?"</p>
<p>That was exactly what she was waiting for. Seeing the message, Wang Han contentedly typed back: "Grab a roasted duck rice meal from downstairs when you come back. And make sure the duck bones are with cumin, not chili powder."</p>
<p>After a brief chat with Zhang Yi, Wang Han wasted no time clicking the <em>Minecraft</em> icon.</p>
<p>She couldn't deny it—<em>Don't Starve</em> had truly amazed her.</p>
<p>The last time she'd been this hooked on a game was <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>It Takes Two</em>.</p>
<p>In between, she'd glanced at other game developers' sandbox titles, but most were uninteresting.</p>
<p>As for <em>Minecraft</em>, she'd been eagerly anticipating it for a long time.</p>
<p>Sure, it had a pixel style, and the earlier promotional trailer hadn't revealed much, but she still held high hopes.</p>
<p>After all, <em>Don't Starve</em> hadn't even had a trailer—just a text post from Chen Xu on his official Weibo account.</p>
<p>After launching the game, the Nebula Games Logo skipped past.</p>
<p>Then came a scene resembling a grassland—but rendered in pixel art.</p>
<p>Fluffy white clouds drifted across the distant sky, with sunlight piercing through them and illuminating the ground.</p>
<p>The clouds in the sky formed the game's title and Logo: <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>
<p>The sunlight cast distinct shadows onto the terrain, clearly reflected on the ground.</p>
<p>The loading screen was also unusually engaging—not a standard flat UI interface, but an interactive game-like UI.</p>
<p>In this interface, the player controlled Steve, standing on a small, isolated island.</p>
<p>The island wasn't large, surrounded by invisible walls on all sides.</p>
<p>Beyond it stretched an endless sea, with a rising sun slowly climbing into the sky.</p>
<p>On the island stood several small structures, each labeled with text: 'Exit Game', 'Options Settings', 'MOD modules', and 'Start Game'.</p>
<p>Everything was constructed from individual blocks.</p>
<p>Wang Han had initially worried the pixel style might be unpleasant to look at.</p>
<p>But now, having entered the game, she realized it was just like the promotional video Chen Xu had posted on his official Weibo account.</p>
<p>Despite being pixel-based, the combination of high-definition materials and lighting and shadows gave the pixel blocks a unique charm.</p>
<p>"It's a bit different from what I imagined. The trailer footage must've been real after all."</p>
<p>Staring at this inventive UI interface, Wang Han couldn't help but marvel inwardly.</p>
<p>After learning <em>Minecraft</em> was a pixel game, her biggest concern had been the visuals.</p>
<p>She wasn't exactly a graphics enthusiast, but she still preferred games with better visuals.</p>
<p>Yet although <em>Minecraft</em> used pixel art, Chen Xu had meticulously refined its artistic presentation.</p>
<p>Beyond high-definition materials and lighting and shadows effects, he'd made subtle adjustments to details.</p>
<p>In <em>Minecraft</em>, players could clearly perceive changes in lighting and shadows. Moreover, the game featured a weather system.</p>
<p>The visual effect of rainbows and mist after rainfall, interacting with lighting and shadows, was particularly impressive.</p>
<p>Especially in this loading screen, which directly showcased the game's graphical quality to players.</p>
<p>Without overthinking, Wang Han first checked the MOD modules—just like in <em>Don't Starve</em>, there wasn't much content yet.</p>
<p>Then she entered the 'Start Game' building.</p>
<p>There were four selectable modes in total.</p>
<p>The first was 'Single-Player Mode', the second 'Multiplayer Mode', the third 'LAN game', allowing players on the same network to play together online.</p>
<p>The fourth was 'Community Game', where players could use their own console as a server to host their game Saves.</p>
<p>However, since this was Early Access mode, only Single-Player Mode and LAN game were currently available.</p>
<p>Of course, even in single-player, players could invite friends through the Nebula Games Platform to join their server.</p>
<p>It might seem like the LAN mode was useless.</p>
<p>But this mode was primarily designed for mobile players in the future. Although PC players rarely needed it, the general sentiment was: "I might not use it, but you must have it." And since it didn't add much complexity, they'd developed it together from the start.</p>
<p>"Guess I'll just play Single-Player Mode for now," Wang Han murmured to herself, selecting the mode and entering the game.</p>
