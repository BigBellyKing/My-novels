                <p>Chapter 790: The Legendary Life of Dovahkiin</p>
<p>Chapter 790: The Legendary Life of Dovahkiin</p>
<p>With the arrival of this massive Black Dragon, whose wings blotted out the sky, perched atop the Guard Tower.</p>
<p>The Imperial soldiers and mages inside Helgen launched arrows and spells into the sky, attacking the airborne dragon.</p>
<p>"This dragon is seriously awesome! Will I have to fight dragons in the late game too? I wonder if the game allows dragon riding—could I become a Dragon Knight?"</p>
<p>With the dragon's appearance, Song Ren was now free to move.</p>
<p>Ralof beside him shouted, urging him to flee immediately.</p>
<p>But Song Ren didn't rush to follow. Instead, he stood still, fantasizing about his future gameplay experience.</p>
<p>After all, the current scene was simply too spectacular.</p>
<p>In terms of visual presentation, the open-world game <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> didn't quite match the intensity of a thread-based game.</p>
<p>Yet this scene—a dragon descending from the heavens, magical spells flashing all around—was undeniably captivating.</p>
<p>Though <em>World of Warcraft</em> had also been impressive, it was an MMORPG, so the camera perspective was adapted accordingly. The same scene could evoke vastly different emotions under different angles.</p>
<p>At least right now, Song Ren found himself rooted to the spot. Even though a blatantly obvious mission prompt had appeared directly above his viewpoint on the screen, he still wanted to stay and watch a little longer.</p>
<p>But this moment of hesitation led to disaster.</p>
<p>The circling Black Dragon opened its jaws, unleashing an endless torrent of flames that instantly engulfed him.</p>
<p>Pain-filled cries erupted from the protagonist's mouth as the UI health bar in the lower-left corner plummeted.</p>
<p>In the next instant, Song Ren's game screen turned black and white, and the loading screen with the UI interface appeared.</p>
<p>"So this dragon wasn't here to save me? Did I seriously overthink it?"</p>
<p>One area-of-effect attack, and Song Ren instantly realized: this dragon had absolutely nothing to do with him. It wasn't here to rescue him.</p>
<p>Was I the clown all along?</p>
<p>After reloading and reviving, he returned to the moment the dragon descended from the sky and Helgen was plunged into chaos.</p>
<p>This time, Song Ren had learned his lesson. The moment he regained control of his character,</p>
<p>he immediately dashed into the nearby Guard Tower and began following the mission prompts to proceed with the game.</p>
<p>He jumped from the rooftop, narrowly avoiding the dragon's fiery breath mid-air.</p>
<p>The entire Helgen had been reduced to collapsed ruins by the dragon's rampage.</p>
<p>Everywhere he looked, flames burned fiercely, and Imperial soldiers lay charred and lifeless.</p>
<p>Yet, under General Tullius's command, Imperial soldiers continued fighting the dragon in the sky while also protecting the civilians within Helgen.</p>
<p>Witnessing this, Song Ren's impression of the Empire improved slightly.</p>
<p>Following the NPC stealthily, by the time he reached a plaza,</p>
<p>Song Ren was quickly faced with his first in-game choice: should he flee with the Imperial soldiers or escape with the Stormcloaks?</p>
<p>"Faction choice—so here I choose between the Stormcloak path or the Imperial path?"</p>
<p>Faced with this decision, Song Ren instantly understood.</p>
<p>Clearly, the game featured two distinct main quests: one supporting the Stormcloaks, the other the Empire.</p>
<p>It was probably similar to the Alliance and Horde factions in <em>World of Warcraft</em>.</p>
<p>After thinking for two or three seconds, Song Ren decisively followed Ralof.</p>
<p>"Though that Imperial general seemed decent and cared for the people..."</p>
<p>"...that female captain earlier still wanted to chop my head off. Can't blame me for siding with the Stormcloak bros now, can you?"</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Song Ren followed Ralof, sprinting toward the guard tower on the right.</p>
<p>Though he hadn't officially entered the story yet, and knew little about the Empire or the Stormcloaks,</p>
<p>how could he side with the Empire when they tried to execute him on sight?</p>
<p>I'm coming for you, Empire!</p>
<p>Inside the hall, Song Ren guided his character through a dialogue with Ralof,</p>
<p>then followed the prompts to loot the armor and weapons from a nearby dead guard.</p>
<p>"Can I interact with everything in this game?"</p>
<p>Staring at the corpse now stripped down to just its undergarments, Song Ren couldn't help but feel surprised.</p>
<p>Looting gear and seeing corresponding feedback on the NPC's body wasn't what amazed him.</p>
<p>What stunned Song Ren was the interactivity within <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>.</p>
<p>Keys, gold coins on NPCs—these could all be taken.</p>
<p>Even items in the dungeon—alleyways, cups, watermelons—could all be interacted with.</p>
<p>The content in Helgen Keep was purely a new player tutorial.</p>
<p>After acquiring the equipment, the very Imperial female captain who had earlier tried to behead him burst in with her subordinates.</p>
<p>Without a word, Song Ren followed Ralof into combat.</p>
<p>Combat in <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> was straightforward:</p>
<p>light attack, heavy attack, and blocking.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there were hardly any flashy moves.</p>
<p>There were none of the flashy combo attacks like in <em>God of War</em>,</p>
<p>nor the intricate sword dances seen in <em>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</em>.</p>
<p>Song Ren didn't see a trace of such mechanics in <em>Skyrim</em>.</p>
<p>If he had to compare, the combat style reminded him slightly of <em>Dark Souls</em>—</p>
<p>a duel reminiscent of Medieval knights.</p>
<p>Of course, the game's difficulty was far simpler than Dark Souls.</p>
<p>Moreover, he could feel this was a pure RPG game, where numerical design still played a significant role.</p>
<p>Compared to him, Ralof beside him was clearly much more formidable,</p>
<p>quickly dispatching the two Imperial soldiers in just a few moves.</p>
<p>"Damn, bro! Are you the Dragonborn, or am I?"</p>
<p>Seeing Ralof barely lose any health while standing in place looting corpses, Song Ren sighed with emotion.</p>
<p>Kill Imperial soldiers, eliminate the grotesque Frostbite Spider that dropped from above, sneak past a large brown bear dozing off—</p>
<p>this segment of gameplay posed virtually no challenge.</p>
<p>Ralof alone could clear the entire area.</p>
<p>The main goal was to guide players through basic operations:</p>
<p>using consumable items, defeating enemies through blocking and attacking, or stripping loot from fallen foes.</p>
<p>There were even mini-game elements, like lockpicking that required some skill.</p>
<p>When facing seemingly invincible monsters, going prone and sneaking past.</p>
<p>Yet there were also aspects that made Song Ren feel satisfied—such as directional attack control.</p>
<p>If he attacked an enemy's weak spot, there was a chance to trigger an execution attack.</p>
<p>Regardless of how much health the enemy's bar showed, a sharp blade would pierce through their chest, or other brutal execution effects would play out.</p>
<p>With bullet time slow-motion and actions full of violence and aesthetic flair, it looked incredibly cool.</p>
<p>Following Ralof for about five minutes,</p>
<p>Song Ren passed through the underground fortress of Helgen.</p>
<p>At the dim cave entrance, thick vines covered the opening.</p>
<p>Faint light filtered through the gaps in the foliage.</p>
<p>At the entrance, Song Ren controlled his character to push aside the vines. The outside sunlight was slightly blinding.</p>
<p>Then, the scenery of Skyrim unfolded before him.</p>
<p>Dense green forests, distant elk faintly visible in the woods, squirrels darting through the treetops.</p>
<p>Farther away, a snow-covered mountain range glistened in silver white.</p>
<p>Hazy white mist and thick clouds filled the sky. A winding mountain path led downward, and through the fog, he could glimpse a rushing river.</p>
<p>This breathtaking beauty left Song Ren utterly stunned.</p>
<p>This was a tried-and-true technique in games: emerging from a cave in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, passing through narrow ruins in <em>Uncharted</em> to see the legendary Pirate's Haven, or climbing the bell tower of a cathedral at night in <em>Assassin's Creed</em> with Ezio and his brother...</p>
<p>"Looks like that dragon isn't coming back. We're safe for now."</p>
<p>As the Black Dragon roared and flew away from Helgen Keep, Ralof beside him exhaled deeply.</p>
<p>Multiple dialogue options appeared—conversations about the dragon, about the Stormcloaks, about the Imperial soldiers.</p>
<p>Clearly, these were designed to help players better understand the game's lore and background.</p>
<p>In addition, Song Ren received two quests:</p>
<p>Find Ralof's sister Gerdur in Riverwood, a town not far from Helgen Keep,</p>
<p>and decide whether to join the Stormcloaks.</p>
<p>"Are these two main quests? Probably similar to <em>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</em>—one personal main quest, one faction-based main quest."</p>
<p>Speculating wildly, Song Ren glanced at the map.</p>
<p>The quest marker for joining the Stormcloaks was too far away, and the rest of the map was completely shrouded in fog—clearly meant to be explored manually.</p>
<p>Thus, Song Ren's immediate goal was set on Riverwood.</p>
<p>Though the game's story hadn't yet mentioned the identity of the Dragonborn, Song Ren, having watched the promotional video, naturally understood that the protagonist very likely <em>was</em> the Dragonborn.</p>
<p>"Riverwood—this must be the newbie village."</p>
<p>"Alright, the great Adventure of the Dragonborn officially begins now."</p>
<p>"Let the legendary life of Dovahkiin begin right here, at this first stop—Riverwood!"</p>
<p>Swinging the Imperial soldier's longsword in his hand, Song Ren felt full of confidence.</p>
