<p>Chapter 244: Entering the Game (Sixth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>Amidst an overwhelming wave of advertisements, time slowly moved forward.</p>
<p>On August 1st, Monster Hunter: World officially opened its demo version for download on the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>Not just players, but many game designers from the gaming industry also immediately chose to download the game.</p>
<p>Because many industry game designers also wanted to see exactly what kind of game Monster Hunter: World really was.</p>
<p>After all, hunting genre games had previously been extremely niche, and on top of that, this game carried significant meaning.</p>
<p>Although the success or failure of this game wouldn't determine the life or death of the Nebula Games Platform, nor cause major damage, it would certainly make The Alliance Corporation, which had recently suffered repeated setbacks, jump for joy.</p>
<p>Whether it was designers who had already committed to the Nebula Games Platform, or those still within The Alliance Corporation alongside NetDragon and TengHua, none of them wanted to see such a thing happen.</p>
<p>After all, at this stage, designers in the industry and some independent game studios, small game companies, had largely benefited from the sudden rise of the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>However, ordinary players clearly didn't care as much.</p>
<p>After all, as players, they simply wanted to enjoy good games.</p>
<p>And Monster Hunter: World was clearly the game they had been eagerly anticipating during this time.</p>
<p>Just past eleven in the morning, many players had already pre-downloaded Monster Hunter: World from the Nebula Games Platform, waiting for the 12 o'clock release of the demo content.</p>
<p>Inside a residential complex in the Imperial Capital, Wang Han and Zhang Yi, who had officially become a family, were each sitting in front of their computers. In the voice channel, Song Ren, Wang Yifan, and Joey were also present.</p>
<p>Five offline friends chatted while waiting for the game to go live.</p>
<p>"This game is great in every way, except that online multiplayer only supports up to four players," Old Song said in the voice channel, sounding slightly depressed.</p>
<p>"Yeah!" Zhang Yi agreed.</p>
<p>"It's fine, we'll just manage our time accordingly. Plus, my company has a big project recently, so I've been pretty busy," Wang Yifan replied in the voice channel.</p>
<p>"Alright, let's not talk about this. Even though the game only supports four-player online multiplayer and we're five people, Sister Han and I can share one computer, taking turns per round," Wang Han said cheerfully.</p>
<p>"Alright, alright, consider the feelings of us single people! Stop showing off, Sister Han!" Joey interjected.</p>
<p>"But I wonder how difficult this game is. Huge monsters and small, thin hunters—something about it just feels off," Zhang Yi said.</p>
<p>"It probably won't be too hard. Besides, didn't Mr. Chen say this isn't a Souls-like game? And the previous trailers also felt quite relaxed—there was even time to roast meat during hunts," Song Ren shared his opinion.</p>
<p>"Who cares about all that? Just go for it! We five are all high-level players who've cleared Dark Souls! And doesn't this game have team-up features? If we can't beat a boss solo, we'll just team up later. All problems solved easily," Wang Han said dismissively.</p>
<p>"It's live, it's live! We can enter the game now, stop talking!" Joey exclaimed in the voice channel upon noticing the game was accessible.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Zhang Yi and the others immediately clicked into the game.</p>
<p>After opening the game, it didn't immediately load in. Instead, a notification pop-up appeared:</p>
<p>'As this is the demo version, only limited areas are accessible, and multiplayer is not supported. (Game save data will only retain character customization data.)'</p>
<p>Seeing the pop-up, Zhang Yi and the others weren't particularly surprised.</p>
<p>After all, they were all veteran players who naturally understood what a demo version meant.</p>
<p>Limited content was basically just the prologue or similar segments, letting players understand the game's vibe.</p>
<p>Naturally, many features couldn't be experienced.</p>
<p>In the voice channel, everyone conferred briefly and then turned off their microphones.</p>
<p>After all, without multiplayer, the voice chat wasn't really necessary. Better to fully immerse themselves in the experience.</p>
<p>After the Nebula Games logo faded, the sound of waves crashing filled their ears.</p>
<p>Then, a booming voice called out:</p>
<p>【Alright then… fellow members of the Fifth Fleet!】</p>
<p>【Time's almost up—no need for long goodbyes!】</p>
<p>【Once you board this ship, there's no turning back. If you've lost your resolve, I suggest turning back right here.】</p>
<p>【Now then, let's set sail for the New World!】</p>
<p>【May the Azure Star, guiding our path, shine brightly for you!】</p>
<p>As the narration ended, the tightly closed doors opened.</p>
<p>Blinding light appeared. After their eyes adjusted slightly, countless people carrying luggage began boarding the ship.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi blended in among them, clearly also one of those heading to the New World.</p>
<p>Boarding the large vessel and stepping onto the deck,</p>
<p>a crew member guided him into the ship's cabin.</p>
<p>Once inside, it was an entirely different world.</p>
<p>Chandeliers with burning candles hung from the ceiling. Countless armored crew members bustled about. At wide tables, groups of three to five hunters raised their cups and drank. Nearby, a crew member had piled up a stack of books, deeply engrossed in research.</p>
<p>But what surprised Zhang Yi the most were the small cats in armor, hopping around and raising their cups alongside the hunters.</p>
<p>Additionally, many other small cats walked upright, casually wandering around, acting as waiters carrying plates full of food to the tables.</p>
<p>Watching a small cat place a plate full of food on the table, then open its big eyes wide and wave with a smile at the female hunter, Zhang Yi found it utterly adorable.</p>
<p>"These cats are so cute!" Zhang Yi couldn't help but sigh with emotion.</p>
<p>Is this really a hunting game? Or is it actually a cute-themed game?</p>
<p>Filled with curiosity, Zhang Yi observed everything inside the cabin.</p>
<p>Each hunter was busy with their own matters—drinking, consulting materials, organizing their equipment.</p>
<p>These would be his hunting companions from now on? His teammates who would fight alongside him?</p>
<p>Now Zhang Yi fully understood why Chen Xu had said Monster Hunter: World was completely different from Dark Souls.</p>
<p>Not even considering the art style or gameplay.</p>
<p>Just the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Look—how friendly and harmonious the members of the Hunter's Guild were! They'd all become his great helpers.</p>
<p>In single-player mode, where teaming up wasn't possible, these NPC teammates would likely be the ones accompanying him.</p>
<p>Unlike Dark Souls, where in Firelink Shrine, you only had the Fire Keeper young lady and a handful of others.</p>
<p>Plus that unwavering Crestfallen Warrior, constantly spreading negative energy thoughts, making the entire game's atmosphere extremely oppressive.</p>
<p>Thankfully, in every Dark Souls game, you could summon helpers.</p>
<p>But in Monster Hunter: World, the difference in style was clearly apparent.</p>
<p>Unity, friendship, filled with positive energy!</p>
<p>【Hey, we're almost at the New World. Are you ready?】</p>
<p>【Nervous?】</p>
<p>As Zhang Yi was lost in thought, a Mohawk-haired male hunter approached, casually sitting across the table, gripping a wine glass, and striking up a conversation as if they'd known each other for years.</p>
<p>After discussing their current situation and some game content,</p>
<p>the game transitioned into the character creation screen. It was similar to the character customization interface in Dark Souls, but while Dark Souls had a Western fantasy style, Monster Hunter: World clearly leaned more toward an Eastern aesthetic.</p>
<p>Character customization!?</p>
<p>This was his specialty! And it seemed like the character creation save data could be retained?</p>
<p>Seeing the rich character customization interface before him, Zhang Yi became excited.</p>
<p>This was his favorite part!</p>
<p>Gender wasn't an issue—still a male character. As for skin tone, yellow skin.</p>
<p>Next, the facial structure needed to be somewhat imposing—a middle-aged hunter, at the peak state of combat prowess.</p>
<p>"A mouth without hair cannot do things reliably," so a beard on the chin.</p>
<p>But the mindset should remain youthful. And when facing hunting targets, it wasn't always necessary to resort to violence—sometimes, love could influence them.</p>
<p>So for hair color, a touch of playfulness was needed.</p>
<p>"Done!" After about fifteen minutes, Zhang Yi nodded in satisfaction at the character before him.</p>
<p>The only thing slightly disappointing was that compared to Dark Souls' character customization system, Monster Hunter: World's was a bit more conservative, limiting his ability to fully express himself. But it would have to do.</p>
<p>And as usual, he'd tweak it later.</p>
