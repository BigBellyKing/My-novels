                <p>Chapter 664: The Most Capable NPC Teammate: Elizabeth (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Of course, beyond the worldviews and backgrounds of these games, the combat system of <em>BioShock Infinite</em> is also quite interesting. Although it is an FPS-type game, it also possesses some RPG attributes. Left-handed magic and right-handed firearms offer players many possibilities for combat combinations. The scene contains various types of mechanisms, such as machine gun turrets. If players learn chaotic magic, they can control enemy machine gun turrets and turn them into their own firepower.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as the game progression advances, players can not only acquire more different weapons but also various superhuman element suits. These can be combined with different firearms and magic to form various routines. Of course, currently, Zhang Yi has only learned a few sporadic superpowers.</p>
<p>However, in addition to this content, what Zhang Yi anticipated and was most curious about was the game's main storyline itself. After all, <em>BioShock Infinite</em> is clearly a linear story progression FPS game, and Zhang Yi didn't feel the same freedom as in <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>. It was more like <em>Uncharted</em> and <em>The Last of Us</em>, but the entire Sky City in <em>BioShock Infinite</em> felt even more vibrant.</p>
<p>On normal difficulty, Zhang Yi didn't get stuck and pushed through the story. After Comstock caused the airship crash, Booker still managed to reach the colossal Monument Island using the Sky-Line. And when Zhang Yi controlled Booker to walk into the angel statue, he discovered that what appeared magnificent from the outside was, in fact, a gigantic research lab inside.</p>
<p>"Oh my god!"</p>
<p>Looking at the research lab inside the angel statue, Zhang Yi was like Grandma Liu Entering the Grand View Garden, observing everything around him. Electric currents, visible to the naked eye, and a gigantic siphon device—everything seemed utterly shocking.</p>
<p>But what surprised Zhang Yi even more was that this research lab seemed to be specifically built for studying Elizabeth. Through some materials and photos, it could be learned that the people in this research lab had been continuously monitoring Elizabeth. Why were these people monitoring Elizabeth? Wasn't Elizabeth Comstock's daughter? A question mark appeared in Zhang Yi's mind.</p>
<p>However, unlike the problems that had troubled him before, this time Zhang Yi quickly got the answer he wanted. In an observation room on the second floor, through a one-way glass window, Zhang Yi saw Booker's target, Elizabeth. The young girl looked healthy and cheerful, but was missing a finger. In the room, Elizabeth was amusing herself with a theatrical performance, admiring her drawing of the Eiffel Tower. But what was even more surprising was that Elizabeth actually had the ability to tear space. She tore a spatial rift on the canvas, and on the other side seemed to be the real Paris, but the rift disappeared in an instant.</p>
<p>"So Elizabeth was imprisoned by her father, Comstock, because she had this ability to open spatial rifts." Zhang Yi boldly speculated and hypothesized. "And this research lab was built to study Elizabeth's abilities. Those two mysterious siblings might also be coveting Elizabeth's superpowers, so they commissioned Booker to rescue her. And eventually, Booker and Elizabeth embark on an adventure together, ultimately deciding to take down Comstock and the shadowy organization behind those two mysterious people?"</p>
<p>He felt that his guess was almost spot on. After all, wasn't <em>The Last of Us</em> a similar storyline? It had just become a cartoon version, with a series of settings like utopia and religion added in.</p>
<p>With his speculations, Zhang Yi continued forward. In the research lab, he reached the upper library. As the floor collapsed, Booker fell down, and finally had his official encounter with Elizabeth. Relying on the key given by the mysterious siblings earlier, Booker led Elizabeth away from the place that had imprisoned her for her entire life, ever since she could remember, and they breathed the free, fresh air outside.</p>
<p>But the next moment, in the sky, the giant mechanical bird Songbird, responsible for guarding and caring for her, furiously swooped down.</p>
<p>"Holy crap, how is this thing supposed to be fought?!"</p>
<p>"Is it invincible? My shots aren't doing any damage at all!"</p>
<p>Seeing the giant mechanical bird Songbird, Zhang Yi's first reaction was that a BOSS battle had begun. After all, he'd seen plenty of large BOSSes. Hadn't he linked the fire enough times to Lords of Cinder in <em>Dark Souls</em>? And every Great One in <em>Bloodborne</em> had been slaughtered. How tough could a mere mechanical bird be?</p>
<p>However, Booker wasn't a Hunter or an Undead. The gun he held, when shot at Songbird, only produced sparks; no health bar UI even appeared. Clearly, this giant mechanical bird was invincible, or rather, Booker couldn't fight it yet; he'd need stronger weapons to deal with it.</p>
<p>The frantic Songbird directly smashed the giant angel statue. In the chaos, Booker and Elizabeth narrowly escaped. In mid-air, Booker held Elizabeth tightly, then used his Sky-Hook to traverse the Sky-Line, just like when Comstock had caused the airship crash earlier. But compared to that previous Leap of Faith during the airship crash, this time was even more perilous and longer. It involved continuous leaps through the air, not just a single-line descent.</p>
<p>From above, one could appreciate the magnificent beauty of the entire Sky City Columbia, but as an acrophobe, Zhang Yi felt like he was about to wet himself. Elizabeth's gasps of surprise, the sound of wind, and the rapidly passing white clouds made the whole process incredibly exciting and dangerous.</p>
<p>Finally, Elizabeth and Booker landed on a floating island used by citizens for vacation. For Elizabeth, who had never seen crowds before, she was instantly captivated by this never-before-seen world. Seeing Elizabeth's excited expression, Booker, who was a little dazed from the fall, told her that she could go explore the floating island, while he would rest a bit.</p>
<p>"Booker, I'll rest with you, I'll rest." Calming his own heart, Zhang Yi felt a lingering fear. Many times, he still couldn't get used to it. It was the same in <em>World of Warcraft</em>; the high-altitude scene with chains and lava in Blackrock Depths also made him feel a little bit like he was going to pee himself.</p>
<p>After a short nap on the beach, Booker woke up again and went to look for Elizabeth. He finally found Elizabeth dancing by the coastline. Elizabeth, who had spent her entire life in a small house, had never seen the outside world. Breathing the free air, Elizabeth was absolutely overjoyed.</p>
<p>However, facing the lingering Elizabeth, Booker also mentioned that they could plan to take an airship to Paris, a place Elizabeth had yearned for for a long time. Along the way, Zhang Yi noticed that he encountered the mysterious siblings who had appeared before. Here, he could choose an ornament for Elizabeth. There were two options: a bird and a cage, which likely symbolized freedom and restraint. He speculated that he wasn't sure what impact it would have later, and after some thought, Zhang Yi chose the bird ornament.</p>
<p>After strolling around the island for a while, the clouds and fog in the sky cleared. The people on the island also saw the damaged angel statue, and immediately, the islanders became alarmed. The entire island went into lockdown, with all exits guarded. And then, Zhang Yi finally witnessed Elizabeth's importance. He could only say that she was absolutely the most capable NPC teammate he had ever encountered in a game. She even far surpassed some human players, like Old Song.</p>
