                <p>Chapter 52: The Despairing Catacomb</p>
<p>Chapter 52: The Despairing Catacomb</p>
<p>While playing the game, Sun Yifeng and Huang Donglai kept bickering with each other.</p>
<p>Although it sounded like an argument, in reality, this was just their usual way of exchange.</p>
<p>The veteran viewers in the live stream room were mostly aware of this.</p>
<p>Undeniably, this Atmosphere made Sun Yixie feel a bit more at ease.</p>
<p>But soon, as Sun Yixie entered the dark and cramped catacomb, his previously relaxed heart tightened once again.</p>
<p>Up until now, there hadn't been many scenes shrouded in darkness.</p>
<p>But this current catacomb was completely different.</p>
<p>Pitch black. Occasionally, a few spots had dim lighting, but even then, the visibility was extremely blurry—practically zero.</p>
<p>To see clearly, he had to rely on his handheld camera, using its night vision mode to navigate.</p>
<p>Although Sun Yixie had mentally prepared himself, understanding that certain scenes later in the game would require this mode,</p>
<p>the moment had finally arrived, and his heart still fluttered with unease.</p>
<p>"What the hell is this!"</p>
<p>"Turn on two air pumps and the main switch, then restart the generator! What the hell is this!"</p>
<p>Sun Yixie stared at the newly appeared quest, and a feeling called despair began to creep into his mind.</p>
<p>The catacomb was already oppressively dark, and now he had to search in this Complex, pitch-black maze for the air pumps and then flip the generator's main switch?</p>
<p>Was this even something a human could do?</p>
<p>Why did I have to go bragging? Why did I have to play this horror game?</p>
<p>In that instant, Sun Yixie felt a twinge of regret.</p>
<p>But words once spoken were like water spilled—impossible to take back. Now that he'd committed, there was no way he could quit.</p>
<p>After all, if he hadn't said anything, it'd be one thing. But having made his claim, unless it was truly impossible to win, he wouldn't back down.</p>
<p>"Damn it, damn it, there's nothing to be afraid of!"</p>
<p>Sun Yixie pumped himself up, inching forward cautiously into the catacomb.</p>
<p>Guided by instinct, he first moved to the left. After not far, he opened a door and spotted the air pump inside the room.</p>
<p>In the dim room, besides the air pump switch, there was also a row of cabinets.</p>
<p>"My luck's pretty good!"</p>
<p>Seeing the air pump right in front of him, Sun Yixie felt a surge of joy.</p>
<p>He'd already completed one-third of his objective!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, bullet comments flooded in.</p>
<p>'Sun Yixie, what kind of luck is this?'</p>
<p>'He found one already? I was hoping to see Sun Yixie panic-breathe a bit more.'</p>
<p>'Isn't this normal? Weren't there arrow hints on the walls earlier? Sun Yixie just didn't notice them.'</p>
<p>'Did you see the cabinets beside him? I feel like that fat uncle from earlier might show up again.'</p>
<p>'Nah, probably not. With that guy's huge build, how could he even squeeze in here?'</p>
<p>Amid the bullet comments' chatter, Sun Yixie also noticed the cabinets nearby.</p>
<p>"When I turn on this air pump, a monster might spawn—so these cabinets are meant for me to hide?"</p>
<p>He stared at the air pump switch in front of him, and the cabinets beside it.</p>
<p>After a moment of thought, Sun Yixie decided to pull the switch. After all, without turning on the air pump, the game progress couldn't move forward.</p>
<p>With a creaking, muffled Click Sound, the switch was activated.</p>
<p>Sun Yixie quickly ducked into the nearby cabinet.</p>
<p>About ten seconds later, a series of loud banging noises echoed through his headphones.</p>
<p>'Boom!' 'Boom!' 'Boom!'</p>
<p>It kept pounding repeatedly, followed by the sharp snap of splintering planks. Then, heavy, muffled footsteps began approaching the room—drawing nearer.</p>
<p>Sun Yixie, still hiding inside the cabinet, didn't turn off his handheld camera. He tilted his back against the cabinet wall and pulled his down jacket's hood tighter.</p>
<p>Then, on the screen, a mentally deranged man entered, clutching a plank resembling a spiked club.</p>
<p>Under the camera's night vision mode, the figure appeared abnormally grotesque and terrifying.</p>
<p>The figure paced back and forth in the room. From his movements, it was clear they were irregular, twitching spasmodically—giving off a deeply creepy vibe.</p>
<p>Under night vision, his wrinkled skin took on a distorted, sickly white hue. His eyes glowed like tiny lightbulbs, appearing extremely creepy.</p>
<p>"Damn it, I was so damn clever—thank goodness I hid in the cabinet early," Sun Yixie sighed in relief, giving himself a pat on the back.</p>
<p>But the next moment, his heart leapt into his throat. The monster was now checking the cabinets.</p>
<p>From the headphones came the sound of the creature pulling open the nearby cabinets, instantly freezing Sun Yixie with fear—he didn't even dare to breathe.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the insane monster only checked two cabinets before muttering to himself and leaving.</p>
<p>"Damn it, the situation's getting more dangerous," Sun Yixie swallowed hard. Clearly, his current predicament was dire. Not only did he have to search for switches in this pitch-black environment, but he also had to stay alert for a boss that could appear at any moment.</p>
<p>After waiting about ten seconds to confirm the monster wouldn't return, Sun Yixie finally crawled out of the cabinet.</p>
<p>In the darkness, Sun Yixie noticed that right beside the air pump he'd just activated, there was a door marked with an arrow.</p>
<p>He opened it and looked inside—sure enough, another air pump.</p>
<p>The only difference was that this room had no cabinets for him to hide in.</p>
<p>"Damn it, what am I supposed to do now!?"</p>
<p>Staring at the scene before him, Sun Yixie panicked and turned to the bullet comments.</p>
<p>But since this was a newly released horror game, the live stream's bullet comments naturally had no wise sages. The suggestions offered were clearly unreliable. Or perhaps some viewers knew the solution but chose not to share.</p>
<p>At that moment, his good buddy Huang Donglai, sitting beside him, offered some advice.</p>
<p>"Ah, Brother Sun, isn't this simple?"</p>
<p>"Cabinets mean a monster appears. But no cabinets mean no monster, right?"</p>
<p>"And when you enter to turn on the air pump, just close the door behind you. This monster pounds on doors, right? That way, you'll get a heads-up and be mentally prepared," Huang Donglai suggested, all while wearing headphones and listening to cheerful Music.</p>
<p>As for why he was wearing headphones—mainly because he was scared too.</p>
<p>Besides, by not hearing the game's audio and watching not the main screen but the secondary monitor displaying the live stream's bullet comments, his sense of fear was greatly reduced.</p>
<p>"Brother Huang, now that you mention it, that actually makes some sense," Sun Yixie mused for a moment, feeling like there might be truth to the words.</p>
<p>But something still felt off—though he couldn't quite put his finger on what.</p>
<p>Still, in such a Perilous situation, Sun Yixie didn't dwell on it. He decided to follow Huang Donglai's suggestion.</p>
<p>After all, it really did sound reasonable.</p>
