<p>Chapter 133 Overseas Promotion (Subscription Request)</p>
<p>For most games, especially Single-player games,</p>
<p>the peak popularity generally occurs during the first and second weeks after release.</p>
<p>After that, the game's popularity steadily declines, especially for titles that received extensive pre-launch promotion.</p>
<p>This has become a common phenomenon in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>After all, for many players, once a Single-player game is Cleared the Game, there's little incentive to replay it beyond collecting missed items or grinding through a second playthrough.</p>
<p>The story has already been experienced; unless the Gameplay is exceptionally compelling, there's usually little desire for a second playthrough.</p>
<p>Coupled with the fact that game developers typically reduce promotional efforts afterward, the game's热度 naturally cools down.</p>
<p>Yet Dark Souls completely defied this norm.</p>
<p>Its popularity steadily climbed.</p>
<p>Especially as more and more players progressed deeper into the game and discovered the intricate details within Dark Souls.</p>
<p>The game's score rose steadily from an initial 8.3 to 9.3, and there seemed to be further potential for growth.</p>
<p>This left countless game designers across the industry utterly baffled.</p>
<p>'How is Dark Souls' reputation getting better and better? This is so baffling!'</p>
<p>'Mainly because Dark Souls was initially underrated. Now it's experiencing a rebound. But what I can't wrap my head around is, hasn't Dark Souls been out for nearly a month already? Why is it getting even more popular?'</p>
<p>'Exactly! Video platforms and live streaming platforms are practically flooded with Dark Souls content!'</p>
<p>'Chen Xu and his Nebula Games are just cursed with good fortune!'</p>
<p>'But looking at third-party sales data, while Dark Souls is definitely popular, the sales figures don't seem explosive—estimated first-month sales are capped at around 4 million.'</p>
<p>'That's still because Dark Souls'热度 is insanely high. Is 4 million first-month sales for a blockbuster really that low? With future discount promotions, joining the ten-million sales club is just a matter of time.'</p>
<p>'It feels like Dark Souls' design is completely opposite to previous ARPG games. So why is it so successful?'</p>
<p>As Dark Souls surged in popularity, the gaming industry continuously discussed this phenomenon-level game.</p>
<p>Major game developers and Game Designers alike began studying Dark Souls in reverse.</p>
<p>After all, previously, the industry had assumed Chen Xu had failed.</p>
<p>No mini-map, extreme difficulty, harsh death penalties—these were all points early players grumbled inwardly about.</p>
<p>But why, as time passed, have these very aspects transformed into Dark Souls' strengths?</p>
<p>Baffling!</p>
<p>Countless game designers stared at Dark Souls'热度 that remained high, their minds doubting life itself.</p>
<p>This completely overturned their understanding.</p>
<p>Of course, there were those even more shocked.</p>
<p>Namely, certain game developers and designers who, during Dark Souls' initial negative口碑, had planned to swoop in and steal the spotlight.</p>
<p>Now, they were all completely dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Inside Hawkwing Entertainment, Li Xiang felt his blood pressure rising, seeing stars dancing before his eyes.</p>
<p>He had considered many possibilities, but never imagined a game that launched with poor口碑 could completely reverse its fate without any changes to its existing content.</p>
<p>The game isn't flawed—the players are. Players must adapt to the game.</p>
<p>This was a common joke among many game designers.</p>
<p>Most seasoned professionals didn't actually believe it.</p>
<p>Yet he never expected that Dark Souls truly began aligning with this statement.</p>
<p>More critically, Dark Souls'热度 showed absolutely no signs of cooling down.</p>
<p>Now, Hawkwing Entertainment faced an awkward predicament.</p>
<p>Should they launch their new game or not?</p>
<p>Launching meant competing directly against Dark Souls' damage output, with two upcoming VR blockbusters from TengHua and NetDragon looming afterward.</p>
<p>Delaying meant abandoning the promotional warm-up they'd already initiated.</p>
<p>In the office, staring at his subordinates who were all looking at him, Li Xiang remained silent for a moment before giving them an out.</p>
<p>'I believe the game still has room for improvement in story and Gameplay setting. To provide players with a better experience, I think we should opt for a delay. After all, no one remembers those garbage games that released on time. Delaying a game is about delivering to players a product that better meets their expectations. It's all for the players!'</p>
<p>Looking at his team, recalling a phrase Chen Xu had said at the gameplay Expo, Li Xiang perfectly copied it.</p>
<p>Honestly, that line worked surprisingly well.</p>
<p>Why delay?</p>
<p>Not out of fear of competitors or poor sales—everything is for the players!</p>
<p>Like Li Xiang, a wave of previously promoted games simultaneously chose to delay their releases.</p>
<p>Of course, a few titles still launched as originally planned.</p>
<p>But none of them were RPG-type games.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>As for the impact Dark Souls had on the industry, Chen Xu wasn't paying much attention.</p>
<p>Right now, he was more focused on the overseas version of Dark Souls.</p>
<p>Although Target Software had acquired publishing rights for many of Nebula Games' titles, their primary focus remained on Dark Souls.</p>
<p>Translations were being done simultaneously in multiple languages, though voice acting was only adapted for English.</p>
<p>With approval materials prepared for various countries and online channels being promoted, Target Software was highly optimistic about Dark Souls' performance overseas.</p>
<p>After successfully passing reviews, Dark Souls' promotional video began airing in multiple countries.</p>
<p>The main promotional methods centered on teaser trailers and actual gameplay footage.</p>
<p>Though the campaign wasn't massive, it was clearly noticeable to domestic game developers.</p>
<p>Soon, news about it spread throughout the industry.</p>
<p>'Heard the news? Dark Souls is going overseas!'</p>
<p>'Really?'</p>
<p>'Just check a few well-known overseas gaming community forums yourself. There are already Dark Souls ads there.'</p>
<p>'Well, it's kind of expected. It's so popular domestically, and it's a fantasy-themed game to begin with.'</p>
<p>'Not surprising. Actually, I think Nebula Games' previous Independent Games wouldn't perform poorly overseas either, especially Valiant Hearts: The Great War, given its setting in that European war.'</p>
<p>'Yeah, it's just that Nebula Games previously focused mainly on the domestic market. But honestly, can Dark Souls really catch on overseas?'</p>
<p>'Who knows if it'll become popular? But I think there's a decent chance. Mainly because the overseas market doesn't seem to have any competitive blockbusters right now.'</p>
<p>On domestic official Weibo and gaming community forums, many players were also discussing.</p>
<p>'Heard they're launching an overseas version of Dark Souls!'</p>
<p>'Overseas version or not, it doesn't really concern us much.'</p>
<p>'I wonder if they'll open overseas servers later. I'd love to invade some foreigners.'</p>
<p>'Damn it, isn't that bullying? But count me in!'</p>
<p>'Oh, come on! Look at your embarrassing playtime—haven't even finished the first playthrough, yet you're dreaming of fighting foreigners? Don't end up getting tormented yourself.'</p>
<p>While domestic players enthusiastically debated,</p>
<p>the promotion by Overseas Target Software was already showing initial results.</p>
<p>Given the limited promotional budget,</p>
<p>large-scale advertising campaigns were clearly challenging.</p>
<p>Thus, Target Software adopted the most common and direct method in the gaming industry:</p>
<p>early media reviews.</p>
<p>In China, Chen Xu hadn't bothered with media previews.</p>
<p>Media and players received the game at the same time.</p>
<p>However, due to Dark Souls' unique game attribute, major domestic media outlets hesitated to give quick judgments.</p>
<p>Some smaller outlets did publish reviews on day one, but they lacked depth entirely—whether praising or criticizing, their takes missed the mark completely. By the time players truly understood Dark Souls, those early reviews were universally ridiculed and deleted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, more authoritative, reputation-conscious major media outlets took their time to fully grasp the game.</p>
<p>By then, most attentive players already understood what the game was about.</p>
<p>Their reviews were essentially just catching up.</p>
<p>Overseas, considering Dark Souls' quality and the need to quickly attract overseas players' attention, media scores were clearly the fastest and most cost-effective method.</p>
<p>The renowned overseas media GameSpot released their score just before Dark Souls' overseas launch.</p>
<p>'This is a fantasy-themed ARPG from a Chinese game company across the Pacific.'</p>
<p>'Before reviewing the game, I want to express my sense of awe. Unique map design, unique Combat System, unique approach to Gameplay—it clearly opens a brand-new path for future ARPGs.'</p>
<p>'We can boldly predict here that Dark Souls' style of Gameplay might become a unique branch in the future of ARPG games.'</p>
<p>'Extremely hardcore, yet delivering pain and joy simultaneously. Death is a constant companion throughout the player's journey.'</p>
<p>'In terms of story, unlike traditional ARPGs that present a gripping, heart-pounding narrative upfront, Dark Souls wraps its joy within layers of suffering.'</p>
<p>'If you wish to savor it fully, you must repeatedly fail, keep fighting, grow stronger, and ultimately surpass yourself. This journey grants an unprecedented sense of achievement and satisfaction. It's a daring experiment—had they failed slightly, they would've shattered completely.'</p>
<p>'But undeniably, they succeeded. This game is damnably attractive. Perfect Level Design and BOSS design—it's not difficult for the sake of difficulty, but rather highly reasonable. Each completed level map feels like solving a puzzle; each victory over a seemingly invincible BOSS makes my blood seem to erupt in excitement.'</p>
<p>'Additionally, the game features numerous NPC side quests, yet provides no clear tutorial. Players must dig deep to uncover them, and might even accidentally kill these NPCs, completely cutting off that storyline in their first playthrough.'</p>
<p>'Furthermore, the game's Art style and map design are mesmerizing. Take the High Wall of Lothric as the starting point—multiple exploration routes guide players to meticulously traverse every corner of the map.'</p>
<p>'Enemy placement and Patrol routes within the map are meticulously designed, such that moving forward or backward along most paths offers players completely different experiences.'</p>
<p>'And the rich selection of weapons further enriches the entire Combat System, eliminating any sense of monotony.'</p>
<p>'Score: 9.5. Review recommendation: If you can accept and endure temporary suffering, Dark Souls is absolutely worth experiencing.'</p>
<p>After GameSpot awarded Dark Souls a high score of 9.5, other well-known overseas media outlets successively released their own high-scoring reviews.</p>
