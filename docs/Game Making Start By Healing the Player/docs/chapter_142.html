                <p>Chapter 141: Are the Trophies Nice to Touch? They're All Mine! (Fourth Update for Subscriptions)</p>
<p>The host took the stage, and unlike before, there weren't as many tedious speech events this time.</p>
<p>There were just some simple introductions, and then Yang Chen, the head of the Modu Game Department, took the stage to announce the list of designers selected for senior job titles this year.</p>
<p>Just as one needs to obtain Game Designer certification to enter the industry, the same applies to senior job titles.</p>
<p>Generally, one needs to have been in the gaming industry for more than five years and have achieved certain accomplishments to qualify.</p>
<p>As for Chen Xu, although his years of experience weren't enough, as the saying goes, if time is short, achievements make up for it.</p>
<p>In two years, he secured first place in the Game Department's Game Design Competition, and his works, such as <em>Fall Guys</em>, <em>Dark Souls</em>, and <em>Outlast</em>, all achieved outstanding results.</p>
<p>Therefore, he was also included in the big list this year.</p>
<p>Along with Chen Xu, fourteen other Game Designers also received the honor.</p>
<p>However, it was clear that Chen Xu was the most eye-catching among them.</p>
<p>As Chen Xu went on stage to express his gratitude and received the certificate from Yang Chen, a round of applause erupted in the venue.</p>
<p>Countless Game Designers below were filled with envy, jealousy, and resentment.</p>
<p>'As expected.'</p>
<p>'To be fair, even though Chen Xu's years of experience are insufficient, if his achievements over the past two years didn't get him in, that would be truly unreasonable.'</p>
<p>'I'm so envious! I've been in the industry for 7 years, and I don't know if my application will pass next year.'</p>
<p>'Don't even think about it, it definitely won't pass.'</p>
<p>'Damn!'</p>
<p>After Chen Xu stepped down, some familiar Game Designers quietly exchanged words.</p>
<p>After returning to his seat, Meng Zuo, who was beside him, also smiled and congratulated him.</p>
<p>Chen Xu smiled back in response.</p>
<p>However, both Chen Xu and Meng Zuo soon fell silent.</p>
<p>Because next was the main event of the evening.</p>
<p>At this moment, all the nominated Game Designers sitting in the front row straightened up, listening intently as the host on stage revealed the answers.</p>
<p>Under everyone's eager anticipation, the first award was soon revealed.</p>
<p>First, the nominations for each award-winning game were announced, and finally, the host on stage, holding a microphone, declared loudly: “I announce that the winner of the Game of the Year for Best Screenplay is—<em>Loulan</em>, developed by designer Ling Hai!”</p>
<p>With the announcement of the winners, all the Game Designers present also gave a warm round of applause.</p>
<p>Chen Xu also applauded with a smile.</p>
<p>As the recipient of the first game award of the night, all the Game Designers did not stint on their applause.</p>
<p>The award winner, Ling Hai, walked onto the stage with great excitement and received the trophy from the awards presenter.</p>
<p>He then delivered his acceptance speech.</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, the audience continued to applaud.</p>
<p>Next was the second game award, the Best Art Direction award, which also went to an Independent Game.</p>
<p>The winner, like the previous one, was very excited and offered various thanks.</p>
<p>Basically, the preceding awards were all relatively minor ones.</p>
<p>Such as Best Art, Best Performance, Best Independent Game, and so on.</p>
<p>These awards were not considered major game awards.</p>
<p>Soon, with these warm-up game awards distributed.</p>
<p>It was time for the truly significant game awards.</p>
<p>The first one up was a category game award.</p>
<p>The award for Best Adventure/Puzzle Game of the Year.</p>
<p>It wasn't unexpected; Chen Xu received his first award of the night.</p>
<p>“I announce that the Best Adventure/Puzzle Game of the Year is—<em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em>, developed by designer Chen Xu!”</p>
<p>Amidst the thunderous applause, Chen Xu took the stage to accept the trophy, then officially thanked the Game Department and all the players for their support.</p>
<p>For Chen Xu, this game award was a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>The awards ceremony continued, with the next category being sports racing games; there were essentially only a few domestic game developers making these types of games, so there were no major surprises.</p>
<p>After that was the Best Action Game award; <em>Dark Souls</em> also received a nomination, but the final award went to <em>Goddess Adventure 3</em>, a game by Platinum Interactive.</p>
<p>This game was considered a long-standing domestic action IP, and Chen Xu himself wasn't too disappointed.</p>
<p>Because he knew that <em>Dark Souls</em> receiving this nomination was mostly just to make up the numbers.</p>
<p>After all, <em>Dark Souls</em> itself isn't an action game; if it had won, it would only mean it stood out because of the competition.</p>
<p>Following that was a rather special award, and one that everyone considered to have no suspense whatsoever.</p>
<p>Unlike before, when the host on stage spoke slowly as if trying to build suspense, this time, they directly and clearly announced the winning game.</p>
<p>“Congratulations to the winner of the Best Casual Game of the Year award—<em>Fall Guys</em>, developed by designer Chen Xu!”</p>
<p>Following the announcement, enthusiastic applause erupted in the venue.</p>
<p>No one showed any surprised expressions.</p>
<p>This was considered the least suspenseful award.</p>
<p>After all, <em>Fall Guys</em>' popularity at the time was incredibly high, truly qualifying it as a phenomenon.</p>
<p>Many Game Designers present couldn't help but sigh with emotion.</p>
<p>'This really is the least suspenseful award!'</p>
<p>'Indeed, this could be called the most phenomenal game of the year; even <em>Dark Souls</em>, developed later by Chen Xu, couldn't compare in terms of popularity.'</p>
<p>'This Chen Xu is simply a monster!'</p>
<p>'This is just the beginning, just wait. There's probably more to come; don't forget <em>Dark Souls</em> hasn't won an award yet.'</p>
<p>'It's crazy, and these awards are all well-deserved too.'</p>
<p>Next were several more major game awards.</p>
<p>By this point, unlike the previous awards for Best Sound Design, Score, and Performance.</p>
<p>The game awards being presented now were all very significant.</p>
<p>They all proved that their games, at least in their respective categories this year, were good enough to be affirmed.</p>
<p>Best Shooting Game, Best Adventure Game, Best Strategy Game...</p>
<p>During this time, Chen Xu also received several awards; <em>Dark Souls</em> won the Best Level Design award, and <em>Overcooked</em> received the Best Cooperative Game award.</p>
<p>Furthermore, compared to previous years, this edition also added a Most Popular Game award, which was chosen by players voting online.</p>
<p>This was also the biggest difference between this year's event and previous years.</p>
<p><em>Dark Souls</em> successfully beat NetDragon's <em>Star God</em> to win this award.</p>
<p>Watching Chen Xu descend from the stage, Meng Zuo, sitting beside him, felt a sensation akin to a myocardial infarction.</p>
<p>It felt as if they were back at the Game Design Competition award ceremony a year ago.</p>
<p>And this was just the beginning.</p>
<p>Again and again, Chen Xu ascended the stage to receive an award.</p>
<p>This time, Chen Xu received the Best Mobile Game award, with the winning game being the mobile version of <em>Sanguosha</em>.</p>
<p>The applause from the audience was already a bit numb, and the host, after announcing the winners, was also a little speechless.</p>
<p>Chen Xu, holding the trophy, as usual, thanked everyone involved in every segment.</p>
<p>At this moment, in the live stream room broadcasting the event, countless viewers flooded the screen with discussions.</p>
<p>'Holy cow, 2333333, which bro counted? How many awards has Chen Xu gotten now?'</p>
<p>'Good heavens, is he here to buy trophies wholesale?'</p>
<p>'Haha, has anyone noticed something? Mr. Chen just seemed to repeat his previous acceptance speech again?'</p>
<p>'Mr. Chen must be suffering inside; after going up so many times, how many unique speeches can he have?'</p>
<p>'Haha, give the camera to Chen Xu, I want to see where he's going to put all these trophies!'</p>
<p>Countless people in the live stream room were flooding the screen with bullet comments.</p>
<p>Likewise, many people were realizing for the first time how awesome this Game Designer, Chen Xu, was.</p>
<p>After all, most players focus on playing games, and they don't really pay much attention to Game Designers or even Game Developers.</p>
<p>Some players didn't even know that <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em> were actually made by the same Game Designer.</p>
<p>However, compared to the online players' curiosity and discussions, Chen Xu was indeed feeling a bit awkward at the moment.</p>
<p>“Ahem, Teacher Meng, could you help me hold some trophies? There are too many, I can't put them all down,” Chen Xu said, returning to his seat and looking slightly embarrassed as he addressed Meng Zuo beside him.</p>
<p>Although the trophies weren't large, there were just so many of them.</p>
<p>A full 6 trophies.</p>
<p>Although the awards varied in significance, the Game Department treated all the trophies equally, with the same shape and size, only differing in the inscriptions on their bases.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there were no staff members present who could hold them, and Chen Xu didn't want to put them on the floor.</p>
<p>So he could only look towards Meng Zuo beside him.</p>
<p>There was no other way; Chen Xu only knew this one designer here.</p>
<p>And from their previous encounters, Chen Xu felt that this Teacher Meng was quite enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, some of the Game Designers sitting next to him quietly turned their heads away.</p>
<p>Too many trophies to put down?</p>
<p>Are you even listening to yourself?!</p>
<p>As for Meng Zuo, who was asked, he finally understood why he had felt flustered earlier.</p>
<p>“I should be outside, not inside,” a sentence suddenly appeared in Meng Zuo's mind for some reason.</p>
<p>But what he said was: “No problem, I'll just bask in Mr. Chen's glory and touch some trophies to experience the feeling.”</p>
<p>Chen Xu: ...</p>
<p>There was nothing wrong with the words, but why did they sound so strange?</p>
<p>But before Chen Xu could ponder it further, he heard the host on stage call out another familiar name.</p>
<p>'Congratulations, the winner of the Best Role-Playing Game of the Year award is—<em>Dark Souls</em>, developed by designer Chen Xu!'</p>
<p>As the words fell, all the Game Designers present turned their gaze towards Chen Xu's position.</p>
<p>At the same time, a camera shot was focused on him.</p>
<p>Instantly, the viewers watching the live stream were amused.</p>
<p>'My god, it's him again!'</p>
<p>'Haha, Chen Xu must be thinking his seat hasn't even warmed up yet, and he has to get up again!'</p>
<p>Ordinary players and Game Designers found it entertaining.</p>
<p>But at this point, many designers started discussing.</p>
<p>'The Best Role-Playing Game award went to <em>Dark Souls</em>?'</p>
<p>'Well-deserved, but still a bit of a pity.'</p>
<p>'Yeah, I thought it would come down to <em>Star God</em> and <em>Sin City</em> in the end.'</p>
<p>Designers in the nomination area discussed animatedly.</p>
<p>One Game Designer in his thirties, wearing glasses, was currently closing his eyes, his hands clasped together as if praying for something.</p>
<p>That was the designer of <em>Sin City</em>.</p>
<p>Meng Zuo, who was also holding a stack of other people's trophies, was energized at this moment.</p>
<p>Chen Xu himself didn't feel much about it.</p>
<p>Accepting the trophy from the host and picking up the microphone in front of him, Chen Xu delivered his acceptance speech.</p>
<p>'Thank you to all the players who supported me, I am very touched.'</p>
<p>'Regarding <em>Dark Souls</em>, there are many differences compared to other ARPGs, but fortunately, the players' feedback has made us very happy.'</p>
<p>'Furthermore, I'd like to share the joy of this award with the employees of Nebula Games; this is an achievement we all accomplished together. I also thank the leaders and judges of the Game Department for their recognition.'</p>
<p>'Finally, I want to solemnly thank all the players once again. It is you who made this possible, and for that, we are deeply honored.'</p>
<p>'In the days to come, I will continue to make even better games.'</p>
<p>'Thank you all!'</p>
<p>Following Chen Xu's final remarks, thunderous applause once again erupted in the venue.</p>
<p>On major live streaming platforms, countless players were also fervently discussing Chen Xu winning the award.</p>
<p>'Haha, at least Chen Xu finally said something new for this major award.'</p>
<p>'Didn't you notice something? A certain producer, who once called himself the Warrior of Love, said a very crucial word: that players' <em>feedback</em> made him very happy!'</p>
<p>'Yeah! <em>Dark Souls</em> is a high-difficulty suffering game, so does this mean Mr. Chen is happy seeing us players suffer?'</p>
<p>'Confirmed, confirmed! Chen Xu is actually this kind of person!'</p>
<p>“However, there's still a bit of regret. It feels like after getting this award, I might miss out on the final Game of the Year, right?”</p>
<p>Countless players online were discussing intensely.</p>
<p>At this moment, Chen Xu also walked down from the stage.</p>
<p>Next up was the last award of the night: Game of the Year.</p>
<p>The nominated Designer from TengHua was intently staring at the main stage's large screen, gripping his knees tightly, clearly very agitated.</p>
<p>Meng Zuo, next to Chen Xu, appeared nonchalant, chatting with others, but his small eyes kept sneaking glances at the stage.</p>
<p>Suddenly, all the lights in the hall dimmed.</p>
<p>On the large screen onstage, snippets of the nominated games appeared.</p>
<p>Each game snippet played with corresponding BGM and prompts.</p>
<p>Magnificent Palaces of the Gods, from prosperity to ruin; countless legendary demons appearing on the earth; grand and beautiful sceneries displayed before players; a youth with mysterious bloodline in the mountains embarking on a journey to find the lost gods — “Star God”</p>
<p>Gang life stained with blood, a bustling nightlife city; as an undercover agent infiltrating the gang, the protagonist struggles in this hellish purgatory, classic game plot scenes of kinship, responsibility, and friendship flashed by like a revolving lantern — “Sin City”</p>
<p>Gundyr the Ash, Farron Undead Legion, Nameless King, Fire Keeper, as well as High Wall of Lothric, Farron Keep, Firelink Shrine – scenes incredibly familiar and full of ‘fond’ memories for players flashed by. Finally, accompanied by the sound of bells, the Ashen One crawled out of the sarcophagus — “Dark Souls”</p>
<p>After all the presentations finished, the lights in the venue came on.</p>
<p>The host loudly announced, and the TengHua Designer excitedly cheered, while Meng Zuo, next to Chen Xu, covered his face with his hands.</p>
<p>The final Game of the Year was awarded to “Sin City”.</p>
<p>From Chen Xu's perspective, this wasn't too surprising.</p>
<p>Because, honestly, in terms of plot depth, “Sin City” was indeed superior to “Star God”.</p>
<p>Technically, “Sin City” was also no worse than “Star God”.</p>
<p>The only thing that surprised Chen Xu was that “Star God” had not won a single award in this event.</p>
<p>“Teacher Meng... try to look on the bright side. ‘Star God’’s market performance is still very good, and players have given it positive feedback.” Chen Xu couldn't help but comfort Meng Zuo, who was still holding his own trophy with a crestfallen look.</p>
<p>After all, Teacher Meng was a good person!</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, Meng Zuo looked at the trophy in Chen Xu's hand, then glanced at the trophy he was holding for Chen Xu. Suddenly, he felt an urge to cry.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>With this, all the awards had been presented, and this reformed Annual Game Awards Event concluded.</p>
<p>Major media outlets also released their reports immediately.</p>
<p>However, the biggest trending topic online was not “Sin City”, which won Game of the Year.</p>
<p>It was Chen Xu and Nebula Games, which had just been established for two years.</p>
<p>After all, winning so many awards at the award ceremony was truly eye-catching. Although, to be honest, the most significant ones were the three category game awards, it was still quite incredible.</p>
<p>Of course, there was another topic that many players discussed: “Star God” had not won a single award.</p>
<p>Based on game popularity and player feedback, “Star God” was quite decent. Before this, no one had expected “Star God” to be the one truly running empty-handed.</p>
<p>Especially in the final live broadcast, the director even gave a shot of Chen Xu and Meng Zuo in the same frame, which created an even stronger contrast.</p>
<p>Many players quickly selected these clips and turned them into memes.</p>
<p>In the picture, Meng Zuo and Chen Xu were holding several trophies for each other, and players added a few lines of text next to them.</p>
<p>[Meng Zuo: It feels so good to hold a trophy!]</p>
<p>[Chen Xu: Is the trophy nice to touch? Remember to give it back later, they're all mine!]</p>
