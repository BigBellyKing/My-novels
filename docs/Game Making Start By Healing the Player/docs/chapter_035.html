                <h1>Chapter 35: Liva's Illness</h1>
<p>Chapter 35: Liva's Illness</p>
<p>The entire game employs a flashback technique.</p>
<p>This is something nearly all players understand.</p>
<p>Carrying their hearts full of confusion, time continues to move forward.</p>
<p>The night before Liva and Johnny got married.</p>
<p>Dressed in formal attire, the two leaned against the lighthouse, chatting under the moonlight.</p>
<p>And on this very night, the lighthouse was given a name—Anya.</p>
<p>Bathed in moonlight, Johnny and Liva climbed to the top of the lighthouse.</p>
<p>Under the glow of the lantern, their silhouettes were cast onto the walls.</p>
<p>Under the silver light, Johnny patiently taught Liva how to dance.</p>
<p>From night until dawn.</p>
<p>A soft, soothing piano melody flowed like a stream, accompanying their dance.</p>
<p>The Atmosphere of the entire game was filled with romance.</p>
<p>The graphics might not be exceptional,</p>
<p>but with the music and Atmosphere working in harmony, this scene felt incredibly romantic and poetic.</p>
<p>"Holy crap, they danced all night long!"</p>
<p>Dong Zhen exclaimed with emotion.</p>
<p>Undeniably, the doubts that had been lingering in his mind were momentarily cast aside.</p>
<p>Because at this very moment, even this Real Man felt something called romance.</p>
<p>Time moved to the next day. In front of the now-named lighthouse—Anya—Liva and Johnny officially became husband and wife.</p>
<p>On the way to the wedding celebration, Liva noticed a small white rabbit that had been run over and killed. Her expression showed sadness, and something peculiar.</p>
<p>But Johnny didn't notice anything unusual.</p>
<p>"So… is this why Liva kept folding origami bunnies later? But what's the connection?" Dong Zhen was puzzled.</p>
<p>Yet he had no clue.</p>
<p>He continued advancing the story.</p>
<p>At the wedding, everyone was joyful, but Dong Zhen caught another detail.</p>
<p>At the ceremony, Johnny's mother used a different name to address Johnny.</p>
<p>Even Johnny's friend Nicolas seemed confused.</p>
<p>Johnny, however, reacted naturally, explaining it was his grandfather's name, and his mother had given him "Joey" as a nickname in honor of him.</p>
<p>"Joey? That name… I definitely smell something fishy here!" Dong Zhen narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p>Time moved forward, bit by bit.</p>
<p>Now arriving at the period before Liva and Johnny's marriage—when they were dating.</p>
<p>At this time, they were visiting a horse ranch.</p>
<p>Riding majestic horses across the field, Liva and Johnny laughed and played.</p>
<p>This was on the doctor's advice—equine therapy might help alleviate Liva's condition.</p>
<p>Like most deeply in-love couples, they shared many intimate moments.</p>
<p>And here, players finally understood what illness Liva suffered from, confirming earlier suspicions.</p>
<p>"Asperger's Syndrome—that's Liva's illness?" Dong Zhen finally learned the name of the illness from the note clues.</p>
<p>But he had never heard of this condition before.</p>
<p>Glancing at the bullet comments, it was clear the live stream room was completely bewildering.</p>
<p>"Patients with this condition exhibit symptoms such as difficulty in social interaction, difficulty in verbal communication, rigid behavioral patterns, and a stubborn insistence on certain special, meaningless routines and rituals."</p>
<p>"Indeed, it matches perfectly."</p>
<p>It suddenly made sense—if she had this condition, then all of Liva's previous strange behaviors could now be fully explained.</p>
<p>Yet while her actions were now understandable, the deeper meanings behind them remained unanswered.</p>
<p>At this moment, Dong Zhen was still filled with curiosity.</p>
<p>Curiosity about Liva and Johnny.</p>
<p>What did the paper bunny represent? What was the true story between Liva and Johnny? Why did Johnny so desperately want to go to the moon?</p>
<p>By this point, nearly two hours had passed.</p>
<p>But why did Johnny want to go to the moon? Why was Liva willing to sacrifice her life just to build that house with a view of Anya? Why did she spend her entire married life folding paper bunnies and asking Johnny questions?</p>
<p>These questions remained completely unexplained.</p>
<p>As the story progressed, it now arrived at Johnny's teenage student years.</p>
<p>During this time, he met Liva.</p>
<p>And Dong Zhen noticed something—specifically, the platypus.</p>
<p>High school Liva always carried that platypus plushie with her.</p>
<p>It seemed the toy held some important significance for her.</p>
<p>And indeed, it became the medium through which Johnny first approached her.</p>
<p>With help from his friend Nicolas, Johnny was pushed toward Liva, who was squatting on the steps reading a book.</p>
<p>'Hello!'</p>
<p>'Uh... hello...'</p>
<p>'Can you hear me?'</p>
<p>Standing before Liva, Johnny appeared awkward.</p>
<p>Then finally, Liva spoke: 'Yes.'</p>
<p>'Then why don't you... never mind... uh, that platypus is really cool.' Johnny scrambled for a conversation topic.</p>
<p>Liva simply put down her book, glanced at the platypus beside her, then returned her gaze to the pages.</p>
<p>'Um... what are you reading?' Johnny tried again.</p>
<p>'A book... a book.'</p>
<p>'About platypuses?'</p>
<p>'No.'</p>
<p>'Oh... well, I think that's cool too.'</p>
<p>Johnny looked extremely awkward. Clearly, he found Liva too cold.</p>
<p>Judging from her behavior, teenage Liva wasn't particularly likable.</p>
<p>One could even say she seemed distant and unapproachable. Even through the screen, viewers could feel just how awkward Johnny must have felt.</p>
<p>How cold the atmosphere must have been.</p>
<p>But through the game's flashback technique, everyone understood—this wasn't the real Liva.</p>
<p>She acted this way only because she had Asperger's Syndrome.</p>
<p>'Lighthouses!' Liva suddenly spoke, interrupting Johnny mid-sentence.</p>
<p>'This country preserves a total of sixteen Tier 2 Fresnel lens lighthouses. Nine are located along the coast, one of which was converted from an ancient kerosene lighthouse.'</p>
<p>'Oh, that's what you're reading? Well, actually... I was wondering, would you like to watch a movie with me?'</p>
<p>'Don't know.'</p>
<p>'It's okay, I can wait for you to think about it.'</p>
<p>'Can't think about it.'</p>
<p>'Why?'</p>
<p>'No date, no time.'</p>
<p>'Um... how about this Saturday at eight? Does that work?'</p>
<p>'Yes.'</p>
<p>This moment made Dong Zhen, who had played this far, feel even more pained—almost heartbroken.</p>
<p>As a normal person, he couldn't possibly fully comprehend what she was going through.</p>
<p>Honestly, he couldn't truly feel how much suffering the in-game Liva must endure.</p>
<p>How agonizing it must be to have thoughts in your heart, yet be unable to express them accurately through words or actions.</p>
