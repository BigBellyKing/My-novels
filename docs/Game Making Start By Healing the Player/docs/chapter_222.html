<p>Chapter 221: It's Absolutely Refreshed My Understanding! (Sixth update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>After two consecutive official Weibo videos, many players had already guessed—this was Nebula Games' special promotional strategy for Minecraft.</p>
<p>Players who had previously built houses in the game were now completely captivated, stirred by the videos of 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' and the 'Forbidden City.' They were so absorbed they could barely eat or sleep.</p>
<p>Their minds raced with endless possibilities, eager to jump into the game world immediately and try it out.</p>
<p>Although many players clearly understood that attempting projects on the scale of 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' or the 'Forbidden City' might be nearly impossible on their own, they still believed simpler projects should be within reach.</p>
<p>In that instant, numerous players who had once built nothing more than matchbox houses completely forgot their past efforts.</p>
<p>All they could think about now were those magnificent Structures.</p>
<p>It was just like playing Dark Souls—after being tormented by Gundyr the Ash, watching veteran players defeat the nameless King without taking any damage suddenly made them believe they could do it too.</p>
<p>They felt as if they had learned something profound. Maybe they still couldn't beat the nameless King, but surely defeating Gundyr the Ash again would be no problem.</p>
<p>This was the psychological state of most players at that moment.</p>
<p>As for the numerous designers in the domestic gaming industry, they too were deeply impressed by Minecraft's promotional campaign.</p>
<p>The recent surge in popularity had clearly taken them by surprise.</p>
<p>"Chen Xu's move is truly awesome! He's made the promotion of Minecraft break new ground!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, never expected this game to be so mind-blowing—'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' and 'Forbidden City'? Absolutely awesome!"</p>
<p>"What's more, everything shown in these videos seems like something players could actually build themselves."</p>
<p>"And this promotion has even gone viral beyond the gaming community."</p>
<p>"Well, it's hard not to—after all, it's positive and uplifting, and the game's pixel style is inherently harmonious. Even though there's fighting monsters, it's presented in a very cartoonish way."</p>
<p>"Still, at the end of the day, it's just a block-building game. It probably won't change much, right?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, no matter how you look at it, it's still a block game."</p>
<p>"Stop the nonsense—check Chen Xu's official Weibo now! Damn it! Minecraft can actually be like this!? I'm completely sold!"</p>
<p>"What's going on?"</p>
<p>Just three days after the 'Forbidden City' video, Chen Xu once again posted a new video on his official Weibo.</p>
<p>Many players were ecstatic. Over the past two days, discussions had swirled about whether another promotional video would appear, and what breathtaking scenes it might showcase.</p>
<p>Speculation ran wild—some suggested the Classical Gardens of Suzhou, others the ruined Old Summer Palace, and even the fantastical Lothric Capital.</p>
<p>And now, at last, a new video had arrived.</p>
<p>Players also began to recognize a pattern: a new video every three days.</p>
<p>Judging by the timeline, was this campaign meant to continue all the way up to the game's official release?</p>
<p>Yet, when players excitedly opened Chen Xu's Weibo and clicked on the video, many were taken aback.</p>
<p>Because this third video was completely different from the previous ones—'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' and 'Forbidden City.'</p>
<p>The video's title was simple: "How to Play 'To Liva' on a Piano in Minecraft."</p>
<p>Seeing the title, many players paused in confusion.</p>
<p>Aren't we building houses? Ancient cities?</p>
<p>Why is it now a piano concert?</p>
<p>But once they entered the game footage, countless players were stunned!</p>
<p>"Damn it! What am I seeing!?"</p>
<p>"Wait, you can do that!?"</p>
<p>"Hold on! Isn't this just a block game?"</p>
<p>"Did they add new content?"</p>
<p>"Don't tell me these sounds are actually from the game and not added in post-production!"</p>
<p>Countless players stared at the screen, dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Previously, even though 'Forbidden City' and 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' had been impressive, players could at least mentally visualize themselves building such things.</p>
<p>But this video?</p>
<p>All players were left speechless.</p>
<p>Inside the video was a massive piano constructed entirely from blocks—88 black and white keys, complete with a piano case, pedals, soundboard, strings, and a hammer action mechanism.</p>
<p>Externally, it was impressive, but compared to the earlier 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' and 'Forbidden City,' it wasn't quite as jaw-dropping.</p>
<p>The crucial difference was that this thing actually worked!</p>
<p>And it produced real sound.</p>
<p>As 'To Liva' began to play, the black and white keys danced rhythmically. The camera slowly panned inside the piano, revealing the dampers moving up and down, and the hammer action mechanism striking the strings.</p>
<p>It wasn't just the players who were stunned.</p>
<p>This time, even game industry designers were left in shock.</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>Isn't this just a block-stacking game?</p>
<p>How did they manage to build a piano!?</p>
<p>And make it produce sound inside the game!?</p>
<p>Many game designers were utterly bewildered.</p>
<p>They had never imagined Minecraft could be used this way.</p>
<p>Especially those players who had already spent five days with the game—they were now filled with doubt, frantically opening the Nebula Games Platform to confirm.</p>
<p>No, there was no mistake!</p>
<p>They had definitely bought the right game!</p>
<p>Then why was their gameplay experience so completely different from the video?</p>
<p>What was the principle behind this!?</p>
<p>However, some hardcore players and veteran players who had delved deeper into the game had begun to grasp the concept.</p>
<p>Was this utilizing Redstone technology within the game?</p>
<p>Many players had previously discovered Redstone in Creative Mode, but few had paid much attention—or understood it fully. They only knew it could be used to create switches.</p>
<p>But now it was clear—its potential was far greater than that!</p>
<p>As for ordinary media outlets, they weren't particularly concerned with what kind of game Minecraft was.</p>
<p>But the fact that a game had recreated 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' and the 'Forbidden City' had already caught the attention of non-gaming media.</p>
<p>Now, with a functional piano built and playing music inside the game, even more gaming media were stunned.</p>
<p>How rare was this!?</p>
<p>Media outlets quickly reposted the video, crafting increasingly sensational headlines.</p>
<p>'A young man, unable to afford a real piano, built one in a video game!'</p>
<p>'Have you seen a pixel-style piano? It turns out…'</p>
<p>Classic marketing accounts, all of them.</p>
<p>Yet, they inadvertently amplified Minecraft's popularity even further.</p>
<p>For gamers who had been closely following the developments, Minecraft had completely refreshed their understanding of what a game could be.</p>
<p>Just watching these videos, they could hardly believe such creations were possible within a game they thought they already knew.</p>
<p>At the same time, many players now felt an even greater sense of anticipation and curiosity for the upcoming videos.</p>
<p>What other astonishing things could this game possibly have in store?</p>
