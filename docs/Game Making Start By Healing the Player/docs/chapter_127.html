                <h2>Chapter 127: Is This Mr. Chen's Love?</h2>
<p>Unlike the uniformly negative complaints online about <em>Dark Souls</em> being too difficult before its release,</p>
<p>in the few days since the game launched, the first wave of players who stayed in the game have completely changed their impression of <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>With these veteran players as pioneers, subsequent players weren’t left looking bewildered.</p>
<p>Even the most basic elements in the game could now be properly explained.</p>
<p>For example, the Crystal Lizard in the Cemetery of Ash: after dying once, many new players could search via the Search Engine and find guides from experienced players, learning that this creature didn’t need to be challenged at all.</p>
<p>Additionally, the in-game messages left on the ground by passionate veterans offered helpful hints, sparing many newcomers from unnecessary suffering.</p>
<p>As for the first Mimic found beneath the attic, the only new players who still got eaten after entering the Dark Souls world generally fell into two categories.</p>
<p>The first category consisted of players who insisted on experiencing the game in its purest form, refusing to consult any guides or analyze level layouts, and completely ignoring the messages left by veteran players.</p>
<p>The second category were those who possessed a mysterious confidence, insisting on testing how strong the Mimic really was—only to learn their lesson the hard way and begin cautiously avoiding them.</p>
<p>After accepting <em>Dark Souls</em>' difficulty setting, player discussions quickly shifted from mere complaints about difficulty to deeper engagement with game content.</p>
<p>Topics such as various strategies, hidden items tucked away in map corners, shortcuts, tactics for defeating bosses and mobs, and whether to prioritize health or other stats during early-game progression</p>
<p>gradually became mainstream discussions among <em>Dark Souls</em> players.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, earlier online hot topics continued to ferment but had begun to cool down.</p>
<p>However, something surprised many players: the topic of instigating Chen Xu to livestream and watch him suffer</p>
<p>actually received a response from Chen Xu himself.</p>
<p>Previously, players had @-mentioned him casually, never really expecting a reply—mostly just joining in the fun.</p>
<p>Now, it turned out to be completely unexpected.</p>
<p>On Chen Xu’s official Weibo account, a post was published, which was then reposted by Nebula Games’ official account.</p>
<p>‘Many players want to see me suffer, but I’ll skip the livestream. If I did stream, I might accidentally spoil key game content too early. <em>Dark Souls</em> is a game worth savoring carefully, so I’ve specially recorded a video walkthrough from the Cemetery of Ash to the High Wall of Lothric, to serve as a reference for新手 players still enduring hardship.’</p>
<p>Below the text was a video link.</p>
<p>Once this message was posted, players following Chen Xu and Nebula Games’ official accounts immediately perked up.</p>
<p>Although it wasn’t a livestream as they’d hoped, a video was still great.</p>
<p>The High Wall of Lothric was already familiar to the earliest players of <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>But the key point was: this was Chen Xu’s own gameplay.</p>
<p>So many players were quite curious.</p>
<p>How exactly would Mr. Chen play? Was this truly an official guide from the producer, meant to assist struggling new players?</p>
<p>Curious players eagerly clicked on the video.</p>
<p>Upon opening, many instinctively checked the duration—about ten minutes, neither too long nor too short.</p>
<p>At the start of the video, viewers quickly recognized the location:</p>
<p>the room opposite the Ice Dog BOSS.</p>
<p>According to normal gameplay, after defeating the Ice Dog, players faced a cliff, requiring a key item to proceed to the next level.</p>
<p>This item could be obtained by speaking with an old woman in the room opposite the Ice Dog.</p>
<p>However, if the old woman was killed, she would drop a basin.</p>
<p>Taking this basin to the statue against the wall in the room would trigger a direct BOSS battle against the Dancer of the Boreal Valley.</p>
<p>The bright red bloodstains on the floor testified to how many clueless players had been brutally slaughtered here.</p>
<p>Players who unknowingly triggered this BOSS fight without intending to attack typically used left-click to initiate dialogue.</p>
<p>Clicking repeatedly, they’d accidentally end the conversation and strike the old woman, leading many to abandon mouse-based dialogue in favor of keyboard controls.</p>
<p>As a result, the Dancer was jokingly referred to by countless educated players as the true second BOSS in <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>(Well… Gundyr the Ash doesn’t count—he was just part of the Trial.)</p>
<p>‘Dancer One-Hit Kill Tutorial!’ The video paused, with bold text appearing in the center.</p>
<p>Instantly, every player was stunned.</p>
<p>“Damn it! One-hit kill tutorial against the Dancer? That’s fierce!”</p>
<p>“Wasn’t this supposed to be a new player tutorial?”</p>
<p>In the video, the character was a Deprived—no customized appearance, no armor, dual-wielding Small Clubs.</p>
<p>Many players watching were puzzled.</p>
<p>According to current online guides from veteran players, the Dancer of the Boreal Valley was clearly a late-game BOSS. Early-game weapons without upgrades dealt embarrassingly low damage.</p>
<p>While it was technically possible to slowly chip away at her health without taking damage, provided no mistakes were made, the difficulty was extremely high.</p>
<p>So what secret strategy could this be!?</p>
<p>The video then cut quickly, skipping the middle cutscene and jumping straight into the Dancer battle.</p>
<p>The next moment, the Dancer, swift as a phantom, appeared beside the character and swung her blade—clearing the health bar instantly.</p>
<p>Well… clearing the Deprived’s health bar.</p>
<p>The first batch of viewers froze, then realized what had happened.</p>
<p>‘Damn it, I took my pants off for this!?’</p>
<p>‘I want to say something, but I can’t… because it perfectly matches the title!’</p>
<p>‘This damn well was a one-hit kill!’</p>
<p>‘So this is the one-hit kill tutorial? No exaggeration, I could do this too!’</p>
<p>‘One-hit kill the Dancer? Easy enough for anyone with hands!’</p>
<p>Bullet comments flooded in visibly.</p>
<p>As players laughed, they also felt a sudden sense of closeness.</p>
<p>After all, how many times had they died exactly like this in the game?</p>
<p>Soon, the amused players were drawn in by the video’s subsequent content.</p>
<p>In the game, a Knight appeared in the Cemetery of Ash.</p>
<p>Currently, there were already many <em>Dark Souls</em> guides online. Among them, the Knight was widely considered the best Class for new players to start with during early-game progression.</p>
<p>Equipped with a shield, sword, and armor by default, the Knight offered greater forgiveness than other classes—though if only fighting Gundyr the Ash,</p>
<p>the Pyromancer, with shorter casting animations, would be a better choice.</p>
<p>But when progressing to the High Wall of Lothric and beyond, the Knight remained more comfortable.</p>
<p>In the video, the Knight pulled the Coiled Sword from Gundyr’s chest and officially entered combat.</p>
<p>Facing Gundyr’s attacks, the Knight in the video raised his shield and tanked a hit. Though his stamina bar dropped significantly, his health remained untouched.</p>
<p>Then, seizing the gap in Gundyr’s attacks, he rolled backward to create distance and slowly recovered stamina.</p>
<p>He took a quick swing, then regardless of Gundyr’s actions or recovery frames, immediately raised his shield again.</p>
<p>The video then switched to fast-forward mode, leaving many viewers stunned.</p>
<p>Because there was practically no complex operation—only one thing to watch: the stamina bar. Never mindlessly hold up the shield.</p>
<p>After the BOSS finished attacking, step forward for a quick hit, then immediately raise the shield again.</p>
<p>Many viewers were shocked.</p>
<p>This was just too cowardly and sneaky!</p>
<p>Most players used the shield mainly for emergencies or Perfect Guard.</p>
<p>But to cower behind the shield the entire time, like in this video? Many had never even tried it.</p>
<p>This was turning real-time combat into Turn-Based!</p>
<p>When Gundyr entered his second phase, the Black Firebomb burial gift came into play.</p>
<p>The player progressed轻松ly to the Firelink Shrine, then onward to the High Wall of Lothric.</p>
<p>When facing the Lothric Knight, many players were eager to see how the video handled it.</p>
<p>After all, this knight possessed a deadly shield bash technique.</p>
<p>But in the video, after attracting the knight’s Aggro, the Undead rolled the moment he exited the room and made a getaway.</p>
<p>Proceeding without major incident to the Ice Dog’s chamber, the strategy mirrored the Gundyr fight:</p>
<p>First phase: target its vitals. Second phase: raise shield, carefully guard against the Ice Dog’s frost breath and Rolling Wheel Attack.</p>
<p>Then, just slowly wear it down.</p>
<p>The entire approach gave off one overwhelming impression: stability.</p>
<p>This left every viewer completely stunned.</p>
<p>Seen this way, the game really did seem quite simple!</p>
<p>No more of that frustrating feeling where your brain understands the moves, but your hands just won’t cooperate.</p>
<p>Just raise your shield, play it safe, and proceed cautiously.</p>
<p>It felt a bit stifling, but it worked!</p>
<p>This video opened a skylight for countless new players.</p>
<p>So the game didn’t necessarily demand mastery of aggressive techniques after all.</p>
<p>You could be a despicable Undead.</p>
<p>Left hand on shield, right hand on sword, all skill points into vitality and durability.</p>
<p>Wear full armor—just make sure you can still roll.</p>
<p>Allocate remaining points as needed, as long as you can wield the shield.</p>
<p>In battle, the shield is your home—never lower it as long as stamina remains.</p>
<p>When facing monsters, suppress the urge to Perfect Guard. Don’t show off recklessly.</p>
<p>Some players who had bought the game but found themselves unable to defeat Gundyr the Ash</p>
<p>felt their spirits rise again after watching this. One by one, they quietly reinstalled the game they’d uninstalled.</p>
<p>Others who hadn’t purchased yet, torn between wanting to play and fearing the difficulty, quietly opened the Nebula Games Platform after watching the video.</p>
<p>Staring at the nearly expired discount coupon in their inventory, the video’s scenes replayed in their minds.</p>
<p>Like the final straw breaking the camel’s back, these players silently clicked the purchase page for <em>Dark Souls</em>, selected checkout, and paid.</p>
<p>Then downloaded, installed, and dove into the world of <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>Starting as a Knight, they carefully hid behind their shields.</p>
<p>Advancing step by step, progressing steadily.</p>
<p>Soon, they discovered—this method really was incredibly effective!</p>
<p>Gundyr the Ash and most monsters in the High Wall of Lothric posed little threat. Any they couldn’t beat, they simply bypassed.</p>
<p>Though extremely cautious, the constant progress and defeated monsters filled them with overwhelming成就感.</p>
<p>For a moment, many players truly experienced the joy <em>Dark Souls</em> could offer.</p>
<p>The entire forum became cheerful and harmonious.</p>
<p>Players grinned widely—behind the high difficulty lay a beginner-friendly routine!</p>
<p>Indeed… Is this Mr. Chen’s love?</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Online, a joyful atmosphere spread.</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games,</p>
<p>during a work break,</p>
<p>a group was also experiencing <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>“Gotta say, this method makes clearing the game way easier! Though it does feel like it’s missing some challenge,” said Ruan Ningxue, sitting at her computer, smiling after defeating a BOSS.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Yang Xin nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>“Missing challenge? You’re overthinking it!”</p>
<p>Hearing them, Chen Xu, who was observing the relevant data nearby, smiled slightly. Qin Yi, standing beside him, perked up his ears.</p>
<p>The Shield-holding playstyle—indeed, it was the most suitable, most brainless routine for new players.</p>
<p>But did they really think holding a shield meant no suffering?</p>
<p>“Do you know why players find Gundyr the Ash and the High Wall of Lothric so easy?” Chen Xu asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“Because the previous generation plants trees so the next can enjoy the shade! Players are already familiar with Gundyr and the monsters in the High Wall. Plus, they have my video as a reference, and the map layout in this area isn’t particularly complex.”</p>
<p>“But when they encounter unfamiliar maps, monsters, and BOSSes later on… hehe…” Chen Xu chuckled meaningfully.</p>
<p>Hearing that ‘hehe,’ everyone shivered.</p>
<p>Especially Qin Yi, who, thinking about the subsequent level designs, monster Numerical Design, and attack patterns, quietly swallowed a mouthful of saliva.</p>
