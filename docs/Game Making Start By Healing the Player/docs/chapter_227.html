                <p>Chapter 226: Ten Million Sales (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>Second day of the Lunar New Year</p>
<p>The sales data for Minecraft has been released.</p>
<p>Thanks to the initial promotional efforts—especially the special videos featuring Along the River During the Qingming Festival, the Forbidden City, and even a piano and a calculator—Minecraft gained massive popularity before its official launch.</p>
<p>Combined with its affordable price and a pre-order period that had already started a month earlier, all these factors led to an explosive sales performance.</p>
<p>Minecraft's 24-hour sales: 3,212,231 copies.</p>
<p>First-day sales: 3.2 million copies.</p>
<p>To say it's unprecedented and will never be surpassed might be a bit exaggerated.</p>
<p>But at the very least, it's the best result in recent years.</p>
<p>Although Minecraft's price is only in the double digits and there was some luck involved, there's no denying the staggering 3.2 million first-day sales.</p>
<p>What stunned many industry designers even more was Minecraft's incredible gameplay and the overwhelmingly positive player reviews.</p>
<p>After the Early Access trial ended during the pre-order phase, Minecraft's player rating stood at 9.0—decent, but not extraordinary.</p>
<p>But now, the rating has climbed to an astonishing 9.8.</p>
<p>An unbelievable figure.</p>
<p>Although Minecraft's strong promotional campaign had already broken through to a broader audience—making even non-gamers aware of the game—and early pre-orders led many game industry designers to expect strong first-day sales,</p>
<p>the moment the 3 million figure was revealed, everyone was truly shocked.</p>
<p>"My god, Chen Xu is just too insane! A pixel-style block-building game selling this well?"</p>
<p>"Forget block-building games—does your block game even look like this?"</p>
<p>"It's mainly because Minecraft's promotion was just too powerful!"</p>
<p>"Yeah! First time I've seen a game pull off such an attention-grabbing marketing strategy."</p>
<p>"It's a textbook example of perfect promotion!"</p>
<p>"Impressive as it is, I feel only Minecraft could pull this off—completely unreplicable."</p>
<p>"Exactly. Minecraft could do this because its game mechanism supports it. Regular games trying to copy this approach simply can't succeed."</p>
<p>Industry designers who had been closely following Minecraft couldn't help but sigh with emotion.</p>
<p>Inside TengHua's Voyage project office,</p>
<p>after receiving the news of Minecraft's sales data, Zhu Yi let out a long breath—part relief, part庆幸.</p>
<p>At first, he genuinely wanted to compete head-on with Minecraft, especially after its trial ended.</p>
<p>But due to Minecraft's subsequent overwhelming promotional momentum, he ultimately held back, choosing to delay his own launch—even if it meant wasting previously prepared promotional resources.</p>
<p>Now, looking back, that decision was truly a brilliant move!</p>
<p>After all, the gaming industry is an incredibly unpredictable field.</p>
<p>No one can say for sure what will happen—a highly anticipated blockbuster might suddenly flop, while an indie title might explode overnight and go global.</p>
<p>Such cases happen nearly every year.</p>
<p>And Chen Xu himself had already achieved astonishing results, creating miracles multiple times.</p>
<p>Combined with Minecraft's sky-high popularity and its breathtaking content demonstrations,</p>
<p>Zhu Yi had remained extremely cautious. Now, it was clear—he had made the right call!</p>
<p>In a month, Minecraft's popularity should have cooled down significantly.</p>
<p>By then, launching Voyage would be much safer.</p>
<p>…………………</p>
<p>The gaming industry's attention to Minecraft clearly differed from that of the players.</p>
<p>For players, diving back into Minecraft and experiencing it further, more and more content was being discovered.</p>
<p>From knowing nothing at first, to learning to use Shelter Stone to build furnaces, mastering how to cook food in furnaces, smelt iron ingots, and craft Armor and weapons.</p>
<p>From merely digging holes to hide, to carving out caves and becoming cavemen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some players discovered that animals in the game could actually be tamed using food.</p>
<p>As time passed, players gradually uncovered the game's endless fun.</p>
<p>Of course, there were also tragic incidents.</p>
<p>For example, dying in the wilderness with a full inventory of materials, only to never find the death spot and lose everything.</p>
<p>Or painstakingly building a cozy, warm house, venturing into the wild for exploration, and then completely losing their way home—still alive, but essentially dead.</p>
<p>To prevent this, many players built towering structures at home as beacons, or placed directional markers along their paths so they could always find their way back.</p>
<p>But even more devastating was when players spent ages building a home, slept through the night, and upon waking up and opening the door in daylight, found a Creeper squatting right at the entrance—before they could react, the blinding flash and hissing sound had already arrived.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, across各大 community platforms and video sites, posts and videos about Minecraft flooded the platforms.</p>
<p>"First-time Minecraft Experience: Basic Tutorial to Understand How to Play!"</p>
<p>"Dig-three-fill-one, cavemen, Using Local Materials—Which of These Have You Done?"</p>
<p>"Step-by-step Guide: How to Build a Duplex Villa!"</p>
<p>"MC Infrastructure Team: Recreate the Great Wall!"</p>
<p>On major video and community websites, related posts gradually progressed from beginner to advanced.</p>
<p>Initially, most content consisted of beginner tutorials—players who understood the basic rules educating newcomers.</p>
<p>But soon, as players became more familiar with the game, a diverse range of content exploded.</p>
<p>There were hilarious parody videos, skill-oriented building videos, and straightforward strategy guides teaching how to survive better in Survival Mode.</p>
<p>On major live-streaming platforms, Minecraft also sparked a huge wave of popularity, with many game streamers casually playing it during downtime.</p>
<p>But even more common were countless players enjoying the game in their own preferred styles.</p>
<p>Some treated it purely as a pixel-style block-building game, opening Creative Mode or joining Peaceful Pure Server to build Structures together with like-minded players.</p>
<p>Others treated it as a Survival Adventure Game, collecting resources in Survival Mode and cautiously exploring the unknown.</p>
<p>Some saw it as a unique multiplayer experience, forming groups in multiplayer mode and developing aggressively.</p>
<p>Still others treated it as a tourism game, marveling at the grand Structures created by Chen Xu and other players.</p>
<p>Of course, online disputes were inevitable—some well-intentioned players opened public servers without protection, only to have their creations maliciously destroyed by others.</p>
<p>There are bad people among any crowd!</p>
<p>But compared to other games, Minecraft had the least hostility of any.</p>
<p>Even its multiplayer mode, which had the highest potential for conflict, remained far more harmonious than other games.</p>
<p>Chen Xu himself didn't pay much attention to this.</p>
<p>Where there are people, there is a community. Let players handle player issues.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>As time passed, third-party organizations soon released Minecraft's subsequent sales data.</p>
<p>First-week sales: 10.12 million copies. Weekly active users: 8.62 million.</p>
<p>Although everyone could clearly feel Minecraft's popularity during this period,</p>
<p>the moment these numbers were revealed, everyone was stunned.</p>
<p>What? Over 10 million copies sold in the first week—and weekly active users actually reached 8.62 million?</p>
<p>What kind of monster is this?</p>
<p>For heavily promoted games, first-day sales often account for the majority—even half—of total sales.</p>
<p>But this rule seemed to fail completely with Minecraft.</p>
<p>Because its sales trend was just too stable.</p>
<p>Inside NetDragon and TengHua's studios—though not together—Meng Zuo and Zhu Yi both stared at Minecraft's data, each momentarily doubting life itself.</p>
<p>Especially Zhu Yi, who had originally planned to launch Voyage one month after Minecraft's release.</p>
<p>He'd already figured out how to promote it with minimal budget.</p>
<p>But now, Minecraft's ever-rising popularity had completely terrified him.</p>
<p>He knew Minecraft's sales would be terrifying—but the ten million first-week sales still left him stunned.</p>
<p>Despite Minecraft's low price, this was only the first week!</p>
<p>And judging by current trends, its popularity showed no signs of cooling down—exceeding even Fall Guys' hype at its peak.</p>
<p>At this rate, wouldn't Minecraft become the best-selling game in history?</p>
<p>And Minecraft's so-called sandbox gameplay was completely different from what the gaming industry had discussed as the core!</p>
<p>In that instant, he felt a flicker of uncertainty.</p>
