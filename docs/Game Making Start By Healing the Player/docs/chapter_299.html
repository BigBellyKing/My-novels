                <p>Chapter 298: Entertaining RPG Maps (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Just like when they first encountered Warcraft, many players were filled with novelty upon entering the RPG maps.</p>
<p>A similar scene unfolded for other players.</p>
<p>As players experienced these maps with different attributes in Warcraft, they quickly discovered their unique enjoyment.</p>
<p>Each map had its own characteristics, but they shared a common feature.</p>
<p>Unlike the RTS gameplay of Warcraft itself, players generally only needed to control a single unit.</p>
<p>Everything else could be completely ignored.</p>
<p>This significantly reduced the game's operational complexity.</p>
<p>Especially players who couldn't fully appreciate the fun of RTS in Warcraft found enjoyment in these diverse RPG maps.</p>
<p>Previously, when playing Warcraft, they generally valued every unit highly. When faced with low-health units, they wouldn't send them to their deaths but would instead preserve them or restore their health with healing potions.</p>
<p>This was because units in Warcraft were truly precious; what died wasn't just a common soldier, but money.</p>
<p>However, in RPG maps, the focus was primarily on the hero's presence, often resulting in a single skill wiping out a large group of common soldiers.</p>
<p>This gave players an indescribable sense of exhilaration.</p>
<p>Before this, Warcraft had given them the impression of a relatively hardcore RTS.</p>
<p>But now, they felt the same sensation as playing a story campaign, and it was even more satisfying.</p>
<p>After all, the story campaign itself also bore the responsibility of introducing players to the basic concepts of Warcraft's RTS gameplay, so it couldn't be completely unrestrained.</p>
<p>But now?</p>
<p>These RPG maps had no such concerns at all.</p>
<p>The exhilarating feeling of cultivation and growth was instantly ignited, making players addicted to these maps.</p>
<p>“Haha, these maps released this time are so interesting!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, I super love the 'Defend the Sword Pass' map, 'Though valiant figures remain, who says the Han has perished!'”</p>
<p>“And that Demon Hunter Chronicles, there are so many craftable equipment pieces! And you can even catch mounts!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but if you don't know how to play at first, it feels quite difficult. If your equipment level doesn't rise, you won't be able to stop the BOSSes later.”</p>
<p>“When playing Defend the Sword Pass, you can do quests, and also farm BOSSes in dungeons. Upgraded equipment is only useful in the early to mid-game; in the late game, you still need equipment dropped by BOSSes.”</p>
<p>“Calamity of the Western World is really fun! And the plot is especially long! My friends and I played for two or three hours and still haven't cleared it!”</p>
<p>“I actually think the 'Monopoly of the World' map is quite interesting; it feels like playing a land-buying board game!”</p>
<p>“Pyramid Escape is the most fun, with all sorts of mini-games.”</p>
<p>“It's just that someone always steals my equipment! Damn it, a bunch of people are fighting the BOSS over there, and the BOSS still has two-thirds of its health, but a whole flock of birds has already arrived.”</p>
<p>“23333333, I can totally picture that scene! And every time attacking monsters come, no one comes back to defend the base, always with the same excuse: 'The BOSS is almost dead!' Damn it, from my perspective, only 10% of its health is gone.”</p>
<p>Online discussions about these RPG maps were also growing.</p>
<p>Moreover, these RPG maps in Warcraft were actually quite suitable for multiplayer gameplay.</p>
<p>This novel mode instantly captivated players, and also encouraged them to invite their friends.</p>
<p>Then, one by one, they were all drawn in by this unique map gameplay.</p>
<p>No player had imagined that Warcraft could contain such content.</p>
<p>You thought it was an RTS-type game, but then a map like this appeared, suddenly telling you:</p>
<p>“Didn't expect that, did you? We can actually be an RPG-type game too!”</p>
<p>And just when you thought that was all, it told you again:</p>
<p>“Actually, it's not just RPGs; it can also be action-adventure and tower defense-like gameplay!”</p>
<p>This unique experience instantly drew players in.</p>
<p>For many RTS-struggling players.</p>
<p>The experience of freeing up their hands, not having to worry about multi-unit control, and only controlling one hero.</p>
<p>It could be said that it made them truly feel the interesting aspects within.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another aspect, the map editor, also garnered attention from many game enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Because judging from the performance of these maps, it seemed they were all created using Warcraft's editor?</p>
<p>“Does this mean we can also create these maps in Warcraft?”</p>
<p>“That sounds a bit interesting!”</p>
<p>“And there are ready-made assets inside!”</p>
<p>After experiencing several RPG game maps, many players developed an interest in the map editor.</p>
<p>Many players also went to study this map editor.</p>
<p>Of course, players who could genuinely create a decent map would be relatively few.</p>
<p>Because even though Chen Xu had optimized the map editor considerably, trying to make it idiot-proof, it still required some learning curve.</p>
<p>Moreover, a truly interesting map wasn't something that could be created so simply.</p>
<p>It still required a basic understanding of games, relevant data theory, and player feedback to create a relatively interesting map.</p>
<p>But for Chen Xu, generating player interest through RPG maps was already enough.</p>
<p>And some players had already released some simple maps.</p>
<p>However, they were quite rudimentary, belonging to the heavily modded type of RTS Versus map.</p>
<p>In these maps, the population cap setting was removed, and all unit types were thrown into a single building.</p>
<p>The speed of unit production and resource gathering in the game were both significantly increased.</p>
<p>This allowed players to mass produce units and then decide who's superior.</p>
<p>In terms of balance, it was naturally poor, but in terms of entertainment, it gave players something to strive for.</p>
<p>And this was a very good omen.</p>
<p>Just like Minecraft's MOD community, how many ordinary players could build massive and magnificent structures, and all sorts of Redstone mechanisms?</p>
<p>Most players were still the type who built matchbox houses, and whose Redstone technology at most involved copying a minecart and an automatic chicken farm.</p>
<p>Further down the line, with the operation of the player community, the popularity of Warcraft would naturally continue to rise.</p>
<p>Of course, Chen Xu would still provide some catalysts in the early stages.</p>
<p>For example, releasing official tutorials for the game editor to help more players understand how to use the tool.</p>
<p>As well as the operation and maintenance of related communities.</p>
<p>As the popularity of RPG maps in Warcraft gradually increased.</p>
<p>Even Warcraft's sales saw a slight increase.</p>
<p>A large number of previously lapsed players also returned, and concurrent players even reached new highs.</p>
<p>This greatly surprised the major game developers and designers who had been following Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Especially the effect of Warcraft's map editor and the gameplay of its RPG maps astonished other game designers in the industry.</p>
<p>“It can actually be like this!”</p>
<p>Just like the players, game designers who had deeply investigated it were equally stunned.</p>
<p>RTS-type game development designers, in particular, felt bewildered.</p>
<p>“Didn't we agree it was just pure RTS gameplay?”</p>
<p>Although your game graphics were a bit more refined, the plot more excellent, the gameplay balance more perfect, and the concepts more outstanding, everyone was still making RTS games.</p>
<p>“But what the heck is this editor?”</p>
<p>“Experiencing RPG, tower defense, and casual games within an RTS?”</p>
