                <p>Chapter 12: Mirror (Game)'s Sales</p>
<p>Compared to Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin's conversation, Chen Xu had been continuously observing the performance of Mirror (Game).</p>
<p>In fact, quite a number of people had already noticed the game, Mirror (Game).</p>
<p>Despite being launched on an overseas platform, and being a rather unique game.</p>
<p>Its sales figures were undeniable. While the official platform wouldn't release exact sales numbers, for Game Designers and industry media, it was generally possible to estimate sales based on various data points.</p>
<p>Although there might be some discrepancies, they wouldn't be too far off.</p>
<p>And while Mirror (Game) didn't top any sales charts, it did achieve an incredible feat by dominating the Positive Reviews list, taking first place.</p>
<p>A game with an 18R Rating suddenly climbed to the top of the positive reviews chart.</p>
<p>It's fair to say this genuinely surprised many Game Designers.</p>
<p>Many also wanted to see just how magical this game truly was.</p>
<p>Especially in the game's comment section.</p>
<p>Many noticed that player comments were fundamentally different from those of traditional Gentleman's Games, even leaving them a little baffled.</p>
<p>'An excellent Match-3 game!'</p>
<p>'Women, get lost! Don't get in the way of my Match-3 game!'</p>
<p>'I can't tell if this is a Match-3 game or a Galgame, but one thing is for sure: my little brother is very satisfied.'</p>
<p>'I used to think this was just a regular Gentleman's Game, but I have to say I'm shocked. This isn't some crudely made Gentleman's Game; it's a quality Independent Game!'</p>
<p>'As a Professional Troll, I can only find one thing to criticize: why in the hell is a Gentleman's Game so touching and so exquisitely made?!'</p>
<p>'Ten minutes have passed, and I've entered Sage Mode, so this game should be closed, but why am I still playing this game non-stop?! This Match-3 is quite interesting!'</p>
<p>'In this game, I saw the good, bad, and ugly sides of human nature. Truly a unique game!'</p>
<p>'When a Gentleman's Game moves me, does it matter if I 'go for it' or not?'</p>
<p>'I opened this game with excitement and thrill, but when I left, I wasn't relieved; I felt a sense of melancholy.'</p>
<p>These comments left many confused, wondering if they had opened the wrong game.</p>
<p>Of course, besides many players giving positive reviews, there were also some who, after pulling up their pants, spoke with great conviction.</p>
<p>Unlike the beginning, when two hundred thousand Yuan was spent on advertorials in forums frequented by gentlemen overseas, now it relied solely on word-of-mouth among gentlemen.</p>
<p>So, for Chen Xu, all he had to do was wait to collect the money.</p>
<p>“Hmm, the first batch of funds is in. Next, I’ll first change the workspace, then register a company.”</p>
<p>“Also, I need to plan out the future development path and, while I’m at it, accumulate more Emotion Points.”</p>
<p>Inside the Rental House, Chen Xu leaned on his bed, making his next plans.</p>
<p>He had noticed that the Emotion Points had grown.</p>
<p>Although there was an increase, it was still relatively limited, just enough for two single draws.</p>
<p>As Chen Xu was thinking, his phone on the side rang. He picked it up and saw it was Ruan Ningxue calling.</p>
<p>“Hello, Senior Sister Ruan, is there anything?” Chen Xu answered.</p>
<p>“Nothing, just wanted to congratulate you. Before, I thought…” Ruan Ningxue on the other end of the phone sounded a bit embarrassed.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu probably knew what Ruan Ningxue wanted to say, so he smiled: “It’s alright, Senior Sister, it’s quite normal. Actually, even I’m a bit surprised by Mirror (Game)’s sales.”</p>
<p>This statement was half-true, half-false. The false part was that Mirror (Game)'s success was entirely within Chen Xu’s expectations.</p>
<p>Whether it was the quality of the game itself, or the subsequent promotional plan, and even the decision to make Mirror (Game) the first game, all were meticulously planned by Chen Xu after prior research, not just a spur-of-the-moment decision.</p>
<p>As for the truth, Mirror (Game)'s popularity had indeed exceeded Chen Xu's imagination.</p>
<p>Although it launched on the Official Overseas Version platform, that was just a name. In reality, the main audience was still domestic players.</p>
<p>But even so, Mirror (Game)'s sales performance still surprised Chen Xu.</p>
<p>At the same time, this reminded Chen Xu of one thing: the gaming industry in this world had a market prosperity far greater than in his previous life.</p>
<p>“By the way, Chen Xu, are you free tonight? Consider it a celebration dinner for you. Also, I have a friend who wants to meet you.” Ruan Ningxue asked over the phone.</p>
<p>“No problem. In fact, I also wanted to treat you to a meal, Senior Sister. After all, if it weren’t for your help earlier, Mirror (Game)’s development wouldn’t have been so easy,” Chen Xu said sincerely.</p>
<p>The two then chatted casually for a bit before hanging up.</p>
<p>Putting his phone aside, Chen Xu checked Mirror (Game)'s sales data in the backend again.</p>
<p>Cumulative sales over 6 days: 58,121 copies.</p>
<p>The growth curve was absolutely explosive, clearly demonstrating the extraordinary combat power of gentlemen.</p>
<p>And given Mirror (Game)'s current potential, this was just the beginning.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that some third-party platforms had only just started listing it.</p>
<p>While Chen Xu was basking in the pleasing data of Mirror (Game),</p>
<p>The Independent Game community was far from calm.</p>
<p>Media outlets that had noticed the game quickly began compiling related data.</p>
<p>After all, for an 18R game to climb onto the Positive Reviews list was truly astonishing.</p>
<p>At the same time, discussions about Mirror (Game) quickly began to ferment.</p>
<p>Related sales data was difficult for ordinary players to compile.</p>
<p>Initially, concerned media and some industry professionals might have estimated one or two tens of thousands.</p>
<p>But with the release of data from third-party statistical agencies, those who followed the game were utterly dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Because the data provided by the third-party agency showed 50,000.</p>
<p>Compared to the actual sales, it was actually eight thousand lower, but even so, this figure still stunned many Game Designers.</p>
<p>Especially some Game Designers who also worked on Gentleman's Games felt their worldview had been completely颠覆了.</p>
<p>A Gentleman's Game selling so many copies? Are you kidding me?!</p>
<p>Was this number high?</p>
<p>No, it wasn't. Top-tier blockbusters could sell millions on their launch day, and some globally renowned overseas blockbusters could even reach tens of millions in first-day sales.</p>
<p>Of course, these games couldn't be compared to Mirror (Game).</p>
<p>As an 18R game with no recommendations, and an Independent Producer's game – no, it should be said, a game made by someone who wasn't even a Game Designer.</p>
<p>This data was absolutely phenomenal!</p>
<p>It had even broken the record for Gentleman's Games.</p>
<p>If not unprecedented, it was at least a first. Before this, no Gentleman's Game had achieved such explosive results as Mirror (Game).</p>
<p>And this was just the beginning.</p>
<p>Many designers of Gentleman's Games had a premonition that they were about to witness history!</p>
<p>No matter how significant this history was, no matter that Mirror (Game) was a Gentleman's Game, it was still history.</p>
