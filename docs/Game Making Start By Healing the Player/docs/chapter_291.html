                <p>Chapter 290: Can It Be Done Like This!? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>"Ah! What's going on?"</p>
<p>"Shu Ben lost again? Is Mr. Chen really this powerful?"</p>
<p>On the main commentary stage, Huang Donglai was completely bewildered—this was totally beyond his expectations!</p>
<p>Beside him, Sun Yixie was quietly chuckling. Seeing his good brother's stunned expression, he put on a comforting face but subtly added fuel to the fire with his words.</p>
<p>"Ah come on, Brother Huang, it's totally normal to make wrong predictions before a match."</p>
<p>"Besides, Mr. Chen really does have some skill. Who could've predicted that Night Elf would go for mining harassment like that? And Brother Huang, you're not a professional player after all, so misjudging the situation is completely understandable," Sun Yixie said with a smile.</p>
<p>"No, no, Brother Sun, I still think my analysis is correct. Of course, Mr. Chen is impressive—I admit that—but I still hold my original view. Haven't you noticed? Mr. Chen's operational skill is still slightly below that of professional players."</p>
<p>"Of course, Mr. Chen is just a Game Designer. And honestly, the tactical performance of that Night Elf just now must have shocked everyone, including all players and pro gamers. From now on, these pro gamers definitely won't underestimate Mr. Chen anymore."</p>
<p>"But under such circumstances, Mr. Chen's skill level will inevitably suffer a big loss." As a professional commentator and streamer, Huang Donglai calmly laid out his analysis.</p>
<p>Of course, he didn't forget to remind the viewers watching the livestream once again what today's event was truly about.</p>
<p>"So, Brother Huang, you really think Mr. Chen is going to lose this match?" Sun Yixie subtly poured more oil on the fire.</p>
<p>"Ah, it's not that I 'think' he'll lose—it's certain! Shu Ben's loss earlier must've been an exception. I admit Mr. Chen is strong, but against fully focused pro gamers, I believe Mr. Chen will suffer a serious setback. That said, it's no big deal—he'll still earn respect in defeat. As a Game Designer, Mr. Chen has already done everything he possibly could."</p>
<p>"Next, he's facing none other than Lü Bu—Lü Fengxian! And after Shu Ben already lost, Satellite will definitely be cautious and ready for battle. How on earth can Mr. Chen win under these conditions?" Huang Donglai emphasized that a professional commentator should have professional integrity.</p>
<p>He trusted what his eyes told him. In the previous match between Chen Xu and Shu Ben, he could clearly see that although Chen Xu's skill was indeed impressive, there was still a slight gap when compared to top-tier pro gamers.</p>
<p>Thus, as a professional commentator, he bravely voiced his honest opinion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the game had officially begun.</p>
<p>The map selected was NI—Northrend Islands.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous map, this one had one major difference:</p>
<p>Players' spawn points were fixed diagonally opposite, with the neutral tavern located in the center.</p>
<p>Each player had only one expansion base adjacent to their main base.</p>
<p>Satellite, playing as the Orcs, let out a quiet sigh of relief upon seeing this map.</p>
<p>On this map, he was confident that if Chen Xu tried that same mining harassment tactic again, he'd be utterly destroyed!</p>
<p>The only potential variable was that the opponent was playing Human race.</p>
<p>Still, Satellite chose a single burrow to execute a default Orc opening.</p>
<p>"Same single burrow fast tech as before, starting with Blademaster—same as last time. But notice how Satellite positioned his burrow: it's in a very tricky spot, placed behind and close to the gold mine."</p>
<p>"Why place it there? Because this map has a tavern. This positioning prevents the opponent from rushing out a Beastmaster to harass. Now, the fourth Peon has come out, and Satellite immediately sends it to scout."</p>
<p>"Satellite has everything calculated!" The audience's attention was focused on Satellite, and Huang Donglai was analyzing the current situation.</p>
<p>But soon, the camera angle switching shifted to Chen Xu's side—and just like most regular players, even the commentators were a bit lost.</p>
<p>"Hmm! Mr. Chen's build order starts with Barracks, then Farm, then Altar of Storms. The opening Footman heads straight to the tavern to scout—that's the default Footman plus neutral hero opening. Is he planning to summon a neutral hero, maybe Beastmaster?"</p>
<p>"Wait! What's this? Lumber Mill is built, and six Peasants immediately transform into Militia and march straight toward Satellite's base. He summoned the neutral hero Firelord! What on earth is going on!?"</p>
<p>The commentators were utterly stunned.</p>
<p>Satellite, inside the game, was equally bewildered.</p>
<p>He had gone with a default opening. After his fourth Peon, first Grunt, and Blademaster came out, he completed scouting in the mid-lane and spotted a Human Footman near the tavern—seeming like a standard opening: Barracks first, then neutral hero. But to his surprise, the opponent had chosen Firelord as the hero. That confused him.</p>
<p>Wasn't Arch-Mage better?</p>
<p>But then, when he saw the second Footman and a swarm of Militia charging in, he was even more baffled.</p>
<p>As a professional player, he had studied all the game data. In that instant, he realized why the opponent didn't pick Arch-Mage but went for Firelord instead.</p>
<p>At level one, Firelord was stronger than Arch-Mage. Plus, the Infernal had a split ability—once it split, if not dealt with quickly, Combat Prowess would instantly double.</p>
<p>Also, starting with a neutral hero saved time, allowing an extra Footman to be produced earlier.</p>
<p>But seriously—just one hero, two Footmen, and six Militia to attempt an all-in rush against him?</p>
<p>Are you kidding me!?</p>
<p>Militia aren't permanent!</p>
<p>Thinking this, Satellite immediately ordered his Blademaster to activate Wind Walk and dashed forward, slashing the Firelord.</p>
<p>In the early game—especially at level one—almost no hero could stand up to a Blademaster.</p>
<p>Satellite's plan was to draw the Militia's attention and buy some time.</p>
<p>But the next moment, Satellite froze in shock.</p>
<p>Because Chen Xu simply moved the Firelord slightly aside—but still heading toward his base. With that tiny repositioning, the Blademaster landed two more hits, reducing the Firelord to three-quarters health.</p>
<p>The bullet comments exploded in surprise.</p>
<p>'What's happening? Is Mr. Chen going for an all-in push?'</p>
<p>'How can he possibly pull off an all-in? This is too far-fetched!'</p>
<p>'Yeah, how can Firelord beat Blademaster early game? Sure, there are Militia, but they'll only last another twenty seconds. After that, won't they just become free snacks for the Blademaster?'</p>
<p>Inside the game, Chen Xu was smiling broadly.</p>
<p>Especially when he reached the Orc base and saw that burrow positioned so far back—he grinned even wider.</p>
<p>Right next to the Orc Barracks, 800 yards away from the burrow (the burrow's attack range is 700 yards), six Peasants immediately began constructing a Guard Tower.</p>
<p>This was a signature trait of the Human race: by spending wood and gold coins, multiple Peasants could simultaneously build a structure.</p>
<p>As soon as one Guard Tower was completed, without hesitation, it was upgraded to an Arcane Tower.</p>
<p>Shortly after, the second Guard Tower was also finished.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back at base, the Lumber Mill was complete—immediately upgraded to an Arrow Tower.</p>
<p>At this point, both players, commentators, and even Satellite in-game finally understood what was happening.</p>
<p>Building defensive towers right inside the enemy base?</p>
<p>Can it really be done like this!?</p>
