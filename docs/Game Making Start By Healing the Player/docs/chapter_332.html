<p>Chapter 331: Unbelievably Satisfying (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>The <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> series always uses multi-threaded narration to showcase its story.</p>
<p>Only at the very end do the storylines converge back into a single faction.</p>
<p>So after rescuing Nikolai, the player's faction switches over to the American military storyline.</p>
<p>From SAS to a Marine: Paul Jackson.</p>
<p>"Judging by the timeline, this seems to happen the day after Price, Soap, and the others rescued Nikolai!" Inside the gaming pod, Song Ren sighed with emotion as he watched the unfolding story.</p>
<p>And unlike before, this time the scale was much larger.</p>
<p>Above the coast, over a dozen Cobra attack helicopters flew toward their target, carrying fully armed team members.</p>
<p>Their mission was clear: capture Al-Asad.</p>
<p>Before the game started, a Replay system had shown a brief video.</p>
<p>The footage revealed Al-Asad capturing a Middle Eastern leader and executing a coup.</p>
<p>'Approaching target in ten seconds.'</p>
<p>'Received...'</p>
<p>With this brief exchange, the attack helicopters quickly arrived above the target zone.</p>
<p>This was the first urban scene in the game.</p>
<p>But clearly, it was set in a war-torn, economically devastated realm.</p>
<p>Yet this only heightened Song Ren's anticipation.</p>
<p>True to the game’s title: <em>Contemporary Era Warfare</em>.</p>
<p>This level clearly had vastly larger scenes!</p>
<p>Over the radio came Lieutenant Vasquez's orders. Song Ren charged ahead toward the target building without hesitation.</p>
<p>He used explosives to breach the door. Without waiting for his teammates, he rushed in—eager to start the "Bang Bang Bang".</p>
<p>Breaching the door, descending into the underground stairwell.</p>
<p>The moment he reached the doorway, the screen shifted from red to gray. A famous quote then appeared on the screen:</p>
<p>[Teamwork is crucial—it ensures someone else takes the bullet for you. —Unknown]</p>
<p>What the hell?!</p>
<p>Where’s my health bar?!</p>
<p>Am I playing <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, or <em>Dark Souls: Monster Hunter</em>?!</p>
<p>At first confused, Song Ren suddenly remembered.</p>
<p>The difficulty!</p>
<p>Damn it, I changed the difficulty!</p>
<p>This isn’t normal difficulty anymore—it’s veteran difficulty!</p>
<p>But just bumping up two difficulty levels? Isn’t that going too far?!</p>
<p>One encounter and I’m already down?</p>
<p>Chen Xu was completely stunned.</p>
<p>Old Zhang had joked about entrusting your life to teammates.</p>
<p>So this is what he meant—let your teammates scout first, while you follow behind?</p>
<p>And "learning knowledge" means reading these quotes after dying?</p>
<p>Song Ren felt utterly broken.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zhang Yi experienced a completely different kind of satisfaction.</p>
<p>After switching from veteran to normal difficulty, he felt far more immersed in the game.</p>
<p>Though the heart-pounding tension was gone, the experience was unbelievably satisfying.</p>
<p>Equipped with night vision goggles, he entered the building, but enemy fire forced him back outside to clear the streets.</p>
<p>Now, modern weapons finally made their appearance. The M1A2 main battle tank arrived as support, though enemy tanks blocked its ability to provide fire cover.</p>
<p>This required using the Javelin anti-tank weapon to destroy enemy tanks first, then take out the elevated machine gun nest.</p>
<p>The situation instantly became intense.</p>
<p>"Awesome!"</p>
<p>After controlling Paul Jackson to eliminate the attacking enemies and coordinating with the M1A2 tank and squad to evacuate successfully, Zhang Yi’s character switched back to Soap, now with the SAS team.</p>
<p>At this point, Soap and his team had already rescued Nikolai and were flying away in an attack helicopter.</p>
<p>But mid-flight, they came under enemy attack—struck mid-air by the classic RPG move, crashing down instantly.</p>
<p>The first team member died—Boris, along with two unnamed pilots.</p>
<p>What followed was an intense escape sequence. When enemy attack helicopters pursued them, they used Stinger missiles to shoot them down.</p>
<p>Finally, under the cover of their own AC-130 gunship, they managed to evacuate.</p>
<p>In this level, Chen Xu had also made some improvements.</p>
<p>In the first half, players controlled Soap and Captain Price during their escape.</p>
<p>In the second half, players took on the role of the AC-130 gunner, helping Soap’s team by bombing enemy positions.</p>
<p>It was no longer like the previous life, where you simply watched a monitor passively. Now, the visuals were far more immersive and震撼ing.</p>
<p>With each explosion, buildings on the ground collapsed instantly.</p>
<p>Kill confirmations and Special Effects lit up the screen, and Zhang Yi felt utterly exhilarated.</p>
<p>And this was just the appetizer.</p>
<p>After successfully helping the SAS team evacuate,</p>
<p>the next segment returned Zhang Yi’s perspective to Paul Jackson.</p>
<p>One storyline followed the SAS, the other the Marines.</p>
<p>Two parallel timelines, advancing simultaneously.</p>
<p>Still riding the high from the bombing run, Zhang Yi, now controlling Paul Jackson, boarded a Gyrocopter and unleashed a barrage of cannon fire on enemy tanks and troops from above the city.</p>
<p>The entire city lay in ruins. Smoke and dust from constant bombardment filled the air, turning the sky a hazy gray at dusk.</p>
<p>Bullets and shells, explosions erupting continuously on the highway overpass.</p>
<p>A half-built skyscraper and its construction crane collapsed in a thunderous explosion.</p>
<p>Finally, after all the smaller-scale missions, Zhang Yi was now experiencing truly epic-scale battles.</p>
<p>He mowed down enemy forces with the machine gun as fighter jets crashed and exploded.</p>
<p>Buildings crumbled, sending massive plumes of dust into the sky.</p>
<p>The scene was nothing short of震撼ing.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi shouted and screamed, his adrenaline surging.</p>
<p>It was too intense. Too thrilling.</p>
<p>A massive convoy of armored vehicles poured into the city.</p>
<p>From the skies, soldiers fast roped down from attack helicopters into the urban battlefield.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of troops launched coordinated assaults across multiple zones.</p>
<p>It was similar to previous levels, but the scale here was vastly grander.</p>
<p>Descending from the helicopter, fighting through to the besieged friendly position, rescuing them, and retreating back to the extraction point.</p>
<p>Even on normal difficulty, the hail of bullets, enemy RPGs, and grenades caused Zhang Yi’s screen to flash red repeatedly.</p>
<p>But fortunately, it wasn’t veteran difficulty—these hits weren’t enough to make him "learn a quote" just yet.</p>
<p>Then, a catastrophic message came in.</p>
<p>There was a strong possibility that a nuclear weapon was hidden somewhere in the city.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the intel, the Marines immediately began evacuating. Countless helicopters turned back, and soldiers scrambled to armored vehicles for extraction.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, controlling Paul Jackson, carried his recently rescued comrade aboard a helicopter and began the rapid retreat.</p>
<p>But Zhang Yi shivered.</p>
<p>Having seen the promotional trailer, he already had a wild guess about what would happen next.</p>
<p>If the previous level made players feel "blood-pumping excitement,"</p>
<p>then this upcoming level would teach them the true meaning of震撼—not just visually, but deep in their souls.</p>
