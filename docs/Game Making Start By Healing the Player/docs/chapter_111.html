                <p>Chapter 111 The Grand Promise is Finally Being Delivered</p>
<p>“This combat mode feels a bit like a knight’s duel!”</p>
<p>“The moves aren’t flashy at all, very simple and straightforward!”</p>
<p>“But the battles against massive BOSSes are quite thrilling.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that Ash Judgment Gundyr looks really formidable.”</p>
<p>“But does the game’s difficulty feel off? Or did they just wear too good equipment during the demo? The BOSS battle seemed too short.”</p>
<p>“Exactly, it felt unsatisfying! Even though massacring the BOSS felt amazing, taking half its health in just half a minute is too fast.”</p>
<p>“It’s just a game demo. When players actually play, the progression based on equipment and level will definitely be different. Right now, it should mainly be showcasing the Combat System.”</p>
<p>“That’s true. The Combat System seems pretty good; at least to me, it looks fine.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, when the official version launches, the difficulty will definitely increase a bit. At the very least, we can play the highest difficulty mode, right?”</p>
<p>“I, for one, hope the game has some challenge. A short playthrough always feels unsatisfying.”</p>
<p>“You’re right!”</p>
<p>Many players were exchanging their opinions in the live stream room via bullet comments.</p>
<p>Their discussions mainly focused on the BOSS battle progression and the visual presentation.</p>
<p>After the video finished playing, Chen Xu selected some highly-liked questions from the bullet comments to answer, and also introduced <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>“I believe everyone has seen the actual gameplay demonstration of <em>Dark Souls</em>. What we can tell players now is that this will be a level-driven game.”</p>
<p>“Additionally, I’ve noticed players asking if the BOSS progression is too short and if the game’s difficulty curve is too simple.”</p>
<p>“This concerns the core Gameplay, which is what makes <em>Dark Souls</em> different from other ARPGs. I can only reveal that <em>Dark Souls</em> will be a rather special game. As for the length of BOSS battles, that depends on the player; whether you defeat it quickly or slowly is up to you.”</p>
<p>“I also noticed some players questioning if this is a Hack-and-Slash Game. I can only say that this game <em>can</em> be played like a Hack-and-Slash, but it still depends on the player’s skill.”</p>
<p>“In reality, for some players, <em>Dark Souls</em> will still be quite challenging.”</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu’s words, the audience watching the live broadcast all sent bullet comments.</p>
<p>The popularity of the live stream room was also steadily rising.</p>
<p>Although most players, recovering from Chen Xu’s answers, felt like they had heard something but understood nothing, the atmosphere was certainly electric.</p>
<p>The online game press conference was still underway.</p>
<p>After a brief demonstration of the Combat System content.</p>
<p>Chen Xu also displayed many in-game scenes to all the players on the big screen.</p>
<p>From the initial Firelink Shrine, players traversed through it to the High Wall of Lothric, and further to the Catacombs, Deep Cathedral, Irithyll of the Boreal Valley, Farron Keep…</p>
<p>These scenes, transitioning from close-ups to distant views, allowed players to fully appreciate the details within, and the grand, magnificent presentation when zoomed out left everyone present in awe.</p>
<p>Because these visuals were clearly not the Concept Design Art or similar images Chen Xu had previously released on the official Weibo account.</p>
<p>They were actual in-game scenes.</p>
<p>This astonished not only players but also industry designers who had been following the game.</p>
<p>In a designer chat group, a crowd of people was also discussing <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>“Chen Xu’s <em>Dark Souls</em> art style is exceptional!”</p>
<p>“Indeed, it can absolutely be called top-tier.”</p>
<p>“But judging by so many scenes, <em>Dark Souls</em> shouldn’t be a small-scale game. I’m actually a bit doubtful.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, is Chen Xu going this big for his first ARPG? So many scenes would definitely be a significant challenge.”</p>
<p>“There are already seven or eight game scenes, aren’t there?!”</p>
<p>“I wonder how long the entire game will be!”</p>
<p>“As long as the story and Gameplay aren’t a major hindrance or heavily criticized by players, <em>Dark Souls</em> can be considered half a success.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, the game’s environmental art design is truly fantastic.”</p>
<p>“Especially the Irithyll of the Boreal Valley scene, it’s absolutely stunning.”</p>
<p>This was the sentiment among Game Designers in the industry, and players were even more excited, filling the official live stream room with exclamation marks.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, simply from the actual combat performance and the game’s art environments, <em>Dark Souls</em> was already half a success.</p>
<p>As for whether it can become an excellent game, that depends on its subsequent performance.</p>
<p>After all, a game isn’t judged solely on one aspect; one must evaluate the game as a whole, its game content’s depth, and its deeper expressions.</p>
<p>If a game, despite utilizing top-tier industry technology to push visual effects to the extreme, falls short in its game content—for example, a weak story—it will still struggle to gain player approval.</p>
<p>For instance, even if a certain game’s visuals and other aspects are first-rate.</p>
<p>But as a story-driven game, if the plot first has players control the protagonist and watch their loved ones get their heads blown off, then go through a drama of revenge, retirement, and then returning for revenge, only to realize at the successful end of their revenge that endless vengeance never resolves anything – can such a game be called a masterpiece?</p>
<p>Clearly, most players have a very clear judgment in their minds.</p>
<p>So for Dark Souls, it currently only possesses its minimum baseline.</p>
<p>As for whether the game can become an excellent work and to what extent, that still depends on its story and Gameplay content.</p>
<p>At the end of the press conference live stream, under the expectant gaze of countless players in front of their computers, Chen Xu officially announced the game’s release date.</p>
<p>“<em>Dark Souls</em> will officially launch on October 1st, priced at 268 Yuan!”</p>
<p>Of course, this was the public price, but as the first blockbuster on the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>It was both a flagship title and a traffic-driving product.</p>
<p>Considering Sales Volume, Chen Xu did not choose an exclusive strategy.</p>
<p>After all, it wasn’t a completely stable bet.</p>
<p>However, a money-based strategy was fine, as Nebula Games’ current capital reserves were still abundant.</p>
<p>It was publicly announced at 268 Yuan, but players who chose the Nebula Games Platform would also receive an additional 69 Yuan discount coupon.</p>
<p>For the current Nebula Games Platform, it was crucial to accumulate a user base and gradually incentivize these new users to make purchases on the Nebula Games Platform, thereby increasing the cost for players to abandonment the game.</p>
<p>Players watching the online live broadcast naturally weren’t aware of this; they were simply delighted that the long-awaited “grand promise” (the game) was finally going to be released after months of waiting.</p>
<p>After months of agonizing wait, this “grand promise” was finally about to be delivered!</p>
<p>(End of Chapter)</p>
