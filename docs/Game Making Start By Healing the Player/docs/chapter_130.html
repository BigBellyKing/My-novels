                <p>Chapter 130: Overseas Agency</p>
<p>“Overseas distribution for Dark Souls?”</p>
<p>Listening to Lin Rou's report, Chen Xu nodded in acknowledgment.</p>
<p>The company that approached them was a relatively well-known domestic overseas publishing and distribution company: Target Software.</p>
<p>Clearly, Dark Souls, as a large-scale PC game, had attracted the attention of overseas distribution companies.</p>
<p>After all, Dark Souls had garnered considerable popularity domestically. Although Nebula Games hadn't officially released sales figures, some third-party data companies had compiled statistics.</p>
<p>There would certainly be discrepancies, but it could still serve as a reference.</p>
<p>Finally, Dark Souls itself was a fantasy-themed game, which would attract a significant audience in overseas markets as well.</p>
<p>As for the so-called difficulty, that wasn't a major issue.</p>
<p>Whether domestically or internationally, there were players who enjoyed fast-paced, simple games, and equally, players who preferred hardcore difficulty.</p>
<p>Moreover, in terms of player base, the overall overseas market was larger.</p>
<p>“Reply to them and schedule a time to discuss cooperation matters,” Chen Xu said to Lin Rou.</p>
<p>Overseas publishing and distribution wasn't that simple. Back then, Mirror (Game) only launched on their official overseas platform, which was essentially just superficial.</p>
<p>A game of Dark Souls' scale clearly couldn't take that approach.</p>
<p>Moreover, 'overseas' didn't refer to just one country, but multiple, involving various channels for game promotion and so on.</p>
<p>The corresponding reviews, promotions, and cautionary matters would all be handled by the publishing and distribution company.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some countries have policies requiring overseas games to have a local publishing and distribution company to enter their domestic market.</p>
<p>If Nebula Games were to build these channels themselves, they certainly wouldn't be able to establish them in a short time.</p>
<p>In the future, Nebula Games would build its own independently operated overseas channels, but at this stage, finding a more capable publishing and distribution company was clearly the way to maximize profits.</p>
<p>Lin Rou notified the other party, and the following afternoon, in Nebula Games' office, Chen Xu met with their representative.</p>
<p>At the conference table, the two discussed matters related to overseas publishing and distribution.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, we don't have many issues with the revenue split, but regarding overseas version modifications and operational rights…” the representative from the other side said.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu waved his hand, interrupting: “That’s a bottom line.”</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu’s words, the words that were just about to leave the other party’s throat were immediately swallowed back.</p>
<p>In other areas, such as overseas marketing and operations, including the game's revenue sharing ratio, discussions proceeded very smoothly.</p>
<p>It was largely based on industry standard practices.</p>
<p>But it was precisely the overseas version modifications and operational rights that ran into some issues.</p>
<p>Target Software wanted some operational modification rights, but Chen Xu was very direct, meaning: you are only responsible for normal overseas publishing and distribution, along with corresponding language translation and voice acting, providing your company's channels for promotion to ensure the game launches, and then you just wait for your share of the money. As for game management rights, don't even think about it.</p>
<p>To put it more simply, operational modification rights would mean, for example, that Dark Souls is a purely buy-to-play single-player game, with multiplayer being merely an add-on.</p>
<p>But if the publishing and distribution company believes that a free-to-play + in-app purchase model might be more suitable for the local market, and they possess the rights, then they could turn it into a free game where a first top-up of 6 Yuan grants a +4 Dark Sword at the start.</p>
<p>Of course, this is an exaggeration, and it's unlikely that any game company would grant such extensive rights. Typically, these matters are subject to mutual negotiation, or relate to rights over specific monetization content.</p>
<p>What made Target Software a bit difficult was that Chen Xu was clearly unwilling to grant even a tiny bit of these rights.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, this particular point is not something I can decide on,” the representative from the other side said, shaking his head upon seeing Chen Xu’s resolve.</p>
<p>Chen Xu smiled and nodded: “No problem, but I hope your company can give me a reply soon. After all, besides your company, there are several overseas publishing and distribution companies with similar intentions.”</p>
<p>As for whether it was true or false? Believe it or not, he wasn't the one under pressure anyway.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>After seeing off the representative from Target Software, Chen Xu also logged into Nebula Games' official forum.</p>
<p>Thanks to the player base brought by Sanguosha and Fall Guys, Nebula Games' player activity reached a peak after Dark Souls and its promotional event launched.</p>
<p>Nebula Games' number of active players also reached a new high.</p>
<p>At the same time, Chen Xu had always attached great importance to Nebula Games' community forum, establishing a dedicated department for its independent operation.</p>
<p>After all, in the early stages, with the Nebula Games Platform having a limited number of games, adopting this social forum operation was one of the best ways to cultivate user stickiness.</p>
<p>Looking at the results, it was already showing initial success.</p>
<p>In the Dark Souls forum section, players were still mostly discussing various strategy guides, playstyles, and common tactics.</p>
<p>Besides that, what Chen Xu found amusing was that some players had already created MODs for the previously opened Workshop.</p>
<p>The most downloaded one was a text MOD that changed 'You Died' after a player's death to 'You Are So Bad'.</p>
<p>Additionally, there were some sound effect MODs that replaced the rather eerie sounds of the underground dungeon.</p>
<p>Of course, these MODs available through the official Workshop did not affect game balance.</p>
<p>Without using the Workshop, players would need to back up a separate save file and play in offline mode.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if they went online, they would be detected, deemed as cheating, and assigned to a special server.</p>
<p>However, one MOD post did pique Chen Xu's interest.</p>
<p>Because Dark Souls also opened its Workshop, many players in that post were discussing with great imagination what interesting MODs might appear in Dark Souls in the future.</p>
<p>Although many of the current participants in the discussion hadn't even fully grasped the game's core content, let alone completed it, some hadn't even entered the capital city and were still at the stage of wondering if they were close to finishing after just defeating the Greatwood.</p>
<p>But that didn't prevent these players from envisioning Dark Souls.</p>
<p>Among them, Chen Xu saw a rather interesting suggestion: wouldn't it be fun if all the BOSSes and mobs in Dark Souls were randomized?</p>
<p>For example, in the Cemetery of Ash, if players faced Champion Gundyr from the Untended Graves instead of Gundyr the Ash impaled by the Coiled Sword, wouldn't that be exciting?</p>
<p>Or having the BOSS's weapons change; for instance, if Gundyr's halberd vanished, and he could only use kicks, palm strikes, and the Iron Mountain Tackle throughout the fight—how thrilling would that be!</p>
<p>Of course, most of it was players' wild imagination, some of which was completely unachievable, but it did give Chen Xu some ideas.</p>
