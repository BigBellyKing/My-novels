                <p>Chapter 558: Mr. Chen, you call this a strategy guide video!? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>After silently trying a couple of times, he couldn't even get past the first wall.</p>
<p>The only good news was that, according to the game's mechanism, the items from before would respawn the moment he exited the map by entering through a door, allowing for repeated trial and error. But even so, a shell thrown against the wall mid-way still ended up killing him.</p>
<p>Then he checked the fastest clear record: the uploader cleared it in 36 seconds.</p>
<p>Meaning that this map, if played without mistakes, would still take a whopping 36 seconds to clear!</p>
<p>Looking at the spike-filled path ahead, he had to admit one thing: this map was not something he could clear right now.</p>
<p>He wasn't a Mario novice either, having played various versions of Mario. Shell jumps, and using shells to farm lives in corners – he understood these basic and advanced techniques.</p>
<p>But a continuous triple shell jump, and seeing that the rest was a zero-mistake parkour run, he clearly understood the difficulty involved.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the bullet comments in the live stream room were going wild with laughter.</p>
<p>“Brother Jie, don't try anymore, let's not suffer this humiliation. Let's go back to playing on normal difficulty!”</p>
<p>“I'm dying of laughter, he threw a shell and got bounced to death! I killed myself!”</p>
<p>“By the way, can you really throw three shells like that? It's too hard, right?”</p>
<p>“Brother Jie, Brother Jie, quickly check Chen Xu's official Weibo account, there are many strategy guide videos!”</p>
<p>Brother Jie was still trying each method one by one, but he quickly noticed the bullet comments.</p>
<p>Chen Xu released strategy guides!?</p>
<p>Brother Jie looked astonished. He knew that Chen Xu had done everything else before, but he had never made strategy guides.</p>
<p>After all, the fun of games lies in exploration. Although many players prefer fast-paced gameplay, such as following guides for puzzle-solving content in some games, from an official game perspective, such strategy guide content would not usually be produced.</p>
<p>But why was Chen Xu making strategy guides for this game?</p>
<p>Brother Jie grew curious. Although he wasn't particularly fond of watching guides, this was a new game after all. Even if it used Mario's mechanisms, there were still many areas he was unfamiliar with.</p>
<p>Pausing the game temporarily, Brother Jie exited and went to Chen Xu's official Weibo account.</p>
<p>He saw several video attachments posted below Chen Xu's official Weibo account.</p>
<p>Brother Jie clicked on the first video attachment.</p>
<p>Subtitles appeared on a black screen:</p>
<p>'Shell Jump Demonstration'</p>
<p>Shell jump! Wasn't this the level he was currently stuck on!?</p>
<p>A seemingly smart little blue Toad appeared in the camera. This map was exactly the one Brother Jie was currently playing.</p>
<p>The path ahead had two doors, three Piranha Plants, a Koopa Troopa, and a row of spike walls.</p>
<p>Then Brother Jie watched as the little blue Toad ran forward, continuously stepping on the two shells of the Piranha Plants on the ground with a running start, tossing both shells into the air. Using the rebound force of the first shell, he jumped up, retrieved the airborne shell, and repeated the previous action.</p>
<p>Through a shell relay triple jump in mid-air, he soared over the tall spike wall, then stepped on the shell to grab the Koopa Troopa as it fell into shell mode, simultaneously stomping a Spiny to use its bounce to jump forward. In mid-air, he threw the shell against the wall to continue the shell jump, advancing all the way forward.</p>
<p>Various aerial shell jumps, rebound jumps using leverage, and transporting nearly exploding Bob-ombs.</p>
<p>After clearing the level, the video screen turned dark, and a line of text appeared: Have you learned it?</p>
<p>Silence, still silence.</p>
<p>What kind of strategy guide video was this!?</p>
<p>Brother Jie, in front of his computer, was completely bewildered. Learned it?</p>
<p>Sorry, I failed to learn it!</p>
<p>How the heck is anyone supposed to learn this!</p>
<p>Every step was seen clearly, but seeing clearly didn't mean he could do it!</p>
<p>Not just Brother Jie, but also the audience in the live stream room were astonished. They were happy when they saw Brother Jie at a loss in the level.</p>
<p>But this official video released by Chen Xu completely shocked them.</p>
<p>They fell into deep self-doubt, wondering if this was something a human could even learn.</p>
<p>Is this a platformer game?</p>
<p>“Holy cow, holy cow, holy cow, I let out a 'Holy cow' sound.”</p>
<p>“What just happened? I blinked!”</p>
<p>“A triple shell jump, it can actually be done like that?”</p>
<p>“Is this really a strategy guide video? Who can learn this?!”</p>
<p>“Could it be that all the super-difficult maps require these kinds of operations?”</p>
<p>Many viewers watching the live stream were equally stunned by this video.</p>
<p>Brother Jie, on his end, continued watching the other videos, since he was already there.</p>
<p>From the timestamps, it was clear that these videos weren't all released by Chen Xu at once, but rather updated gradually. They were all operation videos for Super Mario Maker.</p>
<p>For example, continuous spring jumps, spin jumps + shell jump parkour gameplay.</p>
<p>And of course, there was the pixel point micro-management, squeezing through tiny gaps, which made countless players feel like they were going to have a brain thrombosis just watching it.</p>
<p>“This… this isn't just a blind guess, is it? It's precise down to the pixel point, how torturous must that be?!”</p>
<p>Watching a short ten-second video, Brother Jie was completely dumbfounded.</p>
<p>If it was the previous shell parkour map, he felt he might still have a chance if he practiced a lot.</p>
<p>But the content in this video, he felt, definitely wasn't a map he could play.</p>
<p>In the video, Mario jumped across the edges of blocks to clear the level, with a Piranha Plant on top of the block.</p>
<p>It looked like there was no way to stand on it.</p>
<p>At the end, there was also a screenshot explaining the principle behind it.</p>
<p>It explained that if a block was, say, 8 pixel points, and the Piranha Plant occupied 6 pixel points. With the Piranha Plant on the block, there would still be one pixel point on each side where the character could stand.</p>
<p>He only needed to make the character barely graze that single pixel point to avoid touching the Piranha Plant and dying.</p>
<p>Sounds simple, right?</p>
<p>Simple my foot!</p>
<p>Is this something a person can actually do?</p>
<p>Especially the maps behind it, filled with countless spikes, looking like absolute dead ends, yet he managed to jump across them.</p>
<p>Brother Jie returned to the game and used the game's zoom function to observe.</p>
<p>He could indeed see the pixel points, but the crucial thing was how incredibly difficult this would be in a normal game!</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>In Nebula Games' project office, Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin, among others, watched Chen Xu, who was busy creating 'promotional' material, all speechless.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, you're very strong, but are these operations something players can learn?” Yang Xin voiced her inner question.</p>
<p>“Also, aren't our official maps a bit too difficult?” Ruan Ningxue also asked.</p>
<p>In summary, there was one shared feeling:</p>
<p>Brain/Eyes: Is that all there is to it?</p>
<p>Hands: Damn it!</p>
<p>“Don't underestimate players. Look, this player named Fatty not only cleared the super-difficult parkour map but also set a new record.”</p>
<p>“And this player from the NHC Team also cleared the micro-management map. This is just the first day. What does that show? The difficulty isn't high; in fact, it's too low. You'll understand what 'inhumane' means when you see the maps players create later.” Chen Xu couldn't help but smile faintly.</p>
<p>“Besides, didn't we also prepare some more casual options for ordinary players, like music maps?” Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Indeed, just as Chen Xu said.</p>
<p>Players who got their hands on Super Mario Maker, especially those who had played many Mario games, were amazed by the game's difficulty and techniques.</p>
<p>As for ordinary players, they felt like they were transported back to when they first encountered Minecraft, exclaiming: “This game can actually be played like this!”</p>
<p>Players in the multiplayer cooperative mode were also having a great time, feeling the atmosphere was quite good. Especially some music maps and fun level maps, which left many players with a deep impression.</p>
<p>Sure enough, before announcing Resident Evil Village, Mr. Chen treated them to another good meal!</p>
<p>Super-difficult maps were not for ordinary players.</p>
<p>But this multiplayer mode and easy mode were truly casual and joyful!</p>
<p>Innumerable players laughed and cheered.</p>
<p>However, about a week after the multiplayer mode launched, many players, after their initial familiarization, suddenly noticed that the 'water temperature' seemed a bit off.</p>
