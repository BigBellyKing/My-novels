                <h2>Chapter 31: First Experience with <em>To the Moon</em></h2>
<p>Days passed, and the deadline for the Game Design Competition drew near.</p>
<p>Game producers and game companies alike uploaded their contest entries to the Official Game Platform.</p>
<p>Among them were mobile games and PC games—mostly single-player games, though some online games were included as well.</p>
<p>Clearly, some aimed to win awards, while others just wanted to join the fun.</p>
<p>After all, some had existing projects that could just as easily enter the competition.</p>
<p>Who knows? They might even win something.</p>
<p>After these works were uploaded, the next step was preliminary censorship.</p>
<p>This process would filter out works with problematic content or those that were crude and shoddy.</p>
<p>Of course, this segment was not open to the public. Still, even the removed games would eventually be launched on the game platform.</p>
<p>Though such a rule existed, very few games were actually eliminated each year.</p>
<p>After all, only qualified Game Designers could participate—most of them had at least some skill.</p>
<p>This year, however, drew intense attention from both the industry and players alike.</p>
<p>Would Chen Xu’s game, developed in just over ten days, be eliminated?</p>
<p>‘Here it is, here it is! Scanned the full list—no games were removed at all!’</p>
<p>‘Damn it! Does that mean the Game Department认可 Chen Xu’s game for eligibility?’</p>
<p>‘So at least it’s playable, right?’</p>
<p>‘Found it, found it! Chen Xu’s new work is called <em>To the Moon</em>!’</p>
<p>‘The name sounds pretty serious—space-related, maybe?’</p>
<p>‘The price is super cheap! Only 15 yuan?’</p>
<p>‘Looks like it’s on dual platforms, two different versions.’</p>
<p>‘What? Two versions? Even <em>Undertale</em> didn’t get that treatment!’</p>
<p>‘I’m gonna see exactly what kind of game Chen Xu made in just over ten days!’</p>
<p>As the contest entries were released, countless interested players quickly downloaded and began experiencing their favorite games.</p>
<p>Naturally, Chen Xu’s <em>To the Moon</em> was one of the first to draw attention.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>On Shark TV’s live streaming platforms, in the gaming section.</p>
<p>Many streamers launched livestreams to test out the games from this Game Design Competition.</p>
<p>This was part of Shark TV’s official promotional campaign. After all, the Game Design Competition was hosted by the Game Department—carrying a certain official weight—even if Shark TV hadn’t been formally invited.</p>
<p>But when it came to showing respect, platforms like Shark TV never hesitated to use their tongues.</p>
<p>Just because they weren’t invited didn’t mean they couldn’t show initiative.</p>
<p>Dong Zhen, a streamer on Shark TV, was well aware of this platform event.</p>
<p>So early in the morning, he started his live stream, with the room title: <em>Experiencing Game Design Competition Entries</em>.</p>
<p>‘Morning, folks!’</p>
<p>‘What’s up, little bro? Streaming this early?’</p>
<p>‘Holy crap, which zoo monkey escaped today?’</p>
<p>‘Little Dong’s here so early?’</p>
<p>The moment Dong Zhen started his stream, the screen filled with teasing bullet comments.</p>
<p>Seeing the barrage of comments, Dong Zhen chuckled.</p>
<p>“Ahem!!!”</p>
<p>“Alright, alright, good morning everyone! Today, we’re diving into some of the entries from this Game Design Competition. Big task ahead!”</p>
<p>As he adjusted his streaming equipment, Dong Zhen logged into the Official Game Platform with his account.</p>
<p>“For the first game, let’s try the new one from the creator of <em>Undertale</em>.”</p>
<p>“To be honest, I’ve been looking forward to this for a while.”</p>
<p>“Why? Well, what the heck—didn’t <em>Undertale</em> blow everyone away? It was genuinely amazing.”</p>
<p>“But now, this one called <em>To the Moon</em>? Heard it was made in just over ten days—and wasn’t cut by the Game Department. What the heck, I’m seriously curious what kind of game this is!”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Dong Zhen opened the Official Game Platform and searched for <em>To the Moon</em>.</p>
<p>‘Altering memories… an old man’s dying wish is to go to the moon? Wow, this is bold!’</p>
<p>“Today, I, a proud man standing at 192 cm, shall uncover this game’s secrets!”</p>
<p>The game wasn’t large, and his broadband quickly downloaded it.</p>
<p>Ignoring the screen full of question-mark bullet comments, Dong Zhen decisively clicked to launch the game.</p>
<p>One meter sixty? Impossible. He’d always been a towering 192 cm!</p>
<p>The installation completed quickly.</p>
<p>The game’s icon was simple: two children sitting on a log, gazing at the distant moon.</p>
<p>Launching the game, the Nebula Games company Logo flashed and disappeared.</p>
<p>A full moon, lighthouses appeared on screen. Stars dotted the sky, and a few dark clouds drifted slowly.</p>
<p>Etched onto the moon’s surface was the game’s title: <em>To the Moon</em>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the camera slowly panned downward.</p>
<p>A warm piano concerto began playing as the BGM.</p>
<p>As serene as moonlight.</p>
<p>Lighthouses, grasslands, and a large mansion perched on the edge of a cliff.</p>
<p>The camera slowly moved into the house, where a girl sat at a piano playing, with a young boy beside her.</p>
<p>At this moment, the background music shifted. A simple piano melody began, and closing your eyes, it felt as if you were standing in a forest, a gentle stream flowing before you.</p>
<p>‘Forget everything else, this music is amazing!’</p>
<p>‘Right! Without saying much about Chen Xu’s other work, the music is absolutely top-tier!’</p>
<p>‘Yeah, both piano pieces are really beautiful.’</p>
<p>‘And <em>Undertale</em>—the music added so many points!’</p>
<p>‘Not just <em>Undertale</em>, the music in <em>Mirror (Game)</em> was also excellent!’</p>
<p>‘Caught a gentleman red-handed!’</p>
<p>Reading the live stream room’s bullet comments, Dong Zhen nodded quietly.</p>
<p>The game hadn’t even started yet—whether it was fun remained to be seen—but the music was truly outstanding.</p>
<p>As everyone immersed themselves in the beautiful piano melody, suddenly, the sound of a car engine broke through, followed by a crashing noise.</p>
<p>Accompanying the impact, the game screen slightly shook.</p>
<p>The camera shifted outside the house—a black sedan had crashed into a tree.</p>
<p>Two people in white coats, resembling doctors, stepped out from the car.</p>
<p>‘Where were you looking while driving, Neil?’</p>
<p>‘Hmm, sorry. I was heroically avoiding that squirrel that suddenly jumped out.’</p>
<p>‘…But you still ran over it—and then crashed into a tree.’</p>
<p>‘Look, no need to worry. It’s a company car.’</p>
<p>‘Are you kidding? The boss will kill us!’</p>
<p>‘Hmm… let’s just say I saved a puppy. He likes dogs, right?’</p>
<p>‘He prefers cats.’</p>
<p>‘Why does the world have to be so complicated? Whatever he likes, the crisis is over!’</p>
