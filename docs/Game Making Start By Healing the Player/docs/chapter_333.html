                <p>Chapter 332: Tough Guys Cry (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Attack helicopters were still flying, and the commanding officer's orders were being relayed.</p>
<p>But suddenly, the sound cut out...</p>
<p>Turning around, right in the city's center, a dazzling light suddenly exploded, followed by a thunderous boom.</p>
<p>But this sound lasted only an instant, followed by a deafening silence.</p>
<p>Firelight, accompanied by a colossal black mushroom cloud, shot straight into the sky, and a shockwave spread outwards from the explosion's center, instantly collapsing countless buildings.</p>
<p>The attack helicopters evacuating in the sky were caught by the shockwave and crashed one after another.</p>
<p>The screen instantly turned blood-red, as if hit by enemy bullets. A nearby teammate clung desperately to the helicopter's cabin door. Zhang Yi instinctively tried to pull him, but the next moment, the person was flung out.</p>
<p>Then the attack helicopter crashed directly, and the screen plunged into darkness.</p>
<p>A satellite map appeared, the camera switching to a city.</p>
<p>A brilliant light erupted in the city, leaving behind an enormous crater.</p>
<p>Then the screen warped slightly, and countless names began to scroll.</p>
<p>These were the names of the thirty thousand soldiers who died in the explosion during this operation.</p>
<p>As the names scrolled to a green one, the camera zoomed in for a close-up: Paul Jackson.</p>
<p>The screen gradually faded to black.</p>
<p>At this moment, a sliver of light suddenly appeared on the screen. A bloody, mangled hand stretched out from the rubble, then struggled to crawl outwards.</p>
<p>Before his eyes was a hellish scene.</p>
<p>In the distant sky, the mushroom cloud had not yet dissipated, nor had the light generated by the explosion.</p>
<p>The entire sky seemed to have been torn open by the blast, a blood-red sky, filled with dust and sand.</p>
<p>Nearby, some soldiers who had survived like him, clutching their broken bodies, stared despairingly at the distant mushroom cloud.</p>
<p>Struggling to stand and taking two steps, Zhang Yi looked towards the distant mushroom cloud, but soon Paul Jackson in the game fell to the ground again.</p>
<p>And at that very moment, a second wave of dazzling light erupted.</p>
<p>With this burst of light, the screen completely plunged into darkness.</p>
<p>Nuclear weapons, everyone was familiar with them.</p>
<p>But as for their true power, most people had only witnessed it in films and documentaries.</p>
<p>And now, at least in the game, Zhang Yi felt this terrifying power.</p>
<p>With the explosion, thirty thousand soldiers all perished here.</p>
<p>The post-nuclear wasteland world and fragile lives were utterly shocking.</p>
<p>Modern warfare was also brutal warfare.</p>
<p>After thirty thousand Marines died from the nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>The storyline then returned to the SAS. Al-Asad, whom the Marines hadn't found, was successfully located and captured by the SAS and the Russian army.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi had already seen this part of the plot in a promotional CG. Zakhaev, who had puzzled many players in previous trailers, now had his identity revealed.</p>
<p>Price, lost in thought, told all the team members who exactly this Zakhaev was.</p>
<p>It was fifteen years ago. Back then, Price was still a rookie, just like Soap, who had recently joined the SAS. He followed his captain, Captain MacMillan, to infiltrate the city of Chernobyl for an assassination mission.</p>
<p>The level title 'All Ghillied Up!' appeared. In his previous life, the original level name was "Comprehensive Disguise".</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu still chose a name more familiar to most players in his previous life.</p>
<p>If the previous nuclear explosion showcased unparalleled visual impact.</p>
<p>Then this level revealed an unparalleled sense of immersion.</p>
<p>The once-prosperous city of Chernobyl, due to the reactor explosion incident, had now become a ghost town.</p>
<p>But there were still some armed militants collecting and selling reactor materials.</p>
<p>And now, what Price and MacMillan had to do was find their leader, Zakhaev, and assassinate him.</p>
<p>MacMillan and Price, clad in Ghillie Suits, crawled inch by inch across the ground, advancing inwards.</p>
<p>The sniper's professionalism, calmness, and stealth were all demonstrated to perfection.</p>
<p>Completely different from the previous intense scenes, although it was an infiltration level, it made Zhang Yi's entire being extremely tense.</p>
<p>Especially upon reaching the graveyard behind the church, a helicopter flew in from the distant sky.</p>
<p>In front of him were also large numbers of fully armed enemies, along with armored vehicles and tanks.</p>
<p>It made Zhang Yi clench his toes even tighter.</p>
<p>Crawling slowly through the dense grass, the enemies were incredibly close.</p>
<p>Occasionally, one or two tanks would drive past.</p>
<p>It truly made Zhang Yi afraid to even breathe.</p>
<p>And the coordination with Captain MacMillan was truly superb.</p>
<p>Kills and cover flowed seamlessly.</p>
<p>Especially during the final escape, facing countless enemies, MacMillan and Price were exceptionally brave.</p>
<p>Except for a few dogs mid-way that gave Zhang Yi a stern warning, everything went smoothly until a minor flaw appeared.</p>
<p>That was when facing an enemy attack helicopter, Captain MacMillan was incredibly brave, insisting on showing off by single-shotting the helicopter pilot in the middle of the road, only to end up with a broken leg.</p>
<p>“You were quite the handsome guy when you were showing off, but you look a bit pathetic with a broken leg.” Controlling Price as he carried the injured MacMillan on his back, Zhang Yi was speechless.</p>
<p>The original two-person cooperation instantly became 1.5-person cooperation.</p>
<p>Although he could still provide support, the immobile MacMillan could at best be counted as 0.5 of a person.</p>
<p>And precisely because this seemingly mature old captain insisted on showing off in the middle of the road and broke his leg, the subsequent game difficulty felt like it was skyrocketing for Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>Especially at a Ferris wheel scene, even on normal difficulty, Zhang Yi felt a surge of pressure, completely unable to imagine what the Veteran difficulty would be like.</p>
<p>So here, he decisively switched the difficulty to Recruit.</p>
<p>Is it shameful?</p>
<p>Not shameful, after all, which veteran didn't start as a recruit?</p>
<p>As Price's flashback ended, enemies swarmed in like a tide.</p>
<p>After holding out for a while, a team member told Soap to operate the multi-barrel rotary cannon on the crashed Blackhawk fighter jet.</p>
<p>After shooting down five helicopters in the sky, they entered the house to detonate it and evacuate.</p>
<p>Returning to the farm on the hilltop, they used 'Javelin' to eliminate the enemy army's tanks, finally reaching the extraction point for a full withdrawal.</p>
<p>But in this battle, another teammate sacrificed his life: Mac.</p>
<p>The SAS members then realized that Zakhaev was the mastermind behind this attack.</p>
<p>Although they didn't know his exact location, intelligence pinpointed Zakhaev's son, Victor.</p>
<p>But just as they were about to fail to capture him, this madman unexpectedly raised a gun to his head and committed suicide.</p>
<p>Zakhaev, consumed by the grief of losing his son, immediately declared his intention to seek revenge, launching two intercontinental cruise missiles armed with nuclear warheads.</p>
<p>These two missiles were aimed at American coastal cities, with a potential attack range covering over a dozen locations.</p>
<p>Yet the defense system was virtually useless, and over 40 million ordinary lives were at risk.</p>
<p>Joint forces from Russia, America, and Britain had to enter the base to activate the self-destruct mechanism; otherwise, tens of millions of ordinary citizens would face complete annihilation.</p>
<p>After a fierce battle, the assault team finally breached the underground base through a ventilation shaft on its north side.</p>
<p>Immensely tense and thrilling, from this level onwards, the game's entire pace was like a rollercoaster reaching its peak and then plunging downwards, filled with the scent of gunpowder.</p>
<p>Firefight, breach, firefight, breach!</p>
<p>Especially under the constraint of a ticking countdown, the sense of immersion and urgency was heightened.</p>
<p>After successfully thwarting Zakhaev's plot, it was time to escape.</p>
<p>If 'All Ghillied Up' could be described as an exceptionally brilliant stealth assassination level.</p>
<p>Then this final escape level was the one Zhang Yi felt was the most intense and thrilling.</p>
<p>Pursued by Zakhaev's armed forces, Soap, Price, and the SAS team members fled at high speed on the highway.</p>
<p>The roaring engines and firecracker-like gunshots filled the air. Cars sped down the highway as Zhang Yi, using vehicles for cover, frantically strafed enemies on attack helicopters and armored vehicles.</p>
<p>"Thrilling and exciting" was no longer enough to describe it.</p>
<p>This was a race against death!</p>
<p>After about five minutes of continuous pursuit, the pursuers behind seemed to have been repelled, and Zhang Yi had just let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>But just as the armored Jeep passed a highway bridge, an Mi-24 attack helicopter suddenly appeared in the sky.</p>
<p>Two shells directly blasted the bridge, and the massive explosion instantly collapsed it, blocking Soap and his team's path forward.</p>
<p>At the same time, Zakhaev's forces behind them caught up again.</p>
<p>So Soap and the others had no choice but to jump out of their vehicle and counterattack on the spot.</p>
<p>“Where the heck are the friendly forces? The American army? The Russian army?”</p>
<p>“I'm almost out of ammo!”</p>
<p>Zhang Yi looked at his dwindling ammunition, feeling completely flustered.</p>
<p>And at that very moment, a coal tanker on the highway instantly exploded.</p>
<p>The powerful shockwave from the explosion directly knocked Soap to the ground.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi's vision instantly blurred, and the gunfire sounded like buzzing mosquitoes.</p>
<p>“Soap! Hold on!” A teammate's voice echoed in his ear.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi recognized it.</p>
<p>Standing before him was Griggs.</p>
<p>After Sergeant Paul Jackson and others died in the nuclear explosion, he joined the SAS team to carry out missions and capture Zakhaev.</p>
<p>At this moment, this burly man in the hail of bullets dragged the semi-conscious Soap towards cover with one hand, while continuously firing his pistol at the enemies with the other.</p>
<p>Griggs placed Soap behind cover, then picked up a heavy machine gun from the ground, mounted it on a wrecked car, and frantically suppressed the enemies.</p>
<p>But the next moment, a fatal bullet pierced his neck, blood sprayed from the wound, and his corpse fell heavily beside Soap.</p>
<p>“Damn it!” Seeing Griggs on the ground, Zhang Yi cursed, frantically pressing the game keys, trying to stand up.</p>
<p>Looking around, Price, who had been incredibly brave throughout the team, lay on the ground covered in blood, also struggling to stand.</p>
<p>In the distance, Zakhaev and his subordinates slowly advanced towards Soap and Price.</p>
<p>Along the way, Gaz struggled to stand, but Zakhaev shot him in the head.</p>
<p>“Damn! Gaz!”</p>
<p>Zhang Yi watched Gaz fall, his eyes stinging, and tough guys cried.</p>
<p>Among all the mission team members, aside from Price, Gaz was the one who left the deepest impression on Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>Especially during missions, Gaz had saved him multiple times!</p>
<p>And at that moment, a missile struck Zakhaev's helicopter.</p>
<p>Kamarov's reinforcements finally arrived.</p>
<p>Zakhaev, who had originally intended to have a heart-to-heart with his old friend Price, was now drawn to the reinforcements and ordered his subordinates to counterattack.</p>
<p>At this point, the camera switched to Price, who was nearby.</p>
<p>Without a word, Price used all his strength to push the M1911 on the ground towards Soap.</p>
<p>Picking up the pushed M1911, bullet time activated.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi didn't hesitate, firing all the bullets at Zakhaev.</p>
<p>Blood splattered from Zakhaev's head.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Zakhaev's subordinates were instantly killed by the reinforcements from the sky.</p>
<p>Kamarov, descending from the plane, directed medics to assist Soap and Price.</p>
<p>Accompanied by the news announcer's voice, the game seemed to draw to a close.</p>
<p>But Zhang Yi felt no excitement at all.</p>
<p>Of the SAS, only two remained.</p>
<p>Everyone was dead except for Soap and Captain Price.</p>
<p>Griggs, who wasn't an SAS member but ultimately died covering Soap.</p>
<p>Gaz, who was the first to welcome Soap.</p>
<p>Only two were left in the end.</p>
<p>But what Zhang Yi hadn't expected was that this wasn't the end.</p>
<p>(End of Chapter)
