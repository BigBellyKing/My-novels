                <p>Chapter 96: The Right Game</p>
<p>Nebula Games Office</p>
<p>Compared to its early days as a small team, Nebula Games had now grown into a company of considerable scale.</p>
<p>Chen Xu led the core development team, including Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and Qin Yi.</p>
<p>In addition, separate operations teams were established for <em>Overcooked</em>, <em>Sanguosha</em>, and <em>Fall Guys</em>, responsible for the subsequent operation and content updates of these games.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a dedicated department was formed for the Nebula Games Platform, focusing specifically on maintaining the community and the Workshop (modding platform) features.</p>
<p>Currently, the review process for Workshop-related MODs was still being handled internally by Nebula Games employees and customer support staff.</p>
<p>However, as the number of supported games continued to grow, outsourcing this task would inevitably become necessary.</p>
<p>The in-house staff would eventually shift to overseeing the broader strategic direction, gaining valuable grassroots experience in the meantime.</p>
<p>With the official launch of the <em>Dark Souls</em> project, the entire team was making steady progress in development.</p>
<p>Chen Xu didn’t need to worry too much about art asset production.</p>
<p>He mainly coordinated between Ruan Ningxue and the outsourced team, only stepping in for final reviews.</p>
<p>As for Yang Xin’s work on the story and worldview design, there weren’t many difficulties—his task was simply to keep pace with the game’s overall development.</p>
<p>The core focus of <em>Dark Souls</em> development remained firmly on the Combat System.</p>
<p>Under Chen Xu’s leadership, progress in this area was highly encouraging.</p>
<p>This was largely due to the post-holiday recruitment drive, during which many new employees brought substantial experience in action games.</p>
<p>They quickly grasped Chen Xu’s vision and efficiently adjusted parameters using the Official Game Engine.</p>
<p>"Avoid hit-stun during BOSS battles. Only specific actions, such as backstabs, Perfect Guard counters, and executions, should trigger rewarding mechanics."</p>
<p>"The entire <em>Dark Souls</em> Combat System revolves around the stamina bar. Invisible resource management and fluid combat should take priority over sense of impact."</p>
<p>On the large screen was a BOSS battle scene.</p>
<p>Since the map’s art assets had not yet been produced, the background was still a simple 3D wireframe.</p>
<p>However, the BOSS model had already been created—this was the first BOSS players would face, affectionately nicknamed ‘Gundyr the Ash,’ the Shield-Parry Teacher.</p>
<p>Following Chen Xu’s instructions, the employee responsible for the Combat System gradually fine-tuned the parameters.</p>
<p>While the team continued refining the settings, Qin Yi took the opportunity to discuss certain development matters regarding <em>Dark Souls</em> with Chen Xu.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, regarding data, should we also finalize the formulas for Easy and Normal difficulties?" Qin Yi asked, holding a printed document.</p>
<p>The document listed various stats for BOSSes, monsters, and equipment in <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>"Easy and Normal difficulties? I forgot to mention earlier—this game won’t have difficulty settings," Chen Xu replied with a smile.</p>
<p>"N-No difficulty options!?" Qin Yi’s eyes widened in shock.</p>
<p>He glanced down at the data in his hands, then at the ongoing combat test on the screen, looking utterly bewildered.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen… should we still optimize and adjust these attributes later on?" Qin Yi asked tentatively.</p>
<p>"Why adjust them? The current attributes are actually quite scientific. Don’t just look at the BOSS stats—consider the game’s Combat System design and the player attributes we’ve designed."</p>
<p>"First, let’s examine the Combat System. Most monsters can be dealt massive damage via backstabs. There’s also the shield mechanic and invincible rolling—these allow players to defeat enemies quite easily."</p>
<p>"Given that, if we don’t increase monster attributes to add challenge, wouldn’t players become completely invincible? Wouldn’t the game lose all difficulty? Would players even find it fun then?"</p>
<p>Chen Xu explained solemnly.</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu, Qin Yi felt a bit dizzy.</p>
<p>Hmm… that actually made a certain amount of sense.</p>
<p>But then another question arose.</p>
<p>Theoretically, if players avoid getting hit, they’re practically invincible—able to defeat mobs in just a few hits.</p>
<p>But what if they <em>do</em> get hit?</p>
<p>Staring at the combat test still being optimized on screen, Qin Yi fell into deep thought.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>After leaving the <em>Dark Souls</em> project team and returning to his office, Chen Xu stretched lazily.</p>
<p>During this time, <em>Fall Guys</em> remained extremely popular.</p>
<p>The game had already received two major updates, introducing several new maps into the rotation.</p>
<p>Additionally, thanks to strong player support, new modes such as solo matchmaking and Team Up had been added.</p>
<p>The Team Up mode had been significantly improved compared to its previous life—now, entire teams could win the crown, rather than only a single winner emerging at the end.</p>
<p>In terms of sales, <em>Fall Guys</em> continued to break records. Nearly a month after launch, it had sold close to 4 million copies, with sales trends remaining impressively stable.</p>
<p>As for <em>Sanguosha</em>, while its data wasn’t as dazzling as <em>Fall Guys</em>, it excelled in player retention, with both Daily active users and Gross revenue steadily climbing.</p>
<p>Opening the system’s UI interface, Chen Xu checked the four progress bars linked to the golden item he had previously drawn.</p>
<p>The bar representing happiness had grown the most, already filling up about two-thirds.</p>
<p>Anger and resentment followed, each around one-sixth filled.</p>
<p>The sadness bar, however, hadn’t moved at all.</p>
<p>Clearly, no one was crying while playing <em>Sanguosha</em> or <em>Fall Guys</em>.</p>
<p>As he was observing the growth in emotional points, his phone suddenly vibrated on the desk. Chen Xu picked it up and saw a message from his assistant, Lin Rou.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, there’s a new Game Design Competition announcement from the official side."</p>
<p>A new Game Design Competition?</p>
<p>Chen Xu paused for a moment.</p>
<p>Last year’s competition had focused primarily on sci-fi games.</p>
<p>He had created <em>To the Moon</em>, which, despite winning an award, sparked considerable controversy.</p>
<p>This year, the Game Design Competition was being announced so early?</p>
<p>Opening the Official Game Engine’s backend, Chen Xu found an official electronic document.</p>
<p>However, the theme for this year’s competition?</p>
<p>"A game with an anti-war theme?" Chen Xu instinctively pinched his little finger.</p>
<p>He then glanced at the additional requirements.</p>
<p>They were largely similar to last year’s competition.</p>
<p>If anything was different, it was that this year’s theme was slightly more serious.</p>
<p>After all, it involved anti-war messaging.</p>
<p>As Chen Xu reviewed the requirements, he began contemplating what kind of game to create.</p>
<p>Earlier in the year, he had developed <em>Outlast</em> and <em>Overcooked</em>; later, <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em>.</p>
<p>Originally, he had planned to apply for a higher Job Title only after completing <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>But if he could secure a strong ranking in this competition, he wouldn’t need to wait that long.</p>
<p>Moreover, during this vacuum period while <em>Dark Souls</em> was in development, the Nebula Games Platform needed a new game to maintain visibility and热度.</p>
<p>Now, only the game’s direction remained to be decided.</p>
<p>An anti-war theme offered him quite a few options.</p>
<p>After some thought, and recalling the unlock condition for the golden gashapon he had recently obtained, Chen Xu had an idea for a suitable game.</p>
<p>(Daily request for recommendation votes and Monthly Pass~)</p>
