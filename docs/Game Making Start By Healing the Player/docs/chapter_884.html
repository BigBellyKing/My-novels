<h1>Chapter 883: Damn It, Duck Zhida Zhuo</h1>
<p>In the previous Prologue, Zhang Yi had already learned some of the system settings of <em>Persona</em>.</p>
<p>As a veteran, hardcore gamer who had played countless games, the moment he started, Zhang Yi understood that this was a very traditional RPG game.</p>
<p>Chalice Dungeons, attribute counters, turn-based strategy—these were all fundamental mechanics.</p>
<p>Additionally, there was a particularly important collecting element in the game: Personas.</p>
<p>And about this system, Zhang Yi had a premonition that he would spend countless hours grinding on it.</p>
<p>Currently, all he possessed was his initial Persona, named Arsène Lupin.</p>
<p>But just like the Blades in <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>, the Personas in <em>Persona</em> could also be nurtured and developed.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t yet know what the subsequent progression mode would be like, since he hadn’t unlocked that content yet.</p>
<p>As for the Chalice Dungeons, there was nothing particularly special—traps and mobs were basic elements that existed in virtually every game.</p>
<p>The difference lay in how intricately the dungeons were designed.</p>
<p>But at this point, having only just begun, Zhang Yi couldn’t make any meaningful evaluation.</p>
<p>Aside from these aspects, the parts that intrigued Zhang Yi the most so far—apart from the Art and Music—were the worldview setting and the Daily Life (Mission).</p>
<p>In the game, Personas represented the manifestation of human hearts and were also the source of power.</p>
<p>The protagonist, controlled by the player, would confront Shadows—distorted human desires and corrupted humanity—lurking within the physically manifested Palaces of twisted consciousness.</p>
<p>Both Personas and Shadows took on external forms projected from human illusions, hence their appearances were various supernatural beings drawn from legends and folklore.</p>
<p>This unique world-building deeply fascinated Zhang Yi. He didn’t know how the story would unfold, but clearly, the element of "psychology" would be one of the game’s central themes.</p>
<p>The second highlight was the daily school life. By day, the protagonist was an "undesirable student," but secretly, he was a heart-stealing Hero (attack type). This contrast gave Zhang Yi a uniquely satisfying thrill.</p>
<p>On its own, the school life segment wasn’t particularly interesting. But when combined with the superhero theme and the game’s vivid characters, it created a 1+1&gt;2 effect in terms of enjoyment.</p>
<p>Moreover, the depiction of campus daily life was extremely detailed.</p>
<p>Sitting in the classroom, listening to the teacher lecture at the blackboard, Zhang Yi controlled Ren Amamiya as he rested his chin on his hand, gazing out the window, lost in thought.</p>
<p>This scene reminded Zhang Yi of his own high school days. Of course, the conditions weren’t as good as in the game—back then, they had double desks and long benches for two people, and sometimes they’d even get into fights over territory on the desk.</p>
<p>"Too bad the sense of immersion isn’t that strong," Zhang Yi sighed with emotion.</p>
<p>But then again, this was a private high school in an island nation, not a public one.</p>
<p>Yet as Zhang Yi finished sighing, he quickly found himself slipping back into that familiar high school feeling.</p>
<p>'Hey! Transfer student!'</p>
<p>'Plato, the Greek philosopher, said that the human soul consists of three parts: will, desire... and what was the third? Answer me!'</p>
<p>Zhang Yi: !!!!!!!</p>
<p>"Damn it! Do I actually have to answer properly? How the hell should I know!?" Zhang Yi looked bewildered as the in-game Ren Amamiya stood up.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>The feeling was back!</p>
<p>The teenage nostalgia of being caught daydreaming in class and then being called on by the teacher—it had returned!</p>
<p>"Patience, rationality, love? Three choices? At least it's multiple choice, not fill-in-the-blank," Zhang Yi exhaled in relief as three options appeared before him.</p>
<p>"When you don't know, pick C! And isn't there such a thing as Platonic love? It must be that, right?" After a brief hesitation, Zhang Yi made his choice.</p>
<p>'Hmph... I didn't expect you to know anyway.'</p>
<p>'The correct answer is rationality. Remember that. Socrates, Plato’s mentor, also said, "Ignorance is sin." Those who indulge their emotions and individualism will eventually stray from the tracks and become scum of society!'</p>
<p>As the teacher’s words echoed from the podium, the nearby students began whispering.</p>
<p>'He really isn't a serious student after all.'</p>
<p>'Best not to get involved with him...'</p>
<p>'Oh no, he’s looking this way!'</p>
<p>Zhang Yi: ..........</p>
<p>So this was the school life experience of being a delinquent and an underachiever?</p>
<p>Watching the subtle movements of the surrounding students, Zhang Yi twitched his lips.</p>
<p>Compared to the original version, although the art aspect wasn’t realistic, Chen Xu had made significant changes to the perspective in the VR version.</p>
<p>For instance, during the daily life segments, the player could perceive far more details.</p>
<p>At least now Zhang Yi had made up his mind: next time, he absolutely wouldn’t be an underachiever again!</p>
<p>The "undesirable student" label was clearly a reputation spread by that disgusting volleyball teacher, Suguru Kamoshida.</p>
<p>Based on Zhang Yi’s years of gaming experience, such labels usually only changed gradually as the main quest progressed.</p>
<p>But the underachiever label—he could change that himself!</p>
<p>It was just answering questions, right?</p>
<p>At worst, he could multitask and look up answers while playing!</p>
<p>Zhang Yi gave himself a mental pat on the back for his cleverness.</p>
<p>However, as the game progressed, beyond the dungeons and tutorials, school studies, part-time jobs, and other daily activities, the story and overall Atmosphere began to feel increasingly oppressive to Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>Suguru Kamoshida—without a doubt, he was the game’s first BOSS.</p>
<p>A graduate of private Shujin Academy, Olympic champion, retired athlete who became a physical education teacher and volleyball coach, leading the volleyball club to national tournaments.</p>
<p>But privately, he frequently resorted to physical punishment bordering on abuse, and once falsely accused Ryuji Sakamoto of assault, deliberately injuring his leg and causing the track team to be disbanded.</p>
<p>More critically, the man was a lecherous old lecher who sexually harassed female students and maliciously spread rumors about Ren Amamiya’s supposed criminal past and delinquent behavior, causing most students to fear and avoid him.</p>
<p>Even though word got out, the school’s principal and administrators suppressed the information—because Kamoshida brought benefits to the school.</p>
<p>When the first victim appeared in the game, the oppressive feeling transformed into outrage, reaching its peak.</p>
<p>Unable to obtain the girl named Ann Takamaki, Kamoshida shifted his target to her friend—directly causing her to jump from a building.</p>
<p>"This damn bastard is pure trash!" Zhang Yi glared at Suguru Kamoshida, who was smugly gloating in front of Ren Amamiya and Ryuji Sakamoto, wishing he could jump into the game and punch the bastard square in the face.</p>
<p>"Trash... no, calling him trash is giving him too much credit!" Zhang Yi immediately corrected himself after cursing.</p>
<p>Back when he played <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>, he’d nicknamed Genichiro "Scumichiro."</p>
<p>But compared to this guy, Genichiro was toweringly noble. At least Genichiro sacrificed everything for Ashina; he had his beliefs and perseverance.</p>
<p>But this Suguru Kamoshida? He could only be described as "nastiness opening the Conduit for nastiness's mother."</p>
<p>Infiltrate the Palace, find the Treasure, make him pay the price.</p>
<p>That was Zhang Yi’s sole thought at the moment.</p>
<p>Just then, the call button on the gaming pod rang.</p>
<p>"Already nearly three hours?" Zhang Yi, pausing the game and climbing out, looked bewildered at Wang Han, who was calling him for dinner.</p>
<p>Had it really been three hours already?</p>
<p>He didn’t even feel it!</p>
<p>"Of course. So, how’s the new game? Fun? What did you experience?" Wang Han asked curiously.</p>
<p>"Hmm... pretty fun. As for progress... probably still in the newbie village," Zhang Yi thought. Aside from Ryuji Sakamoto’s awakening, so far he’d only entered the Palace twice and was just about to attempt the third.</p>
<p>Other than attending classes, working part-time, and gathering information, there wasn’t much else.</p>
<p>Yet it was precisely these seemingly mundane activities that had stealthily stolen his time?</p>
<p>He hadn’t even touched the Persona collecting system yet!</p>
<p>But before anything else, he had one more important matter to attend to.</p>
<p>"Ahem... I have an immature suggestion..." Zhang Yi coughed lightly, sitting at the dining table as he watched Wang Han serve rice.</p>
<p>"Hmm?" Wang Han looked puzzled.</p>
<p>"When the Ghost and Roach were betrayed by Shepherd, when Arthur Morgan discovered that Micah had sold out the gang, when you learned that Fontaine was the true mastermind behind everything—didn’t you feel an overwhelming urge to immediately eliminate those hate-inducing characters, to relieve your burning anger? So much so that you couldn’t even sleep at night until they were dealt with?" Zhang Yi tried to make Wang Han understand his inner feelings.</p>
<p>Wang Han put down her chopsticks and glanced thoughtfully at the next-gen VR gaming pod in the room. She got it. She understood.</p>
<p>He was addicted—ready to turn his previous words into "puff puff"?</p>
<p>But she didn’t get angry. Instead, she smiled. "Meals?"</p>
<p>"I’ll cook!"</p>
<p>"Dishes and clothes?"</p>
<p>"I’ll wash!"</p>
<p>"Floors and tables?"</p>
<p>"I’ll clean!"</p>
<p>"Time?"</p>
<p>"Three months!"</p>
<p>"Deal!"</p>
<p>Having signed this series of treaties, Zhang Yi quickly grabbed his bowl and chopsticks and dashed toward the kitchen after dinner.</p>
<p>Though he’d practically taken on all the household chores, he didn’t regret it in the slightest.</p>
<p>Thinking about how soon he’d finally get to beat the living hell out of damn Suguru Kamoshida, Zhang Yi felt it was all worth it.</p>
