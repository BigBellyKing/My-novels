<p>Chapter 388: Not Making Money Is a Crime! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>While Chen Xu and his team were developing <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, <em>Animal Forest</em>, and porting old games,</p>
<p>the gaming industry was making waves of its own, diverting some of the attention away from Nebula Games' entry into the handheld console market.</p>
<p>After the Lunar New Year, major game developers including TengHua, NetDragon, and overseas giant Atrai began launching promotional campaigns for their new titles.</p>
<p>Whether domestic or overseas, all developers had one word prominently featured in their marketing: Open-World.</p>
<p>Science fiction, urban, fantasy; FPS, ARPG, ACT—no matter the theme or genre,</p>
<p>everyone was branding their games as "open-world."</p>
<p>Moreover, the promotional focus generally centered on two aspects:</p>
<p>Large maps and numerous quests.</p>
<p>Clearly, these game developers were capitalizing on the outstanding success of <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>,</p>
<p>a title that had achieved both critical acclaim and massive profits.</p>
<p>As a result, competition in marketing became fierce, pushing developers to their limits.</p>
<p>It was understandable—players indeed had great passion for open-world games,</p>
<p>but the sudden flood of blockbuster titles all claiming to be "open-world" created a problematic situation.</p>
<p>Especially in the domestic market, with both NetDragon and TengHua involved—both already well-known names—</p>
<p>and both launching new titles on the Huanyu VR Platform,</p>
<p>they spared no expense in their promotional campaigns.</p>
<p>NetDragon was developing an open-world FPS set in a vast, exotic land, where players take on the role of an elite special forces unit combating drug cartels.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, TengHua was reviving a classic ACT franchise that had been declining in popularity. The series traditionally focused on fast-paced mowing grass gameplay, and this time they aimed to reinvent it using the open-world selling point.</p>
<p>Whether the games would actually be fun remained to be seen, but in terms of marketing hype, both NetDragon and TengHua had maxed out their efforts.</p>
<p>While they fought fiercely, Chen Xu remained completely relaxed.</p>
<p>"You two fight it out. Nebula Games has no VR plans in the near future anyway."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the first prototype of the Switch had already been completed.</p>
<p>Compared to his previous life, most technologies in this Parallel World were readily available.</p>
<p>Especially HD Rumble—Chen Xu had tested it with a simple demo.</p>
<p>For example, when landing from a height onto surfaces like water, gravel, dirt, metal, or concrete, the vibrations from the voice coil motor provided excellent feedback.</p>
<p>It felt just like the DualSense controller from his previous life.</p>
<p>Additionally, Chen Xu had instructed Yan Xiong to pay close attention to the details.</p>
<p>At the very least, they had to avoid the infamous joystick drift issue that plagued the previous life’s Switch—</p>
<p>where players’ joysticks would start drifting after just two months of use, forcing them to inject WD-40 into the controller.</p>
<p>Controllers were consumables; some wear and tear was inevitable.</p>
<p>But the damage rate of the previous life’s Joy-Con was simply too high.</p>
<p>Of course, this was partly due to Nintendo’s consistent cost-cutting in materials.</p>
<p>Nintendo’s quality control had always been a meme, with people joking, "If the quality improves, how will they make money from hardware?"</p>
<p>The prototype in front of him was entirely black—both the console and the controllers.</p>
<p>Unlike the classic red and blue from his previous life.</p>
<p>But color was an easy fix—whether red and blue,</p>
<p>or even a seven-color rainbow, they could produce it.</p>
<p>The overall design was similar to the previous life’s version, but multiple refinements had been made due to technological differences in this Parallel World.</p>
<p>The most noticeable improvements were a sturdier build and a reduced bezel size, which had been a common criticism of the original Switch.</p>
<p>Additionally, features added later in the previous life—such as Bluetooth support—were now built-in from the start.</p>
<p>There was also an integrated voice system, allowing players to use voice commands directly in tablet mode.</p>
<p>Then there was the game cartridge system.</p>
<p>Chen Xu had initially considered whether to keep physical cartridges, since digital games were mainstream in this Parallel World, and physical copies were mostly for collectors.</p>
<p>However, after discussing with Yan Xiong, he learned that cartridge production costs in this world were not high.</p>
<p>This led Chen Xu to decide to retain the cartridge format.</p>
<p>Of course, like in his previous life, the cartridges would include a bittering agent—</p>
<p>for safety, and also as a potential marketing gimmick.</p>
<p>He disassembled a Switch controller, then attached it to the dock to switch into TV Mode.</p>
<p>Although no games were yet adapted, several test demos had been specifically developed.</p>
<p>The system was already highly polished.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, what do you think?"</p>
<p>"Some minor details can still be adjusted, but overall, there are no major issues," Chen Xu nodded.</p>
<p>"Also, Mr. Chen, the cartridge samples have been produced," Yan Xiong reported.</p>
<p>Cartridge production was outsourced, while iQue handled quality control and verification.</p>
<p>All relevant patents and brand registrations had already been secured.</p>
<p>All that remained was finalizing the specifications and beginning mass production.</p>
<p>"And not just the Switch and cartridges—don’t forget we can produce our own accessories: screen protectors, protective cases, additional controllers, docks, and other merchandise," Chen Xu instructed Yan Xiong.</p>
<p>"Huh!?" Yan Xiong was taken aback.</p>
<p>"The Switch has a touchscreen—don’t players need screen protectors?"</p>
<p>"And protective cases—just like phone cases, the Switch is a portable handheld, so won’t players want to protect it?"</p>
<p>"Even though the Joy-Con controllers are excellent, that doesn’t mean players won’t want traditional full-sized controllers."</p>
<p>"Also, bags for carrying the Switch when traveling—just because the console itself might not make a profit doesn’t mean we can’t profit from accessories."</p>
<p>"Of course, set reasonable prices—don’t make them too expensive. We shouldn’t end up with just the official label and zero cost-performance ratio," Chen Xu emphasized.</p>
<p>Once the Switch launched, most of these accessories would be essential for players.</p>
<p>And if players needed them, they had to make them.</p>
<p>Not making money when you can? That’s a crime!</p>
<p>..................</p>
<p>Days passed, and May approached.</p>
<p>Online discussions were still dominated by NetDragon and TengHua’s upcoming titles.</p>
<p>No other major new releases emerged during this time.</p>
<p>However, updates to <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> managed to grind some spotlight.</p>
<p>For many players, the most anticipated event was the annual gameplay Expo at the end of May.</p>
<p>This year’s exhibition was particularly exciting.</p>
<p>Given the intense marketing battle between NetDragon and TengHua, it was certain their rivalry would reach a boiling point at the event.</p>
<p>But just then, an unofficial news report surfaced.</p>
<p>Nebula Games would also attend the expo.</p>
<p>And they would reveal news about a new handheld console and new games.</p>
<p>Instantly, the entire gaming community, industry designers, and developers turned their attention toward Nebula Games.</p>
