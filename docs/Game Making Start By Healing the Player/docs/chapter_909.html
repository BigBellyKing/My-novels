                <p>Chapter 908: Tenth Anniversary Celebration</p>
<p>Of course, the current 'Nebula World' still has quite a few flaws. The main point is that the connection between games is not that tight.</p>
<p>After all, it involves different themes and different gameplay styles.</p>
<p>Players enter different games, experience different storylines, and after their characters gain certain abilities, some rewards and skills obtained when leaving the game, if carried over to other game scenarios, how should they be designed? Chen Xu and the team haven't been able to integrate this part into a cohesive whole.</p>
<p>One reason is the sheer number of elements, and the other is the balance issue.</p>
<p>It requires gradual version updates to slowly integrate and connect the various game worlds.</p>
<p>Of course, that's the complete version of Chen Xu's envisioned 'Nebula World', which is still a very distant goal.</p>
<p>Moreover, there aren't many complete storylines for existing games. Many of these games will also adopt Parallel World settings like in “BioShock Infinite”, as many games are interconnected.</p>
<p>Secondly, when players change the original main storyline in a game, it naturally requires designing one, or even multiple, development path gameplays.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>“This is outrageous! 10% dividend, are they begging us?!”</p>
<p>“It’s good enough to get 10%. If you were even a little useful, you wouldn't be completely useless.”</p>
<p>“But speaking of which, the Pacific Standard Heist is incredibly exciting!”</p>
<p>In Los Santos, Zhang Yi, Yang Xin, and Song Ren were discussing the just-completed Pacific Standard Heist.</p>
<p>Looking at their million-dollar dividends, the three of them each drove a sports car, enjoying the scenery of the Los Santos coastline.</p>
<p>Over such a long time, the three had evolved into veteran robbers.</p>
<p>Even their choice of vehicles had changed from blindly trusting the Armored Kuruma to now pursuing stylish sports cars.</p>
<p>Although the armored Armored Kuruma was bulletproof, it didn't mean it was invincible.</p>
<p>When facing bombs, the Armored Kuruma was practically a glass cannon.</p>
<p>“But damn, 'Vice City (Game)' is too much of a grind. It’s full of sports cars and real estate. Going by the earnings from the Pacific Standard Heist, the grind points in just one city like Los Santos are unbearable!” Zhang Yi said with some emotion.</p>
<p>Compared to the 250,000 Yuan apartment he started with, he now lived in a manor villa in Hollywood.</p>
<p>But opening the map and looking at the properties in various communities in Los Santos, he could only sigh in admiration.</p>
<p>Let alone collecting all the private planes, cruise ships, and sports cars.</p>
<p>“Don’t even talk about it. With this current model, our earning speed can’t keep up with the update speed!” Song Ren said with tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Eh… what’s this? A Nebula Games Platform UI Pop-up Window!?”</p>
<p>While chatting in the game, Zhang Yi’s eyes suddenly widened in surprise.</p>
<p>Because on his game interface, a Nebula Games Platform pop-up window appeared.</p>
<p>Not just him, but all players logged into the Nebula Games Platform had the same expression.</p>
<p>For most platforms, advertisement pop-ups are quite common.</p>
<p>But Nebula Games was an oddity among them. It wasn't that they had never done it; back when the Nebula Games Platform hadn't fully become the industry leader, they had used pop-ups to promote their own games.</p>
<p>However, as Nebula Games’ influence in the industry grew, and its reputation soared, such pop-ups basically stopped appearing.</p>
<p>Now, a pop-up suddenly appearing, how could players not be surprised?</p>
<p>Zhang Yi and Song Ren stopped bragging and immediately looked at the content of the pop-up.</p>
<p>‘What the heck!? An invitation letter!?’</p>
<p>Zhang Yi’s eyes widened, a look of astonishment on his face.</p>
<p>Numerous familiar game LOGO icons served as the background, but just looking at the title in the center was enough to surprise players.</p>
<p>‘Nebula Games Tenth Anniversary Celebration Invitation Letter’</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>All players worldwide looked at the pop-up invitation letter before them, completely bewildered.</p>
<p>At its inception, Nebula Games stunned many Lewd Persons in the country with its game 'Mirror (Game)'.</p>
<p>Of course, due to its theme, 'Mirror (Game)' later became a "dark history" of Nebula Games that many players joked about.</p>
<p>But this was nothing; after all, which major game developer in the previous life hadn’t made an Adult Game or two?</p>
<p>Capcom, the action game maestro? Sega, the former arcade overlord? Enix, the glory of JRPGs? They’ve all made adult games, alright.</p>
<p>And Koei Tecmo was an absolute pioneer in the adult game industry. Do you wonder why the female character designs in Koei Tecmo titles like Dynasty Warriors and Dead or Alive are so outstanding?</p>
<p>That’s their corporate legacy! They’ve got your XP preferences down perfectly.</p>
<p>Also, don’t let Nintendo’s honest appearance fool you; they also ran adult hotels and adult poker games in their early days.</p>
<p>For a major game developer to start out making adult games, is that embarrassing? Of course not!</p>
<p>As the pop-up message appeared, it spread like an explosion throughout the player community.</p>
<p>‘Holy crap! Tenth Anniversary Celebration? Nebula Games is already ten years old?’</p>
<p>‘Time flies when you think about it! When I first played 'Mirror (Game)' from Nebula Games, I was an ignorant middle school freshman, and now I’ve already graduated from college.’</p>
<p>‘+1, 'Mirror (Game)' was my sexual awakening!’</p>
<p>‘Ten years ago, when I played 'Mirror (Game)', I was a Single person. Ten years later, I’m still a Single person!’</p>
<p>‘LOL, only old fans of Nebula Games would know about 'Mirror (Game)' now!’</p>
<p>‘Honestly, as a pioneer in the adult game industry, Mr. Chen’s 'Mirror (Game)' back then was like a shining star in the night sky.’</p>
<p>‘Exactly, it also spurred a large number of developers to upgrade their adult games.’</p>
<p>‘Isn't this the original internal competition in the industry? Holy cow, even those making adult games started competing intensely?’</p>
<p>‘By the way, isn't Nebula Games' celebration usually held at the theme park?’</p>
<p>‘Looking at the invitation, it seems it’s taking place within the Nebula World. Are they going to livestream it for us?’</p>
<p>‘Holy crap, holding a tenth-anniversary celebration like this, it’s the first time I’ve seen it!’</p>
<p>This invitation instantly caused an uproar in the gaming industry, mainly because it was so novel.</p>
<p>It’s not uncommon for game developers to hold events for their anniversaries.</p>
<p>The key was that Nebula Games this time was planning to hold it <em>within the game</em>, which completely erupted among players.</p>
<p>Even many players still battling in their games immediately ditched them.</p>
<p>Those playing 'DOTA' would rather force-quit into the dark room to find out immediately. Those playing 'World of Warcraft' simply chose to kick the bucket in place to meet Sister Angel. And those playing 'Vice City (Game)'? No need to mention, they just went AFK on the spot.</p>
<p>And these players, upon exiting their games or those not currently playing, upon entering the Nebula Games Platform, were greeted with the biggest update in history.
