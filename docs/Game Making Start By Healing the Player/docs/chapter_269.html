<p>Chapter 268: Map Editor and Optimization Improvements (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>After the meeting, Chen Xu returned to his office to meticulously refine the game design documents in greater detail.</p>
<p>Unlike other RTS titles, in <em>Warcraft</em>, the races, unit types, building attributes—all of these are entirely distinct.</p>
<p>Each comes with its own detailed numerical design, making this aspect particularly complex.</p>
<p>This complexity, however, is precisely what forms the core essence of <em>Warcraft</em>.</p>
<p>Each race possesses unique characteristics and specific strategic roles.</p>
<p>For example, Night Elves' structures like the Ancient of War (Barracks) can not only produce units but also stand up, move, and attack.</p>
<p>Thus, Night Elves typically place their Ancient of War adjacent to neutral creeps, then use it alongside their starting hero to rapidly level up to tier 2.</p>
<p>Similarly, Humans can transform Peasants into Militia via their Town Hall, allowing them to quickly expand to an expansion base, creep, and develop during the early game.</p>
<p>Furthermore, depending on the starting hero's abilities, countless tactical variations emerge.</p>
<p>For instance, when Orcs start with the Blademaster, using Wind Walk enables harassment of enemy Peasants, tailing online multiplayer groups to steal kills and loot from monsters at low health, or investing all early economy into purchasing stat-boosting items from the neutral shop to maximize the Blademaster’s combat prowess.</p>
<p>When Humans face Orcs with access to the neutral tavern, they may abandon their economic expansion advantage, instead focusing entirely on leveling their starting Arch-Mage. At level 3, they can purchase the Beastmaster from the neutral tavern to harass the opponent, while saving up for Paladins and Priests. Once the force is sufficiently developed, they buy the Mass Healing Scroll and Mini Tower from the Human Shop. Once they have a sufficient number of casters, they advance with Militia and Mini Towers to construct Arrow Towers, ultimately overwhelming the Orcs.</p>
<p>Race traits, building mechanics, and hero synergies—these elements constitute the core aspects that distinguish <em>Warcraft</em> from other RTS games.</p>
<p>Delving deeper, the game further differentiates units by Attack Types, Armor Types, individual unit Skills, and intricate numerical balances.</p>
<p>Even Attack Types alone are divided into Regular, Piercing, Hero, Chaos, Siege, and Magic. Armor Types are similarly categorized into Light, Medium, Heavy, Fortified, Hero, and Unarmored.</p>
<p>Chen Xu had already tasked Qin Yi with developing the Damage Model.</p>
<p>The priority was to establish the various types and corresponding Damage Calculation Ratios. Classifying monsters would come later.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin were handling the Art production for <em>Warcraft</em>.</p>
<p>Main characters such as Arthas, Illidan, Tyrande, Sylvanas, and Jaina were naturally being personally overseen by Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Judging solely by in-game character models, by today’s standards, they were truly abysmal.</p>
<p>However, the concept art for these characters was, and always had been, top-tier.</p>
<p>But the game wasn’t limited to just these main characters.</p>
<p>Common units—Human soldiers, Orc soldiers, Undead Ghouls—also required dedicated Art production.</p>
<p>Additionally, significant modifications were needed for gameplay operations and UI interactions.</p>
<p>This area demanded extensive changes.</p>
<p>Although <em>Warcraft</em>’s game design philosophy was unquestionable, it was heavily constrained by the technological limitations of its time, resulting in a user experience that was often counterintuitive, even unreasonable.</p>
<p>One major flaw was player interaction.</p>
<p>In the previous life, <em>Warcraft</em> did not support Custom Keybinds.</p>
<p>For example, using items in the Hero’s Item inventory required the numeric keypad.</p>
<p>This design stemmed from the fact that <em>Warcraft</em> featured Unit Grouping, reserving the number keys on the main keyboard for that function.</p>
<p>Thus, the Item inventory had to default to the numpad.</p>
<p>For most casual players, this design was awkward.</p>
<p>Especially for noobs.</p>
<p>Unit Grouping?</p>
<p>Why would I need that? Just box-select with the mouse and blind A-move—focus entirely on controlling one hero and be done with it.</p>
<p>Additionally, there were persistent font bugs—when a map contained excessive resources or ran for extended durations, text would often turn into garbled characters.</p>
<p>These were all limitations of past game development technology. Now, Chen Xu was determined to address these flaws seriously, correcting them to make the game more polished and enjoyable.</p>
<p>As for the game’s story, Chen Xu had temporarily set it aside—it wasn’t urgent.</p>
<p>Beyond these aspects, there was another critically important direction—one that could be considered the most brilliant design in <em>Warcraft</em>.</p>
<p>It was this very feature that allowed <em>Warcraft</em> to endure for decades, keeping countless players immersed long after its release.</p>
<p>That was the <em>Warcraft</em> Map Editor.</p>
<p>Put simply, <em>Warcraft</em> was the magnum opus of the RTS genre.</p>
<p>And the <em>Warcraft</em> Map Editor unlocked even greater possibilities for the game.</p>
<p>Many players weren’t introduced to <em>Warcraft</em> through its story, campaigns, or RTS gameplay.</p>
<p>Instead, they got into the game through fun and creative RPG maps.</p>
<p>Defend the Sword Pass, Defend Athena, Fantasy Cao Cao's Biography, Monopoly of the World, Pyramid Escape, Calamity of the Western World, Cops and Robbers, Trolls and Elves, Rabbit vs. Sheep War, Human Invincible, War of the Minions…</p>
<p>Even legendary games like <em>DOTA</em> emerged from this ecosystem. <em>DOTA</em>, in particular, was inseparable from the MOBA era that followed in the previous life.</p>
<p>Blizzard Entertainment’s creation of the Map Editor originated from ideas in <em>StarCraft</em>, but it was incomplete and overly complex. It wasn’t until <em>Warcraft 3</em> that the Map Editor became relatively robust.</p>
<p>Yet, even then, it was seen merely as a minor addition to <em>Warcraft</em>’s content. Blizzard themselves failed to recognize its monumental potential.</p>
<p>This ignorance later led to the DOTA copyright dispute with IceFrog.</p>
<p>Fully aware of this history, Chen Xu naturally wouldn’t underestimate the Map Editor.</p>
<p>Instead, he was determined to perfect it.</p>
<p>After all, in the previous life, as time progressed, legendary community players iterated on the <em>Warcraft</em> Map Editor multiple times, adding even more content.</p>
<p>Beyond in-game heroes, units, buildings, and their attributes, the editor also allowed for shaping the game map itself.</p>
<p>Forests, water surfaces, rocks—additionally, weather and time settings existed in the game. Time even influenced the state of neutral monsters, determining whether they were awake or asleep. Vision Radius also varied between day and night.</p>
<p>However, compared to the previous life’s Map Editor, Chen Xu felt it was still overly complex.</p>
<p>While the old Map Editor was powerful, map creation still required a certain level of coding knowledge.</p>
<p>For Chen Xu, with the technology of the Parallel World, a far more open-ended design was entirely feasible.</p>
<p>For veteran modders seeking to create intricate, fascinating maps, higher-level API access could be granted.</p>
<p>For average players, the Map Editor could allow them to easily create simple defense maps based on the game’s existing mechanics.</p>
<p>Just like <em>Overcooked</em>, <em>Fall Guys</em>, and <em>Minecraft</em> with their MOD support.</p>
<p>Let more casual players tinker and create entertaining maps with minimal effort. Why couldn’t the Map Editor itself become a core gameplay feature?</p>
<p>For example, categorize diverse maps within a shared community, allowing players to like maps they play and support their creators.</p>
<p>Create an open community similar to <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous life’s official platform, which became a monetizing tool after being managed by a “raising them like livestock” company—while Blizzard’s remaster quality was to blame, why did the official WAR3 platform also devolve into a cash-grabbing machine, with RPG maps increasingly resembling web games?</p>
<p>Ultimately, it came down to platform commercialization. True, many map creators chose to share their work for free or out of nostalgia.</p>
<p>But WAR3’s map community never achieved the healthy environment of <em>Minecraft</em>. If your map didn’t include the in-game store platform, it wouldn’t even appear in room listings. Worse, if the platform deemed your map unprofitable, it wouldn’t even pass censorship.</p>
<p>Therefore, building a positive community environment was essential.</p>
<p>Fortunately, for Chen Xu, Nebula Games already had relevant experience in this area.</p>
<p>Of course, platform censorship remained crucial. Maps like <em>Seven Dwarfs and Snow White</em>, <em>Defend Athena (Tough Guy Edition)</em>, or <em>Princess Xiangxiang</em>—ones that excited Lewd Persons—should simply vanish from the Parallel World.</p>
<p>Hmm… at the very least, players wouldn’t find them through official channels.</p>
<p>Sitting in his office, Chen Xu pondered various directions for optimizing and improving <em>Warcraft</em>.</p>
