<p>Chapter 307: First Game Experience (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Amidst the eager anticipation of passionate players.</p>
<p>Chen Xu's official Weibo account, Nebula Games, and NetDragon's official websites all announced content related to the trial experience of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>.</p>
<p>But it wasn't just about players being able to download the game from the official VR sections of the Nebula Games Platform and NetDragon Games Platform.</p>
<p>There was also an offline event.</p>
<p>An Early Access trial held in collaboration with VR internet cafes across major cities nationwide.</p>
<p>For online players, early access required purchasing the game in advance. For offline players, the VR internet cafes provided a VR internet cafe exclusive version. Players could log in directly using their NetDragon and Nebula Games accounts, play the game, and save their account data.</p>
<p>However, compared to typical VR games, the pricing of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> was slightly cheaper.</p>
<p>After all, the game itself featured in-app purchase content similar to cosmetic skins, and it was purely an online game with no single-player content.</p>
<p>The domestic price was set at 499 Yuan (Chinese currency), while the overseas pricing was 99 dollars.</p>
<p>As for overseas regions, there were no similar offline VR internet cafe events due to operational constraints.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Time quickly arrived at February 1st. With the New Year arriving relatively late this year, there were still over half a month left.</p>
<p>For players who had long been eagerly awaiting <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, they couldn't wait to dive into the game the moment it unlocked.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi and Wang Han, who were already on their New Year's Holiday, made plans to head to a VR internet cafe together.</p>
<p>They actually owned VR gaming equipment themselves, but there was only one set at home.</p>
<p>Who got to play became a crucial factor. Plus, their old friend Song Ren had been busy before but was now free as the New Year approached.</p>
<p>So everyone seized this opportunity to meet up Offline (referring to real-life connections), enjoy the fun of gaming during the day, and then gather for dinner in the evening.</p>
<p>"There are so many people here! Seems like most of them are here to try out <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>!" After paying and checking in at the front desk, Zhang Yi and the others found a private room with five sleeping pods available. In the center of the main hall hung a massive screen broadcasting a match of <em>Warcraft</em>, clearly a high-ranked player's session from the PC section of this internet cafe. Zhang Yi also noticed a small window on the side displaying a countdown for <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>'s launch. Obviously, once the game went live, it would replace the current broadcast as the featured gameplay.</p>
<p>"Well, it's almost New Year, and lately, hasn't this been the only blockbuster released?" Song Ren wasn't particularly surprised.</p>
<p>"Alright, enough talk. Let's quickly get on the machines and log in to wait for the server launch. By the way, did you guys buy the game?" Wang Han asked.</p>
<p>"Of course we did! How could we not buy Mr. Chen's game?" Song Ren replied.</p>
<p>Wang Yifan and Joey nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Chatting as they went, the group entered the gaming pods, eagerly anticipating the game's launch.</p>
<p>The moment it unlocked, everyone rushed into the game as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Previously, Chen Xu and NetDragon Games had discussed with the Game Department about the possibility of releasing the military version to players, but in the end, they couldn't make it happen.</p>
<p>However, the differences between the military version and the player version were mostly in minor details.</p>
<p>For example, in hostage scenarios, defenders could force hostages to move to positions advantageous to them—this was already predetermined.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game provided absolutely no hints. There was no notification telling players their position was exposed when scanned.</p>
<p>Heartbeat Sensors didn't emit obvious beeping sounds, and equipment like breaching rounds had different performance and destructive power compared to what players experienced in regular gameplay.</p>
<p>Chen Xu estimated that if these elements were presented to players, they might find it interesting at first.</p>
<p>But soon, they would stop playing—it would just be a selling point.</p>
<p>After all, it was far too unbalanced. For attackers, the disadvantage would be extreme.</p>
<p>But that was closer to real-life situations.</p>
<p>"The game forces you to go through the new player tutorial!" Zhang Yi said in the voice channel.</p>
<p>"Same here. What's the big deal about a tutorial? It'll be over quickly, right?" Song Ren responded.</p>
<p>"I've already started!"</p>
<p>Compared to the <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> from his previous life, Chen Xu had put considerable effort into the game's guidance system.</p>
<p>The root reason was that <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> wasn't a simple casual game.</p>
<p>The maps were slightly more complex than those in typical FPS games. Without consulting a map guide, getting lost during your first playthrough of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> was practically routine.</p>
<p>Add to that the various Operators' unique skills, making the learning curve quite steep.</p>
<p>Therefore, upon entering the game, players would undergo relevant new player training.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game included an in-game information system.</p>
<p>This featured skill effect demonstration videos for each Operator, layered maps of the levels, and camera locations.</p>
<p>All designed to better assist players in understanding these elements within the game.</p>
<p>Song Ren was the first to enter the game's tutorial.</p>
<p>Eleven Operators were displayed, but currently, only the Recruit was available.</p>
<p>So there wasn't much choice.</p>
<p>He entered the game tutorial.</p>
<p>"Shooting, running, crouching, prone, stealth walk, fast roping... You can breach windows like this too!"</p>
<p>Song Ren watched as the character in the game kicked off the wall, swung back on the rope, and slammed through wooden planks to breach the window, visibly excited.</p>
<p>Scenes like this, usually only seen in movies, felt incredibly cool with the VR perspective's feedback—utterly awesome!</p>
<p>Other operations didn't pose much of a problem.</p>
<p>The only thing was that character movements—running and walking—were relatively slow in this game.</p>
<p>But it made sense. After all, carrying counter-terrorism gear weighing十几斤 to二十几斤, how could they not be slow?</p>
<p>"So this is how attackers operate: start with a small drone, enter the building, and begin investigating and collecting information."</p>
<p>"Hey, will I be detected if I scan? So if someone scans me, I'll get a notification too."</p>
<p>Looking at the notification screen that appeared after his drone, peeking through a door crack to scan enemies, was immediately destroyed by AI, Song Ren suddenly understood.</p>
<p>The entire new player tutorial didn't cover overly complex content, focusing mainly on basic knowledge.</p>
<p>Operations, information gathering and feedback for attackers and defenders, functions of different equipment, how to use Operator skills, and how to win in three different modes.</p>
<p>After completing a total of five new player tutorial levels, Song Ren, no stranger to FPS games, passed through quickly.</p>
<p>Then he obtained selection qualification for 10 Operators—five attackers and five defenders.</p>
<p>Since he didn't know which ones were good, apart from setting Feng (Mythra) as a must-pick attacker and Lesion as a must-pick defender.</p>
<p>Though the character's real name was Liao Zilang, saying "Lesion" just felt so much more natural with that English name.</p>
<p>For the remaining slots, he picked randomly.</p>
<p>For example, Blackbeard, Ash, and Sledge—characters that left a strong impression on him from the promotional video. For the last slot, he didn't particularly like shield-bearing characters, so he turned his attention to a Russian character.</p>
<p>Fuze, according to the description, specialized in explosives—both his Operator skill and equipment revolved around explosives. Clearly a powerhouse in firepower output, a perfect match for him.</p>
<p>"You guys haven't finished the tutorial yet?" After selecting his Operators, the voice channel fell silent. Song Ren broke the silence, feeling a bit depressed.</p>
<p>"Not yet, I'm only on the third level!"</p>
<p>"Just reached the fourth level! The sense of immersion in this game is really strong! And destroying buildings is especially fun!"</p>
<p>"Yeah! I've destroyed everything in the building that could be torn down!"</p>
<p>Hearing their responses, Song Ren felt even more frustrated.</p>
<p>The fastest among them had only just started the fourth level?</p>
<p>"Then I'll go try out Terrorist Hunt Mode first to warm up. When you're done, call me!" Song Ren said.</p>
<p>Waiting around was a bit boring, so he decided to try out Terrorist Hunt Mode.</p>
<p>From the description, it seemed to be the game's PVE content, and it supported solo play—perfect for passing time while waiting for his friends.</p>
<p>As for the information station?</p>
<p>He never bothered with that when playing games!</p>
<p>A veteran FPS player like him—did he need it?</p>
<p>"Regular, Hardened, Realistic? Let's try Realistic difficulty this time."</p>
<p>Looking at the available options, Song Ren decided to give the Realistic difficulty in Lone Wolf Terrorist Hunt a try.</p>
<p>Let's see just how realistic this difficulty really was.</p>
