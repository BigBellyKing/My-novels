                <h2>Chapter 9: Go Away, Woman, Don't Disturb My Match-3! (Requesting recommendations)</h2>
<p>In the next story.</p>
<p>A young lord from the Warring States period. Her mission and duty were to defend her family from ruin.</p>
<p>Once, she found a magical bronze mirror that transported her to an incredible place. Here, there was no war or strife; everyone could live freely and happily. Dazzled by the prosperous scene, she unknowingly encountered him: an Otaku who wasn't entirely useless.</p>
<p>Their first meeting was very unpleasant; they even had a fight. She lost, and according to the rules of her world, he was thenceforth her husband.</p>
<p>When she was hungry, the Otaku took her out for a meal. A pork cutlet rice bowl, which surprised her greatly: “So much meat, that must cost a lot, right?” Because in her world, common people couldn’t afford meat.</p>
<p>Here, she also tasted a type of alcohol called beer for the first time. ‘What is this? It’s so good to drink,’ she said happily, hugging the bottle, completely drunk.</p>
<p>This was probably her most relaxed moment.</p>
<p>After her hangover, she woke up and picked up the bronze mirror that had brought her to this world. She brought the Otaku back to her own world with her.</p>
<p>However, this didn't bring much change. In her world, everything remained as it was before. The Ketsuno family was still on the verge of collapse, with dangerous enemies watching covetously.</p>
<p>The only change, perhaps, was this not-so-powerful 'husband'. He became the captain of her personal guard, but that was all. Even with his arrival, the Ketsuno family's downfall couldn't be avoided.</p>
<p>Two months later, she sat covered in bloodstains on the city wall, the continuous war and bloodshed staining the land red. Outside the city, corpses piled up like mountains, and killing cries shook the heavens. Those were the enemies about to breach the city.</p>
<p>Looking at the approaching enemies outside the city, she knew that in the end, she had failed to keep the Ketsuno family alive in these turbulent times. “It seems the Ketsuno family’s three hundred years of glory are about to be shattered.”</p>
<p>The Otaku desperately tried to persuade her to escape, but she merely shook her head gently. “Makoto, I am different from you. From the day Father draped the battle robe over me, I swore… to protect the Ketsuno family’s glory with my life.”</p>
<p>The Otaku brought up a pile of examples and reasons, trying to convince her: “The general trend of the world is that what has been long divided must unite, and what has been long united must divide. Your Ketsuno family isn't the only one to be destroyed.”</p>
<p>“Makoto, you wouldn’t understand. Here lie the dreams and efforts of generations of the Ketsuno family. Take this bronze mirror and go quickly.” She confided everything to him. After hearing her, he even demanded she leave with him. But, she had her beliefs; how could she agree? If she had been willing to abandon those beliefs, why would she have returned in the first place?</p>
<p>Closing her eyes, she felt his voice had disappeared, replaced only by the sound of enemies breaking through the city. “Makoto, have you gone? You really… left, huh… Actually, I really wanted to go with you too.”</p>
<p>“I also want to drink beer with you again… That beer, it was really good… It was really good!” Tears welled up in her eyes, uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Memories of the past resurfaced, and a character portrait holding a wine glass appeared in the center of the screen. “Husband, this wine is truly delicious! How about two more glasses? Look, I’ve drunk it all. You should have two glasses too. Come, cheers!”</p>
<p>And in this daze, she faintly heard his voice:</p>
<p>“KILL!!!! I am Ketsuno Anna’s personal guard captain! Those who block me shall be mercilessly slain!!”</p>
<p>Jiang Ping couldn't help but sniffle, looking at the game that had returned to the main interface, and then closed his slightly sore eyes. He didn't open them again until a long moment later.</p>
<p>“Are you insane?!”</p>
<p>“This game of yours is insane! A Gentleman's Game, why are the character portraits so good, the voice actors so good, and the Match-3 combat system also so well-made? Is it free?!”</p>
<p>“I just wanted to play a Gentleman's Game, why did you make it so emotional?!”</p>
<p>While ‘complaining’ verbally, Jiang Ping’s hand showed no hesitation. Of course, this wasn't pulling out toilet paper; it was exiting the game’s main interface and decisively going into the store to leave a positive review. Although it wasn't within the refund period, directly reviewing the game meant he couldn't get a refund.</p>
<p>But this wasn't important at all; the subsequent content goes without saying. Just for this, Jiang Ping felt it was worth it. He even thought the developer was an idiot for selling it at 10 Yuan!</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>It wasn't just Jiang Ping. Through an unknown overseas forum, many LSP players, upon discovering this game, clicked into it with curiosity. When they exited, everyone was filled with emotion.</p>
<p>Some were moved by the game’s story.</p>
<p>The story of elves and demons made them reflect on the good and evil of human nature. Humans willingly degenerated, while an alien elf helped them, only to be repaid with ingratitude.</p>
<p>The story of the Otaku and the female general deeply moved them. He seemed like a useless Otaku, but when it was time to leave, he burst forth with courage and responsibility unimaginable to ordinary people.</p>
<p>The story of the dragon maid and the knight was a long and wonderful journey. “Whose achievements surpass even those of ancient Sage-Kings Yao and Shun? Who can compare with me? Because of us, evil behemoths dare not harm all quarters; because of us, greedy authorities dare not oppress the common people.”</p>
<p>And the story of Caiyun and Mingyue made many LSP players burst into tears. Even if you are Mingyue’s reincarnation, Qingfeng is Qingfeng. Two hundred years of waiting, two hundred years of reincarnation; the story of Mingyue and Caiyun should have ended two hundred years ago.</p>
<p>It was clearly a game that LSPs loved the most. Why did it feel so heavy and so sad after playing it?</p>
<p>These players understood what the content in those previous posts meant. In this instant, they felt the same way.</p>
<p>Of course, there were also many impatient gentlemen who, not being good at Match-3 games, were directly turned away at the door.</p>
<p>“Caiyun Junior Sister, please stop torturing me! Open the door for me! I’m your Mingyue Senior Brother, let me see you!”</p>
<p>These players repeatedly studied the game's Match-3 combat system and continuously grinded for scores and money to upgrade and buy items. Eventually, these players evolved. They no longer paid any attention to the gentlemanly content in the game; instead, they became obsessed with the Match-3 game within it. It was simple, straightforward, and not lacking in fun.</p>
<p>For a Gentleman's Game, it was simply incredible!</p>
<p>It’s just that the girl next to me is actually a bit annoying; she’s blocking me from playing Match-3!</p>
<p>Go away, woman! Quickly step aside, don't disturb me playing Match-3! This time, with my wisdom, I will definitely break the previous score record!</p>
<p>(End of Chapter)
