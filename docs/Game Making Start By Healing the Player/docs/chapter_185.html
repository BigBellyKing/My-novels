<p>Chapter 184: Who Am I? Where Am I? (Fourth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>After spending an afternoon immersed in <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em>, Song Ren exited the game and took a deep breath, glancing at the darkening sky outside the window.</p>
<p>It was just too passionate!</p>
<p>That was the sole conclusion he drew after hours of gameplay.</p>
<p>Let’s not even mention the awkwardness of starting in the Catacombs for now.</p>
<p>But after great hardship finally reaching the Undead Burg Outskirts, he had only one overwhelming impression:</p>
<p>The residents here were far too enthusiastic.</p>
<p>The local villagers, armed with straight swords and axes, warmly welcomed visiting Undead.</p>
<p>Along the way, the Black Knight offered equally warm hospitality.</p>
<p>Especially upon arriving at the Prison Tower—when confronted with an uninvited Undead guest, Javier didn’t get angry. Instead, he picked up his dragon-tooth massage rod and gave the Undead a full-body massage.</p>
<p>What players didn’t know was that Chen Xu had made a few subtle modifications to Javier.</p>
<p>In the original version, there were multiple ways to defeat Javier—strategies like the door-trapping strategy, the poop-throwing strategy, and the underhanded stair-exploiting strategy.</p>
<p>The easiest was the stair-exploiting strategy: players could run up to the Watchtower stairs, then jump down just as Javier climbed up.</p>
<p>The player would lose health, but because Javier wore Heavy Armor, he’d also take significant fall damage.</p>
<p>Since the player had Estus Flasks and Javier didn’t, Javier would ultimately perish beneath the 'dishonorable' Undead’s scheme.</p>
<p>To this, Chen Xu made a few adjustments.</p>
<p>After all, drinking an Estus Flask no longer froze the Undead in place as in the original.</p>
<p>So now, while Javier still took fall damage, it was slightly reduced. His recovery speed after falling was also faster, and the conditions for triggering the jump-down mechanic were stricter—adding just a bit more challenge for players.</p>
<p>And when the Undead finally reached the city walls, things became even more extreme.</p>
<p>Amidst arrows fired by two Hollow common soldiers on the wall, the Undead were invited to enjoy a Tauren feast—though the meal came served a little too hot.</p>
<p>Later, on a wide bridge, a passing Red Dragon generously lit up the sky with a fireworks display, burning pyrotechnics at great cost just for the Undead’s entertainment.</p>
<p>"I thought I was Invincible after countless playthroughs," Song Ren leaned back in his chair and typed into the game chat group, "but it turns out I was dead wrong!"</p>
<p>His words instantly resonated with others in the chat, sparking a wave of replies:</p>
<p>'Exactly! <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em> is absolutely malicious!'</p>
<p>'Right! All these traps and mechanisms—completely Impossible to Guard Against!'</p>
<p>'I lost my first life in New Londo Ruins when I first reached Firelink Shrine!'</p>
<p>'You’re weak! I already lost my first life facing that big-butt demon in the Undead Asylum!'</p>
<p>'I wish they’d unlock teleportation soon—this feels so awkward!'</p>
<p>'Yeah, seriously!'</p>
<p>The chat group was filled with lamentations, each player recounting their painful experiences.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t just this group—identical scenes played out across every major forum community. Countless players from the first wave of access were wailing in agony.</p>
<p>These were the first buyers of <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em>, players who had eagerly jumped into the game upon release.</p>
<p>Most were veterans like Song Ren—players who had already completed the <em>Dark Souls</em> series before.</p>
<p>Before even starting, they had been brimming with confidence.</p>
<p>After all, they were no strangers to <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>Most had already Cleared the Game, some even on their second playthrough, third playthrough, or even eighth.</p>
<p>These Dark Souls veterans were deeply confident in their skills.</p>
<p>As excellent kindling bearers, they had overcome countless hardships.</p>
<p>Nameless King? Lords of Cinder? Farron Undead Legion? All were mere pushovers before them.</p>
<p>Hadn’t they defeated every single one?</p>
<p>By the end, <em>Dark Souls</em> had become more of a fashion and progression game for them.</p>
<p>So beating a prequel should’ve been easy to handle, right?</p>
<p>Yet the moment they entered this game, they realized—they were wrong.</p>
<p>Dead wrong!</p>
<p>Chen Xu had mostly retained the combat system from the previous entries rather than reverting to the original.</p>
<p>After all, many original mechanics severely disrupted player flow—especially the need for the Undead to stand completely still while drinking Estus Flasks.</p>
<p>But even with a familiar combat system, what good did that do?</p>
<p>For games like <em>Dark Souls</em>, the true attraction lies in using a simple action system to create challenges that are both fair and difficult.</p>
<p>Basic attacks, heavy attacks that rarely get used, and weapon arts that only come into play under specific conditions.</p>
<p>Combined with blocking, parrying, Perfect Guard, and rolling, the entire combat system remained simple and intuitive.</p>
<p>The real difficulty lay in the varied attack routines of each BOSS and monster.</p>
<p>Brand-new enemies, brand-new BOSSes—even with the same core mechanics—without knowing how to respond or being able to read a BOSS’s tells at the start of a fight, players would still have to suffer.</p>
<p>And there was another, even more critical factor: the map design of <em>Dark Souls 1</em>.</p>
<p>Arguably, the most praised aspect of <em>Dark Souls 1</em> wasn’t its combat, BOSS design, or story.</p>
<p>Not that those were bad—rather, one element completely overshadowed them all:</p>
<p>The brilliant level map design. Each level was filled with Puzzle Solving, and traps lurked around every corner.</p>
<p>The entire environment was crafted into a massive, seamless whole, structured in a multi-layered, three-dimensional form. The connections between areas resembled a Möbius strip.</p>
<p>Firelink Shrine sat precisely at the center of this map, connected to every direction.</p>
<p>Precisely because of this, the game required players to first travel to Anor Londo and obtain the Lordvessel before enabling teleportation between bonfires.</p>
<p>The <em>Dark Souls 1</em> map was so intricately woven that changing one bonfire’s function—allowing free teleportation across locations—would ruin the elegance of the map design and level layout.</p>
<p>After all, <em>Dark Souls 3</em> used a more linear map structure.</p>
<p>If teleportation were disabled in <em>DS3</em>, players would waste enormous time traversing the map.</p>
<p>But in <em>DS1</em>, it was entirely different. The map was laced with countless interconnected shortcuts, making travel to distant areas surprisingly convenient.</p>
<p>Moreover, unlocking teleportation after obtaining the Lordvessel served as a meaningful reward milestone for players.</p>
<p>Of course, most players hadn’t yet grasped the brilliance of this design.</p>
<p>At this moment, the most immediate sensation for the majority was:</p>
<p>Who am I? Where am I?</p>
<p>On the very first day of the game’s launch,</p>
<p>the fastest-progressing players had barely managed, with the help of Solaire of Astora, to defeat the first Gargoyle and rang the first bell.</p>
<p>These were the more skilled players.</p>
<p>The vast majority of ordinary players were still being 'welcomed' by the enthusiastic villagers in the Undead Burg Outskirts.</p>
