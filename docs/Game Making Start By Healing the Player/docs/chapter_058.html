                <p>Chapter 58: This Game is Full of 'Love'!</p>
<p>At noon, inside Nebula Games.</p>
<p>Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue leaned back in massage chairs, scrolling on their phones.</p>
<p>"It seems like online players are 'targeting' you, Chen Xu!" Ruan Ningxue said, looking at Chen Xu who was beside her with his eyes closed.</p>
<p>"Yeah, exactly! The comments under the promotional official Weibo account for <em>Outlast</em> have jumped from over a thousand to twenty thousand, and they're still climbing," Yang Xin chimed in.</p>
<p>"No choice, really. Who told Chen Xu to insist he was a Warrior of Love during that media interview? <em>Outlast</em> has absolutely nothing to do with a Warrior of Love," Ruan Ningxue said.</p>
<p>At this moment, Chen Xu, who had been enjoying the massage chair service with his eyes closed, opened them.</p>
<p>He pulled out his phone, glanced at it, and showed no signs of panic. "Who says <em>Outlast</em> has nothing to do with love?"</p>
<p>"You're still too young. Watch me," Chen Xu chuckled, then pulled out his phone to send an official Weibo account post.</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>Online players were still in heated discussion, but with Chen Xu's official Weibo account post, all players fell silent.</p>
<p>Especially those who had played <em>Outlast</em> were particularly struck into silence.</p>
<p>Looking at the content of Chen Xu's official Weibo account post, all the players felt a strange sensation, yet they couldn't refute it.</p>
<p>Chen Xu's official Weibo account content read as follows:</p>
<p>"Seeing my dear players question my self-proclaimed title 'Warrior of Love,' I am deeply heartbroken!"</p>
<p>"How is <em>Outlast</em> not a game full of love?"</p>
<p>"Outside the game, this game contains my ardent love for all of you players."</p>
<p>"And the game's actual story content is also full of love!"</p>
<p>"Without spoiling anything, let me give a simple analysis, and you'll see if it makes sense."</p>
<p>"First, let's look at the game's background. The protagonist, Miles Upshur, drives alone to Mount Massive Asylum to investigate its darkness. And it's important to know that Mount Massive Asylum is funded by the multinational corporation Murkoff."</p>
<p>"What kind of mindset drives an ordinary independent journalist to risk his life to expose the conspiracy behind Mount Massive Asylum? To offend a massive, evil conglomerate? The answer is simple: justice! And what is justice? We can understand it as love, a great love!"</p>
<p>"What kind of scene does the protagonist face upon entering Mount Massive Asylum? A dilapidated asylum without a single light, where even electricity needs to be turned on manually, and along the way, there are uncooperative mental patients and doctors blocking his path."</p>
<p>"But what did our protagonist do? He repaired the basement switch for the dilapidated asylum. Even when targeted by mental patients and doctors, our protagonist never intended to harm anyone; he was merely acting in self-defense."</p>
<p>"Even facing such immense difficulties, our protagonist diligently investigated and ultimately uncovered the truth, even sacrificing his life for it."</p>
<p>"What kind of spirit is this? Isn't this an heroic and fearless warrior?!"</p>
<p>"The so-called Warrior of Love isn't just about romantic love; it also encompasses a great love, which means to care for all under heaven when one is successful!"</p>
<p>"Therefore, without a doubt, <em>Outlast</em> is a work filled with 'love' both inside and out!"</p>
<p>"I hope everyone can feel the fervent love within <em>Outlast</em>! Thank you!"</p>
<p>In the Nebula Games office, Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue, still lounging in their massage chairs, also saw the official Weibo account post.</p>
<p>Both looked at Chen Xu with very complicated expressions.</p>
<p>Good heavens, if they hadn't been involved in the game's development, they might actually have believed that spiel!</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, what is this?" Ruan Ningxue looked at Chen Xu, a bit speechless.</p>
<p>Yang Xin next to her looked at him with the same expression.</p>
<p>Before this, they had thought Chen Xu would respond to players' 'questions' with some earnest principles or official rhetoric.</p>
<p>After all, isn't that how game companies and Game Designers usually handle such 'queries' from players?</p>
<p>But they never expected that, in response to these 'questions' from players, Chen Xu would pull out such a statement.</p>
<p>The crucial part was that, listening to it, they even felt that, to a certain extent, it actually made quite a bit of sense.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>The players who had been discussing intensely online hadn't initially thought Chen Xu would proactively respond to anything.</p>
<p>But now, many players were surprised to find that Chen Xu had indeed responded.</p>
<p>And the content? It was absolutely jaw-dropping!</p>
<p>Instantly, the players who had been discussing online erupted.</p>
<p>They all expressed, "I'm cursed if I believe your nonsense!"</p>
<p>'Holy crap, what "minor love" and "great love"? I'm truly cursed if I believe your crap, Chen Xu!'</p>
<p>'I'm disgusted. What do you mean "never harmed anyone from beginning to end"? If I wanted to harm someone, give me a weapon, damn it!'</p>
<p>'Miles: Where's my gun? Where's my gun? Who saw my gun? Am I not living in a capitalist country? Aren't guns allowed here? Why don't I have a gun!'</p>
<p>'Sorry, you only have a DV camcorder, not a gun.'</p>
<p>'I clearly know Chen Xu is BS-ing, but I have to admit, I actually find it somewhat logical.'</p>
<p>'According to this theory, it feels like the patients in the asylum are quite friendly too!'</p>
<p>'Exactly, exactly! How can you say those mental patients aren't friendly? Those patients are extremely friendly!'</p>
<p>'It's just that when the protagonist was investigating the asylum, the patients and doctors kindly interacted with the protagonist, invited him to participate in indoor parkour activities, and accompanied him in a game of hide-and-seek to relive childhood memories. To help the protagonist relax, they even arranged for the Haier Brothers to tell stories and assigned a nail doctor to provide the protagonist with nail care.'</p>
<p>'Security Big Bro, Uncle Fat, was even more concerned about the protagonist's safety, staying by his side the whole time. He followed closely even when the protagonist was repairing the sewers, affectionately calling the protagonist "little pig," and even bravely sacrificed himself in front of the protagonist at the end.'</p>
<p>'That's right, Security Big Bro, Uncle Fat, took such good care of me! In the sewers, he was afraid I'd bump my head, so he specifically separated my head from my body!'</p>
<p>'And the nail care doctor, worried that it would be unhygienic for me to pick up food with my fingers, specifically clipped my fingers off!'</p>
<p>'Yes, yes, and finally, under everyone's care, the protagonist recorded these heartwarming scenes throughout with his DV camcorder. And to repay these lovely patients, the protagonist bravely extinguished fires to save the hospital and helped the nails do abdominal exercises.'</p>
<p>'55555555, the story of <em>Outlast</em> is so moving! So this is love! There is indeed true affection in the world; this is boundless great love! It's just a pity that every time I feel the love from <em>Outlast</em>, I always have to change my underwear.'</p>
<p>'Suddenly I realized, I can no longer look directly at the story of <em>Outlast</em>, and yet, damn it, I can't even say what's wrong with it!'</p>
<p>With Chen Xu's official Weibo account post released, many players were left speechless. A Warrior of Love? He could even tie <em>that</em> to this game?</p>
<p>"Can't beat you!" they seemed to say.</p>
<p>However, subsequently, players who had played <em>Outlast</em> also started various memes and jokes, following Chen Xu's official Weibo account post.</p>
<p>After all, if you put <em>Outlast</em>'s plot in a different way, it really did seem quite heartwarming, harmonious, and full of love.</p>
<p>The entire game, inside and out, was overflowing with love.</p>
<p>After this official response, Chen Xu's official Weibo account post quickly went viral, adding fuel to <em>Outlast</em>'s popularity.</p>
<p>Players engaged in all sorts of meme-making and joke-creating.</p>
<p>As for the gaming industry and various Game Designers, their focus was more on the sales data driven by <em>Outlast</em>'s popularity.</p>
