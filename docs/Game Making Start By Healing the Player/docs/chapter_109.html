                <p>Chapter 109 Players, Good Luck</p>
<p>As the Coiled Sword was pulled from the body of Ash Judgment Gundyr, the boss, previously frozen like a statue, began to awaken.</p>
<p>At this moment, Chen Xu had already switched the Small Club into two-handing mode and used the weapon art to let out a loud roar.</p>
<p>Then, taking advantage of Gundyr still rising to his feet, Chen Xu started swinging the club at him.</p>
<p>The boss's health dropped at an almost visible rate.</p>
<p>Before the enemy could fully turn around, Chen Xu swiftly created distance with a dodge. As the boss launched an attack resembling Mount Hua Split, Chen Xu easily rolled behind Ash Gundyr, carefully managing his stamina bar to always leave at least one bar remaining before continuing his assault.</p>
<p>The dual-wielded Small Club struck Ash Gundyr repeatedly. Suddenly, the in-game character staggered, lost balance, and dropped to his knees. Qin Yi and the others nearby understood immediately—this was a flinch/stun directly caused by the Small Club's poise break.</p>
<p>Facing the kneeling Ash Judgment Gundyr, Chen Xu continued attacking with precise timing, ensuring he didn't fully deplete the green stamina bar.</p>
<p>Soon, with only half health remaining, Ash Gundyr froze in place, entirely enveloped in black substance, transforming into a massive serpent-like form, glaring menacingly.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of Ash Gundyr's transformation, Chen Xu managed to sneak in two more hits with the Small Club.</p>
<p>After transforming, Ash Gundyr leapt high into the air and slammed down with a Mount Tai Crushing attack. Chen Xu effortlessly rolled away using invincibility frames to dodge, then struck him twice more, finally depleting the last of his health.</p>
<p>With a final bellow, Ash Gundyr collapsed weakly to the ground.</p>
<p>"Excellent. The combat system and actions are outstanding. The team should continue testing this aspect."</p>
<p>"As for the game's numerical design and difficulty, let's keep it like this. After all, as the first boss players encounter, it shouldn't be too difficult."</p>
<p>Chen Xu addressed the group.</p>
<p>Regarding the current game test results, he was extremely satisfied.</p>
<p>First, the visual presentation of the game content had significantly improved compared to his previous life.</p>
<p>This included effects like blood splatter after attacks, and interactive environmental destruction within scenes.</p>
<p>Everything was exceptionally well-executed. For example, every slash from Ash Gundyr's halberd would visibly crack the courtyard's brick flooring.</p>
<p>Of course, these were purely visual effects. Although Gundyr's halberd would leave visible cracks on impact, it wouldn't actually create deep craters.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, while this didn't affect gameplay, it served as valuable feedback enhancing player experience.</p>
<p>Not a core aspect, but a nice touch that subtly deepened player immersion.</p>
<p>As for the core difficulty, Chen Xu wasn't exaggerating—this current level felt just right.</p>
<p>After all, in his previous life, Gundyr the Ash had another nickname: the Discouraging Boss.</p>
<p>This was meant as a warning to players about the game's nature.</p>
<p>If you could accept it, congratulations—a new world was opening before you, possibly unlocking special attributes.</p>
<p>But if Ash Gundyr felt like an insurmountable challenge, already filling you with despair,</p>
<p>then refunding before the refund period ended would be the more rational choice.</p>
<p>Of course, there was another straightforward method—popular among PC platform Souls-like players in his previous life:</p>
<p>Becoming the first disciple of the Wind, Spirit, Moon, and Shadow Sect—in plainer terms, using a trainer.</p>
<p>Some players wanted to personally experience the story-driven gameplay rather than just watching videos, but their skill level didn't allow it. For them, a trainer was the perfect solution.</p>
<p>Honestly, as a game developer, Chen Xu held no prejudice against players using trainers in single-player games.</p>
<p>Every player simply had their own way of enjoying the game.</p>
<p>However, even trainer users needed some restrictions. After all, Dark Souls wasn't a purely offline experience. If players weren't in offline mode but playing online,</p>
<p>while in the Embered State, they might face invasions from other players—a built-in game mechanic.</p>
<p>There were benefits, but also risks.</p>
<p>Therefore, Chen Xu adopted the same approach as Dark Souls from his previous life.</p>
<p>Players could use trainers, but doing so would mark their save file, preventing online multiplayer with normal players. Once connected to the network, they'd be assigned to a unique server exclusively for trainer users.</p>
<p>Additionally, save files using trainers couldn't unlock any in-game achievements.</p>
<p>Other online features, such as balance in numerical design, were also restricted.</p>
<p>This prevented players from deliberately grinding a low-level character, exploiting equipment attributes to become a High Wall Lord of Cinder, then invading the worlds of clueless rookies who'd just lit their ember without understanding its purpose.</p>
<p>"But Mr. Chen, isn't this difficulty a bit too low?" Yang Xin, unaware of the full context, voiced her opinion.</p>
<p>"Yeah! It feels a bit like a hack-and-slash game. The boss and mobs don't take much damage at all!" Ruan Ningxue chimed in.</p>
<p>"So Mr. Chen, is Dark Souls actually a hack-and-slash game?" Zhang Yida from marketing and operations asked.</p>
<p>After all, for promotional purposes, the game's tags would be crucial.</p>
<p>At this moment, Qin Yi and the other combat system designers wore bewildered expressions.</p>
<p>Too easy? Doesn't take damage? Hack-and-slash? What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Are you planning to take players' lives later?</p>
<p>And why is Mr. Chen so incredibly skilled?</p>
<p>Qin Yi and the others wore extremely complex expressions.</p>
<p>The game was fine. They were fine. So the only problem must be Mr. Chen!</p>
<p>Who could have imagined their Mr. Chen was actually a gaming master!</p>
<p>Seeing their expressions, Chen Xu smiled and waved his hand. "I know the boss's attack patterns, so I can handle it easily. Ordinary players will still need some practice."</p>
<p>Ah, that makes sense!</p>
<p>The group nodded in understanding, but then shot strange glances at Qin Yi.</p>
<p>Though no one spoke, Qin Yi and his colleagues clearly sensed what everyone was thinking:</p>
<p>Aren't you all involved in designing the numerical values, boss actions, and combat system for Dark Souls?</p>
<p>This is the 'too difficult' challenge you kept talking about?</p>
<p>Are you sure you're not just too weak?</p>
<p>After Chen Xu left, under everyone's gaze, Qin Yi snorted and stood up from his chair. The other combat and action system designers silently made way for him.</p>
<p>No words were exchanged, yet their actions showed perfect tacit understanding.</p>
<p>Too easy?</p>
<p>Then why don't you go ahead and Link the Fire yourself?</p>
<p>Thus, the不服 crowd sat down one by one, determined to experience it firsthand.</p>
<p>Half an hour later.</p>
<p>Everyone's expressions had grown complicated.</p>
<p>"I'll talk to Mr. Chen later. Maybe we should add some death achievements in the game, ensuring players still get rewards and solace even when they die," Yang Xin spoke first.</p>
<p>"After death, I think the screen could slowly transition from crimson to dark red, then to grayish white. Also, the 'YOU DIED' text could be slightly beautified to comfort the player's soul," Ruan Ningxue said with a complex expression.</p>
<p>They exchanged glances, each understanding the others' thoughts.</p>
<p>Players, good luck—that was all they could wish now.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zhang Yida wore a look as if he'd just been mounted by a Chihuahua.</p>
<p>You guys have it easy.</p>
<p>But what about him?</p>
<p>For promotional warm-up, what kind of tags should he even use now!</p>
<p>Thinking about Chen Xu's gameplay footage and his own experience,</p>
<p>Zhang Yida fell into deep confusion.</p>
