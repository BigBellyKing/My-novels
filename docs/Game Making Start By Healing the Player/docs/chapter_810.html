                <p>Chapter 809: Wage Earner, Wage Earner's Spirit</p>
<p>After deeply sighing with emotion, Song Ren was once again very happy.</p>
<p>Isn't playing games all about a sense of immersion? Immersing oneself in the game's protagonist and embarking on adventures with them?</p>
<p>Clearly, Cloud's appearance gave him a great sense of immersion. No matter what he himself looked like, as long as there was immersion, that was all that mattered.</p>
<p>"But, right now, Cloud has just met Barrett?"</p>
<p>Song Ren shifted his attention to Cloud and Barrett's conversation. Right from the start, they were going to blow up the Mako Reactor, and Barrett's speech was as aggressive as in the movie!</p>
<p>Watching Cloud, Barrett, and the AVALANCHE trio interact in the game, Song Ren felt a mix of anticipation and curiosity. Although Barrett didn't show his face much in the movie, Song Ren knew he was also a member of the protagonist's party. Song Ren was also very curious about how characters like Red XIII, Vincent, Yuffie, and Tifa would interact with Cloud.</p>
<p>The beginning of the game held nothing particularly noteworthy. It was pretty much the usual simple game flow, with the relevant quests explained along the way.</p>
<p>Cloud was a mercenary and knew Tifa. Tifa was a member of AVALANCHE, so Barrett and the others hired Cloud to blow up the Mako Reactor. However, Barrett didn't trust Cloud much at this point.</p>
<p>The game's combat system wasn't the pure action gameplay Song Ren had imagined earlier; instead, it was similar to <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em> but without automatic attacks. Players needed to control Cloud to attack and dodge, and the game also featured magic and combat skill settings that players could choose to cast.</p>
<p>Although it looked like an action game, it was more akin to an RPG in nature. After a veteran player like himself got a feel for it, Song Ren instantly came to a conclusion. If one's technical skill was good enough, it could compensate for some statistical gaps, but the most crucial aspects were still improving stats, and the arrangement and selection of skill strategies. The game also included settings like elemental weaknesses. Of course, if one didn't want to operate manually, the game also had auto-battle commands, which, once selected, would work just like in <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>.</p>
<p>Song Ren, having played <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>, picked up this combat system with ease. Especially in the game, unlike <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em> where only one character could be controlled and a maximum of three Blades could be switched, here players could switch between Cloud and Barrett, the two currently controllable characters, and their division of labor was very clear.</p>
<p>Cloud could easily deal with ground monsters, while Barrett was more efficient at attacking flying monsters.</p>
<p>In the elevator, Barrett reiterated information regarding Shinra and the Mako Reactors. This content wasn't fully explained in <em>Advent Children</em>.</p>
<p>Simply put, the Lifestream was extracted and converted into Mako, becoming a new energy source like oil and coal. But the cost of these new energy sources was a reduction in the planet's lifespan and the loss of nutrients and vitality in the land. This was why green plants were almost nonexistent in Midgar, whereas in <em>Advent Children</em>, most areas of Midgar were covered in green vegetation. It was precisely because Shinra, or rather all of Shinra's Mako Reactors, had been blown up at that time, that the earth was able to regain its vitality.</p>
<p>"So Shinra Company is a large capitalist conglomerate. On one hand, it creates societal wealth through Mako, exploiting ordinary people, on the other hand, it destroys the planet's environment."</p>
<p>"And AVALANCHE, then, is a grassroots environmental organization, seeking to purify the environment and overthrow the big capitalists!" Based on the content in <em>Advent Children</em> and the information he had gathered so far, Song Ren made a simple summary.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as the game progressed, Song Ren noticed something different: Cloud's current personality felt very cold, almost like Sephiroth. However, the Cloud in <em>Advent Children</em> initially didn't give Song Ren that impression.</p>
<p>To describe it with a feeling, the Cloud in <em>Advent Children</em> initially had a sense of guilt, a lack of self-confidence. He lacked confidence in his own abilities, which was why Cloud left Tifa and the others, but ultimately, with the encouragement of his companions, Cloud rallied to confront Sephiroth again.</p>
<p>The current Cloud, however, gave Song Ren the impression of being very aloof and self-assured. Especially his constant remarks of "not interested" and "Shinra 1st Class SOLDIER" further proved this point. So, is the <em>Final Fantasy</em> game's story primarily about the great battle against Sephiroth, and then Cloud's gradual character transformation? Much like Mythra turning into Pyra in <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>?</p>
<p>Song Ren mused along the way, but this speculation quickly vanished as the storyline officially entered the Mako Reactor's interior. His attention was completely captivated by the spectacular scene.</p>
<p>Thick copper pipes, gigantic machines in operation, continuously drawing the Lifestream from the bottomless underground world and converting it into Mako. As well as a massive mechanical BOSS resembling a scorpion. Fully showcasing the unique mechanical aesthetics of steampunk. He couldn't find any other words; "spectacular" was the only one that fit.</p>
<p>Following that, the escape sequence after the Mako Reactor explosion gave Song Ren the illusion of playing <em>Uncharted</em>. Fighting along the way, accompanied by the collapsing Mako Reactor equipment and the immersive sensation of burning flames from the VR perspective, it was simply thrilling.</p>
<p>Through the pre-arranged path, Cloud and his party successfully escaped. On the chaotic streets, Song Ren finally met another character from the game, the flower girl Aerith, though at this point, Cloud's interaction with her was limited to buying a yellow flower.</p>
<p>Next, Cloud followed Barrett and the others onto the subway, heading to their secret base, the Seventh Heaven bar in the Sector 7 Slums. And the bar's owner was Tifa, Cloud's childhood friend.</p>
<p>"Tifa! This is incredible!"</p>
<p>Compared to the flower girl whose role was still unknown, and who was only glimpsed in photos and Cloud's memories in <em>Advent Children</em> (he didn't even know her name back then), Tifa's appearance clearly excited Song Ren more. Her black flowing hair, combined with her exposed abs and black skirt, made Song Ren feel that Ah Wei, already in his grave, had died once more.</p>
<p>"Damn it! Bad review! Why can players control characters to lie prone in <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>, but in <em>Final Fantasy</em>, aside from level interactions, there's no way to even crouch normally!"</p>
<p>With some impure thoughts, Song Ren, wanting to peek from a special angle, expressed extreme disappointment.</p>
<p>The subsequent plot wasn't particularly dramatic; it was a rather plain narrative stage.</p>
<p>At this point, Tifa wanted to ask Cloud to help AVALANCHE, and she employed a very common "flashback kill" tactic. "'If Cloud truly becomes a great hero like Sephiroth, then will you come save me when I'm in danger?'"</p>
<p>Facing this warm flashback, Cloud then showed a rather "tough" side. "Sorry, I'm not a hero, nor do I have any fame... so I'm afraid I can't keep that promise."</p>
<p>This damn iron will. Cloud, if you act like this, you won't have a girlfriend later! Listening to Cloud's words, Song Ren was practically dying of anxiety. It gave him the feeling of playing a galgame. The protagonist's path was completely different from the expected strategy path! Tifa clearly hadn't expected Cloud to act this way either.</p>
<p>At this point, Barrett also appeared, but the reward given to Cloud was significantly less. Here, Chen Xu also made a slight improvement compared to the original; at least the tuition fees for the little loli Marlene had to be kept, for no matter how poor one is, education cannot be neglected.</p>
<p>Tifa here also asked Cloud to be understanding, stating that they would have money soon after replacing the air filters for the slum merchants, and asked Cloud to go collect the money with her.</p>
<p>"Come on, just as if you're protecting me."</p>
<p>Facing a seemingly uninterested Cloud, Tifa, leaning on the bar counter, said in a coquettish tone. Listening to Tifa's coquettish voice, Song Ren, like Cloud, couldn't help but sigh. Who could resist Tifa's coquettishness like that! In fact, Song Ren simply felt that this segment was just Mr. Chen wanting to showcase the destructive power of Tifa's coquetry.</p>
<p>With a sigh, Song Ren wandered through the slums with Tifa, experiencing a completely different style.</p>
<p>"It really is the slums! This feeling is completely different from the art style of Midgar's upper sectors!"</p>
<p>Coming out of Seventh Heaven, following behind Tifa. In broad daylight, Song Ren was able to observe the surrounding environment more closely.</p>
<p>Just like the name of this map area: Slums. Environmentally speaking, it was truly dilapidated.</p>
<p>When he previously emerged from Shinra Company after blowing up the Mako Reactor, the surrounding city, at least, had a modern feel to it. Not exquisitely beautiful, but at least orderly, and the streets were clean and tidy. But in these slums, it was completely different.</p>
<p>All sorts of stray cats and dogs, houses built with plastic tiles, and various small shacks surrounded by fences. It felt as if it were an environment from a wasteland world.</p>
<p>Under Tifa's guidance, Song Ren, playing as Cloud, gained a more comprehensive understanding of these slums. Along the way, he also learned some game operation knowledge. Of course, some residents were friendly to Cloud, while others harbored malice towards him.</p>
<p>To improve relations with the local residents, one needed to "grind" reputation points. Similarly, the simplest way to gain reputation points was to help some local residents solve their problems. This would not only yield some rewards but also greatly improve his reputation in the area.</p>
<p>In the warehouse, he met Jessie and the AVALANCHE trio once again. As for the side quests, they followed the standard RPG game flow, which didn't surprise Song Ren much.</p>
<p>Helping the little girl in Sand Park search everywhere for her good friend: Meow Meow. For this, Cloud, carrying a greatsword, had to search for Meow Meow everywhere in the crisscrossing paths of the slums. He also needed to help the grocery store owner by going to deal with mutated rats. And while he was at it, he had to deal with some mutated beasts on the outskirts of the slums that posed a threat to the local residents.</p>
<p>Additionally, there were tasks like helping the anti-Shinra research institute (whose members were technically Shinra employees) collect information on various monsters. And for the warehouse owner, driving out various mutants from his warehouse.</p>
<p>"What the heck, this isn't a Shinra SOLDIER mercenary; this is just a wage earner!"</p>
<p>"Wage earner, wage earner's spirit, even protagonists like Cloud can't escape working!"</p>
<p>After completing two side quests, with his level increasing, he received his reward from the employers. Song Ren suddenly realized. The current main and side quests were all pointing to one thing. That is, the current Cloud was no world-saving hero. He was just a ruthless working machine. Previously, he worked for Shinra Company. Now he worked for the residents of the slums, and for the AVALANCHE team.</p>
<p>But upon closer thought, it seemed that no matter the game, the protagonist was always a wage earner! Geralt of Rivia, on his quest to find his adopted daughter, had no choice but to take various contracts to work for a living. Arthur Morgan worked for Dutch his entire life, not only getting sick from work and ultimately sacrificing himself when the "company" went bankrupt, but even if the company truly went bankrupt, that would be one thing, yet it had transferred its assets beforehand.</p>
<p>But then again, Tifa in <em>Advent Children</em> opened a delivery company, and it was clear Cloud had funded it. Where did that money come from? He earned it by working! So, to start your own business, you first have to be a wage earner?</p>
