                <p>Chapter 7: The Story Behind It Is Heartwarming</p>
<p>In Chen Xu's rented apartment, he was currently devouring a pack of freshly made instant noodles, to which he'd even added an egg.</p>
<p>There was no other way; he could only eat this recently, as he was truly short on cash.</p>
<p>He owed money on his credit cards, Zhibafu's Jiebei, and Jingdog's Jiejie.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Ruan Ningxue's payment for her drawings hadn't been settled, and instead, he'd borrowed another 1000 yuan from her. There was no choice; most of his funds had been invested into the game.</p>
<p>He didn't even have money for food now.</p>
<p>Of course, a major reason was that he had specifically set aside twenty thousand of his total funds.</p>
<p>And these twenty thousand were the foundation for <em>Mirror (Game)</em> to take off.</p>
<p>Chen Xu was confident in the quality of <em>Mirror (Game)</em>.</p>
<p>Especially after deeply understanding some of the Gentleman's Games in this world, including indescribable doujinshi.</p>
<p>Regarding these, Chen Xu could only say they were simply too crudely made.</p>
<p>Are Gentleman's Games not games?</p>
<p>It's outrageous!</p>
<p>But as the old saying goes, even the best wine fears a deep alley.</p>
<p>If you truly believe an 18R game will definitely take off just by being made and thrown onto a platform,</p>
<p>then you're truly thinking too much.</p>
<p>Even masterpieces of the caliber of <em>Minecraft</em> or <em>The Binding of Isaac</em>, if carelessly tossed onto a platform,</p>
<p>might not even make a splash in the early stages if luck isn't on their side.</p>
<p>Therefore, for a game, promotion is essential.</p>
<p>Even for an 18R game!</p>
<p>Of course, this method requires some special tricks.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>In a certain university dorm room.</p>
<p>Yawning, Jiang Ping climbed down from the bunk bed ladder and opened the laptop on his desk.</p>
<p>"There aren't any new doujinshi to read recently, huh."</p>
<p>He muttered, opening a relatively well-known overseas forum.</p>
<p>Of course, when he said "doujinshi," he didn't mean merely explicit ones; it also included some fan-made doujinshi.</p>
<p>For example, some manga plots could be incredibly frustrating, such as a popular supporting female character dying, or the female lead in a hot-blooded manga dying to become the male protagonist's trigger for a burst of power.</p>
<p>This would make people feel as uncomfortable as if they'd eaten poop, but if the manga's quality was excellent despite that, it was truly annoying.</p>
<p>This is where doujinshi came in handy. Of course, occasionally glancing at those indescribable explicit comics with a critical eye was also a common occurrence.</p>
<p>However, such doujinshi were generally small-scale affairs, given the copyright issues involved.</p>
<p>Naturally, there were also original comics, but most of those tended to be of the indescribable explicit variety.</p>
<p>Jiang Ping had now entered a relatively famous overseas doujinshi forum, wanting to see if there were any new ones.</p>
<p>After all, many of the artists who drew these comics were essentially doing it out of interest.</p>
<p>Working inconsistently was normal; forget about tankobons, sometimes it was a blessing if they could even serialize one chapter a week.</p>
<p>Even some special original comics meant for profit weren't necessarily serialized regularly.</p>
<p>But upon entering the forum today, Jiang Ping noticed something unusual.</p>
<p>That was, the posts on the homepage were somewhat intriguing in their incomprehensibility.</p>
<p>'Late at night, my roommate's bed keeps shaking. Is this the distortion of human nature, or the decay of morality?'</p>
<p>'This is simply the most fun Match-3 game I've ever played!'</p>
<p>'A seemingly simple Match-3 game, but the truth hidden behind it is heartwarming.'</p>
<p>'What kind of game is this? It's utterly harmful! I wanted to buy a Match-3 game for my little brother, but now he's completely dejected!'</p>
<p>'Brave little cow, unafraid of difficulties! Go, bros, charge!'</p>
<p>??????</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>Looking at the series of post titles, Jiang Ping was utterly dumbfounded.</p>
<p>After clicking into one of the posts and reading for a long time, Jiang Ping finally realized.</p>
<p>The truth behind it is heartwarming, and the roommate's bed keeps shaking late at night.</p>
<p>These guys have completely floored the accelerator! So, these posts are all talking about the Gentleman's Games that LSP's love the most!</p>
<p>But Gentleman's Games are Gentleman's Games, what the hell are these comments?</p>
<p>'My thoughts after half an hour of gameplay: Just like the game's name, we are all "Mirror Gazers." After putting down the magic mirror, what confronts us are the pains and torments of reality. The more beautiful things one has seen, the more confident one becomes in life. When you're scarred and exhausted, why not take a break and quietly recall this simple, pure, yet slightly melancholic emotion.'</p>
<p>'The dark side of human nature revealed almost surpassed my understanding. Redemption and depravity, the questioning of morality deeply ingrained. Even after closing the game, my thoughts lingered within it. Highly recommended!'</p>
<p>'A game brimming with depth. Using a licentious exterior, it expresses an unparalleled sorrow that spreads like headless flies in the marketplace, yet its message surpasses half a volume of scripture in a temple. The various stories within the game each have their own color, and when strung together, they shine brilliantly, like a miniature human world. This game, of course, has many flaws, but its story is first-rate: simple, powerful, and deeply moving.'</p>
<p>'Subtly, <em>Mirror (Game)</em> gives me a feeling akin to <em>Dream of the Red Chamber</em>. Through the magic mirror, the destinies of women unfold before your eyes. They have their own encounters in different historical contexts and are subject to various forms of control, such as desire, love, and fear... As for what thoughts the spectator might have, they can only ultimately transform into a sigh after closing the game, or perhaps indifference.'</p>
<p>'A certain great literary master once said: There are always those who create explicit content where they shouldn't, but there are also those who explore philosophy where explicit content is expected; exploring life and morality. Clearly, <em>Mirror (Game)</em> is precisely such a game, veiled in licentiousness yet profoundly meaningful.'</p>
<p>'When a Gentleman's Game moved me, I knew that whether to indulge or not was no longer important.'</p>
<p>'When I opened this game, in just ten short minutes, my heart was struck with an unparalleled impact. I find it difficult to describe this game with words; it was like a guiding beacon appearing in the dark night. I have a premonition that because of this game, the Gentleman's Game industry will usher in a revolution!'</p>
<p>What the hell is this!?</p>
<p>What exactly are you all talking about!</p>
<p>After reading through all the posts, Jiang Ping felt completely stunned, and a strong sense of curiosity was born within him.</p>
<p>Looking at the comments in these forum posts, and after confirming the game's name was <em>Mirror (Game)</em>,</p>
<p>Jiang Ping opened the Official Game Platform and searched for it.</p>
<p>The extremely conspicuous elf on the game's cover, and the label indicating it was 18R.</p>
<p>Hmm!</p>
<p>There was no doubt this was a Gentleman's Game.</p>
<p>But these comments of yours, are you truly not commenting on the wrong game?</p>
<p>Jiang Ping, who was already very interested in Gentleman's Games, was now even more so.</p>
<p>What kind of game was this, exactly?</p>
<p>The price of 10 yuan wasn't very expensive.</p>
<p>It was just the cost of one breakfast, after all.</p>
<p>Without much thought, Jiang Ping added the game to his shopping cart and then scanned the QR code to complete the payment.</p>
<p>Now, he wanted to take a look and see what was so special about this Bishōjo Match-3 game.</p>
<p>During the new book period, 2 updates daily. Those with recommendation tickets, please use them, it's very important. (Mwah! [Cute face])</p>
