<p>Chapter 445: Vacation Agency? Mr. Chen Went on a Trip!? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p><em>Element World</em>, promoted as an open-world game, achieved high reputation, yet failed to translate that into high sales.</p>
<p>In contrast, the linear game <em>Uncharted</em> achieved explosive sales, sparking deep reflection among many Game Designers.</p>
<p>Was <em>Element World</em> simply inferior in quality to <em>Uncharted</em>?</p>
<p>Not exactly. Although <em>Uncharted</em>'s quality was indeed spectacular, <em>Element World</em> wasn't particularly bad either—otherwise, it couldn't have earned such high acclaim.</p>
<p>Many designers began shifting their focus toward comparing open-world and linear games.</p>
<p>In recent years, titles like <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> had drawn numerous Game developers to fixate on the open-world theme.</p>
<p>Open-world games seemed to have become the cheat code to success.</p>
<p>But now, was open-world truly always the better choice?</p>
<p>Many Game Designers began analyzing.</p>
<p>What if <em>Element World</em> had adopted a linear mode instead of open-world?</p>
<p>Allowing players to progress along a single path, enabling puzzle difficulty to be carefully designed—starting easy and gradually increasing in complexity.</p>
<p>Much like <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, where early-game monsters were mere appetizers, while the difficulty spiked dramatically upon reaching Diablos.</p>
<p>Would such a design have triggered an explosive surge in sales?</p>
<p>This topic sparked intense discussions across the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Yet for players, despite <em>Element World</em>'s excellence, they still favored <em>Uncharted</em>—simply because it was more fun to play.</p>
<p>Moreover, thanks to <em>Element World</em>'s inherent puzzle-solving and treasure-hunting elements, <em>Uncharted</em> experienced a renewed burst of popularity.</p>
<p>It also heightened player anticipation for the future.</p>
<p>After all, judging from content and various hints, <em>Uncharted</em> clearly had three DLCs currently in development!</p>
<p>El Dorado, Shangri-La, and the City of a Thousand Pillars—these legendary RUINS had firmly hooked players' interest.</p>
<p>In the midst of this industry shift, Zeus, having suffered yet another blow, finally made a decision.</p>
<p>They would change their cooperation partner.</p>
<p>For Zeus, <em>Element World</em> was clearly a painful failure.</p>
<p>Though the game's quality was excellent and its reputation solid,</p>
<p>what good was that if it couldn't help the Zeus Platform expand its territory?</p>
<p>Others reaped the benefits while Zeus alone bore the blame—how could anyone withstand that?</p>
<p>From Zeus's perspective, their platform itself had no issues.</p>
<p>Their marketing efforts were also fully committed.</p>
<p>So where exactly did the problem lie?</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, it was their partner, Atari.</p>
<p>If the game failed, it must be the partner company's fault.</p>
<p><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, and now <em>Uncharted</em>—except for last year when Nebula Games shifted focus to Switch, giving Atari a brief moment of triumph in the New Era VR market, they had otherwise been thoroughly outperformed every other time!</p>
<p>After internal discussions, Zeus's upper management reached a conclusion:</p>
<p>Stop relying on third parties!</p>
<p>They would develop first-party titles themselves!</p>
<p>They had the technology, and they had the money!</p>
<p>With <em>Uncharted</em>'s momentum fading and <em>Element World</em>'s popularity gradually declining,</p>
<p>players soon received a bombshell announcement:</p>
<p>Zeus had invested a massive sum to acquire FOW, a veteran European game developer, for a staggering 2.1 billion USD.</p>
<p>Of course, this acquisition couldn't have been finalized overnight—Zeus had long been in talks with various game developers.</p>
<p>Previous negotiations had stalled due to disagreements on terms. The clear failure of <em>Element World</em> had clearly pushed Zeus into urgency.</p>
<p>With <em>Element World</em>'s defeat now inevitable, Zeus saw no reason to waste further time on it.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Zeus's official website announced a new project codenamed 'Medieval'.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Players erupted in discussion over Zeus's major investment.</p>
<p>After all, FOW was a well-known name in the industry.</p>
<p>The studio was famous for historical-themed games, though it had long been criticized for being frugal—patching and re-releasing games year after year, with graphics rarely updated unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>This time, with Zeus as their new parent company, fans of FOW weren't saddened—they were ecstatic.</p>
<p>Now that they had a wealthy big daddy, FOW's future games would finally get the graphical upgrades they deserved, right?</p>
<p>On domestic forums, players discussed:</p>
<p>"FOW's really upgrading from rags to riches, found themselves a rich sponsor."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I could never get into their games before because the graphics were always outdated. Now, I can actually look forward to their next release."</p>
<p>"Forget FOW—aren't you guys curious about the progress on <em>Uncharted</em>'s trilogy of DLCs?"</p>
<p>"Nebula Games has been making big moves lately—VR themes just got an update. But Mr. Chen is being inhuman again!"</p>
<p>"Damn right! I went into the <em>Outlast</em> theme scene without Awakening Mode on, and I nearly pissed myself!"</p>
<p>"So why the hell did you even enter the <em>Outlast</em> theme scene?"</p>
<p>"By the way, isn't anyone talking about Zeus's 'Medieval' project?"</p>
<p>"It's just a codename with no details—what's there to follow? NetDragon's <em>Shadow Operations: Communication Interrupted</em> is launching soon. But honestly, I'm more interested in Mr. Chen—shouldn't the <em>Uncharted</em> DLC content be almost ready by now?"</p>
<p>"You're all overthinking it. Just check the latest post on their official Weibo! Mr. Chen and the entire Nebula Games team went on a group trip!"</p>
<p>Players were discussing recent happenings in the gaming industry online, but soon one topic dominated the conversation.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen isn't making games—he's gone on vacation?</p>
<p>Many players were baffled upon hearing this.</p>
<p>They rushed to check Chen Xu's official Weibo.</p>
<p>Just ten minutes ago, Chen Xu had posted a new update.</p>
<p>Unlike previous posts announcing new game content, this one stood out completely.</p>
<p>'First stop: Florence, checking in at Florence Cathedral!'</p>
<p>A simple sentence, accompanied by a group photo of Chen Xu, Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, Qin Yi, Meng Zuo, and other Nebula Games core members, taken at a famous local landmark.</p>
<p>Countless players were left utterly bewildered.</p>
<p>We all assumed Mr. Chen was working tirelessly, grinding intensely to finish <em>Uncharted</em>'s trilogy of DLCs—or at least preparing for a new game or project. But you're telling us you went on vacation!?</p>
<p>And not just any vacation—a long trip! Judging by the caption, Florence is just the first stop? There are second, third, and fourth stops coming?</p>
<p>The moment Chen Xu's post went up, countless followers were left completely bewildered.</p>
<p>Is Nebula Games a game development company—or a vacation agency!?</p>
