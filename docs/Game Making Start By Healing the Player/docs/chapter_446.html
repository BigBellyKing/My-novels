                <p>Chapter 445: Vacation Agency? Mr. Chen Went Traveling!? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>“Element World,” promoted as an open-world game, achieved high critical acclaim but failed to translate that into high sales. Instead, “Uncharted,” a linear game, achieved explosive sales, which prompted many game designers to reflect.</p>
<p>Was it that “Element World’s” quality couldn’t compare to “Uncharted’s”? Not entirely. While “Uncharted’s” quality was indeed phenomenal, “Element World” wasn’t actually bad either; otherwise, it wouldn’t have received such high praise.</p>
<p>At the same time, many designers also turned their attention to open-world and linear games. In the past two years, with “Red Dead Redemption” and “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,” many game developers focused on open-world as a genre. It seemed as if open-world had become a cheat code for success. But now, is open-world truly always good?</p>
<p>Many game designers began to analyze this. If “Element World” had adopted a linear mode instead of an open-world one, allowing players to follow a clear path and designing puzzles from easy to hard—much like “Monster Hunter: World,” where early dragons are just appetizers, but the difficulty sharply increases with the Diablos—would such a design have led to an explosion in game sales?</p>
<p>Many game designers in the industry were discussing this. However, for players, while “Element World” was excellent, they still chose “Uncharted” because it was simply more satisfying to play. Moreover, thanks to “Element World” itself having elements of puzzles and treasure hunting, it inadvertently sparked a small wave of renewed interest in “Uncharted.”</p>
<p>This also made many players more excited about what was to come. After all, judging from the content and various hints, “Uncharted” still had three DLCs under development! El Dorado, Shangri-La, and City of a Thousand Pillars—these legendary ruins had truly whetted players’ appetites.</p>
<p>Amidst this confrontation, a bruised Zeus finally made a decision. That was to change partners. For Zeus, “Element World” was clearly a very painful failure. Although the game quality and reputation were excellent, what good was it if it couldn't help the Zeus platform expand its territory? Others reaped the benefits, while Zeus took all the blame in the end—who could endure that?!</p>
<p>For Zeus, their own platform was certainly not the issue. And the promotion had been thoroughly executed. So where did the problem lie? Undoubtedly, it was with their partner, Atari. If the game wasn't good, it was definitely the company's problem! “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare,” “Red Dead Redemption,” and now “Uncharted”—apart from last year when Nebula Games went off to make Switch games, allowing Atari to enjoy some success in the New Era VR market, all other times Atari was completely defeated!</p>
<p>So, after discussions, Zeus’s executives made a decision: no longer place hope in third parties! They would develop first-party games themselves! They had the technology, and they had the money! As the momentum for “Uncharted” passed and “Element World’s” popularity gradually waned, many players received a major piece of news: Zeus had spent a huge sum to acquire FOW, an old-established European game developer, for a staggering 2.1 billion USD. Of course, this acquisition couldn't have been settled immediately; Zeus had actually been in contact with various game developers all along. Disagreements over various terms had previously prevented a deal, but the failure of “Element World” clearly made Zeus anxious.</p>
<p>Moreover, with “Element World’s” failure now a certainty, Zeus saw no need to waste more time on it. At the same time, on Zeus’s official website, a new project codenamed ‘Medieval’ was also announced.</p>
<p>Players were engaged in various discussions about Zeus’s big move. After all, FOW was also a renowned game developer in the industry. This company was famous for historical-themed games, but its works were often criticized for being unwilling to spend money. It was always “patching things up for another year”; unless absolutely necessary, the graphics never saw innovation. This time, with the acquisition by Zeus, players who liked FOW were not sad but instead cheered with excitement. Having found a rich sugar daddy, FOW’s future game graphics would surely improve, right?</p>
<p>On major domestic forums, players were also discussing. “This time FOW has upgraded from a bird-gun to a cannon, found a rich backer.” “Yeah, before, I could never get into their games mainly because the graphics always lagged behind the times. Now, I feel like I can actually look forward to it.” “Forget FOW, aren't you guys concerned about the progress of 'Uncharted's' DLC trilogy?” “Nebula Games has been quite active recently, and the VR theme park also got an update, but Mr. Chen is being a bit inhuman!” “Damn right! The Outlast theme area, I didn't turn on awakening mode before, and it scared the pee out of me.” “So why did you insist on going into the Outlast theme area?” “By the way, isn't anyone paying attention to Zeus's 'Medieval' project?” “It's just a codename, not even a shadow yet, what's there to pay attention to? Plus, NetDragon's 'Shadow Operations: Communication Interrupted' is about to launch, but I'm more focused on Mr. Chen. The 'Uncharted' DLC content should be almost done, right?” “You guys are overthinking it, check out the latest official Weibo post! Mr. Chen and the entire Nebula Games team went on a team-building trip!”</p>
<p>Many players were discussing recent happenings in the gaming industry online, but soon one topic became the main focus: Mr. Chen wasn’t making games, but had gone traveling? Many were puzzled upon hearing this news. They all promptly opened Chen Xu’s official Weibo to check.</p>
<p>Just ten minutes earlier, Chen Xu’s official Weibo had posted a new message. Compared to his usual announcements about new game content, this post felt out of place. ‘First stop: Florence, checking in at the Florence Cathedral!’ A simple sentence, accompanied by a group photo of Chen Xu, Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, Qin Yi, Meng Zuo, and other core Nebula Games staff, taken at the local landmark.</p>
<p>Countless players looked bewildered. “We all thought you were furiously grinding away at game development, Mr. Chen, and that the lack of updates meant you were rushing to complete the 'Uncharted' DLC trilogy or preparing for new games and projects. Turns out, you're on vacation?!” “And it's a long trip too; Florence seems to be just the first stop? Are there second, third, and fourth stops after this?”</p>
<p>With Chen Xu's Weibo post, many attentive players were instantly dumbfounded. “Are you Nebula Games a game company, or a Vacation Agency?!” (End of Chapter)
