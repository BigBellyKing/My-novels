<p>Chapter 787: Dragonborn!</p>
<p>Time progressed day by day.</p>
<p>The online discussions among players about the game <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> grew increasingly frequent.</p>
<p>After all, it was simply too topical.</p>
<p>Nebula Games had once again returned to the open-world genre, and it wasn't the kind defined by players and media, but rather officially designated by the company.</p>
<p>Evidently, Nebula Games had absolute confidence in <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>.</p>
<p>This also made countless players anticipate what kind of performance <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> would deliver.</p>
<p>Despite Nebula Games having released virtually no new content beyond the previous official Weibo account and official website, players' spontaneous attention and discussions kept the popularity of <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> consistently high.</p>
<p>This filled other game developers with envy, jealousy, and even hatred.</p>
<p>Their own games would have vast sums of money poured into pre-release promotions, yet might not even achieve good results.</p>
<p>But look at Nebula Games; they did nothing, and the popularity remained constant.</p>
<p>Especially amidst the players' eager anticipation, Nebula Games and Chen Xu's official Weibo accounts made a new move.</p>
<p>A simple promotional video instantly propelled <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>'s popularity to the top spot.</p>
<p>Innumerable players excitedly spread the news, flooding various game groups and communities. Some even rushed to screenshot and post on Tieba without even watching the promotional trailer first.</p>
<p>'According to Nebula Games' usual practice, does this mean the game is almost done!?'</p>
<p>'This is the best news I've heard!'</p>
<p>'Mr. Chen is awesome!'</p>
<p>'Speaking of which, I thought <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>' DLC would come out first. I didn't expect it to be Skyrim!'</p>
<p>Numerous players following the game left excited comments below the official Weibo post.</p>
<p>Then, one after another, they clicked on the trailer to get a glimpse of this new work, Nebula Games' return to the open-world genre after many years.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>A relief wall carved with ancient prophecies, burning torches.</p>
<p>The next moment, the camera switched.</p>
<p>Mighty mountains, dense forests, and a expanse of silver-white snow.</p>
<p>'You must act, they are returning!'</p>
<p>Flames flickered, and the ancient relief appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>Continuous camera cuts: mysterious ancient prophecy reliefs, and an adventurer panting softly on a forest path.</p>
<p>On the wall of ancient prophecy, countless dragons with spread wings rushed towards a city.</p>
<p>'The Elder Scrolls foretold their return.'</p>
<p>'Their past defeat was merely a delay.'</p>
<p>Muffled drumbeats sounded, the camera returned to the frosty forest, and a strange roar came from the sky.</p>
<p>'Since the Oblivion Gate opened, when the Sons of Skyrim butchered each other.'</p>
<p>The background music slowly transitioned from muffled to impassioned. The ancient prophecy relief became increasingly clear.</p>
<p>Accompanied by gasps, an adventurer in armor holding a sword and shield was forced to the edge of a cliff, seemingly at a dead end.</p>
<p>'But no one wished to believe in their existence…'</p>
<p>A massive shadow appeared behind the adventurer, obscuring the sky.</p>
<p>'When the truth was finally revealed, they were already engulfed in a sea of fire.'</p>
<p>The camera slowly moved, finally revealing what the colossal creature was.</p>
<p>A pitch-black dragon, its wings spread, covering the sky.</p>
<p>Its dark dragon eyes showed no emotion.</p>
<p>With the dragon's roar, the adventurer brandished his sword and shield, turning to charge at the dragon.</p>
<p>Instantly, the background music became impassioned.</p>
<p>Terrifying dragon breath spewed from the dragon's mouth, and the surrounding ice and snow instantly melted in the high temperature.</p>
<p>Facing the colossal dragon, the adventurer seemed to be at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>'But… there is one they fear, in their tongue, it is… DOVAHKIIN' [Dragonborn]</p>
<p>A strange word was uttered by the narrator.</p>
<p>The next moment, the camera switched. Bathed in dragon breath.</p>
<p>The adventurer knelt on one knee, yet was unharmed.</p>
<p>In the burning flames, he slowly stood up, took a deep breath.</p>
<p>And let out a strange roar: 'FUS! RO! DAH!'</p>
<p>Blue light erupted from the Dragonborn's mouth, sweeping past the dragon.</p>
<p>Instantly extinguishing the burning dragon breath around them.</p>
<p>At the same time, the video camera quickly zoomed out, and the background BGM became grand.</p>
<p>'Dovahkiin, Dovahkiin, naal.ok.zin.los.vahriin'</p>
<p>'Wah.dein.vokul.mahfaeraak.ahst.vaal!'</p>
<p>A song completely different from any known language began to play.</p>
<p>It was incredibly grand, filled with a sense of epicness.</p>
<p>Amidst this majestic song, the camera traversed the entire province of Skyrim.</p>
<p>The incredibly prosperous city in the far north by the harbor: Solitude.</p>
<p>Whiterun, with the White River flowing around it, dense farmlands outside the city, bustling trade caravans, and various water and wind-powered mills.</p>
<p>Riften, divided in two by a massive canal, with most of the city floating on wooden piers, countless cargo ships coming and going.</p>
<p>And Winterhold, located amidst a vast blizzard.</p>
<p>The customs and local conditions of Skyrim were showcased in the video.</p>
<p>In addition, there were giants in the wilderness, various terrifying monsters in dungeons, and ferocious beasts in the forests.</p>
<p>And of course, the most fearsome creatures: dragons.</p>
<p>The camera returned to the Dragonborn once again, and this battle was nearing its end.</p>
<p>The dragon was already covered in wounds, and for the first time, fear appeared in its eyes as it looked at the Dragonborn.</p>
<p>It flapped its wings, attempting to escape, but facing the dragon, the Dragonborn took a deep breath, just as before.</p>
<p>Unidentifiable shouts once again roared from the Dragonborn's mouth.</p>
<p>Visible energy pressed the dragon down from the sky.</p>
<p>Then, the sharp blade in the Dragonborn's hand pierced the dragon's body, taking its life.</p>
<p>As the dragon's life ebbed away, its flesh and blood turned into fragments.</p>
<p>Two different energies, blue and red, were absorbed by the Dragonborn.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the video also ended.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>This wasn't Nebula Games' most outstanding game promotional trailer.</p>
<p>But for players, it held an extraordinary significance.</p>
<p>After all, this was Nebula Games' true return to the open-world genre after many years, and a new title at that.</p>
<p>Moreover, what made countless players even more curious was that in this promotional trailer, they saw something different.</p>
<p>The content of the promotional trailer wasn't particularly rare.</p>
<p>Although the visuals looked incredibly impressive, Nebula Games was renowned as a 'film company' and had produced many stunning promotional videos.</p>
<p>For example, every <em>Warcraft</em> series trailer could be considered a classic.</p>
<p>So, while this promotional video for <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> was excellent, it hadn't yet amazed players.</p>
<p>Regarding the setting, the so-called Dragonborn should be the protagonist played by the player, and the story background was like most fantasy tales: prophecies and a savior.</p>
<p>But what truly caught the players' attention was something else demonstrated in the game.</p>
<p>That was the language.</p>
<p>The lyrics, and the Dragon Shout roared by the Dragonborn.</p>
<p>They were completely unheard-of languages!</p>
<p>And they all had corresponding translations.</p>
<p>Quite convincingly.</p>
<p>For example, 'DOVAHKIIN' was translated as Dragonborn (抓根宝).</p>
<p>And the game's theme song also featured these unique languages.</p>
<p>These were the unique languages created for <em>The Elder Scrolls</em> series: Dragon Language.</p>
<p>Compared to Quenya in Tolkien's <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and Klingon in <em>Star Trek</em> from its previous life.</p>
<p>The Dragon Language in <em>The Elder Scrolls</em> was not as rigorous, with many contradictions and loopholes.</p>
<p>However, drawing inspiration from Finnish and Mesopotamian cuneiform, the Dragon Language wasn't entirely made up either.</p>
<p>And for a game, it was more than sufficient.</p>
<p>Such a virtual language, when well-crafted for the construction of a grand worldview, especially for an open-world RPG like <em>The Elder Scrolls</em>, could absolutely be a crucial factor in enhancing player immersion.</p>
<p>Placing such a distinct element in the promotional video clearly attracted some player attention.</p>
<p>'By the way, does anyone know what language the game's theme song is in? It's grand and all, but I couldn't understand a word!'</p>
<p>'It's not English, or French, or German or anything. It kinda sounds like Persian, though.'</p>
<p>'Holy cow, upstairs???? Upstairs is amazing! How do you even know that?'</p>
<p>'What the heck do I know? I'm just bragging; you can just say whatever.'</p>
<p>'Damn it, reported! You fooled my feelings!'</p>
<p>'Doesn't 'dovahkiin' in the game mean Dragonborn? Translated into English, it's 'Dragonborn', but I searched with a translation app, and it can't translate it at all!'</p>
<p>'Speaking of which, could this be a language specially made up for <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>? Didn't <em>Warcraft</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> also have languages like Sheikah?'</p>
<p>'Now that you mention it, it's not impossible!'</p>
<p>'No, what are you arguing about? Open the video again and listen carefully. What Finnish, what Persian? This is clearly Chinese! Listen: Paladin, Paladin, let his blood stain the ground; pick up bows, pick up guns, we challenge with ambition… Isn't that Chinese?'</p>
<p>'I swear to god, where did this genius come from? I can't hold back my laughter at this phonetic transcription!'</p>
<p>'This can be phonetically transcribed? But don't tell me, it actually sounds quite similar!'</p>
<p>(End of Chapter)
