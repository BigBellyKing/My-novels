                <p>Chapter 349: Playtest (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>As soon as the video was released, it instantly ignited the players' enthusiasm.</p>
<p>After this period, the popularity of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare had basically started to decline. After all, there wasn't much content to discuss, mainly just the story. As for multiplayer mode, while players discussed it a lot, it was clearly less engaging compared to the previous discussions about the story. It was mostly strategy-oriented content. For example, what playstyle to use on which map, which guns were better, and how to scientifically equip each gun. Players were still researching these things.</p>
<p>Of course, a larger portion of players belonged to the 'who cares, just grab a gun and go' type. While the combat was very satisfying, the core gameplay wasn't significantly different from previous FPS games. It was just more enjoyable to play. Of course, this reason alone was enough to attract many players to play it. However, it still lacked a sense of amazement, far less than when players first experienced the story mode of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, and also not as impactful as the initial surprise brought by the hardcore gameplay of Rainbow Six Siege.</p>
<p>Now, this brand-new CG promotional video sparked widespread discussion and heated debate among players. It wasn't very long, but it contained a wealth of content.</p>
<p>First, what excited many players was the reappearance of Soap, Captain Price, and Ghost. As for Roach? Many players guessed it was the one giving a thumbs-up on the plane, but whether it truly was, players didn't know. After all, Roach never showed his face in the game.</p>
<p>And this new mode, named 'Warzone,' judging by the scattered hints in the CG and the visual presentation. It clearly showed attack helicopters carrying players to a city. And there were 150 people in the city. Various items and vehicles were scattered throughout the city, and players would parachute down to different locations to eliminate others. Ultimately, only one player or one squad could survive. After all, at the end, only Captain Price and his Task Force 141 left on the attack helicopter. As for the 150 people, it was highly likely they were all players.</p>
<p>Within this game framework, players could make various choices. They could engage in firefights with others, or act as a camper, like the Ghillie Suit sniper from before, taking potshots. Furthermore, from the video, the gameplay was very rich, with land vehicles like jeeps, and even attack helicopters, including Claymores, RPGs, and a wide array of firearms. Cluster bombs and UAV drones, content present in the story and multiplayer modes, were also available in Warzone. And it seemed that after a player was eliminated, they wouldn't be immediately out of the game but would be sent to the Gulag. There was also a Poison Circle mechanic, which seemed to compress and reduce the players' active area. Players who had played the second installment were generally familiar with this place.</p>
<p>Because there were no so-called Battle Royale novels or movies in the Parallel World, Chen Xu didn't use the term 'Battle Royale' in the promotion. After all, players wouldn't have a direct impression if he did. However, despite the gameplay being similar to Battle Royale and its related themes. But in the inherent 'survival of the fittest' mode and the promotional CG video, Chen Xu had already clearly hinted at various gameplay styles.</p>
<p>After discussions among players, the content of this new mode called 'Warzone' was quickly analyzed. In response, players' reactions varied.</p>
<p>'This doesn't seem to be much different, does it? Vehicles, killstreak systems, and firearms – aren't all these in regular modes and the story?'</p>
<p>'Yeah, it feels like nothing has changed except for a bigger map.'</p>
<p>'The main thing is the gameplay has changed, I think it's quite interesting. You can even go to prison to box after dying?'</p>
<p>'Also, this mode feels very unbalanced! If you don't bring a gun, won't you only be able to use a small pistol if you don't find one?'</p>
<p>'Bro upstairs, I don't know if you're genuinely stupid or just pretending. If you don't have a gun, does that mean others do? It's all about luck, just like playing regular modes. If someone gets strong teammates and you get pig teammates, are you going to say that's unbalanced too?'</p>
<p>'Honestly, I think this mode is quite interesting, and with such a large map and so many players, there will be many variables.'</p>
<p>'I don't know about other things, but anyone who likes to shoot everywhere will definitely become the center of attention. Maybe six sniper rifles will be pointed at them as they walk down the street.'</p>
<p>'LOL, I can picture it now. But I'm still quite disappointed. When I saw Captain Price, Ghost, and Soap, I thought it would be story DLC content.'</p>
<p>'Ah, don't even mention it. Talking about Soap makes me sad.'</p>
<p>Players' opinions varied; some found it interesting, while others couldn't understand why Nebula Games went to such great lengths. This included Howard Warsaw from Atrai, who was also experiencing a mix of surprise and joy at this moment. The surprise was: What grudge, what enmity!? Their Storm Action had already been delayed until the tenth! How could Nebula Games still come after them!? Not giving them a chance to live!</p>
<p>The joy was that Howard Warsaw also immediately studied this new mode called 'Warzone'. Like some players, Howard Warsaw also didn't find the 'Warzone' mode particularly interesting. Because it felt like a hodgepodge. Picking up guns had been done in traditional FPS games. Large map battlefields also existed, but few were done well, mostly being niche and hardcore. As for killstreak rewards and firearms, these were all part of the main Call of Duty game. The only somewhat novel thing was boxing after death for another chance. But how was that different from team modes where you could respawn after death? Wasn't it just to reduce players' frustration after being eliminated?</p>
<p>As for the other Poison Circle mechanic, Howard Warsaw could also guess a few things. That is, the game map might be too large, and if not restricted, players probably wouldn't even encounter each other. But this felt a bit like taking off your pants to fart (doing something unnecessarily complicated or pointless). Although he highly valued Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, from these content points, Howard Warsaw truly couldn't find it very interesting. It was like in his previous life, many people, before Battle Royale became popular, simply saw the gameplay and concept but didn't pay much attention to it.</p>
<p>Now there was an awkward situation: should Storm Action still launch as scheduled? But Howard Warsaw didn't have to agonize for too long, as the company had already issued an order. That was to maintain the original launch plan. As for the reason, Atrai had naturally collected player feedback online and internally analyzed that this new mode wouldn't have a significant impact. This also made Howard Warsaw very happy. Why? Because there was now a scapegoat! And if it wasn't his proposal, then this final blame shouldn't fall on him, right?</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>July 6th, the day Call of Duty: Warzone was announced to be open for playtesting in the previous promotional CG video. Many previously puzzled players immediately downloaded it. This included many players who hadn't purchased the main Call of Duty: Modern Warfare game. After all, this game mode was open to all players. Some players who hadn't bought the main game took this opportunity to check out Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's graphics and action-shooting feel. Of course, most were players curious about this new mode.</p>
<p>Just finished Sword and Fairy 7, how should I put it... it exceeded my expectations, after all, the sixth one was really bad~ As for the internet celebrity face, I didn't find anything wrong with it, and the female protagonist's white stockings were really top-tier~ Finally, Elden Ring was delayed!</p>
<p>(End of Chapter)
