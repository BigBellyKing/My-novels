<p>Chapter 760: The Water Temperature Has Become Scalding!</p>
<p>Regarding this mode, Zhang Yi said he had already seen through everything.</p>
<p>He understood it too well.</p>
<p>Start by giving the player a bait—making them feel that finding a fragment was this easy, so wouldn't it be simple to meet the conditions with just a bit more searching?</p>
<p>If you actually think that way, you'll fall straight into Mr. Chen's trap.</p>
<p>Can a fragment passively handed over possibly be the same as one actively sought?</p>
<p>From the beginning until now, no monsters had even appeared, yet the fear was already overwhelming.</p>
<p>The dead silence, combined with the oppressive atmosphere, made one's heart race with anxiety.</p>
<p>And now, to search for fragments, having to delve into every corner of the Silent Hill town—wasn't that asking for trouble?</p>
<p>Clever as he was, he had already seen through it all.</p>
<p>But then, after checking the time, Zhang Yi felt as if he was starting to sweat.</p>
<p>It had already been nearly half an hour since the game started?</p>
<p>Let’s calculate what he had actually done in the game.</p>
<p>It seemed like all he'd done was trigger a segment of James’s inner monologue and background introduction upon arriving in Silent Hill, and incidentally learned about the town’s oddities and direction from that black-haired woman.</p>
<p>Other than that, he had simply been traveling!</p>
<p>Although, primarily because he was just too slow.</p>
<p>Although the game had a running function, Zhang Yi almost exclusively walked instead of ran.</p>
<p>Because in this environment of utter stillness, the sound of leather shoes stepping and heavy breathing, paired with the faint, almost imperceptible background melody, was suffocatingly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Walking was slower, but still bearable.</p>
<p>Advancing bit by bit along the map, Zhang Yi suddenly stopped when he reached a place resembling a crossroads.</p>
<p>"Damn it! Blood! So much blood!"</p>
<p>Pools of blood were scattered across the road ahead, already coagulated into a dark red, stretching into the depths of the street around the corner.</p>
<p>Judging by the shape of the bloodstains, it was as if some creature had died, bled out, and then been dragged away.</p>
<p>Before Zhang Yi could speculate further, the monster’s earlier bellow echoed once more in his ears.</p>
<p>Turning toward the sound, he saw within the white mist a grotesquely twisted figure appear—then vanish.</p>
<p>He silently swallowed, the fleeting image of the monster still lingering in his mind.</p>
<p>It looked somewhat like a humanoid creature, but its walking posture and physique were completely unnatural.</p>
<p>Utterly bizarre.</p>
<p>"What the hell is this thing?!"</p>
<p>Zhang Yi’s heart pounded.</p>
<p>Even though earlier he’d casually said things like, "It’d be good if a monster showed up."</p>
<p>But when the monster actually appeared, the feeling was entirely different.</p>
<p>"So next, I should follow the blood trail, heading in the direction the monster disappeared?"</p>
<p>Judging from the map and the bloodstains on the ground, it was clearly a hint.</p>
<p>In a normal game flow, you’d definitely move forward in the direction the monster vanished.</p>
<p>But right now, Zhang Yi felt completely unnerved—just like Lord Ye’s love of dragons.</p>
<p>He’d been shouting for monsters to come, but now that one actually appeared, he was terrified.</p>
<p>After hesitating for a long time, Zhang Yi slowly began groping forward into the white mist.</p>
<p>The blood on the ground acted like signposts, guiding Zhang Yi’s path as he passed a corner intersection.</p>
<p>At that moment, a noise reached his ears.</p>
<p>‘Zi-zi-zi-zi…’</p>
<p>It sounded like electrical interference. The noise was coming from a construction zone.</p>
<p>On both sides were barbed wire, and directly ahead stood a wooden barricade, but there was a large hole just big enough for an adult to crawl through.</p>
<p>After crawling through, Zhang Yi discovered the source of the sound was a radio.</p>
<p>The environment had been deathly silent before, and Zhang Yi had hoped for some sound, even some monsters.</p>
<p>Now, everything he had wished for had appeared.</p>
<p>Footsteps and the sound of glass breaking echoed.</p>
<p>Looking into the shadows ahead, Zhang Yi shivered involuntarily.</p>
<p>Beyond the white mist, a monster was slowly approaching him in an incredibly twisted posture.</p>
<p>Externally, the creature was humanoid, but bizarrely, it had no facial features. Its upper body was covered in a rubber-like material, writhing unnaturally as it moved.</p>
<p>It also had no arms—or rather, its arms were bound within that rubbery substance.</p>
<p>This was the very same shadow that had vanished in the mist earlier. Zhang Yi recognized it instantly.</p>
<p>As the monster appeared, James in the game kept retreating until he slammed into the wooden barricade. He instinctively pulled out a wooden stick embedded with an iron nail.</p>
<p>Next, the game switched to a controllable interface for Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>"I can kill it!" Zhang Yi’s voice was even tinged with tearful joy.</p>
<p>The monster before him moved extremely slowly, comparable to the zombies in Resident Evil, and didn’t even have the zombies’ strong life energy.</p>
<p>Two whacks with the stick and the monster dropped dead, making Zhang Yi exhale in relief.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, fear stems from insufficient firepower. Since this monster was so easy to kill, Zhang Yi suddenly felt confident again.</p>
<p>At the same time, the radio beside him stopped emitting the ‘zi-zi’ static.</p>
<p>Instead, it began playing a series of fragmented sounds that seemed like Mary’s voice, though broken and unintelligible.</p>
<p>After exploring and finding nothing else, Zhang Yi took the radio and continued forward.</p>
<p>When he passed through the mist and reached another intersection, the radio emitted the ‘zi-zi’ static once more.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the previous monster reappeared within the white mist—and not just one.</p>
<p>In a town that had previously been so dead silent, so many monsters now appeared.</p>
<p>"This… the water temperature seems… gradually becoming scalding."</p>
<p>Looking at the monsters around him, Zhang Yi’s big toe tensed slightly.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Yi also quickly noticed a characteristic: whenever a monster was nearby, the radio in his possession would emit ‘zi-zi’ static.</p>
<p>This made him both anxious and puzzled.</p>
<p>Because usually, horror games aim to suddenly shock the player, right?</p>
<p>But this radio was directly warning the player, “Monsters nearby—get ready mentally.”</p>
<p>But soon, Zhang Yi realized that even with mental preparation, it was meaningless.</p>
<p>In fact, after obtaining this warning radio, the fear didn’t lessen—it intensified.</p>
<p>Not from sudden fright, but from a growing sense of oppression, a paranoid unease.</p>
<p>Before, walking through this dead-silent world, faced with endless white fog, hearing only the protagonist’s breathing and footsteps, Zhang Yi had feared that a monster might suddenly appear and scare him.</p>
<p>Now, although he had the radio, which emitted noise whenever monsters were near, giving him time to prepare, that paranoid feeling remained.</p>
<p>Because Zhang Yi kept thinking: what if there was a scenario where the radio didn’t make a sound, and then a ghost suddenly popped out and scared him?</p>
<p>At first, he hadn’t felt it, but after playing for a while, an indescribable sense of oppression made Zhang Yi’s heart pound rapidly.</p>
<p>Treading carefully through the Silent Hill town, Zhang Yi found an apartment key on a corpse located in a corner.</p>
<p>Wandering the streets in dread and fear for what felt like ages, he finally located the apartment’s entrance.</p>
<p>However, upon entering the apartment, Zhang Yi instantly realized the saying “women are fickle” was inaccurate—because men are fickle too.</p>
<p>Earlier, while facing the eerie fog in the Silent Hill town, he had thought, “This is too oppressive. An environment as dark as Outlast would be easier to handle.”</p>
<p>Well, now he was in the apartment—wasn’t this exactly a dark environment?!</p>
<p>After fumbling around the lobby for a long time, he found a map and barely managed to determine his location.</p>
<p>Then, in Room 205 on the second floor, he found a flashlight.</p>
<p>But what alarmed Zhang Yi was that the moment he picked up the flashlight, the radio on his person began emitting ‘zi-zi’ static.</p>
<p>Then, on the ground, a creature made of two legs joined together—top and bottom—wobbled unsteadily to its feet.</p>
<p>Under the flashlight’s beam, the connection points looked bloody and raw, while the rest resembled mannequin legs.</p>
<p>Though, like the previous monster, it died after a few hits with the stick, its extremely grotesque appearance made Zhang Yi’s scalp tingle to the point of numbness.</p>
<p>"But at least I don’t have to search for batteries like in Outlast. A nuclear-powered flashlight—definitely worth it!"</p>
<p>After confirming the flashlight had no battery mechanic, Zhang Yi breathed a small sigh of relief.</p>
<p>With the flashlight, Zhang Yi continued exploring various rooms. He also discovered that these mannequin-like creatures were particularly sensitive to light—shining the flashlight on them immediately caused them to revive.</p>
<p>In other rooms of the apartment, Zhang Yi found a handgun, and in one room, he saw a man dead beside a television and a strange floor-standing clock.</p>
<p>When he reached the third floor, the path ahead was blocked by iron bars, with a glowing key lying on the floor.</p>
<p>Without thinking much, Zhang Yi controlled the character to go prone and reach his hand through the bars to grab the key.</p>
<p>But the next moment, a little girl suddenly burst out from a room, kicking the key far away.</p>
<p>As she ran deeper into the apartment, she glanced back at James, her face bearing an innocent smile and a mischievous expression: "Haha…"</p>
<p>‘Gulp.’</p>
<p>Watching the little girl disappear into the darkness, Zhang Yi swallowed hard.</p>
<p>If this were any other game and he encountered a troublemaking player, he’d definitely curse them out—after all, griefers in games are so annoying.</p>
<p>The troublemaking kid in New God of War could be excused since it was Kratos’s own son, but he still remembered those money-stealing troublemakers he’d met upon first arriving at Saint Denis in Red Dead Redemption.</p>
<p>But the key point was—this game was Silent Hill!</p>
<p>Although on the surface, this was just a playful little girl.</p>
<p>But with the corpse in the second-floor room, the mannequin creatures, and this dark setting, could a troublemaking kid here possibly be normal?!</p>
<p>Dark scenes, still dead silence, eerie creatures, and a little girl.</p>
<p>Though he was inside a game, Zhang Yi could almost hear the pounding of his own heart.</p>
<p>In that instant, he truly wanted to shut off the game and pull open the curtains to see the sunlight outside.</p>
<p>But then he thought of his birthday, and the look of surprise on Old Song’s face when he gave him that CDKEY.</p>
<p>At that thought, Zhang Yi felt the motivation to keep playing once again.</p>
