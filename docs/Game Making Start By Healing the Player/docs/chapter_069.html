                <h2>Chapter 69: Overcooked? Arguing Kitchen!</h2>
<p>At the same time, on Shark TV.</p>
<p>Even though it was Lunar New Year, numerous streamers, big and small, were still live-streaming various games.</p>
<p>Inside Dong Zhen’s live stream room, he was showing his audience some attractive legs.</p>
<p>‘What the heck! You’re the one who wants to see legs, yet you claim we all do!’</p>
<p>‘Bro, what did I do to disappoint you?’</p>
<p>‘Right here? Pretty average!’</p>
<p>‘Boss, since it’s the holidays, why don’t we stream that new game? Chen Xu’s new work, <em>Overcooked</em>, just launched. It looks pretty fun.’</p>
<p>‘I saw it too. <em>Overcooked</em> does look genuinely entertaining.’</p>
<p>Dong Zhen, who had been watching long, white legs on stream, finally noticed the bullet comments flooding in.</p>
<p>‘Ah, come on! It’s the holiday season—perfect time to show you all the things you enjoy and strengthen our bond. Personally, I’m not even that into this stuff!’</p>
<p>‘Let me check—multiplayer cooperation game, huh? Perfect. I’ll see what A'Shu is up to and if he’s free.’</p>
<p>Dong Zhen opened the game platform, searched for <em>Overcooked</em>, and took a quick glance. That’s when he remembered—it was the same game by Chen Xu.</p>
<p>He still had a clear impression of Chen Xu, the Game Designer.</p>
<p>First, <em>To the Moon</em> had deeply moved him with its warmth, then <em>Outlast</em> terrified him completely. Such a dramatic shift in genres was unforgettable.</p>
<p>After reviewing the game details, he navigated to another streamer’s channel on Shark TV’s gaming section. Many streamers knew each other, and often teamed up for multiplayer games.</p>
<p>Upon entering the other streamer’s room, he saw a man wearing a baseball cap, black-framed glasses, a small beard on his chin, and a black shirt—telling a story.</p>
<p>‘Society’s much better now! Back in the day, school gates were full of thugs! What did they do? Extortion! Claiming younger siblings. They’d walk up, pat your head, and say: “Hey bros, lend us some cash. From now on, if anything happens at school, just tell us.” Got money or not? Hand it over fast. If I have to search you, it’s one slap per dime I find. Will you hand it over yourself, or should I search?’</p>
<p>‘Squad Leader A'Shu, you sound so familiar—did you used to rob people as a kid?’</p>
<p>‘Heh… heh heh heh… Let me tell you, if I’d done it often, my performance wouldn’t be this vivid. The victim’s and the bully’s perspectives are always different.’</p>
<p>As A'Shu recounted his childhood memories, Dong Zhen sent him a message. Viewers watching both streams simultaneously began spamming bullet comments.</p>
<p>‘Rare visitor! Long time no see! Squad Leader Dong, wanna play a game? No problem—let’s jump into the voice channel first.’</p>
<p>The two met up in the voice channel.</p>
<p>‘Squad Leader A'Shu, how have you been?’</p>
<p>‘Very well, very well!’</p>
<p>For show, they exchanged polite pleasantries.</p>
<p>‘Just the two of us playing? This game supports up to four players, right?’ A'Shu asked.</p>
<p>‘There’s even a Versus Mode. Should I try inviting two more? Liuliu and Zhuangzhuang seem to be playing too. Want me to check?’ Dong Zhen suggested.</p>
<p>‘Sure, go ahead,’ A'Shu replied.</p>
<p>Soon, two more people joined the voice channel.</p>
<p>With the four of them now grouped, viewers in each stream grew excited, flooding the screens with bullet comments.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, streamers played solo, with little interaction. But during the holiday season, and with a multiplayer game like <em>Overcooked</em>, this rare scene unfolded.</p>
<p>‘Should we jump straight into PvP? We haven’t even gotten familiar with it yet,’ A'Shu asked.</p>
<p>‘Nah, we’re all new—let’s just try it out,’ Dong Zhen proposed.</p>
<p>‘How should we form teams?’ Liuliu asked over voice chat.</p>
<p>‘I’ll team with the old man. You and Zhuangzhuang pair up. That’s settled,’ A'Shu declared.</p>
<p>After a brief discussion, they quickly agreed.</p>
<p>Entering PvP mode for the first time came with guided instructions.</p>
<p>Creating a private room, selecting a map, and setting rules—none of it was difficult.</p>
<p>They simply used the default settings.</p>
<p>Then they entered the game.</p>
<p>Still, to get used to the controls, they first ran through the Tutorial Level.</p>
<p><em>Overcooked</em>’s tutorial wasn’t complicated—rather, it was simple.</p>
<p>It progressed step by step: chopping ingredients, cooking, washing dishes, handling distractions—all separated into distinct sections.</p>
<p>So Dong Zhen and the others had just one impression:</p>
<p>Simple. Easy.</p>
<p>But once they entered Versus Mode, everything changed completely.</p>
<p>With orders pouring in and intense background audio, an inexplicable tension filled the air.</p>
<p>It felt as if they were standing in a noisy restaurant kitchen, surrounded by impatient customers waiting in line.</p>
<p>Unlike the tutorial, this mode mixed everything together—cooking, chopping, washing dishes, all at once.</p>
<p>More crucially, the two players on each team were separated.</p>
<p>This meant that as independent individuals, they couldn’t coordinate perfectly on any single task.</p>
<p>Chaos erupted instantly.</p>
<p>‘Zhuangzhuang, chop the meat! Chop it now!’ Liuliu, gripping her controller, shouted at Zhuangzhuang sitting beside her.</p>
<p>‘Sis, stop rushing me! You’re flinging dishes everywhere! You haven’t even washed the plates—what good is chopped meat if the dishes aren’t ready? And can’t you chop meat inside too?’ Zhuangzhuang, using the keyboard, launched into a chattering-style grumble.</p>
<p>‘What did you say?’ Liuliu glared angrily at her brother sitting right next to her.</p>
<p>‘N-Nothing… nothing. Sis, I’m delivering food, delivering!’ Zhuangzhuang shrank his neck in fear, suddenly remembering that although they were using headsets and voice chat, his actual sister was right beside him.</p>
<p>Already flustered, being scolded by his own sister only made Zhuangzhuang more confused. Dazed, he picked up an unfinished dish and handed it to the serving window.</p>
<p>‘Zhuangzhuang, wake up! Wake up! This dish isn’t done yet—why are you serving it?! And that’s not even our window—it’s the opponent’s!’ Liuliu stared in disbelief as Zhuangzhuang handed over the incomplete dish.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dong Zhen and A'Shu weren’t faring any better.</p>
<p>‘Squad Leader Dong, we’re selling food here—could you stop throwing ingredients on the floor all the time? This isn’t an India kitchen!’</p>
<p>‘Forget the food! Squad Leader A'Shu, hurry up! What the heck, the place is on fire, and you’re still picking up vegetables? Put out the fire already!!’</p>
<p>‘It’s not my fault—the fire spread from next door! And wasn’t that ingredient you threw on the ground in the first place?!’</p>
<p>‘How is it my fault you didn’t catch it?!’</p>
<p>‘You seriously blaming me? You never put it on the table—always tossing it on the floor!’</p>
<p>Thus, over one small incident, they began arguing.</p>
<p>Yelling while cooking, they only became more chaotic.</p>
<p>With constant order reminders piling up, the entire kitchen descended into utter Chaos.</p>
<p>Viewers, watching the mayhem unfold in the live stream room, burst into laughter.</p>
<p>‘Haha, the Da Zhou siblings have gone from inseparable to nearly broken!’</p>
<p>‘The Taiyuan Flame Blade and the Babao Dong Family Spear are on the verge of splitting!’</p>
<p>‘233333, this is hilarious.’</p>
<p>‘Is this game really supposed to strengthen relationships? Looks like they’re about to start fighting!’</p>
<p>‘Isn’t it strengthening relationships? Look at how red the old man’s face is!’</p>
<p>‘This isn’t <em>Overcooked</em>—it’s Arguing Kitchen!’</p>
