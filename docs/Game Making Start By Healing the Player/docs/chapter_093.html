                <p>Chapter 93: The Arrangement of Dark Souls</p>
<p>Choosing <em>Dark Souls</em>, or rather, the third installment which serves as the final chapter of the Dark Souls series, was something Chen Xu had carefully considered.</p>
<p>In his previous life, <em>Dark Souls</em> was a quite massive series.</p>
<p>From the first installment to the third, which depicted the final era of Linking the Fire.</p>
<p>It told players a magnificent, epic story about the Age of Fire.</p>
<p>Among them, the first and third installments left a deeper impression on players.</p>
<p>This was mainly because the second installment was not personally handled by Hidetaka Miyazaki, and it became a point of criticism for many players.</p>
<p>Specifically, <em>Dark Souls 2</em> had many areas that adopted a 'mob-piling' style of difficulty.</p>
<p>This is also why the second installment didn't achieve the same level of renown as the first and third.</p>
<p>As for Chen Xu's decision to proceed with the development of <em>Dark Souls 3</em>.</p>
<p>The reason was very simple.</p>
<p>It was because, by the third installment, the core concepts of the Souls games had already matured.</p>
<p>For example, <em>Demon's Souls</em>, the original Souls-like game, many players found it harder than <em>Dark Souls 3</em>, while others found it simpler.</p>
<p>However, the difficulty in that game wasn't primarily in the boss battles; it was more about its rather user-unfriendly design and maliciously crafted maps.</p>
<p>But <em>Dark Souls</em> was different; it could be called a standard level-driven game, or even a 'memorization game'.</p>
<p>Compared to the first installment, many players found the third a bit easier, which is perfectly valid.</p>
<p>Because the third installment is indeed the most suitable for beginners to get into Souls-like games.</p>
<p>If one were to rank Hidetaka Miyazaki's Souls-like games, temporarily setting aside <em>Dark Souls 2</em> (which he didn't personally produce) and <em>Demon's Souls</em> (his first attempt at a Souls-like game where various concepts were still immature).</p>
<p>Then, <em>Dark Souls 3</em> could be said to be the easiest compared to <em>Dark Souls 1</em>, <em>Sekiro</em>, <em>Bloodborne</em>, and <em>Elden Ring</em>. (Don't argue with me; if you want to argue, argue with Hidetaka Miyazaki, because the old geezer himself said this during a Famitsu interview about <em>Elden Ring</em>).</p>
<p>Unlike <em>Dark Souls 1</em>, which immediately let players run around aimlessly in the center of Firelink Shrine, often stumbling into high-level areas.</p>
<p><em>Dark Souls 3</em> was very thoughtfully arranged in terms of its game pace, roughly following a 'learn-test-graduate-learn-test' model, which could be described as progressive.</p>
<p>Precisely because of this, <em>Dark Souls 3</em> is also the highest-selling Souls game to date.</p>
<p>Of course, the difficulty of <em>Dark Souls 1</em> was also quite close to that of <em>Demon's Souls</em>, as it was an early title in the Souls series after all.</p>
<p>However, it differed somewhat from <em>Demon's Souls</em>' map design; limited by development funds and content at the time, <em>Dark Souls 1</em> adopted a very clever approach.</p>
<p>It referenced and drew inspiration from <em>Metroid</em> and <em>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</em> for map structure design, adopting a Mobius strip model.</p>
<p>This, in turn, became a major highlight of the Souls series and has been preserved ever since.</p>
<p>One could say that when it comes to Hidetaka Miyazaki's Souls-like games, if you were to ask about groundbreaking achievements...</p>
<p>Like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> establishing the standards for 3D games – well, there isn't really anything like that in Souls-like games.</p>
<p>Because all the mechanics were already established.</p>
<p>Rolling, parrying, backstabs, grappling hooks, blocking, including map design and fragmented storytelling – none of these were pioneered by Souls games.</p>
<p>However, its greatest feature was combining these existing mechanics to create a game with a unique style.</p>
<p>The so-called 'difficulty' was merely a superficial label.</p>
<p>If one truly believes that Souls-like games equal difficulty, then one could only say they are looking in the completely wrong direction.</p>
<p>It was precisely for these reasons, and considering the tolerance levels of players in the Parallel World.</p>
<p>That Chen Xu chose <em>Dark Souls 3</em> as the next new title to develop.</p>
<p>Another reason, of course, was that from a development capability standpoint, a level-driven game is somewhat simpler to create than a typical game.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as a project to establish the reputation and brand of the Nebula Games platform, its widespread appeal had to be taken into account.</p>
<p>Souls-like games, with their unique charm, were clearly a rather suitable option.</p>
<p>After all, the live streaming industry in the Parallel World was also very well-developed compared to his previous life, and games like <em>Dark Souls</em> could achieve a widespread boost in popularity through live streaming platforms.</p>
<p>In his previous life, <em>Dark Souls 3</em> and <em>Sekiro</em> enjoyed extremely high popularity domestically, which was inseparable from the development of the live streaming and video industries.</p>
<p>As for the story, that was not an issue at all, because for Souls-like games, level design is more important than the narrative itself.</p>
<p>Of course, fragmented storytelling remains a major characteristic of Souls-like games.</p>
<p>Unless you, as a player, are a rare genius, it's basically impossible to fully understand the complete story of a Souls-like game in just one playthrough.</p>
<p>After completing the first playthrough, you'd at most only grasp a general idea.</p>
<p>Many plot points aren't directly told to you during gameplay, but are hidden in various places, requiring players to piece them together.</p>
<p>This also led to the unique charm of the Souls series: a thousand players have a thousand opinions.</p>
<p>Everyone has a unique understanding of the story of <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>Because a great deal of content related to the plot and world-building is scattered throughout the game in fragmented form.</p>
<p>Typically, it requires deep digging to roughly understand the direction of the story.</p>
<p>Thus, the story of <em>Dark Souls</em> was continuously dug into and studied by players, even giving rise to memes like 'Souls scholars'.</p>
<p>As the story of the end of the Age of Fire, <em>Dark Souls 3</em> could entirely utilize a flashback technique to present it to players.</p>
<p>All that was needed was to handle some in-game homages and easter egg elements as foreshadowing for subsequent prequels.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Inside the Nebula Games office, Chen Xu leaned back in his chair, eyes closed, contemplating the future direction of <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>As for the gameplay design concept drafts and such, Chen Xu wasn't in a hurry for now.</p>
<p>Because even if he were to 'grind them out' now, project development still required a preparation period.</p>
<p>Before that, the points accumulated from <em>Overcooked</em> before the New Year could be used for a big 'gacha pull' to improve his abilities in various aspects, and at the same time, see if he could draw some good items.</p>
<p>As for <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em>, they hadn't provided many points yet.</p>
<p>Because these two games had only officially launched after the gameplay Expo concluded.</p>
<p>So they hadn't provided many points.</p>
<p>After mentally reviewing the future direction of <em>Dark Souls</em>, Chen Xu opened his browser and the Nebula Games platform's backend to check on the performance of <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Sanguosha</em>.</p>
<p><em>Dark Souls</em>, as Nebula Games' first AAA-tier game, was considered a long-term project.</p>
<p>Although players expressed high anticipation, he could only tell them that "it's being made".</p>
<p><em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em> would be the cornerstones of Nebula Games for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>And it wasn't just Chen Xu himself.</p>
<p>Many Game Designers in the industry had also been keeping an eye on <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em>.</p>
<p>After all, during the gameplay Expo, these two games had truly stood out.</p>
<p>Many Game Designers and developers were also paying close attention to the relevant data after these two games officially launched.</p>
<p>A game isn't considered successful just by being popular; gross revenue and sales volume are the core determinants of a game's success or failure.</p>
<p>(Daily request for recommendation tickets and monthly passes. Before <em>Dark Souls</em>, I'm also planning to write a small-scale, low-cost game to bridge the timeline. Keywords: three men, one woman, one dog. What is it, guess?)</p>
