                <p>Chapter 93: The Arrangement for Dark Souls</p>
<p>Choosing <em>Dark Souls</em>, or specifically the third installment as the final chapter of the Dark Souls series, was a decision Chen Xu made after careful consideration.</p>
<p>In his previous life, <em>Dark Souls</em> was an exceptionally extensive series.</p>
<p>From the original title to the third entry, which marked the end of the Age of Fire.</p>
<p>It told players an epic, grand-scale story about the Age of Fire.</p>
<p>Among them, the first and third installments left the strongest impressions on players.</p>
<p>This was mainly because the second game wasn't directly handled by Hidetaka Miyazaki, which led to many players criticizing it.</p>
<p>Specifically, <em>Dark Souls 2</em> featured numerous mob-piling difficulties in various sections.</p>
<p>This is also why the second installment didn't achieve the same level of fame as the first and third.</p>
<p>As for why Chen Xu prioritized the development of <em>Dark Souls 3</em>,</p>
<p>the reason was very straightforward.</p>
<p>By the third game, the core philosophy of Souls-like games had essentially matured.</p>
<p>Take <em>Demon's Souls</em>, the original Souls-like title—many players felt it was harder than <em>Dark Souls 3</em>, while others thought it was easier.</p>
<p>However, the difficulty of that game didn’t primarily stem from BOSS battles, but rather from user-unfriendly design and malicious map layouts.</p>
<p><em>Dark Souls</em>, on the other hand, was different. It could be considered a standard level-driven game, or even a memorization game.</p>
<p>Compared to the first installment, many players believed the third was slightly easier, and this was perfectly valid.</p>
<p>Because <em>Dark Souls 3</em> was indeed the most beginner-friendly entry into the Souls-like genre.</p>
<p>If one were to rank Hidetaka Miyazaki's Souls-like games, temporarily setting aside <em>Dark Souls 2</em> (which he didn't personally direct) and <em>Demon's Souls</em> (his first attempt at the genre, where many concepts were still immature),</p>
<p>the difficulty ranking would place <em>Dark Souls 3</em> as the easiest when compared to <em>Dark Souls 1</em>, <em>Sekiro</em>, <em>Bloodborne</em>, and <em>Elden Ring</em>. (Don't argue. If you want to argue, take it up with Hidetaka Miyazaki himself, because this is exactly what the Old Geezer said in a Famitsu interview about <em>Elden Ring</em>.)</p>
<p>Unlike <em>Dark Souls 1</em>, which dropped players directly into the center of Firelink Shrine and allowed them to wander into high-level zones by accident,</p>
<p><em>Dark Souls 3</em> arranged its pacing considerately, roughly following a pattern of learn—test—graduate—learn—test, making it truly progressive.</p>
<p>Precisely for this reason, <em>Dark Souls 3</em> achieved the highest sales of any Souls game to date.</p>
<p>Of course, <em>Dark Souls 1</em> was also quite difficult, close to <em>Demon's Souls</em>, as it was an early Souls series title.</p>
<p>But it differed from <em>Demon's Souls</em> in map design. Due to budget constraints at the time of development, <em>Dark Souls 1</em> adopted a clever approach.</p>
<p>It referenced and borrowed the map structure design philosophies from <em>Metroid</em> and <em>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</em>, adopting a Möbius strip pattern.</p>
<p>This unexpectedly became a major highlight of the Souls series and was preserved throughout.</p>
<p>When it comes to groundbreaking achievements in Hidetaka Miyazaki's Souls-like games,</p>
<p>if you're looking for something as revolutionary as how <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> established the standard for 3D games, such a moment doesn't really exist in Souls-like games.</p>
<p>Because all the core mechanics had already existed before.</p>
<p>Rolling, Perfect Guard, backstabs, grappling hook, blocking—along with map design and fragmented storytelling—none of these were invented by Souls games.</p>
<p>Yet its greatest feature lies in combining all these pre-existing elements into a game with a distinct and unique style.</p>
<p>The so-called "difficulty" is merely a superficial label.</p>
<p>To equate Souls-like games solely with "difficulty" means you've completely misunderstood their essence.</p>
<p>It was precisely for these reasons, and with consideration of player endurance in this Parallel World,</p>
<p>that Chen Xu chose <em>Dark Souls 3</em> as his next development project.</p>
<p>Of course, another reason was development feasibility—being a level-driven game, it was relatively simpler to develop compared to other game types.</p>
<p>Moreover, as the flagship project meant to establish Nebula Games Platform's reputation, its potential for virality had to be taken into account.</p>
<p>Souls-like games, with their unique charm, were clearly a suitable choice.</p>
<p>After all, the live streaming industry in this Parallel World was also far more advanced than in his previous life. Games like <em>Dark Souls</em> naturally saw their popularity amplified through live streaming platforms.</p>
<p>In his previous life, <em>Dark Souls 3</em> and <em>Sekiro</em> achieved massive popularity domestically, closely tied to the growth of streaming and video platforms.</p>
<p>As for the story aspect, that wasn't an issue either. In Souls-like games, level design mattered far more than narrative.</p>
<p>Of course, fragmented storytelling remained a hallmark of the series.</p>
<p>Unless you were a genius player, completing a first playthrough would barely let you grasp what the game’s story was actually about—it was nearly impossible.</p>
<p>After clearing one playthrough, you’d only understand the broad outline.</p>
<p>Many story elements weren't directly revealed during gameplay but were instead hidden throughout the game world, requiring players to piece them together.</p>
<p>This contributed to the unique appeal of the Souls series: a thousand players, a thousand interpretations.</p>
<p>Every player had their own unique understanding of the Dark Souls story.</p>
<p>Because vast portions of the lore and worldview were scattered across the game in fragmented form.</p>
<p>Typically, deep digging was required to roughly understand the narrative’s direction.</p>
<p>As a result, the story of <em>Dark Souls</em> was continuously explored and analyzed by players, eventually giving rise to memes like "Souls scholar."</p>
<p><em>Dark Souls 3</em>, as the story of the Age of Fire's end, could perfectly employ the flashback technique to present the narrative to players.</p>
<p>All that was needed was to handle the game’s tributes and easter egg elements, embedding them as foreshadowing for future prequels.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Inside the Nebula Games office, Chen Xu leaned back in his chair, eyes closed, pondering the future direction of <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>As for the design concept drafts for gameplay mechanics, Chen Xu wasn’t in a rush.</p>
<p>Even if he ground them out now, the project would still require a preparation period before actual development began.</p>
<p>Before that, the points he had accumulated from <em>Overcooked</em> since before the Lunar New Year could now be used for a big gacha pull—boosting his various abilities, and perhaps even landing some useful items.</p>
<p>As for <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em>, they hadn’t contributed many points yet.</p>
<p>Because both games were officially launched only after the gameplay Expo.</p>
<p>So they hadn't generated much in terms of points.</p>
<p>After mentally reviewing the future direction of <em>Dark Souls</em>, Chen Xu opened his browser and the Nebula Games platform backend, checking the performance metrics of <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Sanguosha</em>.</p>
<p><em>Dark Souls</em>, as Nebula Games' first AAA title, was a long-term project.</p>
<p>Although players were eagerly anticipating it, all he could do for now was respond with "it's being made."</p>
<p><em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em> would serve as Nebula Games’ main pillars in the coming period.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t just Chen Xu himself.</p>
<p>Many game designers in the industry were closely watching these two titles.</p>
<p>After all, during the gameplay Expo, both games had shined exceptionally.</p>
<p>Numerous game designers and developers were highly attentive to the post-launch data of these two games.</p>
<p>A game’s popularity alone didn’t define success—gross revenue and sales were the true indicators of a game’s triumph or failure.</p>
<p>(Daily request for recommendation votes and Monthly Pass. Before <em>Dark Souls</em>, I plan to write a low-budget game to bridge the timeline. Keyword: three men, one woman, one dog. Can you guess what it is?)</p>
