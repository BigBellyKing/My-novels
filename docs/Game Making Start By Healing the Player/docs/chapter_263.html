<p>Chapter 262: Mr. Chen's Time to Talk (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>For two consecutive days, numerous players online had been strongly demanding a nerf to Diablos and Rathalos, while also calling for an increase in the Long Sword's Numerical Design.</p>
<p>After seeing the tragic fates of so many Longsword Heroes, Mr. Chen, don't you feel any pain!?</p>
<p>Then, something unexpected happened.</p>
<p>On the official Weibo account, Chen Xu and Nebula Games actually published an announcement.</p>
<p>Live streaming platforms like Shark TV also released a notification about an event.</p>
<p>'On the evening of August 11th, Chen Xu, the designer of Monster Hunter: World, will host a live stream at 7:30 PM to answer questions players have about the game.'</p>
<p>Seeing this message, many Hunter players were momentarily stunned.</p>
<p>What does this mean!?</p>
<p>Chen Xu is going to livestream Monster Hunter: World and clarify everyone's doubts?</p>
<p>How novel!</p>
<p>Many players found it quite intriguing.</p>
<p>Of course, it's not particularly unusual for game designers to livestream.</p>
<p>Many developers in the industry have done this before.</p>
<p>It primarily helps bridge the gap between developers and players.</p>
<p>And it's also beneficial for game promotion.</p>
<p>However, this only works if the game's reputation and quality are solid—if your game is a complete mess, then going live?</p>
<p>You'll just get roasted!</p>
<p>But Chen Xu livestreaming to explain questions about Monster Hunter: World still felt fresh to many players.</p>
<p>After all, when designers do livestreams, they usually explain gameplay content, but rarely touch on balance issues, right?</p>
<p>Still, some veteran players recalled the so-called strategy guide videos from Dark Souls.</p>
<p>Regardless, it definitely attracted countless players.</p>
<p>At 7:20 PM that night, a massive audience gathered in Nebula Games' live stream room, already engaging in heated discussion.</p>
<p>This was prime evening streaming time, yet even major streamers from various game categories paused their own streams to directly enter Nebula Games' live stream room.</p>
<p>They were just as curious to see what would happen—after all, ever since Monster Hunter: World launched, the craze had swept across all major streaming websites.</p>
<p>Whether skill-oriented or entertainment-focused streamers, none were spared.</p>
<p>And the game delivered fantastic entertainment value, especially during the three-cat moments.</p>
<p>Aside from a few technical streamers who used their skills to hard-counter Diablos and Rathalos, most regular streamers were still suffering.</p>
<p>They'd rediscovered that familiar feeling from Dark Souls.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, players were chatting awkwardly in the live stream, staring at a black screen.</p>
<p>"I really want to see how Chen Xu will explain the weapon balance issues in Monster Hunter: World!"</p>
<p>"Exactly! Wasn't this supposed to be a hack-and-slash game? How did we end up being the grass getting mowed down?"</p>
<p>"Right! Long Sword players, unite! Let Chen Xu hear our voices!"</p>
<p>Soon, the screen lit up—the live stream began, and Chen Xu appeared on camera. Not only was Chen Xu there, but seated beside him were core members of the team, including Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and Lin Tao.</p>
<p>The audience immediately became excited. As soon as Chen Xu went live, many viewers received notifications and rushed in, causing the viewer count to skyrocket instantly.</p>
<p>"Hey! Not only Chen Xu—who are the people beside him?"</p>
<p>"Whoa, two incredibly beautiful young ladies! Does Nebula Games still hire? Do I qualify?"</p>
<p>"+1, does Nebula Games need a janitor?"</p>
<p>"Forget about the young ladies! Chen Xu, quickly explain the difficulty of Monster Hunter: World!"</p>
<p>"Exactly!"</p>
<p>Bullet comments flooded the screen uncontrollably. Even with chat restrictions enabled, they poured in like snowflakes.</p>
<p>At this moment, Chen Xu began speaking.</p>
<p>"Looks like the players are really passionate! Also, let me introduce the development team of Monster Hunter: World." Chen Xu first introduced the identities of Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, and others, then continued, "I've noticed that many players have raised some questions about Monster Hunter: World."</p>
<p>"But here's the thing—I did say Monster Hunter: World is a game with a completely different style from Dark Souls, but I never claimed it was a hack-and-slash game. So Nebula Games isn't taking the blame for that!" Chen Xu said with a light cough.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, the watching players were momentarily taken aback.</p>
<p>Hmm, come to think of it, that's actually true!</p>
<p>From the moment of release, Chen Xu had only stated that Monster Hunter: World wasn't a Souls-like game, but he never claimed it was a hack-and-slash game.</p>
<p>"And didn't you all initially think the game was too easy and wanted higher difficulty!?" Chen Xu added.</p>
<p>Hearing this, players suddenly remembered something.</p>
<p>Right—the current difficulty isn't even the highest yet! According to Chen Xu, there were supposedly Tempered monsters coming later. If it's already this hard now, just how insane would Tempered monsters be!?</p>
<p>Would it even be playable?</p>
<p>"Don't get too worked up. Monster Hunter: World is actually a game with perfectly balanced difficulty—completely different from Dark Souls."</p>
<p>"Especially in terms of the equipment system, the benefits of armor are much higher than in Dark Souls. Add in proper use of items and traps in the game, and it's actually quite easy. Even a complete beginner with clumsy hands can clear the game easily, as long as they understand the game mechanism," Chen Xu said, addressing the furious bullet comments.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, the bullet comments exploded with a row of '????'.</p>
<p>This symbol alone revealed the players' attitude:</p>
<p>'You keep talking, I guess?'</p>
<p>"Hey, don't throw question marks at me! Don't we designers still have basic trust with you players?" Chen Xu sighed with emotion.</p>
<p>As Chen Xu spoke, the live stream's bullet comments filled with identical phrases:</p>
<p>'Warrior of Love?' 'Old Geezer!' 'I've never seen such a <strong><em>_</em></strong>_!'</p>
<p>Trust?</p>
<p>Who exactly created Dark Souls, Outlast, Silent Hill PT, Overcooked, and that one with the big hammer? Don't you have any idea in your heart? And you still want our trust!</p>
<p>"Alright, fine. I'll demonstrate a bit of how various weapons and game mechanisms work in Monster Hunter: World, so you stop constantly complaining about weapon imbalance and excessive game difficulty." Chen Xu opened the Nebula Games Platform and launched the game.</p>
<p>In reality, Monster Hunter: World truly was a very player-friendly game—at least when compared to something like Dark Souls.</p>
<p>For regular players whose sole goal was to clear the game, there were actually many ways to achieve that.</p>
<p>Of course, clearing the game wasn't the only core aspect of Monster Hunter: World.</p>
<p>In fact, clearing the game was just the beginning—the real game only started then.</p>
<p>So Chen Xu wasn't worried about his demonstration causing any serious consequences.</p>
<p>In fact, quite a few players had already figured out some of the tricks—there just wasn't a complete strategy guide yet.</p>
<p>But that would probably surface within a day or two.</p>
<p>However, the players currently watching the stream clearly didn't understand Chen Xu's intentions.</p>
<p>They began chatting in the bullet comments.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen is going to demonstrate Monster Hunter: World! Wonder how skilled he is!"</p>
<p>"New player? Haven't you seen Mr. Chen's old Dark Souls strategy guide videos? Let's just say he's full of surprises!"</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Nebula Games, Qin Yi and others sitting beside Chen Xu quietly lowered their heads.</p>
<p>Here it comes, here it comes!</p>
<p>Mr. Chen is about to start his talk.</p>
<p>What were the players so passionate about?</p>
<p>Nerf Diablos and Rathalos, buff the Long Sword's Numerical Design.</p>
<p>But now it was clearly entering 'Mr. Chen's Time to Talk'.</p>
<p>Changing the data?</p>
<p>You can dream about that!</p>
