<h2>Chapter 54: Players' Reactions</h2>
<p>For Nebula Games, or rather, Chen Xu's new game,</p>
<p>there were actually quite a number of people still paying attention.</p>
<p>These people weren't just ordinary players, but also included some industry game designers and gaming media.</p>
<p>After all, Chen Xu still carried a label—the first-prize winner of the Sci-Fi Game Competition.</p>
<p>Added to that, <em>To the Moon</em> had genuinely moved countless players.</p>
<p>So, the number of people curious about Chen Xu's new work, <em>Outlast</em>, was far from small.</p>
<p>Especially among player groups that followed horror games closely, <em>Outlast</em> had already begun to generate buzz within their communities.</p>
<p>On a certain horror game enthusiast forum, many players had posted threads discussing <em>Outlast</em>.</p>
<p>"Damn it! Today I found a newly launched horror game that scared the hell out of me! At first I thought it was just another run-of-the-mill, low-tier horror game! But holy crap, it's simply unbelievable—I played for half an hour and was so terrified I couldn't continue!"</p>
<p>"I know, you mean <em>Outlast</em>, right? The one made by the same designer who created <em>To the Moon</em>. This game is damn terrifying. I was pretty dismissive at first when those door jump scares happened, but once I reached the catacomb area, I realized I was terribly wrong!"</p>
<p>"Same, I bought it too. It’s genuinely terrifying, especially when you’re hiding in a closet, praying that fat guy doesn’t find you."</p>
<p>"I think the door jump scares were manageable, since I’m used to them, but that grim combination of night vision mode and pitch-black scenes? I couldn’t handle it at all!"</p>
<p>Many players who had already experienced the game were actively discussing <em>Outlast</em> in these forums.</p>
<p>And their conversations attracted the attention of other players who weren’t previously aware of it.</p>
<p>Although many players followed Chen Xu, the majority of ordinary players remained completely unaware of him or his work.</p>
<p>When it came to <em>To the Moon</em>, quite a few people knew what it was.</p>
<p>Because both <em>To the Moon</em> and <em>Undertale</em> had gained significant recognition among Independent Game player communities.</p>
<p>But when it came to Chen Xu and his new game <em>Outlast</em>, unless someone had specifically followed him, most players were completely in the dark.</p>
<p>This was precisely why top-tier game developers still spent huge sums promoting their AAA titles.</p>
<p>Because most players were very passive in accepting new games—sometimes even after playing exceptional titles, they still had no idea who the game designer or developers were.</p>
<p>In various forum threads discussing <em>Outlast</em>, the topic drew in many players who had never paid attention to Chen Xu before.</p>
<p>"<em>Outlast</em>? That new horror game?"</p>
<p>"Is it really as exaggerated as you guys say? It’s just a horror game after all."</p>
<p>"If you don’t believe it, just try it yourself. It’s available on both the Official Game Platform and the Nebula Games Platform—though Nebula is 5 yuan cheaper."</p>
<p>"OJBK, I’ll go challenge it!"</p>
<p>"I’ll give it a shot too—what a bunch of Cowards you all are!"</p>
<p>"We’ll be waiting for your playthrough impressions!"</p>
<p>"Fine, just wait for our message once we’ve cleared the game! Heh, what’s there to fear from a little horror game?"</p>
<p>Full of confidence at first, but just one or two hours later, the players who had declared they’d challenge the game began returning to the forums.</p>
<p>Compared to their earlier tone of arrogance and dismissal,</p>
<p>this time, just from reading their words, one could sense their current psychological state.</p>
<p>"Holy crap! I nearly died of fright! That lunatic in the wheelchair scared the living hell out of me!"</p>
<p>"I can't take it anymore—I'm feeling dizzy. When I had to turn on the generator in the catacomb, everything went pitch black, my camera battery was dying, and some guy with a spiked plank was chasing me! I completely broke down!"</p>
<p>"Same here! I was so terrified I almost pissed myself—thankfully I held it in at the last second."</p>
<p>"I wonder what kind of trauma the game designer must have gone through to create this!"</p>
<p>"I’m telling you, this is the scariest horror game of the year—no, of recent years!"</p>
<p>"+1! I totally agree!"</p>
<p>"So, since this game is this good, does anyone have any ideas?"</p>
<p>"Like recommending this game to more players? After all, great things should be shared!"</p>
<p>"Great minds think alike! Let’s go post about it on other community forums!"</p>
<p>"Hehe, I already did—go upvote my thread!"</p>
<p>"Damn it! That’s underhanded! You sneaked in early!"</p>
<p>As the first wave of horror game enthusiasts experienced <em>Outlast</em> and got utterly terrified,</p>
<p>many others who had quit halfway through also rushed to game forums and communities,</p>
<p>ready to post threads recommending <em>Outlast</em> to fellow players.</p>
<p>Of course, most of these players weren’t motivated by noble intentions like spreading awareness of an excellent horror game.</p>
<p>Their motives were far simpler: <em>Since I got scared so badly, shouldn’t more players suffer the same fate?</em></p>
<p>Naturally, Chen Xu had also arranged internet trolls in advance to steer the conversation.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it would’ve been difficult to rapidly generate buzz—though this tactic only worked if the game itself had the potential.</p>
<p>And did <em>Outlast</em> have that potential?</p>
<p>The answer was obvious.</p>
<p>Thus, on game forums, community boards, and in player groups, this first wave of players began recommending <em>Outlast</em> to their friends and even strangers.</p>
<p>With such a brilliant game, how could one possibly bear the terror alone?</p>
<p>Other players must also experience the 'love' this game so generously delivers!</p>
<p>On various gaming community sites, some players noticed that, at a certain point, a flood of similar posts suddenly appeared.</p>
<p>Almost all of them revolved around a horror game called <em>Outlast</em>.</p>
<p>"Highly recommend the horror game <em>Outlast</em>. Bought it for my roommate who’s studying for the postgraduate entrance exam. It worked perfectly—he’s now terrified, and I’ve secured my own graduate admission."</p>
<p>"Bought this game for my kid. Now he’s happily playing it in the afterlife!"</p>
<p>"Other games cost money, but this one costs hearts!"</p>
<p>"Bought in the morning, played in the afternoon, died of fright by night."</p>
<p>"If you’re easily scared, don’t buy this horror game—otherwise you’ll definitely regret it!"</p>
<p>"Only those with true courage can dare to play this horror game alone!"</p>
<p>"This year’s best horror game, <em>Outlast</em>—Cowards, stay far away from this one!"</p>
<p>Game forum communities were soon filled with posts like these.</p>
<p>They split into two playstyles: one group played along with memes, luring others into suffering alongside them.</p>
<p>The other group seemed genuinely earnest, describing exactly how terrifying the game truly was.</p>
<p>The meme-driven posts were easy to spot.</p>
<p>But even so, they sparked curiosity in many people.</p>
<p>Could this horror game called <em>Outlast</em> really be that frightening?</p>
<p>Had it really terrified so many people—and inspired so many to spread memes trying to lure others into the nightmare?</p>
