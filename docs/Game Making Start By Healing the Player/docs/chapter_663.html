                <p>Chapter 662: Filled with Doubt (Please subscribe for monthly passes)</p>
<p>Regarding the baptism ceremony, Zhang Yi wasn't entirely clueless.</p>
<p>Generally, there are two types of baptisms: aspersion and immersion. The former involves sprinkling water on the hands and making the sign of the cross on the forehead, while the latter involves full immersion in a pool.</p>
<p>But what the heck kind of baptism ceremony involves holding someone's head underwater?</p>
<p>'Gurgle, gurgle'</p>
<p>The sound of splashing water and rising bubbles filled his vision and ears, leaving Zhang Yi instantly speechless.</p>
<p>What the heck could <em>this</em> be called baptism?</p>
<p>And it wasn't just once; he was submerged three times in a row.</p>
<p>The last time he was plunged into the water, the splashes before Zhang Yi's eyes gradually vanished, and his vision darkened.</p>
<p>“What's going on? Did this baptism drown me? Is it a plot kill, or am I supposed to resist here?”</p>
<p>Looking at the game's perspective, which had plunged into darkness, Zhang Yi was utterly bewildered.</p>
<p>He couldn't quite figure out what was happening.</p>
<p>However, soon enough, the corresponding game scene appeared.</p>
<p>Inside a room, on the table lay a pistol, some bullets, and countless wine bottles and cigarette butts.</p>
<p>‘Bring us the girl, and your debt is cleared.’</p>
<p>‘What do you want to do?’</p>
<p>‘We had a deal, DeWitt! Open the door, now!’</p>
<p>‘I told you… I won't do it!’</p>
<p>The dialogue between Booker and a man reached his ears.</p>
<p>So, this was Booker's past memory?</p>
<p>Booker, burdened by debt, took on this mission to kidnap Elizabeth?</p>
<p>Watching the plot unfold, Zhang Yi was a little confused.</p>
<p>Pushing open the door in the game, he saw a city engulfed in war. But before he could make out more details, his vision went black.</p>
<p>The camera returned to Columbia, the Sky City.</p>
<p>At this point, Zhang Yi was completely baffled.</p>
<p>He even felt more confused than when playing Souls series games.</p>
<p>After all, in Souls series games, even if you don't understand what's happening, you can just slash with your sword and be done with it.</p>
<p>But BioShock Infinite, so far, was still in a narrative phase, and it didn't seem like the kind of game where you just 'bang bang bang' your way through.</p>
<p>However, just from the opening content, Zhang Yi felt it was a bit too complex.</p>
<p>If that was Booker's past memory, then what was the deal with seeing a destroyed city after pushing open the door?</p>
<p>An illusion? Or was it the past, or the future?</p>
<p>Many questions arose in Zhang Yi's mind.</p>
<p>However, this doubt was quickly replaced by everything he saw before him.</p>
<p>Because having undergone the baptism, he could now move freely.</p>
<p>‘Those idiot priests should learn the difference between baptism and drowning someone!’</p>
<p>As Booker woke up and appropriately grumbled in New Eden, Zhang Yi also carefully observed his surroundings.</p>
<p>Unlike before, viewing Columbia, the Sky City, from a cramped flight cabin.</p>
<p>Now, immersed within this city, Zhang Yi could only describe it with two words: dreamlike.</p>
<p>A fantastical world.</p>
<p>Just like a world out of a fairy tale.</p>
<p>The city in the game had a very distinct steampunk aesthetic.</p>
<p>Giant gear mechanisms, where advancement and antiquity coexisted.</p>
<p>There were cars as well as carriages, magic alongside firearms, and prominently, airships representing the steampunk theme.</p>
<p>The opening content didn't immediately throw him into gameplay; it merely allowed players to admire this steampunk-styled city.</p>
<p>Similarly, Zhang Yi wasn't in a hurry to head to the objective on the mini-map to advance the game's main story.</p>
<p>Instead, he spent his time appreciating the scenery of Columbia, the Sky City, along the way.</p>
<p>But soon, Zhang Yi noticed something different: unlike reality.</p>
<p>Though this city boasted technology far surpassing that on the ground.</p>
<p>It was a fanatically religious city, yet what was eerie was that the beings these devotees worshipped in the game weren't deities like Jesus.</p>
<p>Instead, historical figures like 'Franklin,' 'Washington,' and 'Jefferson' were regarded as gods.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, according to some simple books and newspapers, Lincoln, also a leader, had become a demon and apostate.</p>
<p>Eerie, that was Zhang Yi's feeling.</p>
<p>Posters of all kinds adorned the streets and alleys, warning citizens to be wary of the false shepherd's arrival, lest he lead the lambs astray.</p>
<p>The entire game wasn't a completely open world, but there was plenty of content to explore.</p>
<p>For example, within the city, one could experience various interesting mini-games.</p>
<p>Shooting, testing strength, and even enjoying stage plays and movies.</p>
<p>“But is the final BOSS really so straightforward?”</p>
<p>Zhang Yi wandered through Columbia, the Sky City, making guesses.</p>
<p>From the current situation, Zhang Yi felt it was highly probable that Comstock, the one called the Prophet, was the final BOSS.</p>
<p>The entire Sky City was exceptionally prosperous, and currently, the city was celebrating Ascension Day, which was their national day.</p>
<p>Although Booker in the game probably wasn't in the mood for fun, Zhang Yi was having a great time here.</p>
<p>He eventually passed through a large archway, and beneath the reviewing stand with a colossal mentor statue, he was stopped by a newsboy.</p>
<p>‘Sir, your telegram!’</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, controlling Booker, took a card from the newsboy. Turning it over, he saw a message written on it.</p>
<p>【Stop, DeWitt! Don't let Comstock know you're here. Stop, whatever you're doing, don't choose number 77. Stop…】</p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>Just like Booker in the game, Zhang Yi was utterly bewildered.</p>
<p>What was the meaning of this abrupt, nonsensical message?</p>
<p>He repeatedly flipped the card over, finding nothing special about it apart from the message.</p>
<p>But did 'number 77' have some hidden meaning? He stored this information, but soon Zhang Yi was drawn in by the city's various entertainment activities.</p>
<p>The shooting mini-game resembled a circus act, and he also paid a vendor to learn a supernatural ability to control machines.</p>
<p>“So, in this world, magic is just out in the open, and you can learn it just by paying? Alright, that's very capitalist!”</p>
<p>Zhang Yi couldn't help but gasp.</p>
<p>This magic was just like firearms; you could buy it if you had money.</p>
<p>Wandering through the Sky City with a mix of emotion and joy, Zhang Yi completely forgot about the 'find the girl' mission.</p>
<p>Until he participated in a lottery.</p>
<p>After talking to an NPC, he received a numbered ball.</p>
<p>Number 77, that was the number written on it.</p>
<p>The moment he saw the ball, Zhang Yi recalled the content of an anonymous letter a newsboy had given him earlier.</p>
<p>Was there a connection between these two?</p>
<p>Without waiting for Zhang Yi to figure it out, the lottery ceremony began.</p>
<p>And, coincidentally, the winning number was 77.</p>
<p>However, the prize for the winner was quite astonishing.</p>
<p>Because the so-called lottery wasn't about winning a good prize, but a choice.</p>
<p>On stage appeared a black and white couple, newly married.</p>
<p>They had committed a crime: the crime of interracial marriage.</p>
<p>The lottery was for the person who picked the winning number to choose: one lives, one dies.</p>
<p>The winning number was the 77 ball that Booker had drawn.</p>
<p>Here, players could make two choices: throw the ball at the host's head, or make the selection.</p>
<p>But no matter the choice, there was only one outcome.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, without hesitation, chose to throw the ball. But just as he raised his hand.</p>
<p>The guards seized his arm.</p>
<p>Because they saw the letters 'AD' on Booker's hand, which was the information the Prophet spoke of regarding the false shepherd.</p>
<p>The subsequent plot development utterly astounded Zhang Yi.</p>
