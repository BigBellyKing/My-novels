<p>Chapter 473: Players Scared Shitless (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Exiting the game and stepping out of the gaming pod, Song Ren let out a long breath, then turned on all the lights in his bedroom.</p>
<p>Song Ren had always considered himself a tough guy.</p>
<p>But he had to admit, today he'd been defeated once again—by the game <em>Resident Evil</em>.</p>
<p>Even with Awakening Mode enabled, the game had sent his heart racing, chilled his limbs, and drenched him in cold sweat.</p>
<p>If he had to compare, he actually thought the earlier <em>Silent Hill PT</em> might have been even scarier.</p>
<p>Because truthfully, he could sense that <em>Resident Evil</em> had held back in quite a few places.</p>
<p>But knowing that didn’t help—where it mattered, he was still terrified.</p>
<p>Especially with Huanyu VR’s immersive experience and near-photorealistic visual presentation, Song Ren could only admit he was genuinely overwhelmed.</p>
<p>And in just those half an hour, the game had touched on nearly every element a horror game could offer.</p>
<p>Jump scares that made you leap from your seat, psychological suggestion fear that built Atmosphere, and visual terror that inflicted real emotional damage.</p>
<p>You never knew which method the game would use to frighten you next.</p>
<p>The Sense of Oppression was simply too intense.</p>
<p>Leaning back in his chair to relax a bit, Song Ren re-entered the gaming pod and opened the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>He purchased four copies of <em>Resident Evil</em>, then opened his Friends list and sent them as gifts to Zhang Yi, Wang Han, Joey, and Wang Yifan.</p>
<p>Such a fantastic game shouldn’t be enjoyed alone.</p>
<p>After sending the gifts, Song Ren chuckled to himself and launched <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, ready to go all-in push and shoot his way through a few rounds to ease his lingering fear and calm his nerves.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Players like Song Ren, who waited specifically until midnight to buy <em>Resident Evil</em>, were far from alone.</p>
<p>After all, with only thirty thousand slots available and such generous rewards, many confident players had waited until the game unlocked at midnight, eager to dive in and take on the challenge.</p>
<p>But none of them expected—damn it—that <em>Resident Evil</em> was actually a full-blown horror game, perfectly fitting the Halloween theme.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t just any horror game. The relentless pressure from the moment you entered the game had already left many timid players literally scared shitless.</p>
<p>Soon, the Nebula Games community was flooded with discussions about <em>Resident Evil</em>.</p>
<p>"Holy shit, no wonder the benefit was so good—it's totally themed for the holiday!"</p>
<p>"It's actually a horror game? I’ve been totally screwed by a P! Extreme warning—do NOT play this!"</p>
<p>"Back in the day, I stood frozen before Mount Massive Asylum and walked away. But now, damn it, Ethan actually walks into that room willingly!"</p>
<p>"2333333, this setting is pure Mr. Chen’s malice. I hesitated at the door for ages, then watched my character walk in—simply unbelievable, I nearly pissed my pants!"</p>
<p>"Damn, this game reminded me of Chen Xu’s <em>Outlast</em> and <em>Silent Hill PT</em>!"</p>
<p>"What’s worse is how insane the graphics are—and it’s VR! The sense of immersion is simply unbelievable!"</p>
<p>"Chen Xu isn’t just after our money—he wants our lives too!"</p>
<p>Every player who had entered <em>Resident Evil</em> and experienced even a little of it couldn’t stop grumbling inwardly about the game.</p>
<p>At first, everyone thought they’d struck gold—this Nebula Games benefit seemed so easy to claim.</p>
<p>But they never expected Chen Xu was lying in wait for them like this.</p>
<p>This isn’t a benefit at all!</p>
<p>The moment you step into the house, you’re greeted by grotesque food Modeling, followed by a slightly high-intensity horror Replay system.</p>
<p>Then, in the sink, nearly eighty percent of players were startled by the floating corpse.</p>
<p>Later, the game combined <em>Outlast</em>’s jump scares with <em>Silent Hill PT</em>’s environmental Atmosphere and psychological suggestion, pushing the fear factor to the maximum.</p>
<p>Finally, after enduring so much hardship to meet Mia, players were brutally beaten in a domestic assault.</p>
<p>Countless players issued divorce declarations, saying they couldn’t live like this anymore.</p>
<p>Discussions about <em>Resident Evil</em> quickly became the day’s hot topic.</p>
<p>Many players who hadn’t stayed up late woke up early, preparing to join the event and clear their Nebula Games Platform shopping cart. But as they habitually opened the game platform, community, or chat groups, they found everyone was talking about one game—<em>Resident Evil</em>.</p>
<p>The message was consistent: they’d all been scared shitless.</p>
<p>This piqued the curiosity of many others.</p>
<p>A Halloween horror game?</p>
<p>Alright, that fits the theme.</p>
<p>But could it really be that terrifying?</p>
<p>A small seed of curiosity sprouted in many players’ minds.</p>
<p>After all, with horror games, if you don’t play them yourself, hearing about them from others always feels like something’s missing.</p>
<p>In <em>Resident Evil</em>, although Mia in her deranged state was terrifying in-game,</p>
<p>if you just looked at screenshots, she didn’t seem that bad.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly: she’s someone you could charge at fearlessly.</p>
<p>Like the <em>Fatal Frame</em> series from his previous life—many players had said, "How scary could this game be? There are so many Moe Girls—bring it on, I’ll charge and break through!"</p>
<p>But once they entered the game, forget charging—they pissed their pants.</p>
<p>Still, the bold claims of players saying "that’s it?" did encourage others.</p>
<p>After all, the more people talked about it, the more those who weren’t especially timid started thinking, "Maybe I can try it—maybe I’m brave enough to not be scared?"</p>
<p>Plus, just like getting tormented in Souls-like games or scared in horror games,</p>
<p>there were always some players who, after suffering, wanted to drag others into the same Abyss.</p>
<p>The less sophisticated ones would say things like, "This game isn’t scary at all—I’ve already charged and broken through Mia!"</p>
<p>But the more refined players were different—they’d analyze the game’s unique features.</p>
<p>For example, they’d tell others the game was a bit scary, but mostly due to its environment and Atmosphere.</p>
<p>As for the high-intensity scenes and the Sense of Oppression when hunted down?</p>
<p>Just because I’m not mentioning them doesn’t mean they don’t exist!</p>
<p>This information gap slowly lured many naive and clueless players into taking steps toward the bottomless Abyss.</p>
<p>Of course, there were still some strong-willed players who firmly declared they’d never try <em>Resident Evil</em>.</p>
<p>But there were also players with mischievous friends. Waking up in the morning without knowing what <em>Resident Evil</em> was all about, they’d log into the game platform and find a gift waiting for them.</p>
<p>Damn it, this isn’t a gift!</p>
<p>This is a time bomb!!?</p>
