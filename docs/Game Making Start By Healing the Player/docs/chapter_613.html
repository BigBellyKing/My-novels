                <p>Chapter 612: I'm Waiting for the Game to Launch, What Are You Waiting For? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Seeing that less than twenty minutes had passed, Song Ren was utterly speechless.</p>
<p>Why did he ever think Nebula Games had turned over a new leaf?</p>
<p>This was even worse than making grand promises!</p>
<p>Making grand promises was like letting you look and sniff, but now it was different.</p>
<p>This was letting you take a bite; the level of temptation was completely different from before!</p>
<p>Song Ren wasn't the only one; keywords like 'making grand promises' and 'Cliffhanger-Dog' quickly became trending search terms online.</p>
<p>On one hand, Detroit: Become Human could be said to be the first game to utilize the latest technology. Although the game was a demo version, and the content only consisted of simple options and actions like walking, crouching, and picking up items.</p>
<p>It truly brought players a unique experience.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the game's setting itself definitely piqued players' curiosity.</p>
<p>Especially the android Connor, who was at the forefront, his cold and ruthless demeanor inadvertently gained a large following among many players.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the content was incredibly rich. What seemed like merely a prologue scenario turned out to contain a great deal more as players explored it online.</p>
<p>Some endings even required players to investigate certain objects to trigger them.</p>
<p>For example, the option to use a firearm: if players didn't investigate the still-uncollected police officer's body on the scene, they naturally wouldn't notice the pistol hidden under the chair, and thus wouldn't be able to choose the handgun-related endings.</p>
<p>As for the other endings, each had its own unique characteristics.</p>
<p>There was an ending where a perfect negotiation led Daniel to release the hostage voluntarily, only for snipers to gun him down.</p>
<p>Another ending saw Connor sacrifice himself, rushing forward and falling with the other party, but saving the little girl.</p>
<p>There was also an ending where he rushed forward but failed to stop the android.</p>
<p>Of course, besides these, there were also endings where negotiations failed, leading to the hostage's death.</p>
<p>Online players enthusiastically shared the different endings they discovered.</p>
<p>“This demo version has so many branching paths!”</p>
<p>“Exactly! And Connor is just too cool!”</p>
<p>“+1, that emotionless negotiation expert is explosively cool!”</p>
<p>“The game's graphics are also mind-blowing; I can barely tell if it's reality or the game anymore.”</p>
<p>“Yep, the details are insane; so many things are interactive.”</p>
<p>“The only problem is, when the heck is it going to launch? 'Stay Tuned for the Official Version' – but where’s the news about the official version?”</p>
<p>“I want to complain too! I used to think Mr. Chen was force-feeding us grand promises, but now it seems I was too naive!”</p>
<p>Not only players but other game developers also took notice of Detroit: Become Human's content.</p>
<p>Immediately, many game developers were frustrated.</p>
<p>Miscalculation!</p>
<p>When it came to marketing, they still couldn't beat Nebula Games!</p>
<p>What a great selling point!</p>
<p>If they couldn't make the full game, wouldn't it be good to rush out a simple Test DEMO?</p>
<p>The first game in the gaming industry to use brainwave capture technology – what a huge selling point!</p>
<p>A week after Detroit: Become Human's demo version quietly launched, major game developers also successively released preview versions of their new projects.</p>
<p>The game length content generally remained uniformly around 10 minutes.</p>
<p>And each company was quite tacit, explicitly stating that the demo version did not represent the final product.</p>
<p>As for the players, they were all speechless.</p>
<p>“What the heck is this? Chen Xu and Nebula Games have corrupted everyone! What are all these early access versions? They just made an intro and tossed it out?”</p>
<p>“I’m going to throw up! This cake tasting session is utterly insane!”</p>
<p>“Will it ever get better?!”</p>
<p>“But actually, there are a few quite interesting ones.”</p>
<p>“Interesting is interesting, but they’re treating us like fools!”</p>
<p>Initially, with only Detroit: Become Human, players, despite their complaints, were actually quite excited.</p>
<p>Relevant forum communities continuously followed updates and constantly @-mentioned Chen Xu, hoping he would step forward to offer some explanation.</p>
<p>But soon, the trend started to go awry. Various companies successively launched their so-called demo versions, which quickly turned players' anticipation into a degree of annoyance.</p>
<p>Seeing the shift in player sentiment online, various game developers were also depressed.</p>
<p>However, there was still a slight sense of relief.</p>
<p>At least they weren't the only ones being cursed; Nebula Games, being the first, was getting the worst of it.</p>
<p>However, the very next day after this thought appeared in the minds of the major game developers, news that bewildered everyone emerged.</p>
<p>Nebula Games and Chen Xu's official Weibo account once again released an announcement.</p>
<p>Detroit: Become Human's official version will launch in three days. Players can purchase and download it on the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>Official version?</p>
<p>The game is finished?</p>
<p>Not just a selling point?</p>
<p>Innumerable game designers and developers were dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Players were also filled with both surprise and joy.</p>
<p>They were cursing the day before, and the next day Nebula Games directly announced the game was complete?</p>
<p>Under this trend, players' fire instantly shifted to other game developers, though many also expressed anticipation.</p>
<p>Nebula Games had finished; could they expect the same from these other game developers?</p>
<p>The game developers who had released demo versions, looking at their eager fans, were dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Chen Xu, who had just finished posting the launch announcement on Nebula Games' official Weibo, couldn't help but find the online buzz amusing.</p>
<p>He was waiting for Detroit: Become Human's development to conclude and launch. What were these game developers waiting for?</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Three days later, Detroit: Become Human officially launched.</p>
<p>Players who had previously played the demo version generally entered the game immediately.</p>
<p>Song Ren was no exception. He didn't even have time to brag to Old Zhang before choosing to enter the game.</p>
<p>These days, his mind was filled with the handsome Connor.</p>
<p>For the first prologue featuring Connor, Song Ren was already well-versed in the story.</p>
<p>He clearly understood what outcomes each option and branch would lead to.</p>
<p>So, he directly chose to skip it. The game could also load progress from the previous demo version.</p>
<p>Accompanying the perspective as it plunged into a brief darkness.</p>
<p>After about three or four seconds, a cacophony of sounds reached Song Ren's ears, gradually becoming clearer.</p>
<p>At the same time, screen colors gradually appeared. However, he couldn't control the character or even shift the camera, and it was a forced first-person view.</p>
<p>He seemed to be in an android specialty store.</p>
<p>Lines of English code he couldn't understand scrolled across his vision. Finally, a staff member dressed as a store clerk, leading a burly man with a fleshy face, came before him.</p>
<p>They provided the corresponding introductions, discussing topics like repairs, fees, and models.</p>
<p>‘AX400, log your name.’</p>
<p>‘Kara’</p>
<p>It wasn't until he got into the middle-aged man's car and drove away that Song Ren regained his senses.</p>
<p>Was this game a multiple protagonists game?</p>
<p>Wasn't he supposed to be playing the handsome young man, Connor? How did he become Kara, a female android who had been in a car accident and sent back for repairs?</p>
<p>Sitting in the car, a bewildered Song Ren still couldn't move freely, but he could control the camera.</p>
<p>He looked out the window, and soon his confusion about the character was temporarily replaced by the scenes outside.
