<h2>Chapter 44: Outlast</h2>
<p>Shortly after the interview.</p>
<p>Less than twenty minutes had passed since Chen Xu left the Game Department, not even making it back to Nebula Games yet.</p>
<p>Reports from major media outlets were already being published.</p>
<p>*"Revealed: Nebula Games' Next Title Might Be..."</p>
<p>Chen Xu: "I Think I'm Probably a Warrior of Love"</p>
<p>No New Game Planned, But Chen Xu Hints Starfall's Next Project Could Be a Heartwarming Love Story!</p>
<p>A Rising Star in the Independent Game Industry: The Warrior of Love—Chen Xu!*</p>
<p>The hype from <em>Sci-Fi Odyssey</em> hadn't completely faded, and <em>To the Moon</em> was still featured on the official platform's recommendation slots.</p>
<p>These media interviews also introduced Chen Xu to a wider player base.</p>
<p>His official Weibo account had already reached 800,000 followers.</p>
<p>Given the current momentum, surpassing one million was merely a matter of time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the official Weibo account's verified VIP profile now listed <em>To the Moon</em> as a representative work, along with a new tag: 'Warrior of Love'.</p>
<p>Underneath the related interview articles, players discussed animatedly.</p>
<p>"Warrior of Love? What the heck is that!?"</p>
<p>"Now that you mention it, Chen Xu really does seem like a Warrior of Love. Don't even get me started on <em>Mirror (Game)</em>—every character has pure love subplots, though those corrupted endings are kinda... weird."</p>
<p>"And the Pacifist Ending in <em>Undertale</em> is overflowing with love. Not to mention his latest work, <em>To the Moon</em>—the entire game revolves around love."</p>
<p>"Now that you put it that way, it actually makes sense!"</p>
<p>"But I'm more curious—what will Chen Xu's next game be?"</p>
<p>"Probably something super heartwarming, right?"</p>
<p>"Exactly. He's the Warrior of Love after all."</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu himself wasn't paying much attention to the online chatter.</p>
<p>At this moment, having just returned to the Nebula Games office, he was alone in his office, performing a gacha pull.</p>
<p>Golden lights bloomed one after another before his eyes.</p>
<p>The Special Effects looked quite impressive.</p>
<p>It was just that the experience felt way too real.</p>
<p>Fifty-pulls.</p>
<p>Among them: 37 common skill books, covering Story, Music, and Level Design comprehensively.</p>
<p>4 Rare Skill Books—one in Architecture, one in Psychology, and two in Music.</p>
<p>The remaining nine were all Memory Capsules.</p>
<p>"One more pull. Might as well use it now." Seeing he had just enough points for a final pull, Chen Xu didn't hesitate and used them immediately.</p>
<p>As golden light flashed again, to Chen Xu's surprise, something actually dropped!</p>
<p>Not a Rare Skill Book, but a special item similar to a Memory Capsule.</p>
<p>"Single pull summons a miracle? Is this superstitious belief actually real? But what is this thing?" Chen Xu fell silent for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>[Fear Converter] (120 days)</strong></p>
<p>Effect: Converts player Fear Value into ten times the points (cap: 6 million)</p>
<p>Clearly, this was a time-limited item—a Double XP Card with a cap, but one that only worked on player fear.</p>
<p>It was unclear whether the cap applied before or after conversion.</p>
<p>But Chen Xu guessed it was most likely after the conversion.</p>
<p>"And unlike Memory Capsules, this item has a time limit. Is this a hint that I should make a horror game next?" Chen Xu felt a bit speechless.</p>
<p>As for what his next game should be, Chen Xu had actually been pondering it.</p>
<p>First of all, it wouldn't be another small-scale project like before. This time, he wanted to move toward 3D games.</p>
<p>But at the same time, the Game Scale couldn't be too large.</p>
<p>Even though game development in this Parallel World was much simpler than in his previous life,</p>
<p>it still required technical accumulation.</p>
<p>It was like building blocks—everyone had access to the same parts, but the final structure depended entirely on individual skill.</p>
<p>Games were the same, especially those involving FPS and ACT genres.</p>
<p>Take action games, for example. The most important aspect was the sense of impact.</p>
<p>How do you create that sense of impact?</p>
<p>Sound effects, Controller Feedback, Special Effects, UI Interface Vibration, and various forms of Physical Collision Detection.</p>
<p>And even more crucial: screen freeze frames.</p>
<p>The same applied to FPS games.</p>
<p>So for his next project, Chen Xu didn't plan to make anything overly complex.</p>
<p>"Thinking this way, a horror game might not be a bad idea. I could incorporate some Action Elements, but for a horror game, those wouldn't be the core focus." Chen Xu stroked his chin, thinking.</p>
<p>Though he had an idea now, Chen Xu didn't jump into action immediately. Instead, he first researched the current state of horror games in the Parallel World.</p>
<p>In short, it wasn't much different from his previous life.</p>
<p>Whether in the Film and Television Industry or the Gaming Industry, horror games rarely received large-budget productions.</p>
<p>Most were low-cost projects aiming for high returns.</p>
<p>However, compared to his previous life, the market share for pure horror games was significantly larger.</p>
<p>Some single titles had even reached nearly ten million in sales.</p>
<p>Of course, these were mostly older titles, often sold at cabbage-level prices during holidays, and had been on the market for many years.</p>
<p>As for horror games better suited for the VR platform, there were literally none.</p>
<p>After all, VR game development costs were enormous.</p>
<p>And horror games themselves were a niche category.</p>
<p>Unless someone had a special passion for Horror Culture, no one would dare develop a horror game for the VR platform.</p>
<p>The risks were simply too great.</p>
<p>As for PC platform horror games, they generally fell into two categories: low-budget productions,</p>
<p>like the models used in <em>Undertale</em> and <em>To the Moon</em>.</p>
<p>The other type was medium-to-small scale games.</p>
<p>After getting a general understanding of the horror game market and its development in the Parallel World,</p>
<p>Chen Xu quickly made his decision.</p>
<p>He would go with the medium-to-small scale model. The revenue from <em>Mirror (Game)</em>, <em>Undertale</em>, and <em>To the Moon</em> meant Nebula Games now had sufficient capital.</p>
<p>Besides, although the horror game market was niche, that was only in comparison to traditional genres like FPS and RPG.</p>
<p>If done well and able to generate popularity, horror games could still be major hits.</p>
<p>Next came the question of which specific game to make.</p>
<p>For horror games, Chen Xu had several directions he could choose from.</p>
<p>After careful consideration, he decided to go with <em>Outlast</em> for his next project.</p>
<p>Mainly because it was a good fit.</p>
<p>In terms of Game Scale, <em>Outlast</em> had a Game Length of about five hours. Speedrunning it could finish the game in under an hour.</p>
<p>Second, compared to horror titles like <em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>Silent Hill</em>, and <em>The Evil Within</em>, <em>Outlast</em> had a clever advantage.</p>
<p>In this game, the player takes on the role of a reporter who can only run away and cannot fight back.</p>
<p>For Chen Xu, <em>Outlast</em> was essentially a project to facilitate Team Integration and allow him to test the game engine more deeply.</p>
<p>Combat and shooting mechanics could be implemented through the monsters, while the protagonist would only require basic movement actions like running and climbing.</p>
<p>In every aspect, <em>Outlast</em> aligned well with Chen Xu's psychological expectations.</p>
<p>The only potential issue was Censorship.</p>
<p>Unlike Eastern Horror games such as <em>Silent Hill</em> and <em>Fatal Frame</em>, <em>Outlast</em> was pure Western Horror, meaning it featured graphic and bloody content.</p>
<p>Although the Parallel World's Review System was well-established, whether it would pass depended ultimately on the Game Department's approval.</p>
