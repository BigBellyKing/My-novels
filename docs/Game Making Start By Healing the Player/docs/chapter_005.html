                <h2>Chapter 5: I Can't Believe You're Making This Kind of Game!</h2>
<p>Mirror (Game) could be described as a very unique small-scale game.</p>
<p>Match-3 game and RPG elements, combined with Galgame gameplay featuring different endings.</p>
<p>This made the overall gameplay quite substantial.</p>
<p>As for the Match-3 gameplay, it's essentially an extension of Tile-matching game, and this world already has such gameplay. Furthermore, it's quite popular, so Chen Xu wasn't worried about whether this Match-3 style gameplay would be accepted by players.</p>
<p>Secondly, Mirror (Game)'s selling point isn't just the Match-3 game.</p>
<p>The rest are the story and CG Illustration.</p>
<p>But Chen Xu wasn't worried about this aspect because, from his memories, Ruan Ningxue had the talent for it. Including Chen Xu himself, he also possessed this talent.</p>
<p>After simply completing a GDD-related setup,</p>
<p>Match-3 gameplay, different upgrade paths.</p>
<p>After finishing, Chen Xu began writing the story.</p>
<p>The first story featured a Drow Elf Rogue who went to steal from a lord's treasury to help the poor, but unexpectedly, the lord's hidden identity was that of a demon, and she fell into his hands. The subsequent development offered players two choices: Pure Love Warrior or Netorare Warrior.</p>
<p>The second story involved a Female General who time-traveled from ancient times to the modern era, encountering an Otaku in modern society. Due to her time travel, the Female General became defenseless. The subsequent development had two different endings: the Pure Love Warrior route naturally led to a beautiful ending, while the other was a somewhat dark but ultimately moving ending. In modern society, the Otaku commits evil acts against the Female General, and then both time-travel back to ancient times. After a period of getting to know each other, the war is on the verge of being lost, and the Otaku, despite being able to return to modern times, chooses to face death alongside her.</p>
<p>Later, there were also stories about a Zombie of cyclical fate, and a Dragon Knight.</p>
<p>Of course, for the initial phase, Chen Xu planned to produce these four stories.</p>
<p>The main reason was that his savings weren't enough. After all, the Match-3 style gameplay, the subsequent Voice Actor costs, and BGM copyright purchases also required a sum of money.</p>
<p>As for where the money would come from, it wasn't a big problem. His savings of over ten thousand Yuan were clearly insufficient, but a Jiebei loan from Zhibafu, a Jiejie loan from Jingdog, and credit cards could completely cover it.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>The next morning, in Chen Xu’s apartment.</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue, carrying her Graphics tablet and laptop, sat beside Chen Xu, looking at his hand-drawn story outline and Storyboard with a strange expression.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe Chen Xu, you’re making this kind of game!”</p>
<p>“Indeed, indeed, being a Cartoonist and a Game Designer isn't your true talent. Come and Draw doujinshi with me!”</p>
<p>“With your talent and mine, I believe we can definitely make it. Starting as a doujinshi artist, accumulating fans, and becoming a famous Cartoonist – many well-known masters have followed this path of development.”</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue looked at the document Chen Xu had rushed to produce overnight and began to explain her strategic detour plan.</p>
<p>What a waste!</p>
<p>How could such talent be used to make games?</p>
<p>She knew her biggest weakness was insufficient storytelling ability. That's why she decided to create Doujinshi to support herself while gradually honing her skills. But now, looking at Chen Xu's short stories, they were simply excellent.</p>
<p>Pure love, Netorare, reincarnation – all kinds of elements were present.</p>
<p>Listening to Ruan Ningxue’s exclamations, Chen Xu’s mouth twitched.</p>
<p>“Thank you for the compliment, but I'll pass,” Chen Xu said tactfully.</p>
<p>“Alright, Senior Sister, you can proceed with the Illustration creation in order. However, unlike comic format, everything needs to be colored and more refined.”</p>
<p>“Of course, for the story plot part, it doesn't need to be displayed through images; the plot is mainly revealed through dialogue.”</p>
<p>Chen Xu said to Ruan Ningxue.</p>
<p>“I understand, make the drawings more refined, and mainly showcase the female character’s charm, like each illustration is the homepage of a Doujinshi. I’m very professional in this aspect, rest assured!” Ruan Ningxue said energetically.</p>
<p>“Hmm, that understanding is fine,” Chen Xu nodded, then took a deep breath: “If there are no problems, then let’s start work today!”</p>
<p>Upon hearing Chen Xu’s words, Ruan Ningxue smiled slightly and gave a thumbs-up, then opened the relevant software.</p>
<p>The development of Mirror (Game) was smoother than Chen Xu had expected.</p>
<p>Other less critical art resources were mostly outsourced.</p>
<p>Among them, the Dark Elf, Dragon Girl, Female General, and Zombie Moe Girl were the four provisional starting characters.</p>
<p>As for the Soundtrack, Chen Xu could make it himself.</p>
<p>However, it would be time-consuming and labor-intensive, and he didn't have that much money. Instead, purchasing a license directly was simpler and more straightforward. The only thing left was Voice acting.</p>
<p>The Soundtrack BGM could be managed, but the Character portraits and Voice acting were two points that could not be skimped on.</p>
<p>These two points were the two most crucial core aspects of Mirror (Game).</p>
<p>“Hmm, perfect! But it still needs some adjustments.”</p>
<p>Looking at the Illustration Ruan Ningxue had just finished coloring, Chen Xu's eyes couldn't help but show a hint of amazement.</p>
<p>In his previous life, he wasn't an unknown figure in the Gaming Industry. He had met and interacted with some industry veterans at various summits.</p>
<p>He naturally had some knowledge of Art, and in his previous life, he deeply understood the designs of some of the top Concept Art Production masters in the industry, such as Yang Qi, who produced Asura Online, Shigenori Soejima from the Persona series, and Tetsuya Nomura, who did the art concept design for Tifa in Final Fantasy VII.</p>
<p>These industry-renowned individuals, Chen Xu had deeply studied their designs in his previous life. But in terms of character, Ruan Ningxue truly gave Chen Xu a stunning feeling; her talent was not to be underestimated!</p>
<p>Of course, it wasn't without flaws, as the Art presentation in games is different from comics.</p>
<p>Even as illustrations in a Bishōjo game, they were different from comics.</p>
<p>“Is that so! It’s really different from drawing Doujinshi.” Ruan Ningxue said thoughtfully, listening to Chen Xu.</p>
<p>“Yes, even in a Visual novel game, the illustrations and comics are completely different,” Chen Xu gently nodded, saying to Ruan Ningxue.</p>
<p>Inside the rental apartment, Chen Xu and Ruan Ningxue discussed some key points. Currently, the game as a whole was basically nearing completion.</p>
<p>The remaining task was the Voice Actor aspect.</p>
<p>For this type of Bishōjo game, Voice acting could be said to be one of the more important parts.</p>
<p>The proportion of funding for this part accounted for one of the highest portions of the entire game.</p>
<p>Of course, Chen Xu also did not plan for full Voice acting; that would exceed the budget. Voice acting for some more important lines would be sufficient. As for the male protagonists in each story? Would they be voiced? Of course not!</p>
<p>If you are reading this and saving the book, please cast your recommendation votes daily; it's very important. Meow (&gt;^ω^&lt;)</p>
