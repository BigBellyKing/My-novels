<p>Chapter 582: Never to Return? Then Never to Return! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>Inside the underground laboratory, aside from Miranda's various experiments and records, one person was imprisoned.</p>
<p>That person was the missing: Mia.</p>
<p>According to the dialogue, after being kidnapped by Miranda, she had been locked here and subjected to experiments.</p>
<p>After all, Rose was born from her and Ethan. Miranda didn't kill Ethan earlier to collect information, and the same applied to Mia.</p>
<p>'You promised! You said you'd keep us safe! We followed every word you said. Moving here, doing everything!'</p>
<p>'As long as our family could stay together, I didn’t care about anything else! Now tell me, where is my husband? Where is my child?'</p>
<p>Mia stared intensely at Chris as she shouted.</p>
<p>'Ethan... he's gone.' Chris lowered his head, filled with guilt. 'I couldn't save him, but I can still save Rose.'</p>
<p>'Gone? What do you mean?'</p>
<p>'He's dead. I'm sorry, Mia, but we need to leave quickly. We must destroy this village.' Chris avoided looking at Mia's face.</p>
<p>But Mia simply shook her head. 'No! You're wrong... I wanted to keep it a secret, but... you don't understand how special Ethan truly is.'</p>
<p>Ethan? Special!?</p>
<p>Hearing Mia's words, Song Ren, playing the game, froze for a moment. Then, instantly, the camera switched to Ethan's perspective.</p>
<p>Ethan, who should have been long dead, slowly opened his eyes. He found himself in an icy and snowy wilderness.</p>
<p>Bone-chilling cold seeped into his body, making him trembling.</p>
<p>'What... what happened?' Awakening, Ethan stared at his hands in shock.</p>
<p>Because his left hand, which should have had two thumbs severed, had completely regenerated.</p>
<p>Just then, a faint laughter echoed from the mist.</p>
<p>Ethan, stiff and frozen, struggled to his feet and staggered forward.</p>
<p>'Is anyone there?'</p>
<p>Endless snow blanketed the ground. Nearby, a freezing river flowed. Trudging along it, Ethan rubbed his hands together, shivering uncontrollably.</p>
<p>'Where... is this? So cold... huff... too cold...'</p>
<p>The piercing cold nearly paralyzed Ethan, his entire body frozen stiff.</p>
<p>'Damn it... my body...'</p>
<p>He stumbled, collapsing to his knees, breathing heavily.</p>
<p>'You really are... stupid.' A little girl's voice whispered faintly in his ear.</p>
<p>The familiar voice jolted Ethan's memory. He snapped his head up in shock, staring at the sight before him.</p>
<p>'Evelyn! How are you here?'</p>
<p>From the mist stepped a little girl—Evelyn, the final boss from the previous game.</p>
<p>'You're already dead,' Evelyn said coldly.</p>
<p>'Dead? You mean... Miranda... was it her?' Ethan couldn’t believe it. He remembered clearly—Miranda had ripped out his heart.</p>
<p>Yet even so, one thought burned within him. He struggled to rise.</p>
<p>'No... I still have to save... Rose.'</p>
<p>But the next moment, Evelyn’s words froze both Ethan and Song Ren in the game.</p>
<p>'Wrong! It wasn’t Miranda. You... were already dead.'</p>
<p>What did she mean? Ethan was already dead? Not killed by Miranda?</p>
<p>Song Ren looked bewildered, completely unable to grasp Evelyn’s meaning.</p>
<p>Ethan, too, was filled with confusion. 'What are you talking about? I’m still alive...'</p>
<p>'Don’t you find it strange? No matter how badly you’re injured, you never fear it. Remember... ' Evelyn asked a question that puzzled both Ethan and every player.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Why was Ethan never afraid of getting hurt?</p>
<p>As Evelyn spoke, memories flashed through Ethan’s mind.</p>
<p>Arriving in Louisiana, entering the Jack Baker farm. Meeting a crazed Mia. Encountering Jack Baker and knocking him down with a single punch.</p>
<p>At the same time, Evelyn’s voice rang out.</p>
<p>'Three years ago, at the Baker house, you were already killed. You died there—three years ago.'</p>
<p>Song Ren, playing the game, was completely bewildered.</p>
<p>What was going on?</p>
<p>Ethan had already died?</p>
<p>Then how was Rose born? And wasn’t Ethan right here, alive and well?</p>
<p>What in the world was happening?</p>
<p>Ethan seemed to realize something, yet still refused to believe it.</p>
<p>'That... that can’t be... no...'</p>
<p>'Get out of my head... stop lying.'</p>
<p>'Then... what am I?'</p>
<p>'Me... everything I’ve done... Rose... Mia... I...'</p>
<p>Slowly, Ethan pulled himself up from the ground—only to freeze in horror as he saw his hands turning black.</p>
<p>Just like the Fungal Beasts he had encountered at the Jack Baker farm.</p>
<p>'Now you understand? From head to toe, you’re nothing but mold! You’ll never see your family again,' Evelyn said.</p>
<p>'Family? Family?'</p>
<p>'No... Rose... I... still... need... to save... my... child.'</p>
<p>One memory after another flooded Ethan’s mind.</p>
<p>Escaping the Louisiana farm.</p>
<p>Relocating with Chris’s help, undergoing military training.</p>
<p>Having a child, Rose, with Mia.</p>
<p>Sharing a warm dinner at home, telling bedtime stories to lull Rose to sleep.</p>
<p>None of this was illusion—it had all truly happened.</p>
<p>Now Ethan finally understood why Mia had always seemed hesitant around him.</p>
<p>Mia had known all along.</p>
<p>Yet she had stayed by his side. She was still his wife.</p>
<p>And Rose was still his daughter.</p>
<p>Even if he had already died.
Even if he was merely a sentient Fungal Beast made of mold.</p>
<p>He was still a husband. A father.</p>
<p>'You’re dead... dead...!' Evelyn’s mocking voice echoed in Ethan’s ears.</p>
<p>'I... will... save... Rose!' Ethan rose to his feet through sheer willpower, each word spoken with every ounce of strength he had.</p>
<p>At that moment, dark mists in the distance were dispelled by blinding sunlight.</p>
<p>When Ethan awoke again, he was inside a moving Mario Kart.</p>
<p>'You’re finally awake,' a familiar voice said.</p>
<p>Duke, the mysterious fat merchant—apparently, he had saved Ethan.</p>
<p>'Ethan, you had a nightmare. Your battle with Heisenberg was intense, but who could have expected Miranda to appear...' Duke said.</p>
<p>'How long was I unconscious?' Ethan asked.</p>
<p>'Until just before dawn,' Duke replied.</p>
<p>Ethan took a deep breath, staring at Duke driving the cart. 'Duke, I need a favor. Please... take me to Miranda.'</p>
<p>Hearing Ethan’s request, Duke smiled. 'Knew you’d say that. We’re already on the way. We’ll be there soon.'</p>
<p>'Thank you.'</p>
<p>'But Ethan, are you sure you want to go? Your body is... well, breaking down.' Duke didn’t finish the sentence.</p>
<p>But at this moment, Song Ren, the player, already understood Duke’s meaning.</p>
<p>Just like in <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, when Arthur Morgan stepped out of the clinic.</p>
<p>Even if the game wasn’t over yet, the ending had already been revealed to the player.</p>
<p>'Yes.' Ethan looked down at his hands, utterly determined.</p>
<p>'We’ve arrived. So, Ethan, you likely won’t be able to return to your old world ever again... Are you ready?'</p>
<p>'Yes, I must go.' Ethan stepped down from the Mario Kart.</p>
<p>'This is your final chance, Ethan.' Duke smiled kindly, opening the door to his Shop (in-game).</p>
<p>Sell everything that can be sold. Max out all weapons and gear.</p>
<p>Ethan limped forward toward the Altar of Storms.</p>
<p>Never to return? Then never return!</p>
