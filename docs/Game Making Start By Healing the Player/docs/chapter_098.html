                <p>Chapter 98: Self-Promotion?</p>
<p>As time progressed day by day, the development progress of <em>Dark Souls</em> was going extremely smoothly.</p>
<p>With a large number of outsourced art assets being received,</p>
<p>the entire team entered a state of high-speed operation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on Chen Xu's official Weibo account and the Nebula Games official website, the warm-up promotion for <em>Dark Souls</em> was gradually being rolled out.</p>
<p>Simple interactions with players, along with releasing new promotional artwork and similar content.</p>
<p>Basically, just making their presence known.</p>
<p>However, during the same period, there were other games undergoing promotion as well.</p>
<p>The most eye-catching was the promotional battle between NetDragon and TengHua—two top-tier domestic channels and game companies.</p>
<p>Both were concealing VR games, and both had participated in the previous gameplay Expo.</p>
<p>Although their spotlight had been stolen by Nebula Games at the exhibition,</p>
<p>these two games were now pulling out all the stops in their marketing campaigns,</p>
<p>each trying to outshine the other.</p>
<p>Still, despite the massive promotional efforts, the impact on Nebula Games wasn't particularly significant.</p>
<p>After all, these two games were VR titles.</p>
<p>Apart from that, there was also the ongoing Game Design Competition with its anti-war theme.</p>
<p>By the end of July and the beginning of August, the Official Game Platform had already seen the launch of numerous anti-war themed games.</p>
<p>Some were mobile games, others PC games.</p>
<p>As for genres, they were all over the place—RPGs, FPS, and more.</p>
<p>Additionally, quite a few games adopted the same format that Chen Xu had used last year with <em>To the Moon</em> to win awards.</p>
<p>Yet none of them stood out, and many received extremely low ratings from gamers.</p>
<p>Numerous players took to online forums to grumble inwardly.</p>
<p>‘Man, this year’s Game Design Competition theme is... indescribable!’</p>
<p>‘Mainly because for an anti-war game, you have to show the cruel nature of war, right? You need grand scenes. With such a short development cycle and the competition never attracting major developers, these games just feel awkward.’</p>
<p>‘+1, it feels like these games are old-fashioned moralists lecturing me, and worse, the lectures are damn boring.’</p>
<p>‘Stop complaining, quickly check Chen Xu’s official Weibo account—he seems to have joined this Game Design Competition too!’</p>
<p>‘What? Isn’t Chen Xu working on <em>Dark Souls</em>? How did he manage to join this competition? Does this mean <em>Dark Souls</em> is already finished!?’</p>
<p>‘Who knows? But anti-war isn’t an ordinary theme—can Chen Xu really pull it off?’</p>
<p>‘Who cares, I’ll just buy it and play it first. Anything from Chen Xu probably won’t be too bad in quality—at least better than these current anti-war games on the market, right?’</p>
<p>‘That’s true!’</p>
<p>Regarding the launch of <em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em>, Chen Xu didn’t conduct any large-scale promotions.</p>
<p>He simply posted a brief announcement on his official Weibo account and added a short introduction for <em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em> on the main page of the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>But clearly, this was different from the past when Chen Xu had little fame and needed to resort to special tactics to promote his games.</p>
<p>The previous popularity of <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Sanguosha</em>, along with the ongoing development of <em>Dark Souls</em>, had already earned Chen Xu considerable recognition and a loyal fanbase.</p>
<p>Once news of <em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em> was released, players quickly noticed it.</p>
<p>However, while players were pleasantly surprised and Chen Xu remained calm,</p>
<p>many game designers participating in this competition felt their Mindset crumbling.</p>
<p>‘Holy crap, isn’t Chen Xu developing <em>Dark Souls</em>? How did he manage to make this game too?’</p>
<p>‘Yeah! I thought Chen Xu wouldn’t participate in this competition this year!’</p>
<p>‘This is way too damn hard!’</p>
<p>Many game designers felt somewhat broken, though a few with stronger Mindsets clung to hope.</p>
<p>‘Let’s stay positive—maybe Chen Xu’s game this time will actually bomb!’</p>
<p>‘Exactly! <em>Dark Souls</em> has been constantly promoted recently. Chen Xu’s main focus must be on <em>Dark Souls</em>—after all, it’s Nebula Games’ and his own first blockbuster.’</p>
<p>‘Right, and anti-war themed games require depth. Chen Xu might not be able to maintain his usual standard.’</p>
<p>Even as they discussed, like many players, these designers still purchased and downloaded the game, eager to see just how good—or bad—the game truly was.</p>
<p>Compared to last year’s <em>To the Moon</em>, <em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em> was priced at 20 Yuan, available on both mobile and PC platforms.</p>
<p>…………………</p>
<p>On Shark TV, the hype surrounding <em>Fall Guys</em>, which had once dominated the entire live streaming platforms, had cooled down significantly.</p>
<p>Although many streamers were still broadcasting it, with some even dedicating entire streams to <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Sanguosha</em>,</p>
<p>most streamers had returned to their usual formats. At most, when they had no other content, they’d invite a few familiar streamers to play <em>Fall Guys</em> together for entertainment effect.</p>
<p>The launch of <em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em>, however, attracted the attention of many game streamers.</p>
<p>In Liuliu’s live stream room on Shark TV, she had just gone live and was chatting with her audience.</p>
<p>‘Alright, that’s enough chatting for now. Next, let’s play that new game just released by Nebula Games.’</p>
<p>‘Not <em>Dark Souls</em>—that one’s still just a pie-in-the-sky promise, no idea when it’ll come out. This is a new entry in the Game Design Competition called <em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em>. Judging by its scale, I’d say it fits the standard of an Independent Game, though Nebula Games can’t exactly be called an Independent Game developer anymore.’</p>
<p>In her live stream, Liuliu introduced the game she was about to play.</p>
<p>She had been closely following Nebula Games.</p>
<p>Aside from <em>Outlast</em> and their groundbreaking debut <em>Mirror (Game)</em>, she quite enjoyed games like <em>Overcooked</em>, <em>Fall Guys</em>, <em>Undertale</em>, and <em>To the Moon</em>.</p>
<p>So, upon learning that Nebula Games had entered this competition with a new game, she immediately decided to stream it.</p>
<p>As she spoke, Liuliu opened the Nebula Games Platform and instantly spotted the game featured on the homepage.</p>
<p>The game’s cover showed a soldier in uniform and a war dog,</p>
<p>rendered in a cartoon animation art style.</p>
<p>She clicked into the game store interface, where the title <em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em> stood out in bold, thick text.</p>
<p>The game description read:</p>
<p>A heart-touching Adventure Game with a unique atmosphere and art style.</p>
<p>Blending elements of Search &amp; Destroy, actions, and Puzzle Solving.</p>
<p>Help the game’s Hero survive the great war by solving puzzles or infiltrating enemy lines.</p>
<p>It tells the story of four men and women and a loyal dog whose fates intertwine during war—a tale of revenge, family, and friendship.</p>
<p>This fictional story will transport you back to the famous World War I battlefields, reliving the major campaigns on the Western Front and immersing you in historical events.</p>
<p>Before Liuliu could even react, viewers in the live stream room already had mixed opinions, rapidly sending bullet comments to express their thoughts.</p>
<p>‘Is this description just bragging?’</p>
<p>‘Yeah, isn’t this just a small-scale game with a cartoon graffiti style? And judging by the genre, it’s 2D side-scrolling. How can it possibly relive the major battles on the Western Front?’</p>
<p>‘Exactly! How can such graphics convey the cruel nature of war?’</p>
<p>‘I trust Chen Xu, but this sounds a bit too exaggerated. Reliving World War I scenes? I’d believe it if it were a Major Production, but this game?’</p>
<p>‘Right, this is stretching it!’</p>
<p>‘Even Nebula Games themselves haven’t promoted it much!’</p>
<p>After reading the description, many players were bewildered.</p>
<p>This self-promotion was excessive!</p>
<p>After all, this was just a small-scale 2D game with cartoon-style Art!</p>
<p>How could it possibly portray the depth of war? How could it relive those historically cruel battles?</p>
<p>But Liuliu’s focus wasn’t on the game’s description.</p>
<p>(PS: Daily request for recommendation votes and Monthly Pass, wuwuwu...)</p>
