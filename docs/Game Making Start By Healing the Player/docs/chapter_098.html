                <p>Chapter 98: Blowing Your Own Horn?</p>
<p>As time advanced day by day, the development of <em>Dark Souls</em> proceeded very smoothly.</p>
<p>With the reception of a large number of outsourced art assets, the entire team entered a high-speed operational phase.</p>
<p>At the same time, on Chen Xu's official Weibo account and Nebula Games' official website, the pre-release hype for <em>Dark Souls</em> was gradually rolled out.</p>
<p>It involved simple interactions with players, releasing new promotional Concept Art and the like. Essentially, it was about maintaining a presence.</p>
<p>However, during the same period, there were other games being promoted.</p>
<p>Particularly noteworthy was the promotional battle between NetDragon and TengHua, two of the top domestic channels and game companies.</p>
<p>They were both hidden VR games, both of which had participated in the previous gameplay Expo.</p>
<p>Although Nebula Games had stolen the spotlight at the expo, these two games were now making grand gestures in their promotion.</p>
<p>Both were aiming to outdo the other.</p>
<p>However, despite the intensity of their efforts, it didn't really impact Nebula Games too much.</p>
<p>After all, these two games were for VR platforms.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there was the ongoing anti-war themed Game Design Competition.</p>
<p>As of late July/early August, quite a few anti-war themed games had been launched on the Official Game Platform.</p>
<p>Among them were some mobile games and some PC games.</p>
<p>As for types, they were varied, with RPGs and FPS games.</p>
<p>However, many games also adopted the model that Chen Xu used last year to win an award with <em>To the Moon</em>.</p>
<p>But none of them were particularly outstanding; in fact, many received very low ratings from players.</p>
<p>Many players complained online.</p>
<p>‘Honestly, this year's Game Design Competition theme is just… hard to describe!’</p>
<p>‘The main issue is the theme. Anti-war needs to show the brutality of war, right? There needs to be big scenes. With such a short cycle, and Game Design Competition rarely attracts big studios, these games just feel awkward.’</p>
<p>‘+1. These games feel like an old pedant lecturing me, and the lecture itself is damn boring.’</p>
<p>‘Stop bickering! Quick, check Chen Xu's official Weibo! He seems to have entered this Game Design Competition too!’</p>
<p>‘What's going on? Isn't Chen Xu making <em>Dark Souls</em>? How did he enter this Game Design Competition? Does that mean <em>Dark Souls</em> is already finished!?’</p>
<p>‘Who knows? But anti-war isn't an ordinary theme. Can Chen Xu do it well?’</p>
<p>‘Who cares? I'll buy it and play it first. A Chen Xu production probably won't be too bad in quality, at least better than the current anti-war games on the market, right?’</p>
<p>‘You have a point!’</p>
<p>Regarding the launch of <em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em>, Chen Xu didn't carry out any large-scale promotions.</p>
<p>He simply posted an announcement on his official Weibo account and added a brief introduction to <em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em> on the main interface of the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>But clearly, unlike when Chen Xu was still unknown and needed special tricks for game promotion, things were different now.</p>
<p>The previous success of <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Sanguosha</em>, as well as the ongoing development of <em>Dark Souls</em>, had given Chen Xu considerable fame and a dedicated fanbase.</p>
<p>After the news of <em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em> was released, it was quickly discovered by players.</p>
<p>However, compared to the players' surprise and Chen Xu's calm demeanor...</p>
<p>Many designers participating in this Game Design Competition felt their spirits crumble a bit.</p>
<p>“Holy cow, wasn't Chen Xu developing <em>Dark Souls</em>? How did he make this game too?”</p>
<p>“Yeah! I thought Chen Xu wouldn't participate in this Game Design Competition this year!”</p>
<p>“This is too damn hard!”</p>
<p>Many game designers felt a bit overwhelmed, though some with a more resilient mindset were fantasizing.</p>
<p>“Everyone, look on the bright side. Maybe Chen Xu's new work will flop!”</p>
<p>“Exactly, <em>Dark Souls</em> has been heavily promoted recently. Chen Xu's main focus must be on <em>Dark Souls</em>, after all, it's Nebula Games' and his first major title.”</p>
<p>“Right, and anti-war themed games are very profound. Chen Xu might not be able to maintain that depth.”</p>
<p>Of course, while discussing, these designers, like many players, purchased and downloaded the game, eager to see its quality.</p>
<p>Compared to last year's <em>To the Moon</em>, <em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em> was priced at 20 Yuan, available on both mobile and PC platforms.</p>
<p>..................</p>
<p>On Shark TV, the popularity of <em>Fall Guys</em>, which had previously swept the entire live streaming platform, had decreased quite a bit.</p>
<p>Although many streamers were still playing it, and some even exclusively streamed <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Sanguosha</em>.</p>
<p>But most streamers had returned to their usual streaming style. At most, when they had no specific content, they would invite a few familiar streamers to play <em>Fall Guys</em> together to create some entertainment.</p>
<p>And the launch of <em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em> this time also attracted quite a few game streamers.</p>
<p>In Liuliu's live stream on Shark TV, she chatted with her fans, having just started streaming.</p>
<p>“That's all for our chat today. Next, we'll play Nebula Games' new title.”</p>
<p>“It's not <em>Dark Souls</em>. That game is still just 'making grand promises' right now, and who knows when it'll be out. It's a new game for this Game Design Competition called <em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em>. I'd guess its scope is probably that of an <em>Independent Game</em>, even though Nebula Games can't exactly be called an <em>Independent Game</em> developer anymore.”</p>
<p>Inside the live stream, Liuliu introduced the game she was going to play to her audience.</p>
<p>Liuliu paid considerable attention to Nebula Games.</p>
<p>Aside from <em>Outlast</em> and its pioneering work <em>Mirror (Game)</em>, she really liked games like <em>Overcooked (Chinese title)</em>, <em>Fall Guys</em>, <em>Undertale</em>, and <em>To the Moon</em>.</p>
<p>So, after learning that Nebula Games was participating in this Game Design Competition with a new game launch, she immediately prepared to stream it.</p>
<p>While speaking, Liuliu opened the Nebula Games Platform and immediately saw the game prominently displayed on the homepage.</p>
<p>The game's cover image featured a soldier in military uniform and a war dog.</p>
<p>A cartoon animation art style.</p>
<p>Clicking to enter the game store interface, a prominent bold title read <em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em>.</p>
<p>Reading the game's description:</p>
<p>A heartwarming adventure game with a unique atmosphere and art style. It blends elements of exploration, action, and puzzles. Help the game's heroes survive this great war by solving puzzles or infiltrating enemy lines. It primarily tells a story of revenge, family affection, and friendship between four intertwined men and women and a loyal dog amidst the war. This fictional story will take you back to famous World War I scenes, allowing you to relive major battles on the Western Front and immerse yourself in historical events.</p>
<p>Before Liuliu could react much, the viewers in the live stream each had different opinions, flooding the chat with bullet comments expressing their thoughts.</p>
<p>‘Isn't this description a bit boastful?’</p>
<p>‘Yeah, isn't this just a small-scale game with a cartoon doodle style, and it looks like a 2D side-scroller? And it's supposed to relive major battles on the Western Front?’</p>
<p>‘Exactly, how can this art style convey the brutality of war?’</p>
<p>‘Although I really trust Chen Xu, this is a bit much. Reliving WWI scenes? If it were a big production, I'd believe it, but this game?’</p>
<p>‘Exactly, it's a bit far-fetched!’</p>
<p>‘Even Nebula Games hasn't really promoted it much!’</p>
<p>After reading this description, many players were also a bit bewildered.</p>
<p>This self-praise is excessive!</p>
<p>After all, this is just a small-scale, 2D-style game with cartoon art!</p>
<p>How can this depict war? And relive those brutal historical battles?</p>
<p>However, Liuliu's focus wasn't on the game's description.</p>
<p>(PS: Daily plea for recommendation votes and monthly passes, sobbing...)</p>
