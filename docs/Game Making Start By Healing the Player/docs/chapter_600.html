<p>Chapter 599: This Is More of an Assassin Than the Assassin! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>As the game progressed, Li Yue began to experience more of the existing gameplay content.</p>
<p>First was the resources.</p>
<p>In the original game, Joel planned to leave the quarantine zone with Tess by crossing the blockade line.</p>
<p>But they coincidentally encountered the resistance group, the Fireflies, launching an attack, triggering a full lockdown across the entire quarantine zone.</p>
<p>As a result, Tess and Joel had no choice but to take an alternate route—a secret hideout used by smugglers.</p>
<p>Here, players unlock the inventory and resource system, though Li Yue could clearly sense that this system was designed more for enhancing the sense of immersion rather than practical gameplay benefit.</p>
<p>The resources provided were simply too scarce.</p>
<p>A backpack, a handgun, a gas mask, and a pitiful four bullets.</p>
<p>Resources were extremely limited—far worse than the starting conditions in earlier games like Resident Evil.</p>
<p>Clearly, resource management would be a core mechanic in The Last of Us.</p>
<p>If players didn't actively scavenge for bullets and other supplies, ammunition would barely suffice.</p>
<p>This reinforced Li Yue’s earlier thoughts.</p>
<p>Scarce resources weren’t just a gameplay mechanic for resource management—they also served a deeper purpose: immersing players in the game’s setting.</p>
<p>With such minimal supplies and a post-apocalyptic backdrop, what kind of story was this game trying to tell?</p>
<p>And what was the significance of Sarah’s death in the Prologue?</p>
<p>If Sarah wasn’t the girl featured in the promotional trailers, how did Joel meet the girl named Ellie?</p>
<p>With these questions in mind, Li Yue guided Joel and Tess forward.</p>
<p>The journey ahead continued to function as part of the new player tutorial.</p>
<p>Finding a way forward was akin to solving environmental puzzles, similar to Uncharted, or indeed, many other games.</p>
<p>Within a scene, players needed to locate items that helped them reach the next area—sometimes cooperating with Tess to climb to higher ground.</p>
<p>Along the way, players could also collect resources to craft tools or upgrade firearms.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, it was quite traditional. For any player familiar with the genre, there was no risk of confusion or misunderstanding.</p>
<p>And this had both advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>The advantage was that players didn’t need to spend much effort grasping the mechanics, allowing them to focus more on the story.</p>
<p>The disadvantage was that if the narrative experience wasn’t compelling, the gameplay would become a weak point.</p>
<p>Since this was a game review, Li Yue played while simultaneously analyzing the strengths, weaknesses, and reasoning behind various game design choices.</p>
<p>Though the gameplay leaned toward tradition, the character development—especially of Tess, Joel’s companion—left a strong first impression.</p>
<p>Tess’s past remained unclear, but her personality was already revealed through these puzzle-solving segments.</p>
<p>A reliable, tough woman, she could even lift Joel up a flight of stairs with one hand—her strength was undeniable.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, conversations with Tess during their journey gradually unveiled the game’s setting.</p>
<p>In The Last of Us, the virus was a parasitic organism known as the Cordyceps fungus.</p>
<p>A spore-based infection, it took over the human host, enhancing physical abilities and eventually mutating infected individuals into Clickers—blind but with heightened hearing.</p>
<p>Infection was excruciating and incurable, so many chose to end their lives before turning.</p>
<p>Moreover, when an infected body died and decomposed to a certain point, it released spores into the air.</p>
<p>If uninfected people inhaled too many spores, they would become infected as well—hence the need for gas masks in contaminated areas.</p>
<p>While traversing the smugglers’ secret passage, Joel and Tess encountered another smuggler.</p>
<p>His situation was grim—his gas mask was broken, and a metal cabinet pinned him to the ground, rendering him immobile.</p>
<p>Seeing Joel and Tess, the man begged for help.</p>
<p>But with his gas mask destroyed, his fate was sealed.</p>
<p>He would inevitably turn into an infected.</p>
<p>At this point, the player had only two choices: leave him to suffer, or grant him a merciful end with a single bullet.</p>
<p>A quicker, more compassionate release.</p>
<p>Shortly after, they faced their first combat level.</p>
<p>However, the combat system in The Last of Us was different from what Li Yue had expected.</p>
<p>It was more realistic, more intense.</p>
<p>The initial infected were called Runners.</p>
<p>True to their name, they were fast and agile, often appearing in groups. Once alerted, they would swarm the player all at once.</p>
<p>This required players to use stealth walk to avoid detection, or silently assassinate them.</p>
<p>Of course, the infected came in both Regular and special types.</p>
<p>Regular infected could be eliminated with a stealth kill.</p>
<p>But certain elite monsters required crafted switchblades, made using the equipment crafting system, to be taken down.</p>
<p>Additionally, items like bricks, bottles, and steel pipes could be picked up and used as improvised weapons.</p>
<p>This was somewhat reminiscent of Zelda—where any weapon on the ground could be picked up and used.</p>
<p>But the most distinctive feature of the game was the Listen Mode.</p>
<p>When activated, Joel would crouch and, as if using wallhacks, perceive enemy positions based on sound.</p>
<p>Of course, this ability had a limited range.</p>
<p>Combined with the stealth assassination mechanics and the tension of scarce resources, the combat system clearly encouraged players to rely on stealth and assassination.</p>
<p>On second thought, it made perfect sense.</p>
<p>After all, this was a post-apocalyptic setting. Joel was just a slightly stronger smuggler, not an Assassin master like Ezio or Altaïr.</p>
<p>In gameplay, Li Yue experimented with both stealth and aggressive approaches.</p>
<p>The stealth method worked smoothly.</p>
<p>But when he tried charging in with a brick—playing on normal difficulty—he was swiftly taught a lesson by a group of Runners.</p>
<p>One or two might fall to a brick, but the moment other Runners heard the commotion, they rushed in as reinforcements.</p>
<p>If Joel couldn’t escape, death was inevitable.</p>
<p>“This feels more like an Assassin game than Assassin’s Creed!”</p>
<p>Li Yue whispered to himself, cautiously sneaking through a building crawling with infected, filled with emotion.</p>
<p>While Assassin’s Creed offered stylish assassinations, it still allowed players to go on rampage with hidden blades.</p>
<p>But in The Last of Us, at least at this stage, the idea of clearing the game with just a gun and a brick was pure fantasy.</p>
<p>Still, despite his感慨, the combat system itself wasn’t bad.</p>
<p>The Listen Mode, functioning like wallhacks, and the stealth assassination mechanics weren’t particularly novel.</p>
<p>But combined with the post-apocalyptic setting, scarce resources, and limited but accessible tools like bricks, they fully showcased a tense, nerve-wracking atmosphere of survival.</p>
<p>While playing, he hadn’t even thought about anything outside the game.</p>
