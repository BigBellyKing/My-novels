                <p>Chapter 83: Players at the Exhibition</p>
<p>At the entrances of various booths, numerous players were already engaged in discussions.</p>
<p>‘NetDragon and TengHua are really going all out this year!’</p>
<p>‘Damn it! They just launched a VR blockbuster during the Lunar New Year—now another new work already?’</p>
<p>‘Don’t get your hopes too high. It’s probably just a demo, right? Wasn’t it the same every previous year?’</p>
<p>‘Still exciting though! No more talk—I’m off to queue!’</p>
<p>‘Exactly! I’ve got to experience it properly. After all, it’s the latest VR blockbuster from NetDragon and TengHua.’</p>
<p>‘But there are way too many people here!’</p>
<p>‘It’ll only get longer later.’</p>
<p>‘Forget it, I’ll just check out other booths instead.’</p>
<p>The first choice for many players was undoubtedly the booths of TengHua and NetDragon.</p>
<p>And their intentions were crystal clear—to experience the latest VR blockbuster jointly presented by NetDragon and TengHua.</p>
<p>It was simply too attractive.</p>
<p>Of course, quite a few players were intimidated by the seemingly endless queues.</p>
<p>They were just too long.</p>
<p>Although skipping the queue meant missing out on gameplay, there were still other things worth watching.</p>
<p>For instance, the showgirls’ long, bare legs at each booth.</p>
<p>‘Holy smokes! Those legs are huge… wait, I mean super long!’</p>
<p>‘Now that’s what I call “legs that play for years”!’</p>
<p>‘You guys are so fickle. I’m different—I can play with them for two whole years.’</p>
<p>‘So we’re all old lecherous men, huh!’</p>
<p>‘Don’t say that! We’re not lecherous—we just appreciate the beautiful things in life!’</p>
<p>‘Exactly!’</p>
<p>Of course, not every player’s gaze lingered on bare legs.</p>
<p>There were still exceptions.</p>
<p>‘Stop staring, your eyeballs are about to pop out,’ Wang Han rolled her eyes and snapped at Zhang Yi beside her.</p>
<p>‘Cough, cough—don’t say that! I wasn’t looking. I’m not interested in that sort of thing,’ Zhang Yi replied awkwardly, quickly changing the subject. ‘Anyway, where should we go next? How about NetDragon’s booth?’</p>
<p>‘Sure, I’m actually quite curious about their new work,’ nodded a heavily built youth—Song Ren, who had been utterly terrified while playing <em>Outlast</em> earlier.</p>
<p>Besides him were another young man and a girl. They were all real-world friends who had planned to visit the gameplay Expo together.</p>
<p>‘I think we should forget it. There are way too many people! You wait in line for two or three hours, then get only a few minutes of gameplay. The gaming pod won’t even warm up!’ Wang Han said.</p>
<p>Honestly, she was quite interested in the VR blockbusters from NetDragon and TengHua.</p>
<p>But after seeing the massive queue, she immediately gave up on the idea.</p>
<p>‘Oh, wait—Nebula Games also participated in this exhibition. Let’s go check out their booth. Maybe they’ve got a new release!’ Wang Han suddenly remembered.</p>
<p>She had a very favorable impression of this game developer.</p>
<p><em>To the Moon</em>, <em>Undertale</em>, and <em>Overcooked</em> were all games she deeply loved.</p>
<p>‘That’s right! Let’s go see Nebula Games’ exhibition area. I wonder if they’ll have any new titles this time,’ agreed Qiao Yi, a female voice.</p>
<p>‘I’m fine with it,’ said Wang Yifan, another young man, shrugging his shoulders.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi and Song Ren, however, stared wide-eyed upon hearing this.</p>
<p>Even now, Zhang Yi couldn’t forget how he’d ended up washing dishes at home every day.</p>
<p>Likewise, Song Ren still vividly remembered how <em>Outlast</em> had nearly scared him into wetting his pants.</p>
<p>Still, they ultimately decided to first take a look at Nebula Games’ booth. After all, the sight of those intimidatingly long queues at NetDragon and TengHua’s booths was enough to scare anyone off.</p>
<p>And they weren’t the only ones heading toward Nebula Games’ booth.</p>
<p>Quite a few other players were doing the same.</p>
<p>After all, Nebula Games and Chen Xu had gained significant recognition in the independent gaming community and among niche player groups due to their consecutive string of quality titles.</p>
<p>Thus, quite a few players had specifically come to see Nebula Games—and Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Moreover, some industry gaming media and streamers attending the exhibition were also heading toward third- and fourth-tier developers, as well as well-known independent studios.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>NetDragon and TengHua, of course, were the darlings of mainstream media coverage.</p>
<p>But with so much coverage already, how could smaller outlets compete for traffic?</p>
<p>It was smarter to focus on developers with some fame, yet less fierce mainstream competition.</p>
<p>Nebula Games naturally fit that category.</p>
<p>However, when players arrived at Nebula Games’ booth, many were momentarily confused.</p>
<p>The vibe here was completely different!</p>
<p>Look at the other booths—even within the independent game section.</p>
<p>Flashy girls and eye-catching bare legs were everywhere.</p>
<p>Yet Nebula Games was like a breath of fresh air!</p>
<p>There were still girls, sure—three or four of them. But most people here wore mascot costumes.</p>
<p>On a designated stage, they tugged and bounced around each other, looking utterly comical.</p>
<p>‘What’s going on? Why is Nebula Games’ showgirl display like this!’</p>
<p>‘Dude, those aren’t showgirls. Look closely—excluding employees, there are only three female cosers.’</p>
<p>‘Haha, but admit it—this is actually pretty fun to watch.’</p>
<p>‘Check the sign—it says this is Chen Xu’s new game!’</p>
<p>‘<em>Sanguosha</em>? <em>Fall Guys</em>? Never heard of them. Did Chen Xu secretly prepare an ultimate ability just for this exhibition?’</p>
<p>Players arriving at Nebula Games’ booth wore expressions of pure curiosity.</p>
<p>They began discussing animatedly.</p>
<p>After all, compared to other booths, this one was truly extraordinary.</p>
<p>‘Honestly, those colorful toy-like characters do resemble candy beans. Super hilarious!’</p>
<p>‘Exactly! At least in terms of presentation, Nebula Games is truly one-of-a-kind!’</p>
<p>‘But wait—Nebula Games brought new games, yet why are there so few demo units?’</p>
<p>‘Right? <em>Fall Guys</em> takes up such a huge space, yet they only set up fifteen computers?’</p>
<p>‘And <em>Sanguosha</em>? Only five computers? Besides that, it’s just a bunch of chairs and tables—what’s that about?’</p>
<p>‘Could it be that this is Nebula Games’ and Chen Xu’s first time exhibiting, so they lack experience?’</p>
<p>‘That shouldn’t be it. They’ve had plenty of time to prepare.’</p>
<p>Players gathered around Nebula Games’ booth began whispering among themselves.</p>
<p>What puzzled them most was why there were so few playable devices at Nebula Games’ booth.</p>
<p>But soon, their questions were answered.</p>
<p>Nebula Games’ booth was divided into three zones, with a stage left open in the center.</p>
<p>At the stage’s center stood showgirls dressed as sugar beans. Though wearing mascot costumes made it hard to tell their gender.</p>
<p>Soon, the sugar beans bounced apart, creating space as Chen Xu stepped onto the stage, taking on the role of presenter for Nebula Games’ booth.</p>
<p>With Chen Xu’s appearance, fans of Nebula Games who recognized him immediately waved and shouted excitedly.</p>
<p>Though the words they shouted were hilariously amusing.</p>
<p>‘Chen Xu, give me back my girlfriend!’</p>
<p>‘Yeah, Chen Xu, return my girlfriend!’</p>
<p>‘You promised us you’d be a Warrior of Love!’</p>
<p>Facing the impassioned crowd, Chen Xu could only smile awkwardly.</p>
<p>He gestured for silence. ‘Everyone, please calm down. I see you’re all very passionate!’</p>
<p>‘Though honestly, you’ve slightly misunderstood me.’</p>
<p>‘But that’s okay—because the games we’ve brought to this exhibition will erase your biases. It’s time to prove myself once again!’</p>
<p>‘No more words. <em>Fall Guys</em>—a lighthearted, harmonious and heartwarming multiplayer variety show obstacle course game that brings players endless joy. <em>Sanguosha</em>—a multiplayer strategic battle board game.’</p>
<p>Behind him, the large screen displayed promotional artwork for <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Sanguosha</em>.</p>
<p>As Chen Xu introduced the games, the previously quiet crowd burst into simultaneous laughter upon hearing the phrase “lighthearted, harmonious and heartwarming.”</p>
<p>The expression felt eerily familiar!</p>
<p>But before they could react further, Chen Xu’s next words filled them with surprise and excitement.</p>
<p>‘I’m sure you’ve noticed our on-site demo units are very limited. As for the reason—’</p>
<p>‘You can scan the corresponding QR codes to directly download the mobile versions and experience the fun of both games ahead of time during the exhibition.’</p>
<p>‘Also, on the final day of the exhibition, we’ll have a grand finale event to present to you all.’</p>
<p>(Daily plea for recommendation votes and Monthly Pass—Bang bang bang! Finally, let me handle the grumbling: [You’re too short!] [This excitement will last all day!] [Read it, but also feel like I didn’t~])</p>
