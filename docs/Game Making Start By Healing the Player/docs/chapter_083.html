                <p>Chapter 83: Players at the Exhibition</p>
<p>At the entrances of various exhibition areas, many players were discussing.</p>
<p>“NetDragon and TengHua are making big moves this year!”</p>
<p>“Holy crap, they just launched a VR blockbuster during the New Year, and now there's a new title?”</p>
<p>“Don't get your hopes too high, it's probably a demo, isn't it always like this every year?”</p>
<p>“That's still exciting! I'm off to queue up!”</p>
<p>“Exactly, exactly, I really need to experience it, after all, it's NetDragon and TengHua's latest VR blockbuster.”</p>
<p>“But there are too many people, aren't there?”</p>
<p>“More people will just join the queue later.”</p>
<p>“Forget it, I'll go check out other exhibition areas instead.”</p>
<p>Many players' first choice, without a doubt, was the exhibition area where TengHua and NetDragon were located.</p>
<p>And everyone's goal was very clear: to see the latest VR blockbusters brought by NetDragon and TengHua this time.</p>
<p>They were simply too eye-catching.</p>
<p>Of course, quite a few players were deterred by the sight of the long queue.</p>
<p>After all, it was simply too long.</p>
<p>Of course, even without queuing up, and thus no way to experience the game content, there were still other things to see.</p>
<p>Namely, the showgirls' long legs in each exhibition area.</p>
<p>“Wow! Those legs are so big... no, so long!”</p>
<p>“These are legs to play with for years!”</p>
<p>“You people are too fickle, always preferring the new over the old. I'm different, I can play with them for two years.”</p>
<p>“So everyone here is an old lecherous man!”</p>
<p>“Don't talk nonsense, we're not lecherous, we're just good at appreciating the beautiful things in the world!”</p>
<p>“Exactly!”</p>
<p>Of course, not all players' gazes were fixated on long legs.</p>
<p>There were still some exceptions.</p>
<p>“Stop staring, your eyeballs are practically popping out.” Rolling her eyes, Wang Han said grumpily to Zhang Yi beside her.</p>
<p>“Ahem, don't talk nonsense, I wasn't looking. I'm not interested in those.” Zhang Yi said, slightly embarrassed, then immediately changed the subject: “By the way, which exhibition area should we visit now, the NetDragon one?”</p>
<p>“Sure, I'm quite interested in their new game.” A very robust young man nodded. This was Song Ren, who had been scared witless while playing <em>Outlast</em> before.</p>
<p>Accompanying him were another young man and a girl. All of them were friends in real life.</p>
<p>This time, they had also planned to come to the gameplay Expo together.</p>
<p>“I think we should forget it. There are too many people! Queuing for two or three hours just to experience a few minutes, the VR gaming pod won't even warm up.” Wang Han said.</p>
<p>To be honest, she was also very interested in NetDragon and TengHua's VR blockbusters.</p>
<p>But after seeing the long queue, she gave up on that idea.</p>
<p>“Oh, right, Nebula Games seems to be participating in this exhibition too. Let's go check out their exhibition area, maybe they have something new!” Wang Han suddenly remembered something.</p>
<p>She had a very good impression of this game developer.</p>
<p><em>To the Moon</em>, <em>Undertale</em>, and <em>Overcooked</em> — she loved them all.</p>
<p>“Right! Let's go see the Nebula Games exhibition area. I wonder if they'll have any new games this time.” Another female voice, named Joey, agreed.</p>
<p>“I have no objection.” Another young man named Wang Yifan shrugged.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Yi and Song Ren, standing nearby, widened their eyes after hearing this.</p>
<p>To this day, he still couldn't forget how he ended up washing dishes every day at home.</p>
<p>Similarly, Song Ren couldn't forget how he almost peed himself from fright while playing <em>Outlast</em>.</p>
<p>But in the end, they decided to first check out Nebula Games' exhibition area, as the long queues at NetDragon and TengHua's areas looked truly intimidating.</p>
<p>And players heading to the Nebula Games exhibition area, like Zhang Yi and his friends, were actually not few in number.</p>
<p>After all, a string of high-quality games had given Chen Xu and Nebula Games considerable renown within the independent game community and among specific player groups.</p>
<p>Thus, quite a few players came specifically for Nebula Games and Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Similarly, some gaming media from the industry and streamers attending the exhibition were also heading towards the second- and third-tier companies, as well as some well-known independent games.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>There's no need to mention NetDragon and TengHua; they are naturally the subjects mainstream media are keen to report on.</p>
<p>But if too many reports come out, how can you compete with those media outlets for traffic?</p>
<p>It's better to choose game developers that have some recognition but face less intense mainstream competition.</p>
<p>Nebula Games, of course, was one of them.</p>
<p>However, when players arrived at the Nebula Games exhibition area, many were a little bewildered.</p>
<p>The art style was completely different!</p>
<p>Looking at other exhibition areas, even independent game ones.</p>
<p>There were plenty of showy girls and dazzling long legs, not a single one missing.</p>
<p>In contrast, Nebula Games was a breath of fresh air!</p>
<p>There were definitely girls, but only three or four of them. Most of the people were wearing mascot costumes.</p>
<p>On a designated display stage, they were pulling, tugging, and jumping around, looking very comical.</p>
<p>“What's going on?! Why are Nebula Games' showgirls like this?!”</p>
<p>“Friend, these aren't showgirls, if you look, there are only three female cosplayers besides the staff.”</p>
<p>“Haha, but seriously, it's actually quite fun.”</p>
<p>“Looking at the exhibition area's signs, these are Chen Xu's new games!”</p>
<p>“<em>Sanguosha</em>, <em>Fall Guys</em>... I've never heard of them before. Is this Chen Xu's big move specifically prepared for this exhibition?”</p>
<p>Players who came to the Nebula Games exhibition area all had expressions of novelty.</p>
<p>They began to discuss animatedly.</p>
<p>After all, compared to other exhibition areas, this was simply too peculiar.</p>
<p>“Honestly, those colorful toy figures really do look a bit like jelly beans, super comical.”</p>
<p>“Exactly, at least in terms of presentation, Nebula Games is truly unique!”</p>
<p>“But speaking of Nebula Games bringing new games this time, why are there so few devices prepared?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, <em>Fall Guys</em> takes up such a large space, but there are only fifteen computers?”</p>
<p>“And for <em>Sanguosha</em>, there are only five computers, besides that, what's with all the chairs and tables?”</p>
<p>“Is this Nebula Games and Chen Xu's first time participating, lacking experience?”</p>
<p>“That shouldn't be the case, they've been preparing for so many days in advance.”</p>
<p>Players gathered in the Nebula Games exhibition area began to whisper among themselves.</p>
<p>What puzzled the players was why there were so few trial devices in the Nebula Games exhibition area.</p>
<p>But next, their questions were answered.</p>
<p>The Nebula Games exhibition area was divided into three sections, with a stage left vacant in the center.</p>
<p>The center of the stage was filled with showgirls dressed as Fall Guys characters, though their genders couldn't be distinguished in the mascot costumes.</p>
<p>Soon, the Fall Guys characters on stage bounced apart, and Chen Xu stepped onto the stage, acting as the presenter for the Nebula Games exhibition area.</p>
<p>With Chen Xu's appearance, it was clear that some fans of Nebula Games, who had also learned about Chen Xu, immediately recognized him. They waved and shouted loudly.</p>
<p>However, the content of their shouts was irresistibly funny.</p>
<p>“Chen Xu, give me back my girlfriend!”</p>
<p>“Exactly, Chen Xu, give me back my girlfriend!”</p>
<p>“What happened to the 'Warrior of Love' you promised?!”</p>
<p>Seeing the 'excited and agitated' players, Chen Xu couldn't help but feel a little dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Chen Xu motioned for everyone to quiet down: “Everyone, please settle down. You all seem very enthusiastic!”</p>
<p>“However, there are a few misunderstandings about me.”</p>
<p>“Of course, that's fine, because the games brought to this exhibition will wash away your prejudices against me. It's time for me to prove myself again!”</p>
<p>“Without further ado, <em>Fall Guys</em> is a lighthearted, joyful, harmonious, and loving multiplayer variety show obstacle course game that will make players immensely happy. <em>Sanguosha</em> is a multiplayer strategy card game.”</p>
<p>On the large screen behind him, promotional art for <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Sanguosha</em> appeared.</p>
<p>As Chen Xu introduced the games, the initially quiet players, hearing him mention 'lighthearted, joyful, harmonious, and loving'...</p>
<p>...instantly burst into a joyous chorus of laughter.</p>
<p>Because this description sounded eerily familiar!</p>
<p>However, before they could react further, Chen Xu's next words filled them with surprise and excitement.</p>
<p>“I believe everyone has noticed that our on-site trial equipment is very limited. As for the reason...”</p>
<p>“...you can scan the corresponding QR code to directly download the mobile versions and experience the fun of both games in advance during the exhibition.”</p>
<p>“Additionally, on the last day of the exhibition, we will have a grand finale program for everyone.”</p>
<p>(Daily request for recommendation tickets, monthly passes – <em>Clang, clang, clang!</em> Lastly, when it comes to complaints, leave it to me! [You're too short!] [This excitement lasts all day] [I saw it but felt like I didn't~])</p>
