                <p>Chapter 463: A Reply? Players Have to Believe It! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Five days after the official release of <em>Assassin's Creed</em>, <em>Medieval: Deliverance</em> was also released as scheduled.</p>
<p>The backgrounds of the two games actually have a relatively large time span, and they depict different historical periods.</p>
<p>One is the Renaissance period, the other is the Crusades.</p>
<p>But as games launched concurrently, one an exclusive masterpiece on the Huanyu VR platform and the other an exclusive masterpiece on the Zeus Platform, and both being historical themes,</p>
<p>Players still singled out the two games for comparison.</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay, the two games are actually completely different.</p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed</em>, for instance, features diversified gameplay, with assassinations and frontal combat being very rich. Especially some high-level players, after activating the kill streak system, can completely clear out an entire city by themselves. This also led many players to jokingly remark that the so-called perfect assassination in <em>Assassin's Creed</em> is simply to eliminate all eyewitnesses.</p>
<p>As for <em>Medieval: Deliverance</em>, its combat elements lean towards hardcore, requiring players to attack enemies from multiple directions, somewhat resembling a game of rock-paper-scissors. Compared to the cool assassination moves in <em>Assassin's Creed</em>, <em>Medieval: Deliverance</em>'s combat methods are more realistic.</p>
<p>For many players who enjoy cold weapons and realistic, hardcore combat, <em>Medieval: Deliverance</em> has many followers in this regard.</p>
<p>However, for ordinary players, <em>Assassin's Creed</em> is clearly more to their liking.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because unless one aims for perfect synchronization, <em>Assassin's Creed</em>'s combat isn't difficult and can be incredibly satisfying. Coupled with Ezio's dashing Assassin's uniform and execution animations, it's absolutely explosive in its coolness.</p>
<p>The remainder is the game's historical accuracy. In this aspect, <em>Medieval: Deliverance</em> indeed performed well, faithfully recreating the true depiction of a certain historical period.</p>
<p>However, compared to <em>Assassin's Creed</em>, it still falls short. This is because the player's role in <em>Assassin's Creed</em> is inextricably linked to various major historical events. Players can control Ezio to converse with historically renowned figures like Leonardo da Vinci and complete related missions.</p>
<p>They can even assassinate Savonarola and liberate Florence.</p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed</em> didn't strictly adhere to history; instead, it cloaked itself in a layer of sci-fi. For example, the Apple of Eden and the modern-day storyline serving as a narrative device. This actually gave players a stronger sense of immersion. In contrast, <em>Medieval: Deliverance</em> meticulously recreated various details during the Crusades, but players didn't feel as strongly involved in history.</p>
<p>The only thing players found intolerable was that after <em>Uncharted</em> made many players feel Chen Xu truly had 'love' in his game design, this 'love' vanished as <em>Assassin's Creed</em>'s story deepened, openly revealing heart-wrenching blows once more.</p>
<p>First, the entire family of three collectively kicked the bucket. Then, just as players began to perceive Ezio's true nature as an old lecherous man and his unique charm, making them feel the emotional connection between Ezio and Cristina, a final knife was plunged into their hearts.</p>
<p>That would have been fine.</p>
<p>After successfully reclaiming the Apple of Eden and liberating Florence, Ezio collected more and more of Altaïr's secret letters. Eventually, the Assassin Brotherhood pieced together a world map from these letters and used the Apple of Eden to find a legendary secret vault, but this vault was located beneath the Vatican City.</p>
<p>Thus, to enter the underground vault, Ezio infiltrated the Vatican alone and broke into the Sistine Chapel, engaging in a fierce battle with Pope Alexander VI Rodrigo. He ultimately defeated him, opening a hidden passage to the underground, where he learned from Those Who Came Before about a major catastrophe humanity would face in the future. However, compared to Desmond, who knew everything about the future, Ezio was clearly completely bewildered.</p>
<p>Returning to Monteriggioni, where players had just spent a beautiful night with Caterina, with the camera only showing the scene outside the window.</p>
<p>This brief, warm scene was instantly shattered.</p>
<p>Historically renowned Cesare Borgia, the Poison Duke, usurped his father Rodrigo's power and ambushed Monteriggioni, not only capturing Caterina but also killing Mario Auditore, leaving Ezio severely wounded and unconscious.</p>
<p>Mario Auditore, who had always guided Ezio towards becoming a mature Assassin, got written out here, delivering another brutal blow to countless players.</p>
<p>These continuous blows directly broke many players who were deeply immersed in the storyline.</p>
<p>After all, compared to the original <em>Assassin's Creed</em>, the in-game cinematics and visual presentation received significant enhancements.</p>
<p>And for story-driven games, better visuals and performance naturally lead to a more immersive experience.</p>
<p>This was quite different from the beginning, where Ezio merely helped his younger brother find feathers, climbed towers with his older brother, and delivered letters for his father.</p>
<p>Uncle Mario provided a lot of guidance to Ezio along the way.</p>
<p>Initially, Ezio fought for hatred and anger, accusing his enemies of their crimes.</p>
<p>But during this journey, Uncle Mario taught Ezio to respect life.</p>
<p>One could say that while Uncle Mario wasn't Ezio's biological father, in some ways, he was even more like a father.</p>
<p>Under Uncle Mario's guidance, Ezio no longer solely pursued revenge, and he also gained a deeper understanding of the Assassin's philosophy and creed.</p>
<p>'Where other men blindly follow the truth, remember, nothing is true. Where other men are limited by morality or law, remember, everything is permitted.'</p>
<p>This saying wasn't to encourage Assassins to act recklessly, but rather a guide to knowledge, faith, and wisdom.</p>
<p>Online, besides discussions about <em>Assassin's Creed</em>'s gameplay and beautiful scenery,</p>
<p>Most players were focused on discussing the game's storyline. Of course, during these discussions, players' emotions were incredibly intense.</p>
<p>“Heh, I'd rather believe a sow can climb a tree than believe Mr. Chen has any 'love' in his games!”</p>
<p>“Damn it, the deaths of his brother and father at the beginning were just a way of testing the waters, and once the refund period passed in the mid-game, Chen Xu started acting recklessly, didn't he?”</p>
<p>“Cristina, Uncle Mario... honestly, if anyone else dies, I wouldn't be surprised.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen: My dear player, did you drop this golden knife, or this silver knife, or perhaps this iron knife? Player: No, no, Mr. Chen, none of these knives are mine. Mr. Chen: How honest! Then I'll give you all three knives! [Stab!]”</p>
<p>Practically every player who experienced the game's story left various comments on Chen Xu's official Weibo account.</p>
<p>Some overseas players, worried that Chen Xu wouldn't check the overseas official Weibo, even used translation software to machine-translate their grievances into Chinese and posted replies on Chen Xu's domestic official Weibo.</p>
<p>Chen Xu himself, within Nebula Games, was filled with emotion regarding these player comments.</p>
<p>“I really want to reply to the players! But wouldn't that spoil it? There really won't be any Assassins delivering more 'knives' to players later on!” In the lounge, Chen Xu sighed, looking at the +9999 comment notifications on his phone.</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue, who was playing a game with Yang Xin nearby, couldn't help but curl her lips when she heard Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Is it about spoilers?</p>
<p>It's about whether players will believe you! Even if you reply, players have to believe it!</p>
