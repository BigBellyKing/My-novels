                <h2>Chapter 567: Is This the Treatment a Protagonist Deserves? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h2>
<p>This instantly reminded Song Ren of the changes Chen Xu had mentioned during the Nebula Games Carnival Direct.</p>
<p>Does this mean that the new work <em>Resident Evil: Village</em> has added a currency and store system?</p>
<p>Though surprised, Song Ren was overjoyed.</p>
<p>Because this might mean he could buy bullets with money later on.</p>
<p>After all, fear often stems from insufficient firepower.</p>
<p>In the previous <em>Resident Evil</em>, he had been terrified at first, but by the end, his greatest fear wasn’t encountering monsters—it was running out of inventory space.</p>
<p>Now, with the addition of an economic system in this installment, did it mean he could do whatever he wanted?</p>
<p>From a conventional perspective, Ethan should be cautious at this point, wary of attracting the werewolves' attention. But Song Ren had no such concerns.</p>
<p>Seeing the open door, he barged right in to loot everything. He also noticed the in-game map was incredibly convenient.</p>
<p>The map displayed three colors: black for unexplored areas, red for areas with uncollected resources, and blue for fully looted zones.</p>
<p>This completely changed the game's pace for Song Ren.</p>
<p>Screw the werewolves—his small pistol would take care of them all!</p>
<p>Houses? If he could enter, not a single item would be left behind!</p>
<p><em>Resident Evil: Village</em>?</p>
<p>Ethan was here to plunder the Village!</p>
<p>In one room, he even found the shotgun he’d been dreaming of.</p>
<p>Though its Appearance/Shape clearly matched the unlucky old man’s from before, it was incredibly effective.</p>
<p>Two bullets per werewolf.</p>
<p>Moreover, Song Ren discovered numerous flour sacks and barrels of explosives scattered across the map, which could help Ethan deal with the monsters.</p>
<p>Killing monsters not only earned money but also had a chance to drop materials like gunpowder and parts.</p>
<p>These materials could be used to craft bullets, and nearly every accessible house in the village contained some ammunition.</p>
<p>While resources were still tight, not every monster needed to be fought.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game wasn’t pitch-black—just dim, like an overcast or rainy day.</p>
<p>This made the experience far more enjoyable for Song Ren.</p>
<p>Even with the snow-covered scenes, cramped environments, and occasional jumpscare werewolves, the new <em>Resident Evil: Village</em> was a massive improvement over its predecessor.</p>
<p>"This experience is absolutely peak!" Song Ren chuckled as he picked off the werewolf villagers one by one.</p>
<p>They were all resources—it almost felt like a grind game.</p>
<p>But soon, his contentment faded as something felt off.</p>
<p>The number of mobs in the Village seemed to be increasing—and so were their varieties.</p>
<p>Werewolves with Bows and Arrows firing flaming arrows from the rafters.</p>
<p>Werewolves with Hammers and cleavers.</p>
<p><em>Whoosh… whoosh…</em></p>
<p>The sound of flaming arrows cutting through the air filled the room. Though their accuracy was poor, Song Ren realized that if this continued, he’d eventually run out of ammo.</p>
<p>And then, death would be inevitable.</p>
<p>"Farewell! Time to bail!"</p>
<p>Dodging the surrounding werewolves with serpentine positioning, Song Ren bolted in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>He stumbled and rolled his way through, barely surviving thanks to the lowest difficulty setting.</p>
<p>"Damn it! What the hell is that? The White-Haired Lion King?!" At a blocked path marked by wooden stakes, Song Ren froze at the sight of a massive figure approaching.</p>
<p>The towering brute, covered in white hair, wielded a giant spiked hammer—exuding overwhelming pressure.</p>
<p>"No way… Is this a BOSS battle already? How am I supposed to fight this?!" Song Ren had no intention of engaging the Sledge-wielding White-Haired Lion King and immediately turned to flee.</p>
<p>"No, no, no… Stop chasing me! That’s enough already!"</p>
<p>"Big Bro, I’m calling you Big Bro—can you stop chasing me?!"</p>
<p>Despite his running, Song Ren took a few hits from the werewolves, and the screen turned blood-red, signaling Ethan’s impending demise.</p>
<p>But Ethan—and by extension, Song Ren—refused to give up. He fully immersed himself in the protagonist’s role.</p>
<p>His daughter Rose was still missing, waiting for him!</p>
<p>How could he fall here?</p>
<p>This thought grew stronger—until an arrow struck Ethan’s thigh.</p>
<p>Amid his sprint, the sound of an arrow whistled through the air.</p>
<p><em>Thud!</em></p>
<p>The arrow embedded itself in Ethan’s leg.</p>
<p>With a cry of pain, Ethan collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p>The surrounding werewolves closed in, but a deafening roar interrupted them.</p>
<p>The White-Haired Lion King leaped down from the Rooftops, and the Regular werewolves immediately cleared a path—clearly, this was their leader.</p>
<p>The giant, lion-like figure loomed over Ethan, blocking out the light.</p>
<p>Just as the White-Haired Lion King reached Ethan, the distant sound of galloping hooves announced the arrival of two werewolves on horseback.</p>
<p>As Song Ren worried about Ethan’s fate, a bell tolled in the distance.</p>
<p>The White-Haired Lion King and the other werewolves turned toward the sound—then, without a second glance at Ethan, they sprinted toward the bell as if summoned.</p>
<p>At the very least, Ethan was spared.</p>
<p>He pulled the arrow from his thigh and bandaged the wound with a cloth.</p>
<p>As he staggered to his feet, he spotted a limping figure in the distance.</p>
<p>A person?!</p>
<p>In this cursed Village, there was still someone alive?!</p>
<p>And this wasn’t the location from the radio either!</p>
<p>Ethan hurriedly limped toward the figure.</p>
<p>"This is too brutal!"</p>
<p>"They’re not even treating Ethan like a human!"</p>
<p>"Is this the treatment a protagonist deserves? Which protagonist suffers as much as Ethan?!"</p>
<p>Song Ren couldn’t help but feel indignant on Ethan’s behalf.</p>
<p>Compared to other Nebula Games characters—even those who died—none had it as bad as Ethan.</p>
<p>And it hadn’t even been an hour yet!</p>
<p>His wife was dead, his child was missing, he’d lost two Fingers, and now he’d taken an arrow to the thigh. Who knew what horrors awaited him next?</p>
<p>(End of Chapter) &lt;<END_OF_CHAPTER>&gt;</p>
