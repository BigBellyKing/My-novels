                <h2>Chapter 414: Princess Zelda, Wait for Me, Link! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h2>
<p>After arriving at the quest location, Song Ren controlled Link to insert the Sheikah Slate into the mechanism.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the entire screen began to shake violently.</p>
<p>The earth and mountains started trembling intensely.</p>
<p>Even the Switch controller in Song Ren's hands provided feedback through HD Rumble.</p>
<p>The in-game camera pulled back into the distance amidst the violent tremors.</p>
<p>Birds in the forest flew away in fright, and squirrels foraging for food hid in fear.</p>
<p>Even the Bokoblins, monsters infected by dark forces, panicked and glanced around nervously.</p>
<p>As the surrounding hills of the RUINS exploded, a tall tower slowly rose, with Link standing on the platform at its summit.</p>
<p>This tower towered over the ruined RUINS, the snow-covered mountains, and eventually became the highest point on the Great Plateau, offering an unobstructed view of everything around.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t just one—similar towers across Hyrule rose simultaneously.</p>
<p>As the story cutscene ended, Link, who had fallen, got up and curiously surveyed his surroundings, while the camera zoomed out to showcase the entire landscape of the Great Plateau.</p>
<p>At the top of the screen, the stage introduction 'Great Plateau Tower' flashed briefly.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, as the tower's device activated, a droplet of blue liquid fell onto the center of the Sheikah Slate.</p>
<p>After successfully receiving the data transmission from the Great Plateau Tower, opening the Sheikah Slate’s map revealed a small portion of the large map now displayed—merely the tip of the iceberg of the entire game world.</p>
<p>Standing atop the tower, Song Ren couldn’t help but marvel.</p>
<p>Because it was breathtakingly beautiful. Up close, one might not fully appreciate its beauty, but from afar, the unique animated art style of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> unfolded before the player, delivering an extraordinary aesthetic.</p>
<p>The lush green fields and forests, the white clouds bathed in warm sunlight—it looked like a scene straight out of a dreamlike scroll painting.</p>
<p><em>'Remember... try to remember. You... have been asleep for 100 years.'</em></p>
<p><em>'Once the monsters regain their true power, the world will meet its end.'</em></p>
<p><em>'So, while there's still time, Link! You must hurry... hurry...'</em></p>
<p>While Song Ren was still marveling at the game’s beauty, Princess Zelda’s voice echoed in his ears again—though it sounded weak and strained.</p>
<p>From these lines, Song Ren pieced together the game’s story.</p>
<p>Just as online players had speculated, it was the classic tale of a hero rescuing a princess.</p>
<p>A powerful warrior’s return, saving the world, complete with an amnesia trope.</p>
<p>Truly, the protagonist lived up to the role—everything was perfectly in place. Now, all that remained was action.</p>
<p>And that was his forte!</p>
<p><em>"Rescuing a princess? Easy! Didn’t I already save Princess Peach from Bowser? Princess Zelda, right? Just wait for me, Link!"</em> Playing games was all about immersion, and Song Ren was fully embracing the drama, shouting inwardly.</p>
<p>Of course, since he was in a public café, he kept his excitement somewhat restrained.</p>
<p>Soon, the mysterious old man he had encountered earlier glided down from the sky on a paraglider.</p>
<p>After briefly explaining the game’s worldview to Link, he further confirmed Song Ren’s speculation.</p>
<p>A century ago, a calamity named Ganon suddenly descended upon Hyrule, destroying the kingdom.</p>
<p>For the past 100 years, Ganon’s power had lingered, swirling above Hyrule Castle.</p>
<p>To reach that calamity-enshrouded castle, Link would first have to leave the Great Plateau.</p>
<p>But the Great Plateau was an isolated island surrounded by sheer cliffs. Jumping down would mean certain death—unless one had a paraglider like the old man.</p>
<p>And to obtain the paraglider, Link would have to retrieve a treasure hidden inside a shrine for him.</p>
<p>Only then would he hand over the paraglider.</p>
<p>Looking at the quest he had just received, Song Ren couldn’t help but feel speechless.</p>
<p><em>"So the real scoundrel was right beside me all along! The world’s about to end, I’m the hero destined to defeat the great demon king and save the princess, and now you’re sending me on a treasure hunt?"</em> He grumbled inwardly, eyeing the quest from the mysterious old man and the nearby shrine glowing with a dark red light.</p>
<p>Still, he knew this was a common scenario in such games.</p>
<p>The better ones might later justify it as a trial for the hero—something like, <em>'Ah! Hero, you’ve earned my approval. The fate of the world and the princess rests in your hands!'</em></p>
<p>Having played <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> before, Song Ren didn’t feel too disappointed.</p>
<p>After all, <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>’s story wasn’t exactly groundbreaking either.</p>
<p>And paired with <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>’s animated art style, what would have been a clichéd plot in a realistic setting somehow felt unexpectedly fitting here.</p>
<p>Well, no choice—time to go treasure hunting.</p>
<p>Approaching the first shrine, he placed the Sheikah Slate into the circular mechanism and entered.</p>
<p>The nearest shrine was designed to teach Link—and the player—how to use the Magnesis power.</p>
<p>The Magnesis power was represented by a magnet icon.</p>
<p>Once activated, players could freely manipulate any metallic objects within range, moving them at will.</p>
<p>The shrine’s puzzles revolved around using this ability to progress—pulling iron blocks to push aside boulders, creating makeshift bridges with metal plates to cross gaps, or lifting heavy iron doors with Magnesis.</p>
<p><em>"This Magnesis power is pretty neat!"</em> Song Ren exclaimed, dragging a metal block back and forth.</p>
<p>In short, his reaction could be summed up as: <em>'Fun, right? Know how to use it? Never seen anything like this before?'</em></p>
<p>Well… he truly hadn’t.</p>
<p>Though he understood this was just a tutorial teaching him how to use the ability, he couldn’t help but feel excited for what lay ahead.</p>
<p>After playing around for over a minute, Song Ren finally focused on solving the shrine’s puzzles.</p>
<p>The first shrine wasn’t too difficult, and he soon cleared it, obtaining a Spirit Orb.</p>
<p>It also answered a question that had been bothering him.</p>
<p>The game did have a leveling system—but not through conventional monster fighting.</p>
<p>Instead, players had to complete shrines scattered across the map. Each cleared shrine granted a Spirit Orb, and collecting four allowed them to pray at a goddess statue to exchange for either increased health or stamina.</p>
<p>Exiting the shrine, the mysterious old man spoke to Link again, promising to give him the paraglider once he completed the remaining three shrines.</p>
<p><em>What a scoundrel!</em> Song Ren grumbled inwardly once more.</p>
