                <p>Chapter 174: Is There No Love Left? (Please subscribe, monthly pass)</p>
<p>Regarding Chen Xu's so-called game confession posted on the official Weibo account, players collectively declared that not a single word in those statements could be believed!</p>
<p>Although many media editors reposted it, players were not that naive. Even if a few players occasionally claimed to believe it and entered the game, a few minutes later, and then more than ten minutes later, accompanied by a very fitting BGM and the graceful posture of falling from a great height, they would all understand the true core of this game.</p>
<p>Life is suffering? Bullshit! Do you believe that?</p>
<p>However, despite this big hammer-swinging game directly breaking Nebula Games Platform's record for the lowest score, even receiving a failing score of 5.1, the game's download volume steadily climbed each day, and discussions among players about the game were equally abundant.</p>
<p>The main reason was that the game's popularity soared on live streaming platforms and video platforms. Many players, after being tormented, discovered that playing this game themselves was exceptionally painful. But watching others play it? That experience was a complete reversal.</p>
<p>Two words to describe it: pure joy!</p>
<p>Especially watching streamers play, reach a crucial point, and then suddenly fall from above, circling back to the very beginning. That made it even more delightful.</p>
<p>In live streams of this game, similar bullet comments were frequently seen:</p>
<p>‘Welcome home!’</p>
<p>‘Just starting over!’</p>
<p>‘Always play games with a smile.’</p>
<p>‘Where the dream begins.’</p>
<p>And countless streamers and video creators experienced this game with a mix of enjoyment and suffering.</p>
<p>As for the enjoyment, they found that when streaming this game, the streaming effect was indeed much better. Not only were the number of viewers and bullet comments higher than usual, but even the atmosphere was much more harmonious.</p>
<p>When playing other games, if a mistake was made, the bullet comments in the live stream room would become quite aggressive. Comments such as ‘Streamer is so bad,’ ‘You can die from this too?,’ or ‘Even letting a chick peck at rice scattered on the keyboard would be better than you’ were very common.</p>
<p>But when playing this game, if a mistake was made, the bullet comments in the live stream room were very unified. They were all gloating “hahahahas.”</p>
<p>After all, everyone was there to see you make mistakes. If you didn't fall, they wouldn't be happy!</p>
<p>The only difficult thing was that playing this game often led to high blood pressure. Their little hearts couldn't take it!</p>
<p>Blood pressure medication had become a staple in their homes.</p>
<p>On various video websites, one after another, gameplay footage of streamers having mental breakdowns was circulated. The expressions of utter despair on various streamers' faces after returning to the same starting point from different locations confirmed the tragic blows they suffered in this game.</p>
<p>Also spread through these channels, many new players, after hearing about the game's reputation, decided to try it out due to curiosity and other factors. After experiencing it, they became one of those who left self-deprecating remarks like ‘I'm an idiot’ in the comment section.</p>
<p>Some dedicated streamers even referenced Nebula Games' cauldron-like sofa and hammer at the exhibition, cosplaying as the Pot Man and playing the game using motion-sensing controls. It seemed to embody a spirit of finding joy in suffering, of enjoying the game.</p>
<p>Of course, most players and viewers simply thought another crazy player had emerged.</p>
<p>But it wasn't just completely crazy players; speedrun videos also appeared online. In the fastest video, one player cleared the game in just a little over 2 minutes, earning the adoration of countless people.</p>
<p>How skillfully was that hammer swung!</p>
<p>How many times must one have fallen from the trash mountain to become so proficient!</p>
<p>And was the game's progression originally so short?</p>
<p>Of course, for most ordinary players, watching was enough.</p>
<p>..................</p>
<p>While ‘Hammer Swing Ascension’ was rapidly gaining popularity among players, many designers in the gaming industry who paid attention to it expressed confusion.</p>
<p>“Who among you has followed Chen Xu’s game? It’s truly a bit unreasonable!”</p>
<p>“Yeah! There’s nothing to this game; the overall quality is very crude, but how did it become so popular?”</p>
<p>“Exactly. In the past, Chen Xu’s games were either excellent in plot, levels, or innovative in gameplay. But this game? It feels disappointing everywhere. The only good thing is probably the BGM that plays when you fall?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I can’t figure it out either. Its popularity is even comparable to our previous It Takes Two.”</p>
<p>“This is uncanny, what’s going on with this cursed game?”</p>
<p>“I played for ten minutes and was already deterred. I completely don’t understand what’s fun about this game!”</p>
<p>“You’ve got the wrong idea. The actual playtime of this game is very low. It’s more about players trying something new and the popularity spread through live streaming and videos. However, for a small-scale, low-cost game, whether it’s a low-priced buy-to-play or free advertising, if it can achieve half, or even one-third, of this game’s popularity, it’s considered a success.”</p>
<p>Many game designers were discussing in the forum, but some also saw the insights within. One could say that the big hammer-swinging game type is a standard streamer game. A so-called streamer game refers to a game that looks very engaging to watch.</p>
<p>From a certain perspective, It Takes Two, Dark Souls, and Outlast are also considered streamer games. But the difference is that these games have an essential core gameplay. The so-called watchability is merely incidental.</p>
<p>The content of the game itself is enough to captivate players.</p>
<p>But the big hammer-swinging game is different. The original intention behind creating the game was for the original author to see players suffering in it and then feel happy themselves.</p>
<p>Suffering is the core of this game.</p>
<p>This also leads to this type of game being much more interesting to watch others play than to play oneself.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's not oneself who is suffering.</p>
<p>Precisely because of this, its popularity on live streaming platforms grew higher and higher. After all, players playing it themselves certainly couldn't persist.</p>
<p>But streamers are different. Audiences like to watch, and streamers, to create a good show effect, will still play even if their consciousness is blurred from being tormented and their blood pressure rises.</p>
<p>With both factors combined, this seemingly very simple game directly became a trending hit game.</p>
<p>And naturally, as more people watched, some players wanted to experience it themselves. Of course, the fate of these players was also sealed.</p>
<p>In Nebula Games' office, Chen Xu was analyzing the characteristics of this unique game for Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, and others.</p>
<p>“So, Mr. Chen, what you said on the official Weibo account before was indeed all false!” Ruan Ningxue’s focus was completely not on the game.</p>
<p>“Exactly, exactly, Mr. Chen, you really just wanted to see players suffer!” Yang Xin also widened her eyes, looking at Chen Xu.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, so the Warrior of Love has no love left?” Qin Yi couldn’t help but make a jab.</p>
<p>“Alright, everyone, quickly return to your posts. The progress of Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame needs to speed up! Our lovely players are still waiting for us!” Chen Xu coughed twice, changing the subject.</p>
<p>Watching everyone return to their posts, Chen Xu stretched.</p>
<p>The Warrior of Love and all that didn't matter anymore, because the players' misunderstandings and prejudices were growing deeper and deeper!</p>
<p>Whatever he said, they wouldn't believe it, and that really hurt him!</p>
<p>Shaking his head, sighing internally with emotion, Chen Xu confirmed some plans for the overseas version of Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame with Target Software.</p>
<p>With two months remaining until the launch date, based on the current progress, it was absolutely not a problem.</p>
<p>However, the in-game translation and the prior negotiations for relevant promotion channels still needed to be confirmed with Target Software.</p>
