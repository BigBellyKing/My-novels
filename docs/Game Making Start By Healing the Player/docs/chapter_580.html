                <p>Chapter 579: 'Ordinary Citizen' Ethan Winters (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Regarding his impression of Chris, Song Ren had always felt he was a very central character, especially judging by the information revealed in the previous installment's 'Not a Hero' DLC.</p>
<p>Chris had accomplished many incredible things, his life story was brilliantly spectacular, almost like he was cheating. If there was one flaw, it was that his teammates seemed a bit unlucky. Moreover, when Ethan woke up, Chris was nowhere to be found at the scene, so Song Ren wondered if Chris would also appear as a DLC character in Resident Evil Village, but he never expected to encounter Chris directly here.</p>
<p>However, seeing Ethan at this moment, Chris also appeared very angry.</p>
<p>“I told you to stay out of this! Ethan! You're in the way!”</p>
<p>Chris looked at Ethan, who he had knocked to the ground, and said with a frown. With practiced hands, he skillfully removed the pistol magazine he had just grabbed.</p>
<p>You damn well say I'm in the way!? Hearing Chris's words, Song Ren immediately couldn't hold back. Boss! Where the hell were you when I was fighting vampires in the ancient castle, battling the Puppeteer in the mansion, blowing up fish in the fishing village, and having a three-hundred-round war with the Fan Monster in the factory?!</p>
<p>Ethan in the game reacted the same way, instantly flaring up upon hearing Chris's words.</p>
<p>“What good can you do, Chris?”</p>
<p>“You killed my wife! You son of a bitch!”</p>
<p>Looking at Chris, who had his back turned, Ethan cursed angrily, seemingly wanting to vent all the negative emotions from the past two days.</p>
<p>“You think I killed Mia? That wasn’t her!” Chris was silent for a second or two, then turned to look at Ethan. “That was Miranda.”</p>
<p>Hearing Chris's words, Song Ren also clicked his tongue. It was just as he had suspected! This whole affair was a huge conspiracy; the real Mia had vanished at some unknown point, and then Miranda had replaced her, disguising herself as Mia and lurking by Ethan’s side.</p>
<p>At this moment, Ethan also appeared extremely shocked, as if he couldn't believe what his ears had heard: “Wh-what…”</p>
<p>“She’s a bioweapon; she changed her appearance to impersonate Mia. It seems firearms can’t kill her, so I’m here to finish her.” Chris slowly turned on the lights in the factory; a modified combat vehicle was parked in front of him. “Bullshit! Then why didn’t you tell me directly!” Combining with the intelligence gathered along the way, Ethan actually believed it somewhat by this point, but he still couldn't accept the reality. “Because I knew you’d interfere!” Chris was also getting annoyed. “This situation is already troublesome enough; we don’t need ordinary citizens getting involved!”</p>
<p>Hearing Chris’s words, Song Ren in the game fell into a dead silence. He lowered his head, looked at his left hand missing two fingers, then glanced at his right hand, which had been 'hot-plugged,' and also at his abdomen, which had been pierced by rebar, his thigh, which had been perforated by arrows, and the four joints that had been hooked. Goddamn 'ordinary citizen'! Of the Four Heavenly Kings, he had already eliminated three, and the werewolf monsters he had killed were countless. In the entire village, look at those houses that had turned from red to blue—which one hadn't he looted?</p>
<p>After speaking, Chris in the game seemed to realize he had said something wrong, silently turning his head to face away from Ethan again.</p>
<p>“Then why us? What exactly is going on?” Ethan still couldn’t understand; after all, in his eyes, both he and Mia were just ordinary, honest people.</p>
<p>“Alright… Ethan… alright. Maybe I owe you an explanation. Give me that wrench.” Chris took a deep breath.</p>
<p>Taking the wrench from Ethan, Chris explained the situation while repairing the combat vehicle. “Long story short, Miranda is a crazy old woman, and this village, along with all sorts of deformed monsters, are all her… lifelong research achievements.” “It's a very insane mold experiment.”</p>
<p>Hearing Chris's words, Ethan frowned: “Mold? Like in Louisiana?” “Damn it, all this time I thought I could save my family, and now I can't even escape… who else can I save?”</p>
<p>In that instant, Ethan recalled his experience from three years ago and became somewhat despondent.</p>
<p>“Not quite. Take a look at this…” Chris said, tossing a phone to Ethan.</p>
<p>Ethan looked down to see a woman with six black wings: Miranda.</p>
<p>“My people sent it to me a few minutes ago… keep watching.”</p>
<p>Listening to Chris, Ethan swiped backwards.</p>
<p>He saw Miranda in a scene resembling a graveyard, with four bottles containing Rose placed on an altar in the center. This was clearly the ritual Miranda intended to perform.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Ethan immediately panicked: “Rose! No, I have to stop her quickly!” “Calm down, my people are monitoring the area!” Chris called out to Ethan. “But they took my child!” “You don’t understand, what can you do alone besides die?”</p>
<p>Saying this, Chris pulled a button on the combat vehicle. BOOM! A cannon shell directly blew up the large iron gate.</p>
<p>“I’m going to stay here and set up a bomb; you take this thing to the elevator, and we’ll meet up later.” “I promise, I’ll rescue your daughter.” “Definitely!”</p>
<p>Chris returned the pistol to Ethan, saying with a determined expression.</p>
<p>Ethan took the pistol and chambered a round: “I’ll definitely kill Miranda then!” “I’m leaving this to you.” Chris turned and left.</p>
<p>Watching Chris’s retreating figure, Song Ren couldn’t help but click his tongue. Why did he feel like Chris was the one acting like a protagonist? Why could he be so calm and composed, so cool, in such a terrifying operation?</p>
<p>However, after a brief moment of reflection, Song Ren was immediately captivated by the combat vehicle in front of him. He had originally thought it was just something used in cutscenes. But what he never expected was to find actual interactive buttons, and he really sat inside it. And he could shoot! Moreover, there was a symbol behind the bullets and cannon shells: ∞. Infinite ammo! What the heck was this! Was this content he could experience without spending extra money?</p>
<p>Chainsaws, machine guns, cannon shells—it had everything! This was way more satisfying than a damn infinite ammo cheat, alright?</p>
<p>“Damn it, if I could have driven this tank against the first three Heavenly Kings, I would've scattered their ashes!”</p>
<p>With an excited mood, Song Ren drove the tank into the elevator and arrived at a massive square.</p>
<p>Heisenberg, in his complete robot form, descended from the sky.</p>
<p>“You son of a bitch! You’re like an unkillable cockroach! Do you think you can beat me?” “Fine, consider it a warm-up before I deal with that bitch!”</p>
<p>As the words fell, the battle officially began.</p>
<p>With infinite firepower and infinite cannon shells, Song Ren immediately got hyped.</p>
