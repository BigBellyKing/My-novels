                <p>Chapter 187: Mr. Chen's Miscalculation? (7th Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Souls series players are all extremely hardcore.</p>
<p>While the majority of regular players might have just finished their bell-ringing journey and begun a new journey of suffering,</p>
<p>for some hardcore players and veteran high-level players, many have already cleared the game on their first playthrough.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, dedicated players have already drawn out detailed maps of various scenes from <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em> online.</p>
<p>Additionally, through extensive exploration and research, players have discovered several strategies that allow rookies to achieve Musou (unstoppable rampage) status even in their first playthrough.</p>
<p>This is real grass-mowing Musou—not the joke kind where monsters mow down players.</p>
<p>One of the simplest methods involves going to the Wyvern Bridge. Early on, purchase the necessary Bow and Arrows from the Undead Burg Outskirts,</p>
<p>then slowly shoot at the wyvern's tail on Wyvern Bridge. After twenty to thirty shots, you can sever its tail and obtain the Drake Sword.</p>
<p>Although it's just an early-game weapon, wielding the Drake Sword in the Undead Burg Outskirts makes the Undead the coolest kid around.</p>
<p>A slightly more skill-intensive method involves mastering parkour, heading straight to the Catacombs, signing a covenant with the Gravelord, and obtaining the Gravelord Sword.</p>
<p>This method is quite simple—just master traversing the map and avoid getting killed by enemies along the way.</p>
<p>The only tricky part, which also relies somewhat on luck, is a giant headless Wedge Demon lurking in the tunnel.</p>
<p>Not only must you dodge its attacks, but you also need to hide inside a nearby stone coffin and hope for luck.</p>
<p>There's a chance the Wedge Demon will spot you and execute you.</p>
<p>But if you stay inside the coffin for about half a minute, you'll appear directly before the Gravelord and can sign the covenant.</p>
<p>Compared to the starting weapon with base attack power under 100, the Gravelord Sword boasts over 300 base attack power. Once obtained, as long as you're careful in the early game, you can rampage through enemies with ease—delivering an extremely enjoyable player experience.</p>
<p>Moreover, in Darkroot Garden, there's a mighty Black Knight wielding a Guandao.</p>
<p>Lure him near a cliff and act like a despicable Undead by exploiting the terrain, and you might obtain the Black Knight Halberd—the so-called Guandao.</p>
<p>Just like the Gravelord Sword, once you get the Guandao, the entire game becomes significantly easier.</p>
<p>However, compared to the Gravelord Sword, the Guandao demands slightly higher requirements from players.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can attempt to kill the Black Knight and hope he drops the Black Knight Sword, though this requires both skill and a bit of luck.</p>
<p>Although in high New Game+ playthroughs, weapons like the Gravelord Sword become underperforming when upgraded, and the Guandao is merely serviceable,</p>
<p>in the first playthrough, they feel incredibly powerful—truly letting players experience how effortlessly enjoyable a game can be.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous installment, where the infamous cheese method against the second boss, the Dancer, was notoriously frustrating, this new work, while significantly more punishing in normal playthroughs, offers extremely satisfying exploits through specific strategies!</p>
<p>With various veteran players releasing strategy guide videos, the online community is ecstatic.</p>
<p>Sure, in subsequent high New Game+ runs they’ll inevitably have to endure hardship and face all the challenges they previously cheesed through—but who cares?</p>
<p>Right now, they’re having a blast!</p>
<p>"Haha, Chen Xu never saw this coming!"</p>
<p>"Hehe, suffering? Not happening! Musou is just too satisfying!"</p>
<p>"+1, this Guandao is insane! Chopping down bosses in just a few hits!"</p>
<p>"Everyone, hurry up and enjoy it! Who knows, Chen Xu might patch these exploits in a future update!"</p>
<p>"Exactly, exactly—hurry up and enjoy it!"</p>
<p>Online, the 'Undead' were laughing with delight.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>At Nebula Games' experience store, in the rest area, Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin were playing <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em>.</p>
<p>One of them, wielding the newly acquired Gravelord Sword, was mowing down enemies in the Undead Burg, while the other was still trying to figure out how to obtain the Guandao.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, should we fix this?" Qin Yi asked, sitting beside Chen Xu.</p>
<p>"Why fix it? This is part of the game design," Chen Xu replied with a smile.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Qin Yi wore a look of surprise.</p>
<p>Something felt off!</p>
<p>Given the extremely cruel settings implemented during the development of <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em>,</p>
<p>how could Chen Xu remain indifferent when players were now effortlessly dominating?</p>
<p>"What's that look for? I genuinely care about players—I just don't say it out loud. In the previous game, players complained it was too hard to continue, some even resorted to using trainers. In this installment, I've maintained the regular high difficulty for standard playthroughs, but also provided these cheese methods. It's all for the players—it's my love!" Chen Xu sighed with emotion.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Qin Yi was left speechless. Meanwhile, Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin, who were playing nearby, couldn't help but roll their eyes.</p>
<p>They didn't believe him for a second.</p>
<p>Seeing everyone's reactions, Chen Xu helplessly shrugged.</p>
<p>Trust between people is getting thinner and thinner!</p>
<p>"By the way, Qin Yi, take a look at this. This afternoon, have the project team start working on the new mode. Tomorrow, you and I will head over to Galaxy Smart Tech to learn about the latest AI parameters and settings, so we can align the new mode accordingly." Chen Xu handed Qin Yi a document of design concept drafts.</p>
<p>Taken aback, Qin Yi took the document from Chen Xu.</p>
<p>But the moment he saw the first four words on the cover, his hand trembled.</p>
<p>'Death Mode!'</p>
<p>An ominous feeling surged from deep within.</p>
<p>He glanced further down, scanning the content and a few keywords listed in the directory.</p>
<p>【Gods and Lords of Cinder in their Prime】</p>
<p>【First Playthrough Completed Players Unlock Challenge】</p>
<p>Qin Yi hadn't read the rest, but just seeing these two core points, he understood.</p>
<p>The visit to Galaxy Smart Tech must be related to the AI Technology-Applied Game.</p>
<p>And 'Gods and Lords of Cinder in their Prime'? Qin Yi recalled the game's setting.</p>
<p>In the current game, the final boss the player faces is Lord Gwyn, the Lord of Cinder—already burned into an empty shell, fighting purely by instinct, completely unable to use his signature move, Sunlight Spear.</p>
<p>From a narrative standpoint, this was meant to showcase Gwyn's weakness and the spirit of willingly linking the fire and burning into an empty shell.</p>
<p>But from a gameplay perspective, Gwyn is indeed weaker compared to other bosses—especially since his attacks can be parried.</p>
<p>But now???</p>
<p>An unparryable Gwyn? One who <em>can</em> use the Sunlight Spear?</p>
<p>The most critical point? A core aspect: 'Death Mode' unlocks for first playthrough players!</p>
<p>Although he hadn't believed a word Chen Xu said earlier, Qin Yi never imagined this was the trap waiting for players all along!</p>
<p>After reading through the entire document, Qin Yi opened the game forum and saw players still flooding攻略 videos and posts with comments like 'Chen Xu's Miscalculation,' 'Chen Xu's Mercy,' and 'Hurry up and enjoy it,' leaving him with profound感慨.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen will always be Mr. Chen!</p>
