<p>Chapter 270: Game Crossover Warm-Up (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Days passed one after another, and Chen Xu’s development of Warcraft continued steadily.</p>
<p>Art assets were being produced continuously.</p>
<p>Likewise, related data and the overall game structure were being refined bit by bit.</p>
<p>For players of Monster Hunter: World, the New World was no longer unfamiliar.</p>
<p>And of course, the Palico’s stretcher cart had also become very familiar.</p>
<p>Previously, Chen Xu had showcased the Light Bowgun’s shrapnel playstyle and the Gunlance’s shield-holding playstyle through live streams.</p>
<p>A shield, a cannon—solo hunts were no longer difficult.</p>
<p>Facing the Pink Rathian? Two words: simple.</p>
<p>Facing Uragaan? Two words: easy.</p>
<p>Even against Nergigante, only two words: acceptable.</p>
<p>There was absolutely no pressure in clearing the game!</p>
<p>After all, weren’t these cheese playstyles specifically designed for ordinary players?</p>
<p>But when these players faced Tempered monsters, the experience was completely different.</p>
<p>Holding your shield and firing your cannon?</p>
<p>Who do you think you are?</p>
<p>Still expecting the monster to play turn-based with you?</p>
<p>Under the high-efficiency AI performance, these players were instantly taught a harsh lesson.</p>
<p>The forum was once again filled with wails.</p>
<p>"Monster Hunter in MH:W has turned into a verb again!"</p>
<p>"Damn it, the Tempered monsters hit way too hard and their AI is insane. How the hell are we supposed to fight?"</p>
<p>Of course, players saying this were mostly those who had cheese-routed their way through earlier content.</p>
<p>They were completely unfamiliar with the monsters’ movesets.</p>
<p>For ordinary players, however, with Rocksteady Mantle and Impact Resistant Jewel, teaming up to grind monsters became vastly more efficient.</p>
<p>Especially for veteran players with high skill—they turned monsters like Nergigante into units of combat prowess.</p>
<p>It wasn’t about who could clear the quest, but who could kill Nergigante the fastest.</p>
<p>The once majestic and imposing Nergigante had become as pitiful as Meimeizi.</p>
<p>In fact, because so many online players felt Nergigante was too pitiful, numerous fan-made illustrations of a feminized, helpless Nergigante popped up.</p>
<p>Instantly, this monster skyrocketed to become the most popular creature in Monster Hunter: World.</p>
<p>But for ordinary players, it was still clearly difficult.</p>
<p>"Old Song! You’re really doing constant flip-flopping again! Switching back from Gunlance to Long Sword? Weren’t you the one saying you had no idea what Long Sword was?"</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, who had just suffered three consecutive cartings and failed the quest, said to Song Ren in the team.</p>
<p>"Ahem, Long Sword is a lifelong faith. I merely abandoned it temporarily. Now I’ve reclaimed my faith—just like the protagonist in an anime, who had a brief moment of confusion but ultimately rediscovered his conviction," Song Ren began spouting nonsense.</p>
<p>"Huh, why is the game updating?" Midway through his boasting, Song Ren suddenly noticed something—a warning that his version was outdated. Clearly, a new update had just launched.</p>
<p>"Same here. Hey, Old Song, look! There’s a new event! New cosmetic weapons added: Frostmourne (Great Sword), Warglaives of Azzinoth (Dual Blades), Flametongue Blade Sulfuras (Long Sword), Hammer of the Lightbringer (Sledge), Elune's Longbow (Bow and Arrows)..." Zhang Yi, who had just exited the game, saw the Nebula Games Platform update.</p>
<p>"Damn it, that’s kinda cool! And there are two new hunting quests: ‘The Power of Evil: Frost Dragon’ and ‘Chimera from Ashenvale’. But these two don’t really feel like Monster Hunter: World monsters, do they? And what the hell is Azeroth in the description?" Song Ren was also confused by the descriptions.</p>
<p>"Who cares! Let’s just jump into the game and check it out first!" Zhang Yi was also full of questions. He had a hunch that this Monster Hunter: World update was unusual, but regardless, the first step was to enter the game and see for himself.</p>
<p>While chatting nonsense with Song Ren in the voice channel, Zhang Yi re-entered the game.</p>
<p>Soon, he noticed a giant exclamation mark above the Commander-in-Chief’s head.</p>
<p>"You’re here. Something strange has been happening lately. A mysterious force has appeared in the Coral Highlands—frost as lifeless as dead silence..."</p>
<p>"And nearby, countless corpse-like monsters have emerged..."</p>
<p>"You want to investigate alone? Fine. If that’s your choice..."</p>
<p>Zhang Yi sighed emotionally at the Commander-in-Chief’s dialogue.</p>
<p>Investigate alone?</p>
<p>Not me. Never said that. You’re just talking to yourself here, you know?</p>
<p>But he was used to it.</p>
<p>When he first arrived in this New World, he thought the Hunters in Astera Settlement were all friendly teammates.</p>
<p>But reality was cruel.</p>
<p>He suspected the receptionist was actually a Deviljho cub—otherwise, how could someone sit on a Deviljho’s back for so long? Plus, all they ever did was eat.</p>
<p>The Big Bro from the First Fleet was super enthusiastic, but never left the third-floor dining area.</p>
<p>The Field Team Leader looked like the Golden-Maned Lion King—definitely seemed powerful—but during the Nergigante and final Xeno'jiiva hunts, he was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>The Swordmaster was indeed cool, but only showed up once during the Zorah Magdaros capture quest.</p>
<p>As for the rest?</p>
<p>Just a bunch of useless eaters of food and drink.</p>
<p>They called him the White Wind of the New World, the Azure Star guiding the way, but in reality, they were just taking advantage of him being mute—dumping every dirty and exhausting task on him.</p>
<p>Sighing, Zhang Yi accepted a quest from the Commander-in-Chief to investigate the anomaly in the Coral Highlands. Then, under the so-called "companionate" farewell from the "Deviljho cub," he set off once more with his ever-loyal Palico.</p>
<p>"This is a brand-new monster! Kinda ugly!" Upon entering the Coral Highlands, Zhang Yi quickly noticed something different.</p>
<p>The ground was covered in thick frost, and approaching it applied a DEBUFF that slowly drained stamina. The usual Wingdrake mobs along the path had been replaced by rotting, dog-like corpse monsters.</p>
<p>Ghoul—that was the name Zhang Yi got after killing one.</p>
<p>Pushing deeper, he finally reached the highest point of the Coral Highlands and laid eyes on his target.</p>
<p>A massive Bone Dragon, its body covered in blue light: Frost Dragon.</p>
<p>"Damn it, this actually looks kinda awesome!"</p>
<p>As Zhang Yi exclaimed in awe, the Frost Dragon clearly sensed his presence as an intruder. It flapped its skeletal wings and actually took flight. Then, a breath of icy frost erupted from the dragon’s mouth.</p>
<p>……………</p>
<p>Zhang Yi and other Monster Hunter players were astonished by the new event—Chimera, Frost Dragon, and cosmetic weapon skins.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, players of Minecraft were equally shocked.</p>
<p>In the official showcase server, many players suddenly discovered a new structure had appeared.</p>
<p>Since Minecraft’s launch, more and more spectacular builds had been recreated by players.</p>
<p>Locations like Irithyll of the Boreal Valley and Lothric Capital—grand structures that Nebula Games hadn’t yet added to the Minecraft display server—had already been constructed by players, leaving everyone amazed.</p>
<p>The showcase server mainly displayed official Nebula Games creations.</p>
<p>However, this function was mostly for initial player guidance, so afterward only a dedicated operations team maintained it.</p>
<p>Their efficiency naturally couldn’t match that of passionate players. To date, only two new building complexes had been added to the official Minecraft server.</p>
<p>One was Astera Settlement from Monster Hunter: World, and the other was the toy castle from It Takes Two.</p>
<p>But now, many players suddenly noticed that a new building complex had appeared in the official Minecraft showcase server.</p>
<p>A magnificent human city-state.</p>
<p>Named: Lordaeron.</p>
<p>Symmetrical building complexes, densely packed yet clearly layered.</p>
<p>At the center stood a massive arched castle. Behind the city gate ran a long water channel, accessible only via a suspension bridge leading to the central castle hall.</p>
<p>In front of the castle stood a giant bell tower, flying the banner of Lordaeron with its distinctive emblem: the Twin Single-Headed Eagle Crest and a lion.</p>
<p>At first glance, it felt nothing short of grand.</p>
