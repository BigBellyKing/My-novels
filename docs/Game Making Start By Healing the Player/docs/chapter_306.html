                <p>Chapter 305: Negotiations Break Down, Prepare for Assault! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Under the setting sun, in a cemetery filled with tombstones, a middle-aged man rose from an unmarked grave.</p>
<p>"I never thought it would happen so fast. A gunman, a single bullet, straight to the head."</p>
<p>He stood up and walked forward.</p>
<p>"This... I planted a breaching charge, and a life was just gone."</p>
<p>"It was me... I made a mistake only a rookie would make."</p>
<p>The camera cut closer, and only then did players realize the photo on the tombstone was of the man himself.</p>
<p>"They hid a trap by the window; remember to double-check before entering!"</p>
<p>The camera zoomed in, and the person on the tombstone was still him.</p>
<p>"Use your rope well. Don't think you're a superman; falling from the second floor... sometimes it's just that sudden!"</p>
<p>"Foolish, still foolish... always foolish."</p>
<p>The middle-aged man took a deep breath and continued walking forward.</p>
<p>All the tombstones along the way bore his photo.</p>
<p>At this point, viewers of the video suddenly understood.</p>
<p>Clearly, this wasn't some convoluted story about reincarnation.</p>
<p>Instead, it symbolized the man's actions as a player in the game.</p>
<p>"A gunman was ambushed there; by the time I noticed him... it was too late!"</p>
<p>"Killed by a knife from behind, a vertical breaching charge... this one, I stepped directly on a Claymore when rushing out of the building. Being bold is good, but don't be greedy."</p>
<p>"I remember every cause of my death, every foolish mistake I made, and every misjudgment of the situation!"</p>
<p>"But I guarantee, today, it will absolutely not be me who falls in battle!"</p>
<p>As his words faded, the camera zoomed in on the man's face, and the screen plunged into darkness the next moment.</p>
<p>Only his narration remained.</p>
<p>"Are you ready? Initiate the meticulous assault plan."</p>
<p>The next moment, the scene switched to the interior of a bank. In the center of the lobby, a group of hostages were bound and gagged, their faces filled with panic. Simultaneously, in an office on the first floor, a group of terrorist personnel were planting a bomb.</p>
<p>Beside them, countless other White Masks were sealing off critical passages with roll-down wooden panels.</p>
<p>Some White Mask terrorists held shields, guarding various key routes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the camera moved outside.</p>
<p>Elite special forces personnel from various countries stood ready for battle—the Rainbow Team.</p>
<p>"Yes, it's them again."</p>
<p>"We cannot let the bomb explode!"</p>
<p>"But they refuse to negotiate!"</p>
<p>"The safety of all hostages rests solely with you all!"</p>
<p>A middle-aged officer looked at the fully armed Rainbow Team, took a deep breath, closed his eyes, then opened them and said with a resolute tone: "Now..."</p>
<p>"Negotiations have broken down, prepare for assault!"</p>
<p>As his words fell,</p>
<p>The assault officially began.</p>
<p>All squad members had been standing by in their respective areas, ready for action.</p>
<p>In the distance, Glaz was already in position, his sniper rifle set up, calmly covering all possible terrorist locations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, operators like Ying, Blitz, Montagne, Thermite, Ash, and Pulse split into two groups and assembled.</p>
<p>One group launched an attack from the first floor, while the other ascended to the bank's roof via ropes, preparing to assault simultaneously with the first floor team.</p>
<p>At this moment, the screen switched back to the initial location, where two drones had slipped through the door crack into the bank, transmitting internal information.</p>
<p>A notification sound came through all squad members' voice comms.</p>
<p>"One terrorist at the main bank entrance counter, two terrorists to the left of the entrance, hostages have been moved to the second floor."</p>
<p>Facing the tightly sealed bank door, everyone exchanged glances. The next moment, Thermite stepped forward.</p>
<p>Then the scene moved indoors.</p>
<p>On the steel bank door, a crimson spark appeared, and this trail of sparks moved with remarkable regularity.</p>
<p>It was as if someone was cutting open the door with a welding torch, only much faster.</p>
<p>Before the White Mask terrorists could fully comprehend what was happening, an astonishing boom erupted the next moment.</p>
<p>"Boom!"</p>
<p>A cloud of black smoke rose, and then flashbang-like fragments shot through the smoke, landing in the center of the lobby, emitting an intense light.</p>
<p>Instantly, everyone was plunged into temporary deafness and blindness. At this moment, all the White Mask terrorists frantically fired their weapons towards where they remembered the bank entrance to be.</p>
<p>"Clang, clang, clang, clang..." A series of metallic impacts. As the smoke cleared, Montagne was seen leading the charge with his Greatshield, all bullets striking the shield without causing any effective damage.</p>
<p>Ying, Thermite, and Ash, who followed him in, seized the opportunity to pick off the White Masks in the lobby one by one.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the scene instantly switched to the second floor.</p>
<p>Via rope, Blackbeard, wearing sunglasses and a beard, coolly attached a bulletproof shield to his weapon and slowly descended to a window on the second floor that was sealed with wooden planks.</p>
<p>On the roof, Pulse looked at the Heartbeat Sensor in his hand, which showed two red dots.</p>
<p>He took out a Remote Charge, placed it above, then retreated to the side.</p>
<p>The next moment, the bomb detonated with a boom, blowing a hole in the roof. The instant the explosion occurred, Blackbeard burst through the window, his MK17 CQB, equipped with a bulletproof shield, quickly eliminating the two distracted White Masks.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Pulse and Blitz, who had jumped down from the roof, quickly secured the second floor.</p>
<p>The first and second floors were completely cleared, and the bomb had been defused. All that remained was the hostage room.</p>
<p>The two squads converged. Facing the wooden door sealing the hostage room, Ash took out her grenade launcher and fired a breaching round at the planks.</p>
<p>After about a one-second delay, there was a loud boom.</p>
<p>The breaching round exploded, and smoke filled the air.</p>
<p>At this moment, Blitz, shield in hand, was the first to rush in, pressing the charge button on his shield with a slight force.</p>
<p>Sizzle... <em>snap!</em></p>
<p>A flash of white light erupted from the shield, illuminating the entire room as if it were daytime.</p>
<p>The sudden blinding flash caused the White Masks guarding the hostages to scream and fall into temporary blindness, their weapons instinctively firing wildly in the direction of the squad.</p>
<p>However, countless bullets were all blocked by the shield, though as bullets struck Blitz's shield,</p>
<p>Cracks clearly appeared on the bulletproof glass visor.</p>
<p>Despite this, Blitz remained unfazed. Seizing the moment, he raised his right hand.</p>
<p>The P12 Pistol, a product of precise German engineering, fired each bullet accurately through the heads of the White Mask terrorists.</p>
<p>Seeing the still-shaken hostages, Ash and Ying stepped forward to free them.</p>
<p>The next moment, the camera panned across the face of each squad member.</p>
<p>Finally, the screen gradually faded to black.</p>
<p>Ying's voice echoed in the comms channel.</p>
<p>"Assault complete."</p>
<p>The game title appeared in the center.</p>
