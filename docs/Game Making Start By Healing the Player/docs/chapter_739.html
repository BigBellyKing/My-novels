                <p>Chapter 738: Where Did This Child Come From? Was He a Gift from a Mini-Game? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>This short video, less than 30 seconds long, immediately sparked heated discussion among countless players.</p>
<p>After all, though the video was short, the content it revealed was simply too abundant and too explosive.</p>
<p>First and foremost was Kratos in the game, which was officially confirmed to be alive, and a sequel was also on its way.</p>
<p>For players who love <em>God of War</em>, this was undoubtedly an exceptionally pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>Another point was that the Kratos in the video was no longer the Kratos of his youth, but an aging Kratos entering middle to old age.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with the Olympian gods in Greek mythology essentially wiped out, the setting of the new game also made many players curious about Kratos's current whereabouts.</p>
<p>At the same time, Kratos's appearance also astonished players.</p>
<p>What kind of character was this?</p>
<p>Whether they had played the game or only learned about it through videos, they all shared a common understanding: this Spartan strongman was a maniacal character.</p>
<p>Even before becoming the God of War, while still serving the Olympian gods, Kratos was always in an incredibly frenzied state.</p>
<p>And after the second installment, once Kratos was ambushed by Zeus, he completely transformed into an enraged machine of vengeance.</p>
<p>Slaughter was the eternal theme, and the endless aesthetic of violence caused players' adrenaline to surge.</p>
<p>Kratos at that time could be described as fearless, a being who would slay gods if they stood in his way, and buddhas if they did.</p>
<p>But what about now?</p>
<p>In this video, Kratos's gaze appeared remarkably calm, and his face had aged considerably.</p>
<p>As for whether gods had age limits, no one could say for sure.</p>
<p>Yet, the only undeniable point was that Kratos had aged, at least judging by his appearance in the video.</p>
<p>With such a setting, what kind of story would this <em>God of War</em> sequel ultimately present to players? Furthermore, judging from this video, Nebula Games clearly had a deliberate plan.</p>
<p>It wasn't merely a case of seeing good sales for the <em>God of War</em> trilogy and then scheduling a fourth installment.</p>
<p>If that was the case, why wasn't this sequel released in the same manner as the previous trilogy?</p>
<p>Many players looked bewildered.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the video was enough to excite and captivate players, and that was sufficient.</p>
<p>Although <em>God of War</em> was a brand new IP, its trilogy's epic narrative and content that pushed the aesthetic of violence to its extreme forced players to admit that it was truly exhilarating to play.</p>
<p>Even though the content of this <em>God of War</em> sequel had not yet been announced, its timing, content, and everything else remained a mystery.</p>
<p>Yet, many players had already declared, “Buy, buy, buy! Not buying it makes you inhuman!”</p>
<p>Kratos alone was enough, and they also believed that with the foundation of the first three installments, the quality of this new entry was guaranteed.</p>
<p>Of course, some players expressed doubts, as even though it was just Kratos shown in a mere 30 seconds, the style felt completely different.</p>
<p>In reality, although this was also <em>God of War</em>, and Kratos was still the protagonist,</p>
<p>this sequel was completely different from the previous trilogy.</p>
<p>The game projects were developed simultaneously, but their core concepts differed.</p>
<p>It wasn't merely that the game's setting shifted from Greece to Norse mythology; more crucially, the gameplay and content also changed.</p>
<p>The previous <em>God of War</em> leaned more towards platforming and actions, while the <em>God of War</em> set in Norse mythology leaned towards RPG, aiming to tell players a better story.</p>
<p>Of course, this didn't mean that <em>God of War</em>'s action depth was gone.</p>
<p>That's why Chen Xu only started promoting this game after the trilogy was released, when players were debating the ending of <em>God of War III</em>.</p>
<p>At the same time, Chen Xu didn't use “God of War 4” as a suffix for this new <em>God of War</em>; it was simply titled <em>God of War</em>.</p>
<p>After the game's title was announced, players also looked perplexed, rubbing their eyes and wondering if they had misread it.</p>
<p>“What's the meaning of this? Isn't it <em>God of War IV</em>? Why is it called <em>New God of War</em>?”</p>
<p>“Could it be that it's no longer Kratos's story? Is Kratos just making a cameo in this <em>God of War</em>, just a minor role?”</p>
<p>“It's not impossible. After all, Kratos's story has been told, and most of the Greek gods have been killed.”</p>
<p>“So, has the game's style changed too?”</p>
<p>Not only players but also many industry designers were somewhat surprised by <em>New God of War</em>.</p>
<p>After all, the success of the previous <em>God of War</em> trilogy had arguably solidified the series' gameplay style.</p>
<p>However, judging by the game's title and some previously revealed content, this entry seemed to aim for some breakthroughs, rather than being confined to the previous <em>God of War</em> trilogy.</p>
<p>Many industry designers secretly speculated in their minds.</p>
<p>This was a very bold move, but the crucial question was: could Nebula Games succeed?</p>
<p>Many industry designers remained doubtful about this, and of course, some designers secretly hoped that Nebula Games' <em>New God of War</em> would suffer a Waterloo.</p>
<p>Especially FOW, which had launched <em>Olympus</em> for testing, aiming at the VR DOTA market, was still in its open BETA testing phase. However, its popularity had now been completely overshadowed by <em>God of War</em>.</p>
<p>Even if the genres weren't the same, and both merely shared a Greek theme, the crucial point was that players' time was also limited.</p>
<p>Moreover, for FOW, the most important aspect of <em>Olympus</em> was to collect player data and simultaneously generate buzz to quickly carve out a share of the DOTA market.</p>
<p>After all, compared to their new title, the DOTA market was already well-established.</p>
<p>But the sudden emergence of the <em>God of War</em> series completely disrupted FOW's promotional plans.</p>
<p>Now, FOW's only hope was that Nebula Games would make drastic changes to <em>New God of War</em>, altering the entire game beyond recognition, and thereby provoke player resentment.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Amidst the attention of the industry and players, <em>New God of War</em> didn't make them wait long this time; after all, it had already been in planning during the development of the <em>God of War</em> trilogy.</p>
<p>In mid-June, <em>New God of War</em> launched on the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>However, after many players entered the game with eager anticipation, they were all dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Although everyone had made various speculations online beforehand, upon truly entering and experiencing the game, a single thought crossed everyone's mind.</p>
<p>“Is this really still <em>God of War</em>? What exactly happened to Kratos during this time?”</p>
<p>Zhang Yi watched Kratos in the game, gently caressing a golden handprint on a tree, leaning against it, and lost in thought, muttering to himself.</p>
<p>And this was a question that all players collectively pondered.</p>
<p>Why had Kratos become like this?</p>
<p>How did Kratos's Blades of Chaos turn into an axe?</p>
<p>With such confusion, Kratos in the game was seen swinging the axe in his hand, chopping heavily at a large tree.</p>
<p>Accompanied by flying woodchips, the large tree was severed at its trunk and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>As he bent down to pick up the tree trunk, the bandage on Kratos's left hand came loose.</p>
<p>This seemed to stir a long-dormant memory in him. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and then began re-wrapping the bandage.</p>
<p>“I found some…”</p>
<p>Just then, a small boy's voice came from behind Kratos.</p>
<p>A Boy Kid was seen holding an unknown plant, curiously approaching Kratos.</p>
<p>Kratos, at this moment, instinctively turned, moving his bandaged arm out of the Boy Kid's sight.</p>
<p>“Get on the boat, boy.”</p>
<p>Kratos said expressionlessly, simultaneously hoisting the large tree from the ground. He turned and walked with the small boy named Atreus towards a small boat moored by the stream.</p>
<p>Kratos threw the tree trunk into the water, tied it to the stern, and then rowed the boat along the river towards another dock.</p>
<p>A child?</p>
<p>This was Kratos's son?</p>
<p>Kratos actually had a son?</p>
<p>Was he his biological son or adopted?</p>
<p>If biological, who was the mother?</p>
<p>Could he have been a gift from Kratos playing a mini-game before?</p>
<p>Impossible! The mini-games were clearly all for Red Soul Extraction!</p>
<p>In that instant, Zhang Yi's heart was filled with confusion.</p>
