                <p>Chapter 49: I'm a Tough Guy! What Do I Have to Fear!</p>
<p>Listening to the rustling wind sound in his headphones, Sun Yixie glanced at the asylum in the distance on the screen.</p>
<p>Sun Yixie fell silent for a moment.</p>
<p>‘Before I start playing this game, I wanna ask everyone—if… I mean, <em>if</em>—I say I'm having second thoughts, can I just not play?’</p>
<p>‘Alright then… can I just turn on the lights first? Don’t rush me.’</p>
<p>With that, Sun Yixie stood up, leaned forward, and with a soft <em>click</em>, pressed the light switch.</p>
<p>In the next moment, the camera revealed a cluttered little room now illuminated by the sudden light.</p>
<p>Immediately, bullet comments flooded the live stream room.</p>
<p>‘????????? Cowardly, perverted Sun Yixie!’</p>
<p>‘Wasn’t it supposed to be as easy as breathing to play a horror game?’</p>
<p>‘He’s already turning on the lights? Already scared?’</p>
<p>‘23333333, Brother Sun, if you really can’t handle it, let’s wait for Brother Huang to come back and play together. At least you’ll have company.’</p>
<p>‘233333, “as easy as breathing”—then why did Brother Sun turn on the lights?’</p>
<p>‘Turn off the lights! Turn off the lights!’</p>
<p>‘Turn off the lights! Turn off the lights!’</p>
<p>‘Turn off the lights! Turn off the lights!’</p>
<p>Following Sun Yixie’s action of turning on the lights, the entire screen filled with bullet comments, eventually converging into a single, unified chant:</p>
<p>‘Turn off the lights! Turn off the lights!’</p>
<p>‘The hell with turning off the lights! Why the hell would I turn them off?! Shut up!’</p>
<p>‘I’ll say it one more damn time—horror games are like breathing to me, completely stress-free. Sure, I might get startled once in a while.’</p>
<p>“But it’s only just a tiny bit of tension.”</p>
<p>Seeing the flood of bullet comments, Sun Yixie tried to use off-game banter to ease his own nervousness.</p>
<p>He sat back down, put on his headphones, and officially began the game.</p>
<p>From the game’s earlier instructions, he had already grasped some basic information.</p>
<p>In <em>Outlast</em>, he played the role of a defenseless reporter.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, horror games fall into two categories.</p>
<p>The first has a Combat System—players can use firearms or other weapons to kill monsters or bosses.</p>
<p>The second type lacks any combat system at all—players must solve puzzles and flee, avoiding monsters instead.</p>
<p>Currently, the market is dominated by the first type, while the second, though present, is far from mainstream.</p>
<p>At least, there aren’t many Major Productions in that category. The game before him, <em>Outlast</em>, clearly qualified as a Major Production within the horror game theme.</p>
<p>Just from the scenes and Atmosphere, Sun Yixie could feel it.</p>
<p>The graphics were certainly not on par with 3A titles—there was a noticeable gap.</p>
<p>But still, they felt remarkably realistic.</p>
<p>And for a horror game, such strong immersion easily made one feel uneasy.</p>
<p>“Damn it, I’m not scared! How could I possibly be scared? Just let me check the operations first, don’t rush me.”</p>
<p>Sun Yixie looked at the secondary monitor, trying to exchange banter with the bullet comments to relieve some pressure.</p>
<p>Inside an unoccupied security booth by the gate, he found a battery.</p>
<p>After searching around the main entrance, Sun Yixie gathered a few items:</p>
<p>A DV camera, one battery, and a blue folder.</p>
<p>“This must be our replacement for a flashlight, right?”</p>
<p>Sun Yixie pulled out the DV camera, inserted the battery, and turned it on.</p>
<p>Seeing the ghastly green的画面, Sun Yixie—being an experienced game streamer who had played many games—immediately grasped the implication of the DV camera’s setting.</p>
<p>He could already guess that later on, there would be dark environments where he’d need to rely on this DV camera to navigate.</p>
<p>Though his words were bold, his heart had already begun to race.</p>
<p>After confirming there was nothing more to explore, Sun Yixie pushed open the heavy iron gate and stepped into the courtyard.</p>
<p>The asylum featured a European-style Structure, utterly silent. Through the windows, he could see lights flickering on and off inside various rooms.</p>
<p>It felt as if a pair of eyes were watching him from one of those lit rooms.</p>
<p>Controlling the protagonist forward along the path, Sun Yixie suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>Because inside Mount Massive Asylum, the lights on one floor suddenly turned on—and a dark figure appeared in the window.</p>
<p>His eyes, previously narrowed to slits, suddenly widened.</p>
<p>Sun Yixie activated the camera’s zoom function, trying to get a closer look at what the figure was.</p>
<p>But as if sensing someone was watching, the figure instantly darted away.</p>
<p>From his perspective, he only caught a blurry shadow.</p>
<p>Then, the room’s lights turned off again.</p>
<p>A chill surged from Sun Yixie’s feet straight up to the top of his head.</p>
<p>Nothing had even happened—no terrifying monsters had appeared.</p>
<p>Yet, his heart was already pounding.</p>
<p>The Mount Massive Asylum before him felt like a monstrous beast with its jaws wide open, waiting for him to step inside.</p>
<p>Moreover, the surrounding layout felt deeply unsettling—especially those security vehicles parked at the entrance, which struck him as particularly odd.</p>
<p>Why would there be security vehicles at the entrance of an asylum?</p>
<p>Approaching the main gate of the asylum, he found it locked and impossible to open.</p>
<p>After wandering around, Sun Yixie finally discovered a small hole in the iron gate to the left, and crawled through.</p>
<p>Next came a series of gameplay tutorials:</p>
<p>Running, jumping, climbing, and crouching—basic actions.</p>
<p>The game’s camera work and attention to detail were extremely precise—something Sun Yixie had never experienced in previous horror games.</p>
<p>Through the headphones, he could clearly hear the protagonist’s breathing heavily.</p>
<p>Following the tutorial prompts, he approached a window, climbed in—and suddenly, all the lights in the room went out.</p>
<p>The room plunged into complete darkness.</p>
<p>At the same time, Sun Yixie, deep in gameplay, was startled by the sudden blackout and flinched.</p>
<p>‘233333, what did I just see?’</p>
<p>‘Haha, Brother Sun actually has eyes!’</p>
<p>‘I’m dying of laughter—Brother Sun totally flinched just now, right?’</p>
<p>‘Brother Sun, if you’re scared, just admit it!’</p>
<p>Seeing Sun Yixie’s reaction, the bullet comments exploded once more.</p>
<p>Compared to regular streams, today’s live stream room had far more comments—clearly, many viewers were also feeling scared, using bullet comments to relieve their own fear.</p>
<p>“D-D-Damn it! What’s there to be scared of?! I’m a tough guy! What do I have to fear?! Nothing at all!”</p>
<p>After activating the DV camera’s night vision mode, the惨绿色 color tone of the画面 made the game’s Atmosphere even more eerie.</p>
<p>Shouting loudly to boost his own courage, Sun Yixie began exploring with the camera in hand.</p>
<p>He pushed open an ajar door and stepped forward.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a TV set that had been turned off powered on by itself, emitting a sharp, piercing noise.</p>
<p>“AAAAAHHH!”</p>
<p>The screech sent Sun Yixie flying.</p>
<p>On camera, Sun Yixie jerked violently in fright. Accompanied by a world-class tenor scream, he kicked the desk, sending his wheeled chair rolling backward, while his hands covered his eyes and his entire body slumped into the chair.</p>
<p>After a few seconds, realizing no further sounds came through the headphones, he slowly parted his hands just enough to peek through a tiny gap, glancing sideways at the computer screen.</p>
<p>The game’s room was pitch black—only the static snow of a TV screen flickered in the darkness.</p>
<p>Once he confirmed there was no further danger, Sun Yixie finally lowered his hands, shifting from covering his face to clutching his chest, breathing a deep sigh of relief.</p>
