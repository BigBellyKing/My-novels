                <h1>Chapter 16: Run-In</h1>
<p>Meeting room.</p>
<p>Chen Xu was explaining the content of <em>Undertale</em> to Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue.</p>
<p>The part regarding <em>Mirror (Game)</em> wasn't too problematic—just needed to follow previous templates, adding corresponding character portraits and written storylines, and it'd be done.</p>
<p>The main focus going forward would be on developing <em>Undertale</em>.</p>
<p><em>Undertale</em> was a work created by an Independent Game Designer in Chen Xu's previous life.</p>
<p>Yet it touched countless players worldwide and could be considered a classic META game. However, unlike other META games such as <em>Pony Island</em>, <em>ICEY</em>, and <em>The Stanley Parable</em>, <em>Undertale</em> successfully integrated META elements with RPG mechanics, even reshaping players' perceptions of traditional RPG settings.</p>
<p>The game's core concept was very clear.</p>
<p><em>Undertale</em>'s main strength lay in its story, combined with META-style twists. Gameplay elements were merely seasoning.</p>
<p>Of course, Chen Xu did plan to improve certain aspects.</p>
<p>For instance, compared to its previous life version, the Art of <em>Undertale</em> would definitely be enhanced.</p>
<p>In its original form, <em>Undertale</em>'s primitive pixel style and hand-drawn lines weren't chosen for artistic reasons.</p>
<p>It was simply due to lack of funds—after all, it was a solo independent project.</p>
<p>After <em>Undertale</em> became wildly popular, some so-called connoisseurs and media outlets claimed its art style was uniquely distinctive—but that was all nonsense.</p>
<p>Indeed, not all pixel games stem from financial constraints. For example, in Chen Xu's previous life, <em>Octopath Traveler</em> used pixel art to blend contemporary and nostalgic visual presentation, and some retro-themed games deliberately adopted the pixel aesthetic.</p>
<p>However, for a story-driven META game like <em>Undertale</em>, superior graphics would clearly enhance the experience rather than detract from it.</p>
<p>Take <em>Minecraft</em>: it used pixel-style visuals because its block-based gameplay naturally matched that aesthetic.</p>
<p>But <em>Undertale</em>'s art style was clearly not a compromise made for the sake of gameplay.</p>
<p>Leaving aside visual presentation, <em>Undertale</em>'s story and Music were undeniably classic.</p>
<p>In particular, Sans's "Megalovania" and Undyne's "Battle Against a True Hero" were iconic.</p>
<p>After briefly introducing the core elements of <em>Undertale</em> to the two, Chen Xu showed Ruan Ningxue some concept art of key characters.</p>
<p>Toriel, the kind and gentle motherly figure; Asgore, the king who appeared benevolent before battle but transformed into a war god wielding a trident once combat began; the two skeleton brothers (Sans and Papyrus), one tall and one short; and Flowey, the seemingly innocent flower who was actually an expression meme lord...</p>
<p>Chen Xu would personally handle quality control for the main characters' designs.</p>
<p>As for regular mobs, those would be outsourced—just needed to meet requirements and pass final inspection.</p>
<p>Next came the storylines: Neutral Route, Pacifist Route, Genocide Route, and Soulless Pacifist Route.</p>
<p>Chen Xu had used Memory Capsules obtained from the system to outline the key plot points for each path.</p>
<p>The rest would be filled in by Yang Xin.</p>
<p>After assigning their responsibilities, Chen Xu sat down at his desk and entered the official engine's backend, preparing to establish the foundational framework for <em>Undertale</em>.</p>
<p>"Ningxue, was <em>Mirror (Game)</em> developed like this when you worked on it before?"</p>
<p>Staring at the manuscript—so detailed it couldn't possibly be more thorough—Yang Xin was still slightly dazed.</p>
<p>Beside her, Ruan Ningxue, already sketching with a reference sheet in hand, looked puzzled. "Yes, why? Is there something wrong with developing a game this way, Sister Xin?"</p>
<p>"Wrong? It's too smooth! Too clear-headed!" Yang Xin widened her eyes, though she lowered her voice.</p>
<p>In terms of scale, <em>Undertale</em> felt like a small project.</p>
<p>Yet the development process was so streamlined it gave Yang Xin the illusion that even a dog could do it.</p>
<p>Contrasting this with the chaotic development processes at her previous company, Yang Xin momentarily wondered if all the employees she'd hired before had just been pretending to work.</p>
<p>While sighing with emotion, she began carefully reviewing <em>Undertale</em>'s story, thinking about how best to flesh it out.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chen Xu, seated at his desk, didn't dwell on such random thoughts.</p>
<p>Right now, he was testing the official engine.</p>
<p>The available Computational Resources had increased by roughly twenty times compared to before.</p>
<p>In the backend, the current available resource was 0/1024MB.</p>
<p>Judged by previous life standards, that was about 1GB. But Chen Xu checked the tutorials and new features.</p>
<p>In this Parallel World, these resources were more than sufficient.</p>
<p>If he wanted more?</p>
<p>Either increase the Game Designer's Job Title level, or spend money.</p>
<p>How to level up? Either grind slowly—what people called gaining experience.</p>
<p>Alternatively, win prestigious awards or make positive contributions to the gaming industry.</p>
<p>In a way, the creation of <em>Mirror (Game)</em> had indeed advanced the gentleman's game industry.</p>
<p>After getting a rough understanding, Chen Xu gently shook his head and stopped thinking about it.</p>
<p>He turned his focus to developing <em>Undertale</em>.</p>
<p>For Chen Xu, this Independent Game wasn't particularly difficult.</p>
<p>With Parallel World technology, creating such a game wouldn't take much effort.</p>
<p>The truly time-consuming and labor-intensive parts were the story text, character portraits, and Music.</p>
<p>After all, <em>Undertale</em> was renowned for its exceptional soundtrack.</p>
<p>This was also common among many other standout independent titles.</p>
<p>Story, Music, and Gameplay creativity had always been the three-pronged approach of independent games.</p>
<p>"Sister Xin, who the hell is this guy? Come out and bite us!"</p>
<p>"A hit-and-run dog. Probably jealous of <em>Mirror</em>'s sales results, and since his new game is about to launch, he's deliberately staging a run-in to grab popularity. This guy's a habitual offender."</p>
<p>Noticing the commotion from Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue, Chen Xu grew curious. "What's going on?"</p>
<p>Seeing Chen Xu approach, Yang Xin picked up Ruan Ningxue's phone. "Look at this—another hit-and-run artist."</p>
<p>Chen Xu took the phone. On screen was a video reposted by a media outlet called <em>Game Timespace</em>.</p>
<p>After tapping to play, a middle-aged man appeared, reviewing a game. The game's image shown was <em>Mirror (Game)</em>—specifically, a clothed character portrait.</p>
<p>"To capture players' attention, today's game designers will do anything."</p>
<p>"Vulgar! Utterly vulgar!"</p>
<p>"Game development is an artistic field. Calling such works 'games' feels like a desecration of gaming itself."</p>
<p>"Can such a game designer advance the gaming industry?"</p>
<p>"He cannot!"</p>
<p>"If my upcoming game <em>Blooming (Game)</em> contained such content, I'd be too ashamed to show my face."</p>
<p>"So I urge all fellow game designers: reduce gimmicks, and instead focus on creating truly great games. Stop resorting to vulgar content just to boost sales."</p>
<p>The roughly two-minute video was delivered with righteous indignation.</p>
<p>Yet when Chen Xu scrolled through the comments, something interesting emerged.</p>
<p>Alongside a group of supportive players, a large number of sarcastic ones appeared.</p>
<p>"Zhong 'Big Cannon', you're back again?"</p>
<p>"Vulgar? Then I must criticize it too!"</p>
<p>"Others' games? Vulgar! My game? Art!"</p>
<p>"Just say when you're advertising your new game already."</p>
<p>"Bro upstairs, you're not paying attention to Zhong 'Big Cannon's' bombastic performance. Didn't you see? It's already inserted—the game's called <em>Blooming</em>."</p>
<p>After watching the entire video, reading the comment section, and hearing Yang Xin's explanation, Chen Xu got the full picture.</p>
<p>The man's name was Zhong Mei, a designer under Hapai Culture &amp; Sports—and also the company's owner.</p>
<p>His reputation in the gaming industry was mixed.</p>
<p>The praise stemmed from Zhong Mei actually having some solid past works.</p>
<p>Even in recent years, while his games hadn't exploded in popularity, their quality wasn't bad.</p>
<p>The criticism, however, was about Zhong Mei's character.</p>
<p>He frequently targeted games that were currently popular and somewhat controversial, disparaging them to promote and elevate his own upcoming titles.</p>
<p>It wasn't just Chen Xu—many other game designers had been attacked this way before.</p>
