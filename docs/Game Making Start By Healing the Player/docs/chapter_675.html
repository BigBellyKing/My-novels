<p>Chapter 674: My Cerebellum Is Overloaded (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Song Ren felt something strange in the game.</p>
<p>After all, as a player who had just experienced The Witcher: Wild Hunt, he was still very concerned about Elizabeth's whereabouts.</p>
<p>Yet now, the character he was controlling was named Jack?</p>
<p>Moreover, the scenes of Rapture around him seemed slightly different from the previous preview?</p>
<p>The Rapture before Song Ren felt extremely eerie.</p>
<p>It was completely unlike the content shown in the preview video.</p>
<p>The underwater metropolis of Rapture was empty, filled everywhere with ruins.</p>
<p>Mad mutants leaped out to attack people.</p>
<p>Putting aside his fixation on Elizabeth for now, Song Ren cautiously advanced forward, exploring step by step.</p>
<p>Guided through the radio by a strange man named Atlas, Song Ren began exploring Rapture.</p>
<p>"This guy is quite polite—uses honorifics the whole time."</p>
<p>As Song Ren explored Rapture, he sighed with emotion.</p>
<p>This was probably the most respectful NPC he had ever encountered in a game.</p>
<p>Even when giving directions, every sentence included a polite "Would you kindly," making Song Ren feel a bit awkward.</p>
<p>We're practically family—why so formal?</p>
<p>As Song Ren continued exploring Rapture, he increasingly felt a striking contrast.</p>
<p>The architecture of the deep-sea metropolis was exquisitely crafted, yet shattered and broken, with leaks everywhere.</p>
<p>The dreamlike neon signs along the streets contrasted sharply with the corpses and bloodstains nearby.</p>
<p>The lazy singing from the bar's jukebox was melodious, while the clown sound effects from the vending machines were unsettling—Song Ren jumped in fright the first time he heard them.</p>
<p>Combined, these elements made Song Ren feel as if Rapture were a dream—beautiful yet grotesque, mad yet real.</p>
<p>Of course, what interested Song Ren even more was the game's combat mechanics.</p>
<p>Similar to the Magic (attack type) in The Witcher: Wild Hunt, the superpowers in Rapture were called Adam Plasmid. Like the Magic (attack type) in Columbia, the Plasmids derived from Adam substance were openly sold.</p>
<p>Fire, lightning—through different Plasmids, players could unleash different elemental powers.</p>
<p>What stunned Song Ren, however, was that, just like in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, players could use elemental powers to interact with the environment.</p>
<p>For example, if the ground was wet, using an electric attack would electrocute any monsters standing in the water.</p>
<p>Ice-covered paths could be melted with fire.</p>
<p>Yet what intrigued Song Ren most was the story of Rapture.</p>
<p>Besides himself, Rapture was filled with addicts driven insane by Adam substance, as well as Little Sisters collecting Adam and Big Daddies protecting them.</p>
<p>A Big Daddy was a massive monster wearing a metal diving suit, wielding a giant drill.</p>
<p>Their relationship resembled that of Elizabeth and Nightingale.</p>
<p>But unlike Elizabeth, who was protected, the Little Sisters could move freely.</p>
<p>As Song Ren progressed through the game, his mind filled with curiosity and confusion.</p>
<p>When would he finally meet Elizabeth? What had happened to this city of Rapture?</p>
<p>These questions lingered in his mind.</p>
<p>But Song Ren didn't have to wait long before he finally saw Elizabeth.</p>
<p>In the game, Chen Xu employed a dual narrative structure.</p>
<p>This differed slightly from the previous life.</p>
<p>After all, in the original BioShock and its DLC Burial at Sea, the stories were largely independent.</p>
<p>Chen Xu trimmed some drawn-out level progression here.</p>
<p>He also added transitional scenes to make character switches smoother.</p>
<p>After all, Elizabeth's storyline and Jack's storyline were parallel.</p>
<p>Much like the relationship between Geralt of Rivia and Ciri in The Witcher: Wild Hunt.</p>
<p>The main quest followed Jack's perspective—a clear, visible path.</p>
<p>The hidden path, however, followed Elizabeth's perspective.</p>
<p>In the original BioShock, there were indeed visible and hidden storylines, but due to production scale and budget, the hidden path was mostly conveyed through documents.</p>
<p>Here, Chen Xu integrated some of that hidden narrative with Elizabeth's Burial at Sea storyline—depicting Rapture's rise and fall, and the backstories of characters like Dr. Yi—through Elizabeth's journey.</p>
<p>Elizabeth and the surviving Booker belonged to the past.</p>
<p>Jack's Rapture was set in the Future Era.</p>
<p>Through Elizabeth's eyes, Song Ren finally saw the once-glorious Rapture at its peak.</p>
<p>It was vastly different from the time period Jack experienced.</p>
<p>At this point, Rapture had not yet fallen into civil war or chaos.</p>
<p>Its prosperity rivaled that of Columbia, the Sky City.</p>
<p>But unlike Columbia's heavy religious atmosphere, Rapture was filled with artistic flair.</p>
<p>Theatrical posters, sculptures, and films were everywhere on the city's streets and alleys.</p>
<p>At this juncture, Song Ren watched as Elizabeth led Booker on an adventure.</p>
<p>Through clues and collecting items, he began to piece together the connection between Rapture and Columbia.</p>
<p>The concept of Big Daddies and Little Sisters originated from the bond between Elizabeth and Nightingale in Columbia.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Magic (attack type) in Columbia stemmed from Rapture's Adam Plasmid.</p>
<p>As the game progressed, more and more truths were gradually unveiled—Song Ren was completely stunned.</p>
<p>Compared to The Witcher: Wild Hunt, this concluding chapter titled Rapture was even bolder in its story.</p>
<p>Why was Elizabeth still alive?</p>
<p>What was the origin of Booker in Rapture?</p>
<p>When Booker was attacked by a Big Daddy along the way, Elizabeth's guidance helped him finally recall everything.</p>
<p>In this timeline, Booker first became Comstock, choosing baptism after the Battle of Wounded Knee.</p>
<p>After that, his story mirrored Comstock's in The Witcher: Wild Hunt.</p>
<p>By funding the Lutece siblings, he built Columbia, the Sky City, and created a machine capable of opening parallel worlds.</p>
<p>Using knowledge from parallel worlds, he became the Prophet—Comstock.</p>
<p>But he lost his ability to have children, so he searched parallel worlds for his daughter, Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Yet a variable emerged: Elizabeth's existence was a constant.</p>
<p>But her life or death became a variable.</p>
<p>In this particular timeline, when young Elizabeth was taken, it wasn't her finger that was cut off—it was her head.</p>
<p>He had personally killed his own daughter, even if she was from a parallel world.</p>
<p>This realization shocked Booker, but instead of facing it, he once again fled reality—just as he had after the Battle of Wounded Knee.</p>
<p>He asked the Lutece siblings to teleport him to a place no one knew.</p>
<p>That place was Rapture.</p>
<p>And precisely because of this teleportation of Comstock, Rapture and Columbia became intertwined.</p>
<p>Here, Booker adopted a daughter named Sally—the Little Sister.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had guided Booker all along in searching for Sally, merely to make him remember his sins.</p>
<p>By this point in the game, Song Ren was utterly dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Elizabeth found Booker just to guide him to regain his memories—and then kill him!?</p>
<p>If this shocked Song Ren, what came next left him confused.</p>
<p>"Booker died again!? What the hell is going on? Is Elizabeth connected to Jack somehow? And the timelines of Elizabeth and Jack are only a few years apart!"</p>
<p>Watching the sudden appearance of the Big Daddy, who not only killed Booker but also Elizabeth, Song Ren's head started to ache.</p>
<p>His cerebellum was overloaded—this was exactly how he felt.</p>
<p>Even stranger was Elizabeth herself.</p>
<p>Though she died under the Big Daddy's drill just like Booker, she was different.</p>
<p>Due to her unique abilities, in the instant before death, Elizabeth, like the Lutece siblings, entered a state of quantum entanglement.</p>
<p>She existed in every timeline, yet not truly present.</p>
<p>But unlike the Lutece siblings, Elizabeth could only observe the course of fate—she could not interfere.</p>
<p>In terms of life signs, Elizabeth had entered an immortal, undying state.</p>
<p>But what Song Ren never expected was that, after seeing the future, Elizabeth chose to abandon her observer form and willingly become mortal.</p>
<p>This caused Elizabeth to lose some of her memories, while her subconscious transformed into Booker's mindset, accompanying her throughout her adventure.</p>
<p>Moreover, Elizabeth made a deal with a rebel leader to save the Little Sister, Sally.</p>
<p>Why did Elizabeth do this?</p>
<p>What future had she seen?</p>
