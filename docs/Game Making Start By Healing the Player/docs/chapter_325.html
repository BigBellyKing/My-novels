<p>Chapter 324: For the Players, I Can Endure (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>“Damn it! That's absolutely incredible!”</p>
<p>Following the video's final curtain, Song Ren's voice, filled with shock, came through the voice channel.</p>
<p>“This is called Call of Duty: Modern Warfare? This must be World War! It's too insane!” Zhang Yi also spoke up in response at this moment.</p>
<p>At the same time, he couldn't help but click replay.</p>
<p>This short promotional video, less than two minutes long, brought him an overwhelming sense of shock.</p>
<p>This video was not only broadcast domestically but also overseas.</p>
<p>After all, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is a cornerstone title for Cosmic VR devices.</p>
<p>What it's competing for is not just the domestic market, but the global market.</p>
<p>This time, the overseas publisher was still Target Software.</p>
<p>However, there was one slight difference from before.</p>
<p>That is, Target Software is now in the shape of Nebula Games.</p>
<p>Simply put, Nebula Games acquired a portion of Target Software's shares and is now the largest shareholder.</p>
<p>If it came to selling, Target Software certainly wouldn't want to, as its profits were steadily increasing.</p>
<p>But the key point was that the majority of Target Software's overseas revenue came from Nebula Games' titles.</p>
<p>And now that Nebula Games had proposed this plan, not agreeing was certainly an option, but future collaborations would be difficult.</p>
<p>So Target Software deliberated and thought, 'Why don't we just sell?'</p>
<p>It's just becoming the shape of Nebula Games, and once we adapt, it might even be more comfortable.</p>
<p>With strong promotion, this promotional trailer also landed on major overseas video websites, accompanied by multi-language subtitles.</p>
<p>Overseas players were also incredibly excited by it.</p>
<p>After all, Nebula Games was no longer an unknown entity.</p>
<p>Earlier titles like Dark Souls, followed by Minecraft, Monster Hunter: World, Warcraft, and the recent Rainbow Six Siege, all received significant attention overseas.</p>
<p>At the same time, the three most popular game genres among overseas audiences were: guns, cars, and balls.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare belonged to the broadest genre: guns.</p>
<p>These explosive scenes instantly ignited the passion of countless overseas players.</p>
<p>Especially those scenes that could be described as insane, they sparked widespread discussion globally.</p>
<p>Domestic players.</p>
<p>“My God! Is this Chen Xu's new game? It's absolutely insane!”</p>
<p>“I can only say I'm buying it like crazy! And it feels like a completely different style from Rainbow Six Siege!”</p>
<p>“The White House falling, the Eiffel Tower collapsing, the space station disintegrating, cities nuked – is there anything Chen Xu wouldn't dare to do!?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Chen Xu wouldn't dare to set the background domestically! Forget about blowing up famous buildings, Chen Xu wouldn't even dare to destroy flowers and grass!”</p>
<p>“Ahem, be a bit more farsighted! It's not that Mr. Chen wouldn't dare, but it's a requirement for the bigger picture. After all, Cosmic VR aims to capture the global market, so setting the background overseas is mainly to better conquer the overseas market, isn't it?”</p>
<p>“Don't worry about all that, I'm more curious about the gameplay content of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Is it more focused on multiplayer or single-player?”</p>
<p>“Multiplayer and single-player, I don't know, I just hope it's satisfying. Rainbow Six Siege is fun, but I really can't play it.”</p>
<p>“Can't play it +1. I'm still alive, but I'm more useful watching cameras after dying.”</p>
<p>Similarly, many people were discussing it overseas.</p>
<p>“Atrai just revealed the promotional video for Storm Action, and Nebula Games immediately released content for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. That's so cool!”</p>
<p>“Haha, exactly. The confrontation between Zeus and Cosmic. I was originally going to buy Zeus, but now I have to say I'll have to wait and see. The Call of Duty: Modern Warfare trailer is just too cool!”</p>
<p>“But seriously, won't this company's promotional video turn out to be a misleading promotion/scam? I've been fooled many times before.”</p>
<p>“Friend, do you know Dark Souls, Warcraft, Minecraft, and Rainbow Six Siege? These games are all from Nebula Games, and they never fake things in their promotional videos.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I specifically went to a China website to learn more about this game company, especially their BOSS, who is also the lead designer for these games. In China, he has a nickname called 'Warrior of Love,' meaning that every game he makes contains his love for the players, so he would never do anything to make players uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>“My God, that's so cool! But even so, to be honest, I'll have to wait for the game to come out before drawing conclusions. Still, I have to say I'm even more excited for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare now.”</p>
<p>Clearly, the quality of this game's CGI was absolutely world-class, letting many players understand the meaning of 'Ten Years of Game Development, Nine Years of CG'.</p>
<p>But while it was cool, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare didn't show much in terms of gameplay, and many players didn't understand what kind of game it actually was.</p>
<p>This was also within Chen Xu's expectations; the promotional video was mainly to stir up players' enthusiasm.</p>
<p>To let players know what kind of explosive content this game, named Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, would have.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>News about Call of Duty: Modern Warfare spread worldwide.</p>
<p>Players engaged in various discussions.</p>
<p>At this time, Chen Xu was in Nebula Games' office, arranging story content with his team.</p>
<p>For the game's story, Chen Xu adopted two presentation modes.</p>
<p>The first was pre-rendered CG cutscenes.</p>
<p>For example, when a scene switch required pre-loading, CG cutscenes would be used to convey the story's plot to players.</p>
<p>The second was real-time story events.</p>
<p>This meant that players in game levels would communicate with their teammates to reveal the game's plot.</p>
<p>Rather than clearing a level and then playing a real-time rendered animation.</p>
<p>Doing this had both advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>The advantage was a smoother player experience.</p>
<p>The disadvantage was that if players weren't paying attention, for instance, scratching one's foot midway, and an NPC character was speaking in the game at that moment.</p>
<p>Then some content might be missed.</p>
<p>There was no good solution for this, as everything has its pros and cons.</p>
<p>A choice had to be made between the two.</p>
<p>Chen Xu's choice was to make the player's game experience smoother.</p>
<p>Moreover, for VR games themselves, players' concentration tends to be higher than in PC platform games.</p>
<p>To some extent, this also compensated for some of the drawbacks.</p>
<p>What remained was the story aspect.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, if this story is written, players will probably send you razor blades again!”</p>
<p>Yang Xin, responsible for enriching the story in the office, couldn't help but sigh with emotion as she looked at the outline summary.</p>
<p>Because it was truly too heart-wrenching.</p>
<p>Just the highlighted points and script content were enough to make her, being a bit emotional, feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>And when made into a VR game, with that high sense of immersion.</p>
<p>Players' emotions would definitely explode!</p>
<p>“There's no other way. All of this is to bring players a better gaming experience. For the players, I can endure these misunderstandings.”</p>
<p>Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Send razor blades?</p>
<p>Express delivery companies wouldn't even deliver them!</p>
<p>Moreover, Nebula Games' security forces had been strengthened before the New Year.</p>
