                <p>Chapter 533: Children Choose, Adults Want It All! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Many other players, just like Song Ren, were immersed in the White Wolf's story.</p>
<p>Playing up to this point, the story was incredibly heartwarming, with the White Wolf's affection for Triss and Yennefer, and his familial love for Ciri.</p>
<p>It could be said that all of it deeply moved the players.</p>
<p>Now that the White Wolf had brought Ciri back to Kaer Morhen, all players who had reached this point basically understood that a major decisive battle was imminent.</p>
<p>Moreover, all the people the White Wolf had helped previously also arrived at Kaer Morhen to assist Geralt.</p>
<p>Keira, the Archdruid of the Skellige Isles, and Triss, who had already settled in Kovir and Poviss.</p>
<p>Everyone quickly strategized. To withstand the cold of the White Frost, Yennefer put all her effort into creating a protective shield that enveloped the entire castle.</p>
<p>But even so, facing the Wild Hunt's assault, everyone was repeatedly beaten back.</p>
<p>“Damn it! This Wild Hunt is too fierce!”</p>
<p>The endless stream of Wild Hunt soldiers made Song Ren feel overwhelmed.</p>
<p>His health was critically low; even using potions couldn't restore it fast enough.</p>
<p>This was even before Eredin, the King of the Wild Hunt, had entered the fray.</p>
<p>Eventually, Yennefer collapsed from exhaustion, and the enemy's main force breached the gate. The power of frost instantly engulfed Kaer Morhen, freezing everyone except Vesemir among the White Wolf's companions.</p>
<p>And at this desperate moment, a Witcher stepped forward.</p>
<p>That was Vesemir, the master of the Wolf School.</p>
<p>He fought three opponents without falling into a disadvantage, but ultimately, to protect Ciri, Vesemir was severely wounded and captured by the Wild Hunt General as a hostage, threatening Ciri to walk into a trap. Seeing Ciri about to surrender for his sake, Vesemir made a decision.</p>
<p>“You’ve never liked listening since you were little. I like that stubbornness in you.”</p>
<p>“Soar!”</p>
<p>As his last words fell, Vesemir made one final desperate lunge, stabbing the Wild Hunt General who held him with a dagger. Enraged, the general immediately killed Vesemir in his grasp.</p>
<p>Immense grief plunged Ciri into a frenzy. The power of the Elder Blood instantly ran wild, also forcing the entire Wild Hunt army to retreat.</p>
<p>Seeing Ciri's magic about to destroy all of Kaer Morhen, and that the White Wolf and Yennefer would have died from this rampant magic, the timely awakened Elven mage Avallac'h appeared and stopped her.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Song Ren, in the game, had not yet recovered his senses.</p>
<p>What happened?! Vesemir died?!</p>
<p>Thinking of the moment the old man sacrificed himself, Song Ren felt completely unwell.</p>
<p>In that instant, he wanted to retract his previous words. Mr. Chen was still Mr. Chen, without the slightest change.</p>
<p>Everyone cremated the old man's body, but at the same time, they all knew that relying on just a few Witchers couldn't possibly counter the vast Wild Hunt army.</p>
<p>During these days of seeking allies, Geralt also had more time to spend with Ciri.</p>
<p>During this time, Geralt and Ciri went to Velen to exact revenge. The three old crones of Velen were servants of Imlerith, a Wild Hunt General, and Imlerith was the one who killed the old man.</p>
<p>Facing their enemies, the father and daughter split up. Ciri went to confront the three old crones. Inside the cave, the three old crones transformed into three beautiful, unclad women, but they were in the act of cannibalism, which was utterly brutal.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, Song Ren might have lingered to take another look, but he had already known the true forms of these three old crones from the Bloody Baron's quest, so he didn't hesitate and immediately started the fight.</p>
<p>The only drawback was that he had mostly been controlling Geralt. Although there were also segments where he controlled Ciri, he was still a bit unfamiliar, which led to him dying twice and having to restart the fight. Ultimately, Ciri successfully killed two of the old crones, but unfortunately, one of them escaped.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Geralt used Aard Sign's fire to cook Imlerith's head, and then smashed Imlerith's skull with a hammer, avenging his mentor. It was quite satisfying, one might say.</p>
<p>Returning to camp, the White Wolf then traveled through time and space with the Elven mage, arriving in the world of the Elves.</p>
<p>Because Avallac'h knew deeply how vast the Wild Hunt's forces were, and that their current strength couldn't possibly contend with them, he decided to turn the most powerful General and Governor under Eredin, the King of the Wild Hunt.</p>
<p>However, compared to the dangers of time travel, turning the General was much simpler, as the General was extremely loyal to the former king.</p>
<p>So Avallac'h revealed the true culprit behind the former king's death and brought the General before Ciri as proof.</p>
<p>It turned out that when Ciri was fifteen or sixteen, she had once visited the world of the Elves. At that time, to bring the Elder Blood back to the Elves, he made a deal with Ciri.</p>
<p>The condition was to take Ciri home, in exchange for her bearing children for the Elf King. However, in the Elf King's eyes, humans were an inferior race, like livestock. For several days, the Elf King couldn't bring himself to do it. Eredin then exploited this, tricking the Elf King into drinking a large quantity of aphrodisiac potions, which poisoned him and allowed Eredin to seize power.</p>
<p>“Damn it! What the heck is this plot?! Good thing Ciri is okay!” Song Ren was utterly stunned.</p>
<p>What kind of divine development is this?!</p>
<p>Having Ciri bear children to continue the Elder Blood?</p>
<p>Then the old Elf King couldn't bring himself to do it, his subordinate tricked him into taking drugs, and he ended up killing himself with them!</p>
<p>Through the power of a Dreamer, Avallac'h showed the General the moment the former king died. The General immediately declared that he would absolutely not send reinforcements to Eredin and even guided everyone to arrange the major battle in the Skellige Isles, using Ciri as bait and the Sunstone to summon Eredin's army.</p>
<p>However, before that, Geralt and his companions still had some preparations to make.</p>
<p>At the Kingfisher Inn, Song Ren went to undertake a quest called “Three-Way Tango”.</p>
<p>As for the targets, it was naturally Triss and Yennefer.</p>
<p>That name alone certainly sparks the imagination.</p>
<p>A little intimacy before a big battle, is that reasonable?</p>
<p>It's perfectly reasonable!</p>
<p>Unlike Yennefer's queen-like aura, Triss, with her fiery red short hair, was more like a delicate bird clinging to her man.</p>
<p>Regarding these two sorceresses, both clearly devoted to the White Wolf and also cherished by him, players online had long been in a heated debate.</p>
<p>And for these two different female characters, the favorite thing for many players to do was “buy shares”.</p>
<p>One faction supported “Triss shares,” another supported “Yennefer shares.”</p>
<p>Of course, there were also some “demon-father-tier” players who, in their madness, supported Ciri.</p>
<p>Song Ren, of course, wouldn't be like that. As for Yennefer or Triss?</p>
<p>Children choose; intelligent adults, of course, choose to have it all.</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>Isn't this a hidden questline?</p>
<p>“Three-Way Tango”! A ménage à trois, what an imaginative scene!</p>
<p>Wonder if Yennefer brought her unicorn.</p>
<p>Watching Geralt, the White Wolf in the game, holding a bottle of wine and arriving at the door of the upstairs room in the Kingfisher Inn, Song Ren in the game was also humming a tune.</p>
<p>Entering the room, two sorceresses in their underwear, a bottle of red wine and candles—the whole atmosphere was instantly set.</p>
<p>And they wanted to rest the White Wolf's hand on the bed?</p>
<p>This is a new kind of gameplay!</p>
<p>Looking at the in-game scene, Song Ren was filled with anticipation.</p>
<p>But the next moment, something that stunned him happened: Triss and Yennefer in the game high-fived each other, drank a glass together, and then turned and left, leaving the White Wolf alone in the room until the next day when his good buddy Dandelion found him and unlocked his shackles.</p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>No girls left?!</p>
<p>Only Dandelion left?!</p>
