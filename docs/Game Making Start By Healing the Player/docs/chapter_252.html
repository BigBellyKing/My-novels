<p>Chapter 251: That's It!?! (Fifth Update)</p>
<p>Facing the Great Jagras before him, Zhang Yi was starting to lose a bit of patience.</p>
<p>This boss acted just like the bosses in Dark Souls' Death Mode, perfectly embodying the concept of 'If the enemy doesn't move, I don't move'.</p>
<p>Pulling out a Whetstone from his item pouch, Zhang Yi sharpened his Great Sword. During his earlier pursuit, he'd been harassed by a few Crown-crested Dragons, which had reduced his sword's sharpness.</p>
<p>Shouldering his Great Sword, Zhang Yi charged straight at the Great Jagras.</p>
<p>But before he could even launch his attack, the Great Jagras, seeing him charge forward, initiated its own assault.</p>
<p>Facing the Great Jagras's attack—resembling a giant lizard lunging forward—Zhang Yi didn't opt to dodge with a rolling maneuver. Instead, he chose to hard-countered the hit, taking the damage head-on.</p>
<p>He mainly did this to test the enemy's attack strength and get a better sense of its capabilities.</p>
<p>"This damage is significantly higher than that of the previous Crown-crested Dragon!"</p>
<p>Looking at the numerical design of his health bar dropping, Zhang Yi felt a bit surprised.</p>
<p>The collision from the Great Jagras had shaved off roughly one-tenth of his health bar.</p>
<p>Clearly, this boss posed a real threat.</p>
<p>Still, despite that, Zhang Yi felt no worry at all.</p>
<p>His margin for error was still very generous.</p>
<p>Unlike Dark Souls, where you'd be nearly dead after two hits and finished after three, he could easily withstand seven or eight hits like this!</p>
<p>And most importantly, unlike Dark Souls, which confined battles to specific zones, Monster Hunter: World allowed free movement during combat without area restrictions.</p>
<p>"Perfect! I'll use this guy to test my Great Sword properly!"</p>
<p>Zhang Yi became excited.</p>
<p>The previous Crown-crested Dragon and Great Jagras didn't have enough health—his Charged Slash couldn't be fully utilized, let alone his True Charged Slash. They'd collapse after just one strong charge.</p>
<p>Now, he finally had the perfect chance to go all out with the Great Jagras!</p>
<p>"One slash! Two slashes!"</p>
<p>Alongside his partner Palico, Zhang Yi launched a frenzied assault on the Great Jagras.</p>
<p>His routine was simple: slash once, then immediately start charging in place.</p>
<p>When the Great Jagras attacked, during the charging animation, his character entered a hyper armor state, allowing him to tank the hit and trade damage.</p>
<p>"True! Charged Slash!" Zhang Yi had already assumed his stance, ready to strike.</p>
<p>On-screen, his Hunter character raised the massive Great Sword with both hands, building momentum.</p>
<p><em>Clang!</em> The Level 3 Charged Slash indicator activated in the game.</p>
<p>In an instant, the Great Sword's most powerful True Charged Slash came crashing down!</p>
<p>In Zhang Yi's mind, he already pictured the Great Jagras being one-shot by this devastating blow, instantly crippled and defeated.</p>
<p>But in the next moment, the Great Jagras suddenly shifted its Aggro, twisted its rear, and lunged toward the nearby Palico.</p>
<p>At the same time, his Hunter character, still wielding the oversized Great Sword, executed a spinning slash.</p>
<p>Boom! Rumble!</p>
<p>Two consecutive True Charged Slashes slammed into the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust.</p>
<p>Just as Zhang Yi finished his ground-chopping maneuver, the Great Jagras reoriented its Aggro and charged back, knocking him far away with a headbutt.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi looked completely bewildered: "????? What? This is allowed?!"</p>
<p>Watching his character rise from the ground, Zhang Yi, seated before his computer, looked utterly bewildered.</p>
<p>His skill had completely missed!?</p>
<p>Still, his confusion was short-lived, as the fight against the Great Jagras was progressing smoothly overall.</p>
<p>One thing that kept making him grumble inwardly, though, was that the Palico kept drawing the Great Jagras's Aggro, causing his charged attacks to repeatedly hit empty air.</p>
<p>Yet, despite this, Zhang Yi couldn't really blame the Palico.</p>
<p>Since he hadn't turned off damage indicators, he noticed the Palico was actually dealing quite a decent amount of damage.</p>
<p>And although his Great Sword had essentially become a Hoe for hitting the ground, pioneering the true ground-chopping sword style, it did make the fight significantly easier.</p>
<p>While the Palico distracted the Great Jagras, Zhang Yi could freely output damage—though he often missed.</p>
<p>Even better, when his health dropped, the Palico actually brought him a Vigorwasp, breaking open its nectar sac to instantly restore a substantial amount of health.</p>
<p>The battle with the Great Jagras went fairly smoothly. At first, unfamiliar with the monster's attack patterns, Zhang Yi had been knocked down multiple times. But after a few exchanges, he realized that despite its intimidating appearance, the Great Jagras was actually quite weak.</p>
<p>Not only were its movements sluggish, but its damage output wasn't as high as expected.</p>
<p>The only thing it had going for it was being meatier than the earlier Crown-crested Dragon and Herbivore.</p>
<p>But ironically, this was exactly what made Zhang Yi feel very satisfying—because it allowed him to slash away freely.</p>
<p>Under the combined assault of Zhang Yi and his Palico, the Great Jagras quickly accumulated numerous wounds.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Great Jagras realized it was outmatched.</p>
<p>After one final furious charge, instead of continuing its assault, it turned and fled deep into the forest.</p>
<p>"This monster can actually run away!?"</p>
<p>Seeing the Great Jagras escaping, Zhang Yi at his computer was shocked—he hadn't expected this at all. Nevertheless, he followed the green guiding bug and gave chase.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Great Jagras had just swallowed a Jagras and hadn't fully digested it, leaving it with a bloated belly that slowed its movements significantly. It wasn't long before Zhang Yi caught up.</p>
<p>At this point, the Great Jagras was clearly at the end of its strength, limping as it walked—obviously in a severely wounded state.</p>
<p>Just as before, Zhang Yi charged forward, Great Sword in hand, followed by his Palico.</p>
<p>After just a few slashes, the roaring Great Jagras finally collapsed.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, a message appeared on screen: 【Primary Objective Completed】.</p>
<p>"I still feel like I haven't had enough!" Zhang Yi approached the fallen Great Jagras to harvest materials, feeling slightly unsatisfied.</p>
<p>Although the Great Jagras wasn't particularly difficult, the issue was that while his Great Sword dealt high damage, its speed was still a bit slow.</p>
<p>Out of ten attacks, about half missed.</p>
<p>Especially the True Charged Slash—throughout the entire fight, it only landed once. But no doubt about it, the damage it dealt was immense.</p>
<p>He also noticed another thing: the Great Sword's hyper armor wasn't truly Invincible.</p>
<p>It could withstand regular attacks, but attacks capable of knockback could still break hyper armor.</p>
<p>"I wonder what new monsters await later!"</p>
<p>Looking at the countdown, Zhang Yi sighed with emotion.</p>
<p>So far, his experience had been excellent. He felt he could give Monster Hunter: World a solid nine out of ten. He'd save the last point for now.</p>
<p>The main reason? He found the new player tutorial somewhat unreasonable.</p>
<p>During the fight with the Great Jagras, the Research Team Leader kept instructing him on various operations—clearly the tutorial NPC.</p>
<p>But this guy just stood there watching. We're both Hunters—why don't you jump in and help me fight!?</p>
<p>What are you just standing around for!?</p>
<p>Just because you're the Commander-in-Chief's grandson, you think you're special!?</p>
<p>The Hunter's Guild doesn't need nepotism!</p>
<p>I hate people like you the most—princelings!</p>
<p>While grumbling inwardly, Zhang Yi hummed a tune as he returned to Astera Base to turn in his quest, preparing to take on a new mission for another round of hunting.</p>
<p>However, at that very moment, a pop-up notification appeared.</p>
<p>【Demo version ends here. Game officially launches on August 7. Stay Tuned!】</p>
<p>No... it's over!?</p>
<p>Zhang Yi stared at the message, looking completely bewildered.</p>
<p>(End of Chapter) &lt;<END_OF_CHAPTER>&gt;</p>
