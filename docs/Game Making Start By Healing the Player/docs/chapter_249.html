<p>Chapter 248: This Game Is So Easy! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>After passing through a forest trail, Zhang Yi couldn't help but sigh in amazement.</p>
<p>In the distance lay a beach, along with the lush Ancient Forest. On the beach, numerous Herbivores gathered in small groups, each possessing a long tail resembling a hammer.</p>
<p>Ignoring the Research Team Leader who was waving at him ahead, Zhang Yi immediately sprinted toward a Herbivore that was drinking water in the distance.</p>
<p>"You'll be my first practice target!"</p>
<p>Facing the Herbivore, Zhang Yi felt a surge of excitement.</p>
<p>After all, this was his first real hunting attempt. Until now, all his techniques had only been practiced on wooden dummies.</p>
<p>As Zhang Yi approached, the Herbivore drinking water didn't seem to sense any danger.</p>
<p>Thanks to his prior knowledge of Monster Hunter: World, Zhang Yi understood that Herbivores were non-aggressive by nature—peaceful creatures that wouldn't attack first.</p>
<p>Clearly, their purpose in the game was to serve as beginner targets for players.</p>
<p>With a swing of his Great Sword, Zhang Yi struck and charged. A damage indicator shot up, and the Herbivore let out a pained cry, instinctively lashing out with its tail hammer before attempting to flee.</p>
<p>Nearby Herbivores scattered in panic.</p>
<p>Although struck by the tail, Zhang Yi's hyper armor during the charged attack prevented any flinching. The damage was negligible.</p>
<p>Then came a second strong charge. With a final cry, the Herbivore collapsed—defeated.</p>
<p>"No doubt about it—the Great Sword is truly divine! I didn't even use full strength, and you're already down!"</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was ecstatic.</p>
<p>Judging by size, the Herbivore was nearly as large and sturdy as two oxen.</p>
<p>Yet it had fallen so easily. The Great Sword's damage was simply explosive!</p>
<p>He knew this monster was designed as a practice target—something that wouldn't fight back or retaliate.</p>
<p>Still, the thrill remained.</p>
<p>Especially the Great Sword in his hands—the damage exceeded his expectations.</p>
<p>After only two or three strikes, the Herbivore was dead.</p>
<p>Each swing delivered satisfying sound effects and responsive feedback, as if the sword were truly slicing into meat.</p>
<p>It felt incredibly satisfying.</p>
<p>As for wounds, Monster Hunter: World didn't display overly bloody visuals.</p>
<p>Though it was a hunting game, forcing players to hack monsters into gory pieces and dismember them afterward would have been excessive.</p>
<p>Thus, while there were visible wounds during hunts to enhance the sense of immersion, the game didn't strive for realism.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game featured a damage indicator system, allowing players to see the damage they dealt.</p>
<p>This system was enabled by default, though it could be turned off to increase immersion.</p>
<p>It remained on by default primarily to help players learn the mechanics.</p>
<p>After all, Monster Hunter: World had hitzones and weak points on different body parts.</p>
<p>Damage indicators helped players better distinguish these differences.</p>
<p>Of course, for most experienced Hunters, this system was practically useless.</p>
<p>Knowing the weak spots didn't mean you could actually hit them.</p>
<p>Most would still end up as Foot Massage Masters or Back Scrubber Masters.</p>
<p>Which Old Hunter hadn't evolved from such humble beginnings?</p>
<p>As for hitzones or weaknesses?</p>
<p>Completely unclear!</p>
<p>One word: Just Go For It (colloquial)!</p>
<p>After a brief moment of excitement, Zhang Yi sheathed his Great Sword and began collecting loot.</p>
<p>He also pulled out a Whetstone to sharpen his blade, fully restoring its sharpness.</p>
<p>Though he had defeated his first prey in his hunting career, his excitement quickly subsided.</p>
<p>He well understood that Herbivores were designed solely for training.</p>
<p>There was virtually no chance of losing.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, there was naturally no sense of achievement.</p>
<p>Like defeating Gundyr the Ash in Dark Souls for the first time—the overwhelming sense of accomplishment came from knowing that boss posed a massive challenge at that stage.</p>
<p>It took immense effort and skill refinement to finally overcome it.</p>
<p>Or in RPGs, grinding levels and crafting gear to finally defeat a boss due to insufficient level attributes—those too brought joy and pride.</p>
<p>But defeating a creature that couldn't fight back, barely stronger than a Training Grounds wooden dummy—feeling proud of that? That would be ridiculous.</p>
<p>So for Zhang Yi, the only takeaway was confirmation—he had chosen the right weapon.</p>
<p>The Great Sword was incredibly powerful.</p>
<p>Charged attacks with hyper armor, damage through the roof.</p>
<p>No wonder it was the protagonist Hunter's weapon in the promotional video.</p>
<p>As for those three Longsword Heroes at the end of the trailer? Clearly minor characters (gaming slang) level.</p>
<p>"Still, these Herbivores are way too fragile!"</p>
<p>Shouldering his Great Sword, Zhang Yi didn't immediately follow the green guiding bug to meet the Research Team Leader for the main quest. Fifty minutes still seemed plenty.</p>
<p>With the Great Sword on his back, he located and eliminated two more Herbivores.</p>
<p>Then he wandered around the outskirts of the Ancient Forest, discovering something fascinating.</p>
<p>On the game's large map, numerous interactive elements existed.</p>
<p>Pickable fruits and food items, even insects and small animals on the ground could be captured.</p>
<p>Just moments ago, he'd used a net to catch a gray Detour Rabbit.</p>
<p>After wandering for a while, Zhang Yi finally followed the green guiding bug through a narrow path, arriving at the quest location: Jagras's Den.</p>
<p>As he emerged, a group of Small Jagras appeared, along with a few larger ones nearby.</p>
<p>"So many!"</p>
<p>Seeing the swarm of Jagras, Zhang Yi instinctively felt a twinge of panic.</p>
<p>A lingering side effect from playing Dark Souls.</p>
<p>In Dark Souls, the scariest thing wasn't seeing a boss—it was seeing a cluster of mobs.</p>
<p>But once Zhang Yi actually started fighting, he realized his worry was completely unfounded.</p>
<p>"Finally, my health bar isn't just photoshopped on! It's so sturdy!"</p>
<p>Accustomed to Dark Souls' health bar that shattered with a single hit, seeing only a tiny sliver of health lost after being attacked by these Small Jagras made Zhang Yi instantly thrilled.</p>
<p>What did this mean? Monster Hunter: World truly wasn't a high-difficulty game like Dark Souls!</p>
<p>Then, swinging his Great Sword at a Jagras, the feedback further proved his point.</p>
<p>One charged strike sent it crashing to the ground. Two follow-up hits, and it was dead.</p>
<p>Monsters attacked him for negligible damage, while he cleared them in two or three hits—like turning into a boss himself!</p>
<p>Inside the cave, strange glowing creatures resembling fireflies existed. Interacting with them released a flashbang effect, blinding the Jagras instantly.</p>
<p>At that moment, Zhang Yi could mindlessly charge his Great Sword—<strong>one hit, one kid</strong>.</p>
<p>Even his companion Palico assisted in battle—<strong>Invincible</strong>!</p>
<p>He'd never felt this exhilarated before.</p>
<p>This game is so easy!</p>
<p>It's actually a Hack-and-Slash Game!</p>
