<p>Chapter 293: We Must Believe in Science, Not Superstitious Belief (5 Updates, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Jiedong in the group felt somewhat helpless.</p>
<p>Actually, that Frost Armor Spider just now, although quite annoying.</p>
<p>But now that he had time to reflect, he felt that if he had truly played seriously, there would have still been a chance.</p>
<p>But at that moment, he didn't know what had come over him—seeing this completely new tactic had momentarily stunned him, causing his operations to feel slightly clumsier than usual.</p>
<p>In the end, he directly lost that crucial skirmish.</p>
<p>Jiedong: "Still, Chen Xu really has something. I've never seen such a strong designer before."</p>
<p>Satellite: "Indeed impressive, but I feel it might've been better if he didn't go for Wolf Riders but instead went for Wind Riders."</p>
<p>Jiedong: "Now you're just making hindsight comments. In your game, I even said it would've been better if you went for Far Seer!"</p>
<p>Shu Ben: "Honestly, the three of us aren't that embarrassing. We've personally verified that the Orcs aren't the version's favorite child."</p>
<p>Others in the group, watching the three chat, were all speechless.</p>
<p>How could they not be the version's favorite child? After watching those three matches just now, the Orcs seemed more like the underpowered version!</p>
<p>"Honestly, Guashen should be playing the last game tonight, right?" someone in the group said.</p>
<p>"Exactly! The glory of the Orcs must not fall like this!" Shu Ben instigated.</p>
<p>"Guashen! Guashen! Guashen!" Satellite also sent messages in the group.</p>
<p>Mainly because this group of pro gamers had been defeated by a game designer, which genuinely made them feel a bit ashamed.</p>
<p>The key point was that everyone felt extremely frustrated—during the matches, they each felt their own operations were slightly better than Chen Xu's.</p>
<p>But the matches never reached a stage that truly tested pure mechanical skill.</p>
<p>Mostly, they were just completely crushed early on.</p>
<p>And during that crushing phase, facing these novel tactics for the first time, none of them knew how to counter them.</p>
<p>By the time they had a rough idea, they'd already missed the golden opportunity and slipped directly into a disadvantage.</p>
<p>If they were given another chance to face the same tactics Chen Xu used earlier, each of them felt confident they could win.</p>
<p>But they just didn't have the face to ask for a rematch.</p>
<p>Now, everyone's attention turned to Guadi.</p>
<p>Moreover, many wanted to see how Guadi would handle Chen Xu's tactics, so they could use it as a reference.</p>
<p>"You guys!" Guadi in the group was speechless, though he also felt a bit itchy to play.</p>
<p>..................</p>
<p>As for the official live stream room, it was even more lively.</p>
<p>Countless bullet comments were flying by like it was New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>On the commentary desk, Sun Yixie was trying hard not to laugh, his expression simply unbelievable.</p>
<p>"This is damn unreasonable!" Huang Donglai was now doubting himself—could it be that he was actually cursed?</p>
<p>Why did whoever he supported end up losing!?</p>
<p>But he had analyzed everything scientifically and rationally!</p>
<p>Why was this happening!?</p>
<p>"Brother Huang, the bullet comments are all saying you jinxed them well!" Sun Yixie said beside him.</p>
<p>"Damn it! Stop saying 'jinxed' all the time! We must believe in science! Mr. Chen is indeed amazing, but he did make mistakes during the matches. And let's be honest—Mr. Chen's fundamentals really aren't as good as professional players!" Huang Donglai defended himself, even getting slightly emotional and blurting out a couple of catchphrases.</p>
<p>"Brother Huang, so you still believe in the pro players!?" Sun Yixie quietly tested, trying to provoke.</p>
<p>"I've already heard the news—the final player is Guadi! Currently the strongest Orc player. And Mr. Chen has already used all his previous tactics. What reason do I have to believe Mr. Chen can win?" Although there had already been three victims, Huang Donglai never changed his opinion, because he was a professional commentator.</p>
<p>Others could doubt you, but you couldn't doubt yourself. He believed in his own judgment.</p>
<p>"Brother Huang, it's not that I don't believe in your judgment. I feel that Mr. Chen's performance today has impressed not only me, but also the pro players and the audience alike," Sun Yixie said in a tone that sounded incredibly sincere.</p>
<p>"Regarding the balance of Warcraft, I think no one should have doubts now. Mr. Chen's skill speaks for itself. If Mr. Chen were a noob, you could say he doesn't understand the game. But clearly, Mr. Chen is himself a highly skilled player who deeply understands the balance between all the races."</p>
<p>"As the saying goes, even horses stumble. Guadi is indeed strong, but to be honest, Mr. Chen isn't weak either. Brother Huang, won't you reconsider?" Sun Yixie revealed his true intentions.</p>
<p>"No need to reconsider. I firmly stand by my opinion—Guadi is invincible, okay? Don't you believe in Guadi too?" Huang Donglai fired back.</p>
<p>"Honestly, compared to Mr. Chen, I do lean slightly more toward Guadi. After all, Mr. Chen has played almost all three races today, and Guadi has probably been watching all along. So I think Mr. Chen might face some difficulty in this final match," Sun Yixie, at this moment, still stood by his good brother.</p>
<p>"Exactly! We commentators must believe in science! Stop believing in all this superstitious belief. I refuse to believe Mr. Chen still has some hidden tactic that can defeat Guadi. Impossible!" Huang Donglai declared.</p>
<p>"Ah, stop talking! If Mr. Chen actually defeats Guadi, I'll shave my head with Brother Huang to celebrate!" Sun Yixie said, responding to the various bullet comments in the live stream room.</p>
<p>"Yeah, if Mr. Chen wins, we'll both shave our heads—but that's simply impossible!" Huang Donglai said.</p>
<p>................</p>
<p>Completely unaware that someone had already made a flag about shaving their head based on the match outcome, Chen Xu now felt his state was better than ever.</p>
<p>At the same time, he felt a sense of astonishment.</p>
<p>The commentators still didn't believe in him?</p>
<p>He originally thought that after defeating one or two pro gamers, the commentators might start favoring him. During the third match, he clearly felt that shift, which was why he won by such a narrow margin.</p>
<p>And the third opponent's strength was weaker than the first two. Fortunately, at a critical moment, he once again felt that mysterious power—otherwise, that match should've been lost.</p>
<p>And now, they still didn't believe in him?</p>
<p>Although this opponent, Guadian, was indeed extremely powerful.</p>
<p>In the live stream's bullet comments, the spectators were all excited.</p>
<p>"Here we go, here we go! I wonder if Mr. Chen can beat Guadian!"</p>
<p>"It's not impossible!"</p>
<p>"Anyway, I hope Mr. Chen wins. That would be simply awesome!"</p>
<p>"I'd rather see two certain people shaving their heads!"</p>
<p>"Huh? CH (Hidden Valley)—why did Mr. Chen pick Night Elf on this map? Is he going for that expanding strategy? But this map is too small. Won't he get found immediately before Tier 2 tech finishes?"</p>
<p>Many knowledgeable players in the live stream room were slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>A key characteristic of this map was its narrow terrain, which wasn't friendly for large late-game army engagements with high food/supply.</p>
<p>But the key point was that the Orcs' power spike wasn't that late. Once they reached Tier 2, combining Wolf Riders' high mobility and Ensnare, whether they went for the AOE-burst Tauren or the Shamans for control and healing points, they were extremely effective against the squishy Night Elf units.</p>
<p>And most importantly, Chen Xu's previous expanding strategy would be nearly impossible to execute effectively on this map.</p>
<p>Huang Donglai and Sun Yixie were also explaining the current situation, after all, this involved their hair.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen built structures in a straight line to block the entrance, preventing the enemy's Blademaster from rushing early. The Ancient of War is placed next to a neutral creep camp to level up, then return to block the entrance. But he only built one Archer, and chose Demon Hunter as his starting unit instead of neutral creeps?" Huang Donglai was puzzled.</p>
<p>"This is somewhat standard, yet somewhat unconventional!" Sun Yixie also admitted he didn't fully understand.</p>
<p>"But Guadian here is very confident, going straight for the default opening: Altar of Storms, Burrow, barracks, Shop (in-game)," Sun Yixie continued.</p>
<p>"Ah, he directly farmed a nearby Fat Ogre and got lucky—an item dropped: Circlet of Nobility, all attributes +2. That's a really good item. But he's not continuing to farm? He's going straight to the neutral shop?"</p>
