<p>Chapter 149: While Others Play <em>It Takes Two</em>, We're Sword Fighting (Fifth Update, Please Subscribe for Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>There were quite a few lone wolf players just like Song Ren.</p>
<p>Originally, many players had some interest in <em>It Takes Two</em>, but due to the high threshold of requiring two players, they chose to wait and see for now.</p>
<p>But soon, they discovered something—whether on live streaming platforms, video platforms, or within the player community—this game was completely different from Chen Xu's <em>Overcooked</em> released last year.</p>
<p>First, there was the game's scale.</p>
<p>With its cartoon art style and two-player co-op gameplay, these two elements combined easily led players to assume it was an Independent Game or a low-budget production.</p>
<p>Yet <em>It Takes Two</em> was entirely different. In terms of content and scale, it was on par with some blockbuster titles.</p>
<p>Even more crucially, everything shown in the promotional trailer Chen Xu had previously released wasn’t just hype—it actually appeared in the game.</p>
<p>Different scenes paired with unique special abilities, along with cinematic animations throughout the gameplay, made players feel as if they were watching an interactive movie.</p>
<p>In terms of player experience, it contrasted sharply with <em>Overcooked</em> from last year, where players started out cheerful, gradually became Hyped Up, and eventually ended in arguments that turned 'cooking chaos' into 'breakup chaos'.</p>
<p>The content showcased by <em>It Takes Two</em> so far was far too heartwarming.</p>
<p>This was primarily due to the game's design.</p>
<p><em>Overcooked</em> focused purely on cooperation and tacit understanding.</p>
<p>When cooperation failed and players' timing didn’t align, it naturally led to blame. If one couldn’t self-<strong>counter</strong>, it inevitably escalated into arguments.</p>
<p>But <em>It Takes Two</em> was completely different.</p>
<p>This game featured puzzle-solving and skill-based <strong>operations</strong> as well. If both players were clumsy, then it was a case of the pot calling the kettle black—everyone laughed together while playing.</p>
<p>And if one player was more skilled while the other struggled, the <strong>Split-screen</strong> mode allowed both to clearly see where the problem lay.</p>
<p>Unlike in <em>Overcooked</em>, where everyone thought they were right and the other was wrong, here the issue was transparent.</p>
<p>Once the problem was identified, players could patiently guide each other, deepening their emotional bonds, friendship, and connection.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game's <strong>story</strong> and <strong>Level Design</strong> were excellent at evoking emotions and facilitating <strong>conflict</strong> resolution.</p>
<p>Even the Book of Love in the game, which specialized in <strong>instigating</strong>, attracted a lot of player attention. In a way, it diverted focus away from interpersonal tension.</p>
<p>With a shared goal, arguments became rare, replaced instead by true teamwork.</p>
<p>After the game <strong>launched</strong>, especially on various live streaming platforms, many streamers—facing a game drought—paired up to play <em>It Takes Two</em>.</p>
<p>The entertaining and joyful atmosphere drew in many players who originally hadn’t planned to buy the game, making them unable to resist spending money.</p>
<p>But how were lone wolf players supposed to find teammates?</p>
<p>Naturally, they had to frequent major game forums and communities to search.</p>
<p>Soon, forums were flooded with similar friendship-seeking posts:</p>
<p>'Looking for a friend who can play long-term, preferably with a good temper, to play <em>It Takes Two</em> together!'</p>
<p>'Seeking a buddy, gender doesn’t matter, good temper and long online hours preferred. I’ll provide the game, you bring the player?'</p>
<p>'I’ll provide the game, you bring the player. Let’s enjoy <em>It Takes Two</em> this weekend. DM me if interested!'</p>
<p>Many players had previously been unable to experience this game simply because they were alone.</p>
<p>But lured by the game’s appeal, they began searching for partners.</p>
<p>And in doing so, many realized they weren’t the only ones feeling isolated.</p>
<p>There were numerous other players with similar experiences, also forced to play alone due to various reasons.</p>
<p>In that moment, many players who had previously felt <strong>lonely</strong> realized they weren’t so alone after all.</p>
<p>If there was one thing that felt off to them,</p>
<p>it was that on community forums, players who had experienced <em>It Takes Two</em> and were raving about it were all <strong>in pairs</strong>—either couples or romantic partners.</p>
<p>But when they looked back at their own team-seeking peers, it was uniformly <strong>Real Man</strong> after <strong>Real Man</strong>.</p>
<p>While others were <strong>in pairs</strong> playing <em>It Takes Two</em>, why had it turned into 'Male Bonding Takes Two' with mutual sword fighting for them?</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>But whether it was <em>It Takes Two</em> or <em>Male Bonding Takes Two</em>,</p>
<p>one thing was certain:</p>
<p>After experiencing the game, players were completely amazed by its <strong>Level Design</strong>.</p>
<p>Especially as the <strong>story</strong> progressed, the game’s content proved incredibly rich.</p>
<p>Beyond the various <strong>mini-games</strong>, the gameplay was presented in many other creative ways.</p>
<p>Each theme came with its own <strong>Special Item</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, after transitioning from the Greatwood level into a room, May and Cody were captured by a space ape and taken to a space-themed scene.</p>
<p>There, the two gained new items.</p>
<p>May obtained <strong>Shoes</strong> that defied gravity, while Cody received a belt that allowed him to grow in size.</p>
<p>Using these two new items, the space-themed level delivered a strange, dreamlike experience akin to teleportation through time and space.</p>
<p>However, from this point on, the game’s narrative finally reached an intense <strong>conflict</strong>.</p>
<p>Cody and May, having transformed from humans into dolls, naturally found it difficult to accept.</p>
<p>Originally, they wanted to ask their daughter how they could return to normal.</p>
<p>But they discovered their daughter seemed completely unable to hear or see them.</p>
<p>Cody believed they had been struck by <strong>Magic (attack type)</strong>, transformed into dolls by their daughter Rose’s tears.</p>
<p>Therefore, if they could make Rose cry again, they might turn back into humans.</p>
<p>This was also why Cody and May were obstructed by the space ape.</p>
<p>A line from the space ape left a deep impression on players—'You’ll only make her cry!'</p>
<p>To further strengthen his point, the space ape even pulled out a tape recorder.</p>
<p>To make Rose cry, Cody and May quickly agreed on a plan: head to their daughter’s toy <strong>castle</strong> and destroy her favorite toys, making her cry from sorrow.</p>
<p>"How could parents do such a thing? That's too much!" Wang Han said, watching the scene after returning home from eating hotpot and continuing to play <em>It Takes Two</em>.</p>
<p>Destroying their daughter’s cherished toys to make her cry, combined with the space ape’s earlier behavior, was deeply ironic.</p>
<p>"But from a story perspective, it's somewhat understandable," Zhang Yi scratched his head. "After all, they turned from humans into dolls, and their daughter doesn’t react to them at all."</p>
<p>"That's true," Wang Han nodded thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"But more importantly, it's about communication. It reminds me of when I was a kid—my mom sold all my card collection as scrap, and I cried for ages!" Zhang Yi sighed with emotion.</p>
<p>"You had it rough. My childhood was happy—my parents never threw away my toys," Wang Han said with a triumphant smile.</p>
<p>"That's the importance of communication and mutual understanding!" Zhang Yi said.</p>
<p>"Absolutely," Wang Han agreed.</p>
<p>"So promise me—you’ll never throw away my figurines and models, okay?" Zhang Yi grinned.</p>
<p>Wang Han: …………</p>
<p>So that’s what this was leading to!</p>
<p>"Oh, come on! When have I ever thrown away your figurines? I even bought the glass display cabinet for you!" Wang Han replied irritably.</p>
<p>"Hehe, come on, let’s focus on beating this level. Watch the story, watch the story!" Zhang Yi quickly laughed and changed the subject.</p>
<p>Two updates first, two more before midnight</p>
