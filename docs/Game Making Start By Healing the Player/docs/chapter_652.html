                <p>Chapter 651: Mr. Chen, You Can Even Break Hearts with an MMORPG? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Historically, everyone in Darrowshire was slaughtered.</p>
<p>But in this re-enacted 'history,' Chromie's magic allowed Song Ren and his companions to participate in this cruel war of the past.</p>
<p>Defeating the corrupted Captain Redpath to save his soul and Darrowshire.</p>
<p>Finally, as the last of Captain Joseph Redpath’s health bar was depleted, his agitated eyes cleared, and sounds of excited joy filled the air.</p>
<p>'The Scourge has been defeated! Darrowshire is saved!'</p>
<p>Innumerable people began to cheer.</p>
<p>Everyone cast their weapons aside.</p>
<p>Amidst the cheers of the people of Darrowshire, their figures grew increasingly blurry, eventually fading away. These were all their lingering obsessions, all their unwillingness and attachments.</p>
<p>But as the Darrowshire they had tirelessly defended was finally safe, they found release in that moment.</p>
<p>Paladin Davi and Joseph Redpath's souls stood in the village, smiling at Song Ren and his friends.</p>
<p>Davi offered Song Ren and his companions the highest Paladin salute: “The war is over, and the people of Darrowshire are saved, all thanks to you, dear Dwarf, Elf, and Gnome friends. You are all heroes of Darrowshire!”</p>
<p>Joseph Redpath also expressed his gratitude: “My eyes were clouded by darkness, but you saved me from evil black magic. Thank you.”</p>
<p>Finally… the battle was over, the images of the past dissipated, and the tormented souls of Darrowshire could finally find peace.</p>
<p>“Let’s go, let’s go see little Pamela!”</p>
<p>Having completed the quest, Song Ren let out a long breath. Zhang Yi and the others next to him nodded with emotion.</p>
<p>Returning to Pamela, the little girl happily ran out at the sight of Song Ren and his group.</p>
<p>'The battle is over! I heard Papa talking to me.'</p>
<p>'He scared all the Undead away by himself! And he said he’s on his way home, I’m so happy! He also said that if you came to our house, I should give you a good welcome.'</p>
<p>'So I’ve already brewed tea! I hope you like tea with lots and lots of sugar.'</p>
<p>Listening to Pamela’s innocent and adorable words, Song Ren and his friends sighed deeply. This was probably one of the most moving quests they had ever done in a game.</p>
<p>Pamela continued with a smile.</p>
<p>'Papa asked me to give you this key. He said you can use it to open a box behind the house.'</p>
<p>'He also wants me to thank you. Did you help him? Did you tell him that you helped me find my doll?'</p>
<p>'Well, here’s the key… Thank you, you are all kind sirs!'</p>
<p>This key was the reward for completing the quest, capable of opening the treasure chest behind the house. Upon opening it, they found several blue-tier pieces of equipment with good stats.</p>
<p>However, Song Ren and his friends weren’t focused on the equipment.</p>
<p>Because at the entrance of the house, the redeemed Joseph Redpath had returned.</p>
<p>Seeing Joseph Redpath’s figure, Pamela excitedly ran over.</p>
<p>'Papa?'</p>
<p>'Papa, you’re back? Papa, you’re back!'</p>
<p>'Let’s go play! No, tell me a story, Papa!'</p>
<p>'No, let’s go pick flowers! And drink tea! I found my toy doll, did I tell you?'</p>
<p>'I really missed you, Papa!'</p>
<p>Looking at Pamela rushing towards him, Joseph, with a smile, gently embraced his daughter. The two waved at Song Ren and his group, then turned and walked out of the house.</p>
<p>'Papa, where are we going?'</p>
<p>'Dear, shall we go home?'</p>
<p>'But isn't this our home?'</p>
<p>'No, our home isn’t here anymore. Our new home is filled with golden sunlight everywhere, and Mama is waiting for us there too.'</p>
<p>'Mama is waiting for us too? Then, Papa, let’s hurry!'</p>
<p>'We’re going home!'</p>
<p>In the twilight, Joseph held Pamela's hand, walking forward and eventually disappearing into the sunset.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Watching the figures, one large and one small, disappear, Song Ren sniffled.</p>
<p>He felt a sting in his eyes and nose.</p>
<p>Beside him, the more emotional Joey, had a catch in his voice.</p>
<p>“Damn it, Chen Xu, you haven't changed! Why make a quest in an MMORPG so melodramatic!” Zhang Yi cursed, but his voice also choked up a little.</p>
<p>In his previous life, this quest in <em>World of Warcraft</em>, known as the Battle for Darrowshire, had moved many players as well.</p>
<p>And that was still when the technology wasn't capable of perfectly rendering visual effects.</p>
<p>Now, under VR, the performance directly brought many players to tears.</p>
<p>And also a bit of heartache.</p>
<p>Who would have thought that an MMORPG could also hit them so hard?</p>
<p>It seems Mr. Chen truly hasn't forgotten his original intention!</p>
<p>“Come on, let’s level up two more times, then go help Old Man Fordring retrieve that painting.”</p>
<p>Looking at his teammates, Song Ren changed the subject.</p>
<p>Hearing Song Ren’s words, the four companions just nodded heavily.</p>
<p>Pamela and Redpath were already dead; all that remained were their souls.</p>
<p>But Old Man Fordring and his son, whom they had encountered in the Plaguelands earlier, were still alive!</p>
<p>Their sole thought now, after the emotional fluctuations from Pamela’s quest, was to let Old Man Fordring and his son live happily.</p>
<p>This was also the thought shared by many other players.</p>
<p>For most players, the Plaguelands was definitely a detestable place.</p>
<p>There was simply no reason to like it.</p>
<p>A barren wasteland, dilapidated towns, and disgusting monsters everywhere.</p>
<p>And the monsters here often appeared in groups, so one careless mistake and you’d be running back to your corpse.</p>
<p>But the Plaguelands was also a place that left a deep impression on countless players.</p>
<p>The story of the little girl Pamela and Darrowshire touched innumerable players.</p>
<p>At the same time, both the Western Plaguelands and Eastern Plaguelands evoked countless memories for veteran <em>Warcraft</em> players.</p>
<p>South of Mistyblight Summit, there was a place blessed by the Holy Light.</p>
<p>That was the tomb of Uther the Lightbringer, leader of the Knights of the Silver Hand.</p>
<p>Besides that, the renowned Stratholme in the Eastern Plaguelands also left many <em>Warcraft</em> players deeply moved.</p>
<p>It was in Stratholme that Arthas, then still a Paladin, clashed in ideology with Uther the Lightbringer and Jaina.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the lonely Prince, to prevent the plague from spreading, raised his blade and killed the citizens he had once sworn to protect.</p>
<p>Afterward, the rage for revenge gradually made Arthas paranoid, which was the main catalyst for him to venture to Northrend, seeking Frostmourne to gain power and kill the Dreadlord.</p>
<p>It can be said that many scenes in the Plaguelands were closely related to the stories in <em>Warcraft</em>.</p>
<p>Yet, these stories were also incredibly sorrowful histories.</p>
<p>This was also reflected in the quests of the Plaguelands.</p>
<p>Breaking hearts, it only takes one time and then countless more.</p>
<p>Slowly engaging with the various quests in <em>World of Warcraft</em> made players gradually feel the 'malice' emanating from a certain individual.</p>
<p>Initially, the quests didn't have such a strong impact; they were meant to ease you in.</p>
<p>Now that you've fallen into the huge pit of <em>Warcraft</em> and are almost max level, it's about time your souls received another baptism of love.</p>
<p>As future versions are updated, the number of moving quests will certainly not decrease; it will only grow.</p>
<p>Bradenbrad, who died alone in the Argent Crusade's prerequisite quests, Dardanaga, who could only be honored with Bloodpetal Sprouts after feeding them before the Cataclysm…</p>
<p>Never forgetting the original intention – that is Nebula Games’ excellent motto.</p>
