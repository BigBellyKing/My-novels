<p>Chapter 391: The Painted Cake Can Actually Be Eaten! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>As Chen Xu finished speaking, he didn’t continue to leave in suspense.</p>
<p>Soon, the large screen began playing a series of scenes.</p>
<p>In a cramped kitchen, two people worked together in perfect tacit understanding, chopping vegetables, cooking, and serving dishes.</p>
<p>A group of tiny figures resembling candy beans pushed and shoved each other, fighting for the crown at the top.</p>
<p>Cody and May, transformed into puppets and dirt people.</p>
<p>An Undead kneeling on one knee before a bonfire.</p>
<p>A Hunter in Astera Settlement grabbing onto a Wingdrake's foot, heading toward the New World.</p>
<p>In addition, there were also works from numerous third-party game developers.</p>
<p>The audience below watched, thoroughly surprised.</p>
<p>Of course, the releases of <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> on Switch would likely still take some time and might involve graphical downgrades.</p>
<p>After all, even though the hardware capabilities of the Switch developed by Chen Xu in this Parallel World were superior to those of his previous life,</p>
<p>the visual presentation of <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> in this world was also stronger than in his previous life.</p>
<p>Watching the scenes on the big screen, many players began quietly exchanging thoughts and discussing among themselves, their faces lit up with excitement.</p>
<p>Games like <em>It Takes Two</em>, <em>Overcooked</em>, and <em>Fall Guys</em> had already been ported, with clear notices displayed below.</p>
<p>As for <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> and <em>Dark Souls</em>, many veteran players exchanged knowing smiles.</p>
<p>Here it comes!</p>
<p>The familiar part of painting the picture!</p>
<p>The games haven’t arrived yet, but the promotional video has.</p>
<p>However, what Chen Xu said next quickly surprised many players.</p>
<p>"On the Switch, we will gradually port some classic games. But on the Switch, there will also be brand-new exclusive titles specially adapted for the platform."</p>
<p>Games specifically developed for the Switch handheld console!?</p>
<p>The crowd wore stunned expressions.</p>
<p>So the so-called new games were actually being developed specifically for the Switch!?</p>
<p>After seeing all the animal plushies at the exhibition site, many players had already mentally prepared themselves.</p>
<p>Yet upon hearing Chen Xu’s words, they were still astonished—because these so-called new games would be Switch exclusives, not launching on PC or VR platforms!</p>
<p>Still, this sparked intense curiosity—what kind of exclusive games could they possibly be?</p>
<p>After all, Chen Xu’s intention was clearly evident: to attract players to buy the Switch through the attraction of exclusive titles.</p>
<p>"As for the genres of the new games, I'm sure you're all quite curious. First is <em>Animal Forest</em>, a game every tough guy must play." As Chen Xu spoke, the audience stirred.</p>
<p>As gamers, there were still many male players present at the exhibition.</p>
<p>And what man doesn't consider himself a tough guy?</p>
<p>A game every tough guy must play! Hearing Chen Xu’s words, every player in the audience became excited.</p>
<p>But as the video began playing, the previously excited players froze.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen, could you please repeat that? This is really a game every tough guy must play?</p>
<p>The screen displayed gameplay footage.</p>
<p>A clear blue sea stretched beneath a cloudless sky, with fluffy white clouds floating overhead.</p>
<p>Gentle waves lapped against golden sand.</p>
<p>Under a coconut tree, several lounge chairs sat, one occupied by a resident leisurely sunbathing.</p>
<p>High in a distant Greatwood, cicadas chirped incessantly.</p>
<p>In front of a tent, a resident happily picked up a piece of wood from the ground and carried it inside.</p>
<p>On a flower-filled lawn, islanders sat at a table—some reading, others sipping afternoon tea.</p>
<p>By the riverside, two islanders held buckets and fished quietly.</p>
<p>In autumn, leaves rustled to the ground as some islanders swept them up, others catching insects with nets.</p>
<p>In winter, some warmed themselves by fires outside their homes, while others built snowmen.</p>
<p>In spring, groups carefully tended gardens and fruit trees.</p>
<p>At night, everyone sat on benches, admiring the moonlight.</p>
<p>Finally, in front of a house, everyone smiled as they took a group photo.</p>
<p>Image after image of joyful island life flashed across the screen, radiating harmony and heartwarming charm.</p>
<p>But that wasn't the main issue.</p>
<p>The main issue was—Mr. Chen, could you please repeat what kind of game this is a must-play for?</p>
<p>This is supposed to be a game for tough guys!?</p>
<p>Many players in the audience were completely bewildered.</p>
<p>But soon, they snapped back to reality. Clearly, this was just a playful joke.</p>
<p>Just like when Mr. Chen jokingly called himself the Warrior of Love, only to be teased by them in return.</p>
<p>This game titled <em>Animal Forest</em> was obviously an official, unconventional meme played by Mr. Chen himself.</p>
<p>However, apart from the bewildered male players, some female players were extremely excited and thrilled.</p>
<p>Because this art style was absolutely delightful!</p>
<p>All those cute little animals were simply adorable!</p>
<p>"Next up is a uniquely designed platformer game—<em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>! Modern cities, deserts, forests, oceans... You'll explore over a dozen distinct themed scenes, and the game also supports two-player co-op mode." As the <em>Animal Forest</em> promotional video ended, a new video began playing on the large screen under Chen Xu’s introduction.</p>
<p>Cheerful music filled the exhibition area as a giant hat-shaped airship appeared on screen.</p>
<p>"Above the Peach Princess’s castle..." appeared as a subtitle.</p>
<p>Then, Bowser, a giant spiked turtle wearing a suit and a white top hat, appeared on screen.</p>
<p>Before him stood Mario, the plumber in his red cap.</p>
<p>The two clashed fiercely on the deck of a castle that resembled a spaceship, but Mario was clearly no match for the mighty Bowser.</p>
<p>"Haha! It's over now!"</p>
<p>Bowser hurled his white top hat, striking Mario directly.</p>
<p>Peach reached out in worry.</p>
<p>Looking down at Mario’s red cap lying by his feet, Bowser stomped on it with one foot.</p>
<p>"I, the great king, shall marry Princess Peach!"</p>
<p>"Feel bitter about it, Mario!?"</p>
<p>"Hahahahaha..."</p>
<p>With Bowser’s slightly dramatic lines, it was clearly the classic trope: a dragon kidnaps the princess, and the hero goes to rescue her.</p>
<p>But this hero named Mario... honestly, didn’t quite match most players’ image of a hero.</p>
<p>Amidst Bowser’s maniacal laughter, the screen went dark.</p>
<p>Then came a rapid series of cuts, revealing one exotic world after another to the players.</p>
<p>The Metro Kingdom, set in a modern cityscape.</p>
<p>The Forest Kingdom, teeming with life.</p>
<p>The Seaside Kingdom, with sandy beaches and oceans.</p>
<p>In addition, there were the Desert Kingdom, the Snow Kingdom...</p>
<p>"Of course, I'm sure you're all eager to personally experience these two games and the unique features of the Switch."</p>
<p>"On-site, we've prepared plenty of devices for everyone to try out the games firsthand."</p>
<p>As the video ended, Chen Xu announced another piece of news that thrilled every player.</p>
<p>"Damn it! There's actually a demo session!"</p>
<p>"Did I hear that right?! This... this isn’t just painting the picture!"</p>
<p>"They're back! Everything’s back! I can actually get to eat this piece of cake!"</p>
<p>"Stunned!"</p>
<p>"Don’t talk—let’s get in line now!"</p>
<p>Many veteran players of Nebula Games were completely stunned at this moment.</p>
<p>This instantly brought back memories for those who had attended the very first Nebula Games exhibition.</p>
<p>Back then, Nebula Games had been just as impressive!</p>
<p>At that time, <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em> had completely stolen the show at the exhibition.</p>
<p>But that was only for that one year.</p>
<p>The next year, the second Nebula Games exhibition had no playable demos.</p>
<p>What, you say there was that one with The one with the big hammer the following year?</p>
<p>Could you even call that a game!?</p>
<p>That was a low blood pressure treatment device!</p>
<p>Now, after several years, the playable demo segment of Nebula Games’ exhibition was back!</p>
<p>Previously, some players hadn’t shown much excitement over the promotional videos for <em>Animal Forest</em> and <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>.</p>
<p>Mainly because they felt the games seemed a bit too childish. Although everyone trusted Nebula Games’ reputation, and knew that a game’s quality couldn’t be judged solely by its trailer—only actual gameplay could reveal the truth—</p>
<p>the problem was, they might never actually get to play them.</p>
<p>So naturally, most players weren’t particularly interested.</p>
<p>But now, no one had expected that at this exhibition, they’d actually get to eat the cake.</p>
<p>And just like that, everyone’s excitement skyrocketed.</p>
