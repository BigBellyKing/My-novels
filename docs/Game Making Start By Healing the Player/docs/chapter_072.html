                <h2>Chapter 72: Could You Be the Master of Love?</h2>
<p>As more and more streamers began live-streaming <em>Overcooked</em>, and an increasing number of video creators produced content about it, more and more players were exposed to the game.</p>
<p>On community forums, discussions about the game were everywhere.</p>
<p>‘Breakup’ and ‘Friendship over’ became keywords associated with the game.</p>
<p>Especially as the game’s popularity surged, Tieba, forums, and various Q&amp;A communities were flooded with stories players made up on the spot.</p>
<p>For example: <em>My girlfriend and I were deeply in love, but after playing </em>Overcooked<em>, we broke up and our friendship ended.</em></p>
<p>Of course, occasionally some of these stories were true. However, for those couples who actually broke up because of <em>Overcooked</em>, the game was merely a spark that ignited the fuse.</p>
<p>Their relationships had already been like gunpowder—ready to explode at the slightest touch.</p>
<p>Still, this didn’t stop the spread of <em>Overcooked</em> memes.</p>
<p>After Valentine’s Day, <em>Overcooked</em>’s popularity climbed geometrically every single day.</p>
<p>Major online communities buzzed with playful discussions among players.</p>
<p>Moreover, in various live stream rooms, whenever streamers or video creators turned red-faced and argued over gameplay elements, viewers would timely flood the screen with bullet comments like ‘Breakup!’ and ‘Going solo!’</p>
<p>After all, enjoying drama is practically human instinct.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>While players were playing along with memes and personally experiencing what ‘Breakup Kitchen’ truly meant,</p>
<p>On the official Weibo account, a trending topic had been pushed to the top of the PC game category’s homepage:</p>
<p>‘How do you evaluate game designer Chen Xu, who calls himself a “Warrior of Love,” for choosing to launch <em>Overcooked</em> on Valentine’s Day and releasing an extremely romantic and heartwarming promotional video?’</p>
<p>Under this post, players flooded in with all kinds of responses.</p>
<p>‘Don’t even talk to me about that Warrior of Love! I was naive enough to believe Chen Xu actually made a warm and wholesome game. My girlfriend and I broke up after playing <em>Overcooked</em>! Chen Xu, compensate me for my lost girlfriend!’</p>
<p>‘Bro above, what happened? Did you break your hand?’</p>
<p>‘Yeah! Bro, don’t give up on treatment! Modern medicine is so advanced—go to the hospital quickly, maybe they can reattach your girlfriend!’</p>
<p>‘Don’t worry, bro, you had two girlfriends anyway—losing one isn’t a big deal.’</p>
<p>‘You guys are going too far! The OP is already suffering enough.’</p>
<p>‘Ahem, friendly reminder: open this OP’s profile page. You’ll find a surprise.’</p>
<p>‘Damn it! OP, wasn’t your last post saying you broke up with your boyfriend? Are you male or female?’</p>
<p>‘Young man, your mindset is too narrow! Can’t a guy have a boyfriend? Add me as a friend—I’ll show you something amazing!’</p>
<p>‘You guys are off-topic! Anyway, I feel Chen Xu is full of malice! He already showed his colors with <em>Outlast</em>!’</p>
<p>‘It’s not just <em>Outlast</em>! Think carefully about all the games Chen Xu has developed before. Reflect. Really reflect.’</p>
<p>‘Exactly! Chen Xu is no Warrior of Love. Think carefully—every game he’s made so far cuts like a knife!’</p>
<p>‘Right! Take <em>To the Moon</em>—seemingly heartwarming, but in the end, Johnny only got false memories. At its core, it’s still a tragedy! And <em>Undertale</em> has its Genocide Ending. As for <em>Mirror (Game)</em>? Beat the Tauren. Pure love warriors never retreat!’</p>
<p>‘Exactly! We strongly suggest the Game Department take action. Chen Xu’s games are truly dangerous! <em>Outlast</em> only tried to scare us to death, but <em>Overcooked</em> wants us to engage in real-person PK now!’</p>
<p>This Super Topic gathered over twenty thousand comments in just one day.</p>
<p>Of course, there were also some dissenting voices.</p>
<p>Many players said <em>Overcooked</em> wasn’t that exaggerated—they’d played it with friends and lovers, cooperated, tricked each other, and had a great time.</p>
<p>However, these comments clearly stood isolated and outnumbered.</p>
<p>The dominant sentiment remained: never again would they believe Chen Xu was the so-called ‘Warrior of Love.’</p>
<p>…………………</p>
<p>At Nebula Games.</p>
<p>After the New Year’s Holiday, employees from various departments had gradually returned to work.</p>
<p>At the company’s rest area, Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin sat with mischievous smiles, staring at Chen Xu.</p>
<p>‘Mr. Chen, your conspiracy has been exposed!’ Yang Xin showed Chen Xu the Super Topic.</p>
<p>‘Exactly!’ Ruan Ningxue chimed in.</p>
<p>When they were developing <em>Overcooked</em>, and when they filmed the promotional video, the naive duo genuinely believed this was a warm, wholesome game that strengthened relationships.</p>
<p>During development, when certain internal signs appeared, they thought it was just a coincidence.</p>
<p>But now, with the game launched, terms like ‘Breakup Kitchen’ and ‘Friendship Over Kitchen,’ plus this trending topic, instantly made them realize:</p>
<p>Beneath <em>Overcooked</em>’s seemingly warm exterior lay sheer malice!</p>
<p>‘Sigh, the world is declining, and people’s hearts have changed! You two are co-developers—how can you hold such thoughts?’ Chen Xu looked at them solemnly, offering a serious explanation.</p>
<p>‘Why are so many players breaking up? Because their relationships were already flawed!’</p>
<p>‘Why do breakups happen? Because they can’t communicate or reach consensus in the game. Because when one makes a mistake under time pressure, the other blames them, pouring oil on the fire. Because when one is slow and can’t keep up, the other grows impatient and dismissive.’</p>
<p>‘Therefore, the true core of <em>Overcooked</em> is to teach couples and friends the essence of coexistence—the real preservative for genuine friendship and love: communication, tolerance, and patience.’</p>
<p>‘If any of these three elements are missing, cracks in the relationship naturally appear.’</p>
<p>As Chen Xu finished speaking, Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue, sitting across from him, fell silent.</p>
<p>After a long pause, Yang Xin stared at Chen Xu with a strange look: ‘Could… could you be the legendary Master of Love?’</p>
<p>‘Chen Xu, why are you always able to come up with such convincing, eloquent speeches?’ Ruan Ningxue also looked utterly speechless.</p>
<p>This scene felt strangely familiar!</p>
<p>Back during <em>Outlast</em>, there had been a similar explanation.</p>
<p>Was this a Matryoshka doll?</p>
<p>If it weren’t for the precedent of <em>Outlast</em>, the two might have actually believed him.</p>
<p>‘You think it makes sense? Then the truth must be exactly as I said. I’m a producer who genuinely cares about players!’ Chen Xu smiled.</p>
<p>Their expressions didn’t change at all.</p>
<p>Why did it feel to both of them like Chen Xu was just fooling them?</p>
<p>Hmm… no, more accurately, fooling the players.</p>
<p>Watching Chen Xu pull out his phone, open the official Weibo account, polish up his words, and send them out, the two exchanged glances.</p>
<p>They both saw the exact same thought in each other’s eyes: <em>From now on, we must be extra careful. Mr. Chen’s deception skills are no ordinary thing!</em></p>
