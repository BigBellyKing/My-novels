                <p>Chapter 47: Players and the Industry in Heated Discussion</p>
<p>October 31st, early morning. Chen Xu uploaded a pre-recorded video to his official Weibo account right on schedule.</p>
<p>He also posted a message: Guess what the new game is?</p>
<p>Though it was the middle of the night, there were still quite a few night owls among the players following Chen Xu's official Weibo.</p>
<p>As soon as the message was posted, it didn't take long before it caught the attention of some players.</p>
<p>'What's going on? Look what I just found! Does Chen Xu have a new game?'</p>
<p>'He posted this at midnight? That timing is just too something!'</p>
<p>'My God, what kind of video is this! Posting it late at night—I thought it was something fun!'</p>
<p>'Wait, what the hell is this video? A horror game?'</p>
<p>'Damn it! This DV footage is way too grim!'</p>
<p>'So the next game Chen Xu is making is a horror game?'</p>
<p>'Horror game or not, I don't really care. But the timing of this post is just way too grim!'</p>
<p>'So the next game is related to DV footage?'</p>
<p>Many players were Taken Aback.</p>
<p>After all, Chen Xu's intention was extremely clear. This incredibly grim video was clearly meant to tell players: his next new work is a horror game.</p>
<p>But what sparked even more discussion among players was the timing of this announcement.</p>
<p>The next day, Chen Xu's Weibo post triggered numerous reposts and reports from various gaming media.</p>
<p>After all, the popularity from Chen Xu's previous win of the Zhengyou Award with To the Moon still lingered a little.</p>
<p>Plus, with November just around the corner, there were currently no major blockbusters worth mentioning in the market.</p>
<p>As for Chen Xu's video, players began discussing and analyzing what kind of theme his new game might have.</p>
<p>Even within the horror genre, there are different themes.</p>
<p>'There's DV footage and it seems to be set in an indoor office—looks like it's set in the Contemporary Era.'</p>
<p>'Handheld DV filming something, yet the entire video is eerily silent. Considering how chaotic the room appears, can we boldly speculate that ghosts can only be seen through the DV?'</p>
<p>'Walking with a handheld DV through dark hallways and rooms, suddenly a ghastly face appears on the screen, then drags the cameraman into the dark Abyss!'</p>
<p>'MMP, you dramatic bunch! There's nothing concrete here—can you stop making wild guesses? I watched this in broad daylight and still felt chills all over!'</p>
<p>'You're way too scared already? I suggest you wear a diaper when you play or watch it later.'</p>
<p>'It was truly grim. I saw this late last night, and even though it revealed nothing, I ended up scaring myself, thinking someone was under my bed. I was mentally drained for half the night.'</p>
<p>Online discussions were animated, but most were just random speculations. After all, Chen Xu's video was only meant to hint that his next project is a horror game.</p>
<p>But the specific game type remained undisclosed.</p>
<p>Not only players, but also industry designers and gaming media began heatedly discussing the topic.</p>
<p>'Have you heard? Chen Xu's new work is actually a horror game!'</p>
<p>'A bit unexpected. Never thought Chen Xu would choose to Get his hands on a horror game first.'</p>
<p>'Not too surprising though. For small teams and Independent Game designers, horror games are actually a relatively accessible entry point.'</p>
<p>'Small team? Chen Xu isn't exactly a small team. Haven't you seen Nebula Games' profile? His Team (mode) isn't that small.'</p>
<p>'Makes sense. After all, both Undertale and To the Moon sold pretty well.'</p>
<p>'Still, horror games are quite niche. Even overseas, there haven't been many outstanding horror games, let alone domestically.'</p>
<p>'Yeah, even though VR seems like a good fit for horror games, market demand and development cost remain big issues.'</p>
<p>'I think Chen Xu's horror game might just be hanging a sheep's head and selling dog meat.'</p>
<p>'What do you mean?'</p>
<p>'Look at To the Moon and Undertale—clearly, Chen Xu is a designer who excels at storytelling. So, is it possible that this so-called horror game is merely cloaked in a horror facade, while actually delivering a heartwarming story?'</p>
<p>'Now that you mention it, that does sound plausible. Didn't Chen Xu once call himself a Warrior of Love?'</p>
<p>'Makes sense!'</p>
<p>Industry designers discussed Chen Xu and the news of his new work.</p>
<p>But for various gaming self-media chasing traffic, it was nothing short of a chaotic spectacle.</p>
<p>'Chen Xu Releases Strange Video Late at Night—What Are His Intentions?'</p>
<p>'From Heartwarming to Horror? Game Designer Chen Xu Switches to Horror Games!'</p>
<p>'Abandoning His Strengths to Try Niche Horror Games—Confidence or Recklessness?'</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>One headline after another flooded websites and forums.</p>
<p>Larger media outlets managed to maintain a relatively neutral stance.</p>
<p>But for marketing accounts and second- and third-tier gaming media, it was all about setting the narrative.</p>
<p>This was mainly due to the game type Chen Xu had chosen.</p>
<p>After all, the gaming industry hadn't seen an excellent horror game in years.</p>
<p>While it wasn't entirely a stagnant pool, the horror game market lacked vitality.</p>
<p>Some horror games selling moderately well were mostly established IPs, and their annual sales continued to decline.</p>
<p>Horror game themes were incredibly diverse.</p>
<p>Domestic themes: Zombie, female ghost.</p>
<p>Overseas themes: Serial killers, devils.</p>
<p>Real-world, surreal.</p>
<p>All kinds existed.</p>
<p>Yet none had achieved massive commercial success.</p>
<p>The main reason was that these horror games hadn't broken out of a certain mold.</p>
<p>They still relied on jump scares, shooting mechanics, and tightly-paced story progression.</p>
<p>It's not that this model was bad—just that making it truly outstanding was extremely difficult.</p>
<p>In the previous life, how many combined shooter-horror games could truly be considered memorable?</p>
<p>Only Resident Evil and Dead Space. And even then, only the former remained a top-tier IP, while the latter was long dead—only revived years later when Electronic Arts had run out of old rice to fry.</p>
<p>However, for Chen Xu and the entire Nebula Games team, the online buzz had little impact.</p>
<p>Because the game's development progress was visibly advancing.</p>
<p>The game wasn't complete yet, but the early sections were already playable for testing.</p>
<p>After trying it out, Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, and the rest of the team shared only one thought:</p>
<p>There was no way in hell this could be played at night!</p>
<p>No choice—it was just too terrifying.</p>
<p>Even though the entire development team had been involved in creating it, with every element crafted collectively,</p>
<p>that didn't mean they weren't scared!</p>
