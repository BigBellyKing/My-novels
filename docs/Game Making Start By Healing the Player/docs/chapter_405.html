                <p>Chapter 404: Choosing Switch Games (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>With the launch of the overseas version of the Switch, a similar trend swept across the global market.</p>
<p>Frenzied buying, stock shortages…</p>
<p>The situation that occurred domestically two months prior was almost perfectly replicated overseas.</p>
<p>At the same time, Nebula Games also released the Switch's sales data for the first time.</p>
<p>From its domestic launch until the overseas version's release, a total of two months had passed.</p>
<p>Nebula Games has now announced the Switch's sales figures.</p>
<p>Global shipments totaled 4.1 million units.</p>
<p>This number utterly astonished major domestic game developers.</p>
<p>Because, as of now, the Switch's sales momentum is still incredibly strong. At least on major e-commerce websites, while stockouts no longer occur immediately upon release, supply can only last for a few days. Many designers and developers in the gaming industry initially thought this was due to limited future supply.</p>
<p>But now it seems it's not merely limited; it's insufficient. And from the current overseas launch, it appears the overseas market can absorb a substantial amount. If the initial success was bolstered by Nebula Games' IP, its current growth is purely a testament to the Switch handheld itself.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are the game sales on the Switch platform.</p>
<p><code>Super Mario Odyssey</code> predictably claimed the largest share of sales, with 2.11 million units sold. And one must consider that <code>Super Mario Odyssey</code> has physical cartridges, and there's a corresponding secondhand market for them. Taking this into account, doesn't it mean that <code>Super Mario Odyssey</code> has entered one out of every two Switches currently?</p>
<p>Of course, as Switch sales increase and more games are released, this number will certainly decrease. Because currently, these are the games available to play for those who bought a Switch. But even so, it's still an incredible figure.</p>
<p>Beyond these, what surprised many game developers was that some older games launched on the Switch platform also achieved impressive sales. This wasn't just true for Nebula Games' titles; even games ported by third-party studios saw excellent sales.</p>
<p>Initially, these third-party game developers simply wanted to save face with Nebula Games. After all, everyone was making a living on the Nebula Games Platform. But they never expected such high sales, comparable to, if not better than, their PC platform sales.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are the Switch online members. Although many players opted for family group memberships for the cheaper price, cheap is still not free. The Switch's performance, in short, left game developers and media in the gaming industry dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Chen Xu himself was a little surprised by this but then quickly came to terms with it. The Switch's core design philosophy was indeed astonishing. In his previous life, the Switch became the fastest-selling handheld console, a success inextricably linked to its excellent quality.</p>
<p>It wasn't solely relying on Nintendo's name to do as it pleased. Otherwise, the Wii U wouldn't have been a disaster, and the Wii's success was largely due to its blue ocean strategy, attracting many housewives with its motion controls; for most casual users, the Wii wasn't a game console but a yoga mat or a dance mat.</p>
<p>Of course, the success or failure of a game console isn't determined solely by these factors; the mass exodus of third-party developers was also a core issue.</p>
<p>It was precisely due to these complex reasons that Chen Xu initially had more options for the Switch's launch titles. For example, games like Ring Fit Adventure or 1-2-Switch. However, Chen Xu ultimately chose <code>Super Mario Odyssey</code> and <code>Animal Forest</code> as launch titles. This was because Chen Xu positioned the Switch not as a toy, but as a game console, and a platform.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>In Nebula Games' reception room, Chen Xu was also being interviewed by Game Timespace. Of course, calling it an interview was more akin to promotion.</p>
<p>After all, the Switch's current sales figures had already broken countless records set by domestic handheld consoles. Naturally, many media outlets wanted to interview him on the topic of the Switch. To better facilitate promotion, Chen Xu, unlike before, conducted numerous interviews this time.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, besides the exclusive launch titles <code>Super Mario Odyssey</code> and <code>Animal Forest</code> on the Switch, the membership library also contains quite a few new mini-games, and player feedback has been excellent. Are there any future plans for this segment?” The reporter sitting opposite Chen Xu posed the question. It wasn't pointed, but rather a question aimed at promoting the Switch.</p>
<p>“Of course,” Chen Xu nodded, explaining, “the membership game library will continue to add new mini-games. Furthermore, there are plans for ported games like <code>Minecraft</code>, as well as entirely new games specifically developed for the Switch by third-party developers.”</p>
<p>Many Switch players online currently hold these classic mini-games in high regard. Initially, most players subscribed for online multiplayer and cloud saves. But after subscribing, many idly tried out the mini-games in the membership library and instantly found themselves hooked, unable to put them down.</p>
<p>From a graphical and technical standpoint, these games are vastly different from mainstream blockbusters. Yet, players found them surprisingly fun and replayable. For instance, in Original Super Mario Bros., many players, after researching, discovered various hidden contents. Such as pipe warps and hidden blocks. Despite being a 2D side-scrolling game, the level design was quite ingenious. Besides this, there were cooperative mini-games like Snow Bros. and Metal Slug, which friends could play together, as well as shoot-’em-ups like Mushihimesama and Ikaruga. There weren't too many or too few; a total of 8 were initially added to the membership library. Coupled with the two exclusive games on sale, and numerous ported games from Nebula Games and third-party developers, the number of games on the Switch, while not massive, was certainly not small.</p>
<p>As for why players found them so replayable, games like Mushihimesama and Metal Slug were among the arcade owners' favorites in his previous life. What? You ask why arcade owners liked them? Because they were difficult and easily consumed coins! Chen Xu didn't optimize the difficulty on the Switch for these games either, merely adding new options: Challenge Mode and Easy Mode. As the names suggest, Challenge Mode meant a one-coin clear. Easy Mode meant infinite continues, respawning on the spot upon death. For players choosing Challenge Mode, these games were indeed highly replayable.</p>
<p>“Then, Mr. Chen, will there be more exclusive Switch games in the future?” the reporter asked the final question.</p>
<p>“We actually already have plans,” Chen Xu said with a smile. “As I've mentioned before, we will be releasing another exclusive Switch game in the second half of the year, and it will be an open-world game, a type of open-world game completely different from <code>Red Dead Redemption</code>.”</p>
<p>The reporter opposite Chen Xu blinked, completely dumbfounded by his words.</p>
