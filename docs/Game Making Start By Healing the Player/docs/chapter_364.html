<p>Chapter 363: Players Love Me So Deeply! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>After watching the full promotional video, many players were left with a bewildering feeling.</p>
<p>They were completely confused.</p>
<p>Although there were quite a few dialogues in it, many players simply couldn't understand them.</p>
<p>The main reason was that the story content in the entire trailer adopted a fragmented,拼组-style approach.</p>
<p>Simply put, early-game story dialogues and late-game story dialogues were separated and pieced together.</p>
<p>Without prior knowledge of the plot, players would have almost no chance of guessing correctly.</p>
<p>Of course, the purpose of doing this wasn't to act like a Riddler-like figure, but rather to allow players to grasp the game's background and basic content without revealing the actual story.</p>
<p>With the release of the promotional trailer,</p>
<p>players who had been following Red Dead Redemption began discussing it extensively.</p>
<p>Even within this short, one-minute-and-a-bit promotional video, there were still details worth digging into.</p>
<p>First, the graphics needed no explanation.</p>
<p>Combined with Nebula Games' previously released theme of 'Farm Life,' it was clear that the visuals of Red Dead Redemption would not be an issue.</p>
<p>Although it wasn't clear whether this trailer used CGI or real-time in-game rendering, Nebula Games clearly had no reason to sacrifice their reputation in this regard.</p>
<p>After all, unlike gameplay and story—elements requiring deep immersion—graphics were extremely easy to judge for authenticity or downgrades.</p>
<p>What truly captured player attention, however, was the game's setting.</p>
<p>It seemed the player character wasn't exactly a good guy.</p>
<p>"Feels a bit different from typical Western themes! Are we playing as a major villain?"</p>
<p>"Yeah! It's totally different from the 'Beautiful World' style. I've read that novel—the protagonist is more like a Robin Hood-type outlaw hero, but here we're robbing trains and banks, seems like we've done every bad thing imaginable!"</p>
<p>"I actually find it quite interesting. We've seen too many heroic protagonists—this is the first time encountering a villain protagonist."</p>
<p>"I'm more curious about the gameplay. Will it be mission-based like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare?"</p>
<p>Players discussed various topics surrounding Red Dead Redemption.</p>
<p>What interested them most was how the game portrayed the Western world.</p>
<p>Even though the vast world hadn't been fully revealed yet,</p>
<p>the mere glimpse shown in the promotional video was enough to spark player anticipation.</p>
<p>Moreover, compared to Atrai's 'Beautiful World,' Nebula Games showcased a much more vibrant city—a city gradually entering the Contemporary Era.</p>
<p>It featured modern equipment like streetcars and streetlights, while still preserving historical remnants like horse-drawn carriages.</p>
<p>The fusion of progress and the past was undeniably captivating.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>While online discussions were ongoing, Chen Xu was working overtime with his team, pushing forward the development of Red Dead Redemption.</p>
<p>Currently, the team was split into two groups. One group focused on gameplay content for Red Dead Redemption—fishing, hunting, bounty hunter activities, and so on—led by Lin Tao.</p>
<p>The other group handled detailed content and collaborated with Yang Xin's team on quest architecture, led by Qin Yi.</p>
<p>Inside the Huanyu VR gaming pod, Chen Xu was controlling Arthur Morgan as he shaved his beard. The in-game mirror clearly reflected Arthur Morgan's face.</p>
<p>The realism was extremely high—wrinkles on Arthur's forehead were clearly visible.</p>
<p>In addition, the game featured abundant interactive elements,</p>
<p>even more so than in the previous life's version of Red Dead Redemption.</p>
<p>For example, mirrors, logs, and bricks on the ground could all be picked up and even used as weapons.</p>
<p>There were also wooden houses that players could actually set on fire and destroy. After burning, they would leave behind wreckage. Of course, these were only specific houses in the wilderness—otherwise, we might witness the spectacular sight of Saint Denis going up in flames. While that would indeed be cool, current hardware capabilities and physics engine technology were still quite strained.</p>
<p>Besides main quests, there were also side quests and Stranger missions.</p>
<p>Chen Xu took inspiration from The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.</p>
<p>Before accepting a quest, players could even kill the NPC offering it, thus eliminating the quest entirely.</p>
<p>Additionally, players could attack野外 merchants and black-market dealers.</p>
<p>After killing them, those functional NPCs would no longer appear.</p>
<p>Of course, these actions wouldn't affect the progression of the main storyline.</p>
<p>This made the entire game feel more free and simultaneously more realistic and immersive.</p>
<p>In his previous life, many features were restricted due to Technical capabilities, making it impossible to include certain content.</p>
<p>But in this Parallel World, clearly much more could be achieved.</p>
<p>Exiting the gaming pod, Chen Xu nodded in satisfaction. Some minor details still needed modification, but the overall structure was solid.</p>
<p>Next up was reviewing the cinematic angles for the story segments.</p>
<p>"Don't use the default camera angle for this scene. Use a film cinematography perspective instead."</p>
<p>"Here, the player won't be as free. The goal is for players to watch and immerse themselves in Arthur's identity, not act as themselves."</p>
<p>"Also, when passing through the forest, play That's the Way It Is as background audio along with the camera work. Integrate flashback dialogue from NPCs the player has encountered to elevate the emotional intensity to its peak. Only then can players truly experience redemption alongside Arthur."</p>
<p>Standing before the holographic projection showing a DEMO sequence, Chen Xu instructed the team members beside him.</p>
<p>Unlike other games, Red Dead Redemption had a relatively slow pace,</p>
<p>echoing the style of old films from the last century. Many scenes in the game didn't use the player's default viewpoint.</p>
<p>Instead, they were specially crafted film cinematography shots. During gameplay, players could even switch to this cinematic view.</p>
<p>Third-person, first-person, and cinematic perspectives—three camera modes were used throughout the game's development.</p>
<p>Specific moments, when combined with cinematic angles and the game's Soundtrack, would fully immerse players emotionally.</p>
<p>Especially the iconic scene where, after bidding farewell to Sadie and Abigail, Arthur firmly places his hat on his head and rides resolutely toward the camp—that would undoubtedly become one of the most legendary moments in gaming history.</p>
<p>Returning from the project office to his own office, Chen Xu was in a particularly good mood.</p>
<p>After all, the project's progress was going very smoothly.</p>
<p>Having just finished working, Chen Xu leaned back in his chair and opened his phone, browsing the official Weibo account and some industry news.</p>
<p>As expected, online discussions were overwhelmingly centered on the two games—Red Dead Redemption and Beautiful World.</p>
<p>Chen Xu glanced through them. Discussions about Beautiful World mainly focused on two aspects:</p>
<p>Faithfulness to the original story and the promised Gameplay Content. According to Antorini and Atrai's promotional points, both emphasized so-called freedom.</p>
<p>In contrast, discussions about Red Dead Redemption were much more diverse—covering game type, story content, and more.</p>
<p>The two most discussed topics were:</p>
<p>First, many players suspected the story might involve a tragic storyline.</p>
<p>After all, the previous Call of Duty: Modern Warfare had left a deep impression, and now, playing as Arthur Morgan—a gang outlaw—would he really get a happy ending?</p>
<p>An ordinary game designer might not immediately think along these lines, but who was Chen Xu?</p>
<p>A Warrior of Love!</p>
<p>Pouring love into players?</p>
<p>Pfft!</p>
<p>Chen Xu's love was about using knives to torment players—either through game difficulty or through the story.</p>
<p>The second major topic was gameplay. Many players speculated it would follow Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, using separate level maps.</p>
<p>Reading the online discussions, Chen Xu sitting in his office couldn't help but sigh with emotion.</p>
<p>Just as he loved the players deeply, the players loved him right back.</p>
<p>They knew each other's thoughts perfectly—guessing each other's intentions with perfect clarity.</p>
<p>Seeing the hot posts online, Chen Xu stepped forward and responded on the official Weibo account, addressing these two hottest topics.</p>
