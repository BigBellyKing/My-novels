                <p>Chapter 469: This game... it’s a bit different from what I imagined! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>On October 30th, many players stayed up late, waiting in front of their computers for the event to begin.</p>
<p>The tokens and such weren't important; the key was the new game.</p>
<p>Although there were only 30,000 slots for the grand prize, many players' chances were quite slim.</p>
<p>But what if it was their turn?</p>
<p>And even if they didn't win the grand prize, this was a game from Nebula Games! Nebula Games products are always high-quality; this was already a recognized fact in the minds of players.</p>
<p>Even if it was an event game, many players believed it would be very interesting.</p>
<p>So at this time, regardless of how late it was, many players were waiting in advance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this new game was quite mysterious, which also made many players curious.</p>
<p>No relevant game content was announced, only the game's title: <em>Resident Evil</em>.</p>
<p>Judging from the name, many players were a bit confused.</p>
<p>“Bio” usually refers to biochemistry, right?</p>
<p>So what does “crisis” mean?</p>
<p>A crisis caused by biochemistry?</p>
<p>Could this be another high-difficulty Souls-like game?</p>
<p>Many players speculated before purchasing, especially since players could refund after pre-ordering, which, to some extent, further supported this guess.</p>
<p>However, while many players expressed their speechlessness, many others, especially veteran <em>Dark Souls</em> players, were full of confidence.</p>
<p>If it truly was a Souls-like game, then they had hit the jackpot!</p>
<p>“Hey, Old Song, what are you waiting up for in the middle of the night? Can’t you wait until tomorrow? Are you really going to get one of those 30,000 slots?” Zhang Yi leaned on his bed, yawning as he chatted with Song Ren on his phone.</p>
<p>“It’s about the ritualistic feeling! Besides, as a veteran Souls-like player, I might actually have a shot at one of those 30,000 slots,” Song Ren chuckled on the other end.</p>
<p>He didn't really care much about the prize money; the key was the atmosphere of the event.</p>
<p>“So, Old Zhang, you’re not playing tonight?” Song Ren asked.</p>
<p>“Not tonight. Wang Han will be back soon, and I have something to do tonight. Don’t spoil anything for me tomorrow,” Zhang Yi coughed lightly a couple of times.</p>
<p>“Tsk, tsk. Alright, I’m not talking to you anymore; the game’s about to unlock. I’m going to play,” After a few words, Song Ren hung up the phone and, with a sigh of emotion, entered his gaming pod.</p>
<p>However, his heart was quickly filled with anticipation.</p>
<p>The only thing that made him curious was why this game was so mysterious.</p>
<p>With curiosity, Song Ren clicked to enter the game.</p>
<p>‘Hey, darling!’</p>
<p>After a brief black screen upon entering the game, a face suddenly appeared on the screen, greeting Song Ren.</p>
<p>It was a sudden shock right at the beginning. Although the girl was beautiful, it startled Song Ren.</p>
<p>“Holy cow, you scared me! Miss, don’t you know that scaring people can scare them to death?”</p>
<p>Looking at the pretty girl in front of him, Song Ren complained, but he had to admit, she was quite stunning.</p>
<p>The girl waved at the camera, then sat back down in the distance.</p>
<p>From the background, it seemed like she was at sea, with bright sunshine all around, looking very comfortable.</p>
<p>‘I just wanted to say simply: I miss you so much, I love you.’</p>
<p>‘Oh, that’s right! I have good news for you! I’m coming home! Yay!’</p>
<p>As she spoke, the girl acted like a child, happily clapping her hands, which even made Song Ren smile.</p>
<p>Is this my girlfriend or my wife?</p>
<p>Oh my, my wife is a bit cute!</p>
<p>And the visuals are amazing; it feels like it could compete with <em>Uncharted</em>!</p>
<p>Song Ren looked very surprised, and he was right in his guess, because most of the assets in this game were made by Chen Xu using some from <em>Uncharted</em>, which allowed for such rapid completion.</p>
<p>Of course, to meet the game's requirements, Chen Xu had made a few small changes, but at this moment, Song Ren was completely unaware, still immersed in the girl's gentle voice.</p>
<p>‘I just want to get out of this babysitting job and get back to my dear husband. I miss you so much.’</p>
<p>‘Ethan… I love you.’</p>
<p>The girl in the camera said with a smile.</p>
<p>‘Oh, alright, I have to go back to work. I love you, Ethan. I’ll kiss you a million times.’</p>
<p>‘Mwah! Bye, baby, love you!’</p>
<p>Watching his wife’s adorable appearance on screen, Song Ren grinned. It was truly heartwarming!</p>
<p>But the next moment, the camera slowly pulled back, and Song Ren realized he was in a dark small room, watching the video on a laptop.</p>
<p>Then a new video opened, and this one was a stark contrast to the previous calm and sweetness.</p>
<p>At this very moment, the same girl was on screen, but she was extremely flustered. The dim footage was shaky, and the girl was breathing rapidly, appearing terrified.</p>
<p>‘I’m sorry… I’m so sorry, Ethan! I lied to you, but…’ The girl in the video hesitated to speak further.</p>
<p>‘If you see this video… then you must listen to me!’</p>
<p>The screen instantly plunged into darkness, with only his wife’s desperate and panicked voice.</p>
<p>‘Absolutely! Don’t get involved!’</p>
<p>And the next second, before Song Ren could recover, a new scene appeared before his eyes: he was driving a car down a highway, with overgrown wasteland on both sides of the road. At the same time, his phone next to him rang, and Ethan in the game answered.</p>
<p>‘Hello?’</p>
<p>‘Hey, it’s, uh, it’s Ethan.’</p>
<p>‘I, hi, are you alright? You suddenly disappeared the night before last.’</p>
<p>‘Yeah, yeah. No, I’m good… really good. It’s about Mia! She’s not dead, she’s alive… she’s back!’</p>
<p>‘They found her? How? What happened?’</p>
<p>‘I don’t know, I don’t know what’s going on, but she’s back… she just is. Maybe it’s a prank, but she wants me to go find her.’</p>
<p>‘Where is she?’</p>
<p>‘Dulvey, Louisiana. Dulvey.’</p>
<p>‘Dude, it’s been three years! She’s been missing for three years!’</p>
<p>‘I know, I know! But what if it really is her? I have to find out what happened!’</p>
<p>In the game, as Ethan talked to an unknown man on the phone, the car arrived in a remote wilderness, and by then, dusk was approaching.</p>
<p>Song Ren in the game had pretty much figured out a few things. Mia was the woman from the opening video, protagonist Ethan’s wife.</p>
<p>Her profession seemed to be a babysitter, then she went missing for three years. Finally, Ethan received a message from Mia and went to Dulvey to find his wife.</p>
<p>But the key thing is… this game is a bit different from what I imagined?</p>
<p>Song Ren fell silent.</p>
<p>Combining this with Mia’s sudden change in the previous video, Song Ren now fully understood the situation.</p>
<p>Isn’t this damn game a horror game!?</p>
<p>And Ethan, please listen to your friend, let’s not go, okay?</p>
