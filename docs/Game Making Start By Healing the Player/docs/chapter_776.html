<p>Chapter 775: What a Garbage Game!</p>
<p>Compared to the original setting of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>, Chen Xu had no intention of releasing DLC content related to gameplay mechanics in this installment.</p>
<p>For instance, official 'cheat-like' Blades such as KOS-MOS and Sparks—characters that in his previous life were simply obtained via email—weren't handed out so easily here.</p>
<p>Instead, just like Poppiba, they required players to complete an entirely new Blade-unlocking quest before obtaining them.</p>
<p>Other features, such as disabling monster aggro and custom difficulty settings, were directly integrated into the base game itself.</p>
<p>Players could select modes based on their skill level. Even those who couldn't grasp the Combat System could still enjoy the story with options like auto-battle and automatic QTE completion—perfect for a casual experience.</p>
<p>As for Zhang Yi, he didn’t adjust the custom difficulty and instead picked normal difficulty.</p>
<p>As someone who considered himself a veteran player, Zhang Yi naturally wouldn't opt for auto-battle. For traditional RPGs like this, gradually mastering the combat system was a significant part of the core enjoyment—and Zhang Yi understood this perfectly.</p>
<p>So he only enabled the option to make mobs ignore aggro. After all, when he was underleveled and stuck on a quest, or needed to grind mobs for materials, he could choose whether or not to fight them.</p>
<p>But during map exploration or main quest progression, constantly running into random mobs felt quite annoying.</p>
<p>However, the Zhang Yi inside the game had no idea that this feature only worked against regular monsters.</p>
<p>In the world of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>, apart from the regularly spawning mobs, there were also Unique Monsters—essentially field bosses.</p>
<p>These bosses, once defeated, would leave behind a gravestone allowing players to challenge them repeatedly. They had significantly higher health and damage output compared to normal monsters.</p>
<p>In Gormott Province, a lush grassland teeming with life, the biodiversity was astonishing.</p>
<p>There were single-digit level bunnies and Scaled Beefalo, level 10–20 Wolfkin, level 30–40 crabs, one level 90+ Ancient Tyrant, and a level 80+ Gorilla Bro.</p>
<p>With the no-encounter feature enabled, Zhang Yi contentedly strolled across the vast Gormott plains. Unbeknownst to him, a massive gorilla swung down from the giant tree behind him.</p>
<p>Aggro triggered. The intense battle BGM blared. The next second, a red damage number—-8621—floated above Rex’s head, and the screen went black. Zhang Yi respawned at his last save point.</p>
<p>"Damn it! What the hell!? Where did that gorilla even come from!?"</p>
<p>Zhang Yi looked bewildered after respawning, completely unprepared for such a sudden attack while admiring the scenic beauty of Gormott.</p>
<p>He was barely under level 10, with a total health pool under 1,000. How could that Gorilla Bro punch him for thousands of damage!?</p>
<p>In truth, Zhang Yi wasn’t the only one getting one-shot by the gorilla. Nearly every player experiencing <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em> for the first time and walking across the vast Gormott plains had suffered the same brutal fate.</p>
<p>Unlike regular monsters that just patrolled their tiny zones, this particular chimp acted like a king patrolling his territory—swinging from trees to the plains and back again.</p>
<p>Its aggro range was enormous. Moreover, many players had died from being accidentally pulled into multi-monster aggro chains during fights.</p>
<p>After respawning, Zhang Yi approached Gormott with much more caution this time.</p>
<p>Upon entering Gormott, he quickly advanced into new story segments, none of which particularly surprised him.</p>
<p>Because Nia was a wanted criminal, Rex and Nia were defeated by Brighid, a Blade. Nia was captured and thrown into jail, while Rex and Pyra escaped with the help of Tora, a Nopon.</p>
<p>Clearly, Tora was one of the protagonist's party members. After completing a series of quests, they learned of Nia’s location and also helped Tora create an Artificial Blade—Poppi.</p>
<p>However, what interested Zhang Yi the most wasn’t the story, but rather the game’s meme-filled character designs and hilarious吐槽 points.</p>
<p>Tora, who desperately wanted to become a Driver, struck Zhang Yi as a textbook otaku.</p>
<p>His design for Poppi was clearly maid-themed. Though he tried to act otherwise, the next moment revealed his closet filled with various maid outfits—exposing his true attribute.</p>
<p>"What a garbage game! They’re not wrong at all!" Zhang Yi gritted his teeth as he stared at the arcade machine in Tora’s house.</p>
<p>Compared to the torturous mini-games he’d played before, like The one with the big hammer, this was relatively mild.</p>
<p>But this was a game within a game!</p>
<p>Clunky controls and strict hit detection completely broke his spirit.</p>
<p>Even worse, the mini-game was a top-down scrolling shooter where the player had to guide a tiny character to the bottom to grab a treasure chest, then return the same way.</p>
<p>If you died mid-way, you got nothing—driving Zhang Yi absolutely insane.</p>
<p>Especially infuriating was Tora’s final line, which resonated deeply with Zhang Yi’s sense of frustration.</p>
<p>In reality, Chen Xu had made some adjustments to this arcade game. The drop rate was slightly higher, and the score needed to unlock Poppi’s bond events was reduced.</p>
<p>Additionally, not all upgrade parts came from the arcade. Later on, players could grind Core Crystals in the Challenge Arena and exchange them.</p>
<p>But Zhang Yi, at this moment, knew absolutely nothing about any of this.</p>
<p>Right now, he was gritting his teeth and forcing himself to play this 'garbage game'.</p>
<p>The reason? He discovered that playing it could drop Core Crystals.</p>
<p>And he already knew what Core Crystals were for.</p>
<p>They were used to summon Blades. Earlier, the system had gifted him one Core Crystal, which he used and pulled a dark-skinned female Blade—leaving him deeply disappointed.</p>
<p>Now, completing tasks in Tora’s arcade game actually rewarded him with Core Crystals.</p>
<p>And his luck seemed decent. After a few tries, he’d obtained three Regular Core Crystals and one Rare Crystal.</p>
<p>Adding those to the four Rare Crystals and ten Regular Crystals he’d already collected from ordinary treasure chests—ones that didn’t require scene skills to open—his inventory was filling up nicely.</p>
<p>But should he open them now?</p>
<p>Zhang Yi stared at the crystals in his inventory, torn between using them and saving them.</p>
<p>It wasn’t about saving for a ten-pull—after all, the in-game Blade Bonding System clearly stated that ten-pulls didn’t increase odds.</p>
<p>The main reason for hesitation was what the tutorial mentioned: whoever opened the crystal had to use it. Tora, who had just joined the party, couldn’t open cores—meaning he could only bond with Poppi.</p>
<p>So Zhang Yi wanted to wait until Nia was rescued, then let her open some crystals too.</p>
<p>After all, Nia was a main heroine. She deserved her fair share.</p>
