                <p>Chapter 227: Subsequent Operational Arrangements (Fifth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>Time passed day by day, and the topic surrounding Minecraft remained incredibly popular.</p>
<p>On major websites, any content related to Minecraft consistently maintained extremely high click-through rates.</p>
<p>Videos showcasing various builds within the game, comedic gameplay clips, and tutorial videos aimed at new players—these all left many game designers in the gaming industry feeling utterly baffled.</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>With the New Year's Holiday concluded, employees across all departments of Nebula Games had gradually onboarded.</p>
<p>At this moment, Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, and Yang Xin stood behind Chen Xu, curiously watching the display screen in front of him.</p>
<p>Steve sat inside a tank, facing a massive boss, which had a health bar UI displayed above its head.</p>
<p>The gameplay was extremely simple: the player merely needed to sit in the tank, continuously attacking the enormous monster ahead while dodging the TNT bombs it hurled.</p>
<p>It was primitive, but what amazed everyone was that this MOD wasn’t created by Chen Xu—it was developed entirely by a Minecraft player.</p>
<p>After its release, this MOD quickly became the most downloaded, second only to the several building complex MODs previously released by Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Within just a single day, it achieved 2 million downloads.</p>
<p>"Actually being able to drive a tank and fight a boss in Minecraft!" Ruan Ningxue behind them exclaimed, visibly surprised.</p>
<p>"It’s not just about driving tanks to fight bosses. In theory, whether it’s RPG, Racing, FPS, or any other genre, all types of games can be realized within Minecraft using the game’s rules," Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Of course, the actual experience wouldn’t match the feel or depth of content found in dedicated FPS, RPG, or Racing games.</p>
<p>But the key point was this: did players truly care about the feel and content richness when playing these genres within Minecraft?</p>
<p>What they truly cared about was the fact that Minecraft could be played in such ways.</p>
<p>They were experiencing the unique characteristics it offered.</p>
<p>Just like how many players enjoy GHS in regular games, yet in adult games, they prefer analyzing story and life philosophy.</p>
<p>Were they genuinely seeking GHS or deep philosophical discussions?</p>
<p>No. They simply desired something different.</p>
<p>It was an innate human trait.</p>
<p>Originally, Chen Xu had planned to secretly introduce some unique modes for players—such as Hide and Seek or Master Builder.</p>
<p>But now, it was clear he had underestimated the players’ creativity.</p>
<p>This MOD named 'Tank Battle Against Evil Monsters,' although extremely simple in content, had clearly opened a new door for Minecraft players.</p>
<p>Chen Xu believed it wouldn’t be long before even more distinctive MODs emerged.</p>
<p>"We don’t need to worry about the rest—let the players handle it. However, we must ensure excellent maintenance of the community and the game environment!" Chen Xu addressed the operations team.</p>
<p>Regarding the operations team, their primary responsibility wasn’t content operations.</p>
<p>Rather, it was maintaining the game environment.</p>
<p>For example, if players engaged in personal attacks, verbal abuse, or similar behavior, they would receive warnings, temporary mutes, temporary bans from online mode, permanent mutes, or permanent bans from online mode as punishment.</p>
<p>Unless someone was deliberately trying to get banned, the permanent mute and permanent online ban penalties would rarely be triggered.</p>
<p>Mostly, it would only result in temporary mutes.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Chen Xu’s words, the operations team nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>"Additionally, Lin Rou will collect data on players across various online servers. Later, we can produce a documentary series titled 'Minecraft,' dedicated to recording Minecraft’s history—including various memes within the player community. We can create series such as 'The First Player to Dig-Three-Fill-One at Night' or 'The First Player Who Chose Not to Build a House, But Instead Placed Their Bed Directly in an Underground Mine or Cave.' These can all become documentaries, preserving the history and memories of Minecraft players," Chen Xu instructed Lin Rou.</p>
<p>Chen Xu clearly understood how long the lifespan of Minecraft truly was. Even a decade after release, its annual player growth remained positive, repeatedly setting new records for active players.</p>
<p>In his previous life, it achieved sales of 230 million copies, becoming the best-selling game in the world, continuously breaking its own records.</p>
<p>One could say this game was nothing short of a miracle.</p>
<p>Therefore, Chen Xu naturally wouldn’t neglect the importance of maintaining the official community and the game’s atmosphere.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, the mobile version of Minecraft and the VR version of Minecraft can also be put on the agenda," Chen Xu said, looking at Qin Yi and the others.</p>
<p>The mobile version—essentially the phone version—would share data with the PC version.</p>
<p>Purchasing the PC version would grant access to the mobile version as well.</p>
<p>However, due to platform and hardware limitations, the mobile version would have significant content cuts compared to the PC version.</p>
<p>First, graphics would be heavily downgraded—the mobile version couldn’t possibly match the visual quality of the PC version.</p>
<p>Second, the controls would be more Frustrated, as players could only use virtual joysticks via touchscreen.</p>
<p>Additionally, certain game modes available on PC—such as Showcase (mode) and online multiplayer—wouldn’t be supported on mobile.</p>
<p>Moreover, various MODs, despite having identical gameplay and data content, wouldn’t be supported on phones due to hardware performance constraints. Many MODs that ran smoothly on PC simply couldn’t operate on mobile devices.</p>
<p>If there was any advantage, it was that nearly every player owned a phone, allowing them to play Minecraft anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>As for the VR version, development would be much more convenient and straightforward.</p>
<p>In fact, the VR version could deliver even better graphics than the PC version—assuming we’re referring to the game’s original configuration.</p>
<p>Of course, if discussing maximum visual performance, both PC and VR versions could undergo unlimited DIY customization.</p>
<p>The performance limit depended entirely on how deep your wallet was.</p>
<p>But in terms of mainstream configurations, VR currently held a clear advantage over PC.</p>
<p>Therefore, the original content of Minecraft could be fully replicated onto the VR version.</p>
<p>The only requirement was control adaptation for VR mode, as playing inside a gaming pod using motion sensors offered a vastly different experience from PC.</p>
<p>However, unlike the shared data between PC and mobile versions, the VR version would require an additional paid purchase.</p>
