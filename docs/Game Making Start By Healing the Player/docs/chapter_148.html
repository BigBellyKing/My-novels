                <p>Chapter 147: Split-screen Cooperation (Third update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>“The camera in this game actually uses split-screen, it's so retro!” Zhang Yi said with a hint of nostalgia.</p>
<p>The split-screen setting is indeed a very retro concept.</p>
<p>In today's internet era, games involving multiplayer online play basically don't require operating on the same machine.</p>
<p>However, in the era when the internet wasn't developed, network conditions clearly didn't support such operations at the time.</p>
<p>In such circumstances, some games involving two-player co-op would adopt a local split-screen mode.</p>
<p>This meant dividing the display screen into two, with one half showing the 1P player's perspective and the other showing the 2P player's perspective.</p>
<p>So, finding that <em>It Takes Two</em> actually used split-screen came as a bit of a surprise to Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>“I think it’s fine, actually. I can see your screen, too. Maybe some level design later on will require it?” Wang Han didn't overthink it.</p>
<p>As they chatted, the two moved forward.</p>
<p>They soon encountered the first puzzle.</p>
<p>After pulling the switch, the lifting staircase didn't descend; instead, three fuses inside grew legs and ran off directly.</p>
<p>Two of them didn't run far and stayed put, but another mischievous fuse escaped entirely.</p>
<p>“These fuses actually grew legs and ran away!?” Zhang Yi exclaimed in surprise at the in-game scene.</p>
<p>“Why so surprised? Haven’t you read fairy tales as a kid? Personification, right? If books can be alive, what’s so strange about fuses growing legs? We're made of clay and wood, after all!” Wang Han grumbled inwardly next to him.</p>
<p>This segment of chasing the fuses was essentially a tutorial on the game's basic controls.</p>
<p>Basic operations included aerial landings to activate switches, wall jumps, double jumps, double jump dashes, climbing, and running.</p>
<p>However, this entire new player tutorial process gave both Zhang Yi and Wang Han a very unique experience, and they also began to appreciate some advantages of the split-screen mode.</p>
<p>That is, they could see each other's screen content in real-time and observe each other's actions.</p>
<p>And if one player was using the wrong method, they could immediately tell the other and instruct them on how to pass the section.</p>
<p>If it weren't for the split-screen mode, they would have to be in the same physical location; otherwise, without seeing the screen, it would be difficult to know why the other person was stuck on a level/quest.</p>
<p>Moreover, the active map area in <em>It Takes Two</em> itself isn't small, so this split-screen mode was perfectly suited!</p>
<p>The initial level puzzles were basically without any difficulty. Wang Han and Zhang Yi played lightheartedly, and soon found and reinstalled the runaway fuse.</p>
<p>Through a lift, the two were launched onto a table, where their daughter was writing a letter.</p>
<p>Just as Cody and May, excitedly preparing to talk to their daughter and ask how to undo their doll state, Dr. Hakim appeared and opened a cabinet door.</p>
<p>Inside was a broken vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p>Facing Cody and May, the vacuum cleaner showed great hostility.</p>
<p>The vacuum cleaner had been broken because Cody used it to suck up all sorts of random things, like fruit pits and plastic bottles.</p>
<p>May had said she would fix the vacuum cleaner, but instead, she just left it in a corner of the room, ignoring it completely.</p>
<p>“Last time, I think your keyboard went haywire because you spilled coke in it, right?!” Wang Han, seeing this scene, glanced at Zhang Yi next to her.</p>
<p>“Accident… accident, let's not talk about that, let's watch the story. A new level has begun! This isn't just a tutorial level anymore!” Zhang Yi coughed twice, changing the subject as he looked at the game screen.</p>
<p>Life, who hasn't accidentally broken something? Besides, he tried really hard to fix it. He threw it in water immediately, then left it in the sun for two days. Unfortunately, the keyboard couldn't make it in the end.</p>
<p>Hearing Zhang Yi's words, Wang Han pursed her lips, but refocused her attention on the game.</p>
<p>At any rate, this opening had certainly piqued her curiosity.</p>
<p>Throughout the game, Cody and May are not like the Cinders in <em>Dark Souls</em> who only have three lines of dialogue: 'Hey! Uh! Ah!'</p>
<p>During gameplay, based on each other's actions, May and Cody exchange some lines of dialogue.</p>
<p>Through these lines, one can feel the relationship between May and Cody.</p>
<p>Both believe they are correct and the other is wrong.</p>
<p>From a story perspective, <em>It Takes Two</em> is clearly a classic family drama.</p>
<p>Although they had just finished the new player tutorial, through the game's promotional video and the content shown so far, not just Wang Han, but most players experiencing the game had already guessed the upcoming plot.</p>
<p>It would simply be May and Cody, with the help of Dr. Hakim, the Book of Love.</p>
<p>Through shared tacit cooperation, they would rediscover their love for each other, and finally, the family would be reunited.</p>
<p>It's a very clichéd plot, to say the least.</p>
<p>And from the dreamy cartoon animation art style, many players felt that such a story would likely not have any major twists.</p>
<p>Despite this, players weren't curious about the ending, but rather the journey in between.</p>
<p>What hardships would Cody and May endure, what levels would they encounter, and how would they overcome them together to finally understand each other?</p>
<p>After being knocked away by the vacuum cleaner, the game truly began.</p>
<p>Compared to the new player tutorial levels, the level puzzles in the game became relatively more complex.</p>
<p>In this journey, a player cannot pass alone.</p>
<p>Players must interact with the map to help the other player get to a certain place, allowing both to pass smoothly.</p>
<p>For example, with a blowing pipe, a player dives in one end and is blown out the other.</p>
<p>But if they just go in directly, they can never reach the target. The other player must lift the pipe.</p>
<p>And the player who reaches the other end also needs to press the corresponding switch, so that both can pass a small level.</p>
<p>At the same time, it's not just cooperation; some levels also require players to have a tacit understanding of teamwork.</p>
<p>For instance, in a ventilation duct level, players need to pass through three fans arranged in a hot air, cold air, hot air sequence. One player jumps, while the other switches between hot and cold air.</p>
<p>In a cold air state, the player can be blown up by the cold air and continue to jump.</p>
<p>But with hot air, they would be burned to ashes.</p>
<p>Pulling a button switches the fan's temperature.</p>
<p>So, in this level, it's the players' tacit cooperation that is tested.</p>
<p>When one player jumps, the other player must immediately switch the fan's temperature.</p>
<p>Cooperation and tacit understanding are perfectly demonstrated here.</p>
<p>And the benefit of the split-screen mode here is that not only do Cody and May in the game need to cooperate, but the two players behind the display also need to work together.</p>
<p>First, three updates. Like yesterday, I will continue writing tonight, not less than ten thousand characters.</p>
