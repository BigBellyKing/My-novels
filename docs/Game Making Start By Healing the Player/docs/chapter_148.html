<p>Chapter 147 Split-screen cooperation (Third update, Please Subscribe for Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>"The camera in this game actually uses split-screen? How retro!" Zhang Yi said with emotion.</p>
<p>The split-screen setting was indeed a very nostalgic feature.</p>
<p>In today's networked era, multiplayer games generally didn't require players to operate on the same machine.</p>
<p>But back when the internet wasn't developed, network conditions clearly couldn't support such operations.</p>
<p>Under those circumstances, games involving two-player co-op would adopt local split-screen mode.</p>
<p>That meant splitting the monitor's display into two halves: one showing the 1P player's view, the other showing the 2P player's view.</p>
<p>So when Zhang Yi realized that <em>It Takes Two</em> actually used split-screen, he felt slightly surprised.</p>
<p>"I think it's fine. Now I can see your screen directly. Probably some level designs later will require it?" Wang Han didn't overthink it.</p>
<p>The two chatted as they progressed.</p>
<p>Soon, they encountered the first puzzle.</p>
<p>After pulling the switch, the lifting staircase didn't descend. Instead, the three fuses inside sprouted legs and ran away.</p>
<p>Two stayed nearby, not moving far, but the mischievous third fuse dashed off completely.</p>
<p>"The fuse actually grew legs and ran away!?" Zhang Yi exclaimed in surprise at the game's story.</p>
<p>"Why so shocked? Haven't you read fairy tales as a kid? Personification! If books can come alive, why not fuses? We're made of clay and wood ourselves!" Wang Han grumbled inwardly.</p>
<p>This sequence chasing the runaway fuse served as a tutorial for several basic operations in the game.</p>
<p>Activating switches mid-air after landing, wall jumps, double jumps, double jump dashes, climbing, and sprinting—among other basic operations.</p>
<p>Yet this entire new player tutorial offered Zhang Yi and Wang Han a uniquely immersive experience. At this point, they also began to appreciate some advantages of the split-screen mode.</p>
<p>They could see each other's screen in real time and observe each other's actions.</p>
<p>If one made an incorrect move, the other could immediately point it out and instruct them on how to proceed.</p>
<p>Without split-screen, players would have to be physically together; otherwise, without seeing the screen, it would be hard to understand why the other was stuck on a level/quest.</p>
<p>Moreover, the map area in <em>It Takes Two</em> was quite expansive. The split-screen mode was perfectly suited for this!</p>
<p>The early level puzzles posed no real difficulty. Laughing and joking, Wang Han and Zhang Yi quickly found the missing fuse and reinstalled it.</p>
<p>The elevator launched them onto a table, where their daughter was writing a letter.</p>
<p>Just as Cody and May, excited, rushed toward their daughter to talk and ask how to reverse the doll state,</p>
<p>Dr. Hakim appeared and opened a cabinet door.</p>
<p>Inside was a broken vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p>Facing Cody and May, the vacuum cleaner showed intense hostility.</p>
<p>Cody had used it to suck up all sorts of random junk—fruit pits, plastic bottles—and damaged it.</p>
<p>May had promised to fix it, but instead left it abandoned in the corner of the room.</p>
<p>"Wasn't the keyboard from last time ruined because you spilled coke into it!?" Wang Han shot a glance at Zhang Yi upon seeing this scene.</p>
<p>"Accident... just an accident. Let's not talk about it—watch the story! A new level has started! This isn't the tutorial anymore!" Zhang Yi coughed twice, shifting the subject as he focused on the game's graphics.</p>
<p>Life happens—everyone accidentally breaks things sometimes. Besides, he had tried his best to repair it: first soaking it in water, then drying it under the sun for two days. Unfortunately, the keyboard still didn't survive.</p>
<p>Hearing Zhang Yi, Wang Han rolled her eyes but turned her attention back to the game.</p>
<p>Regardless, the opening had already piqued her curiosity.</p>
<p>During gameplay, Cody and May weren't like the Ashen One from <em>Dark Souls</em>, who only had three lines throughout the entire game: "Hey! Uh! Ah!"</p>
<p>Throughout the game, based on each other's actions, Cody and May exchanged lines of dialogue.</p>
<p>Through these lines, players could feel the relationship between Cody and May.</p>
<p>Each believed they were right, and the other was wrong.</p>
<p>From a story perspective, <em>It Takes Two</em> was clearly a clichéd family drama.</p>
<p>Although they had just finished the tutorial, judging from the game's promotional trailer video and the content so far,</p>
<p>Not only Wang Han, but most players experiencing the game had already speculated what would happen next.</p>
<p>Obviously, with the help of Dr. Hakim—the Book of Love—Cody and May would,</p>
<p>Through tacit cooperation, rediscover each other's love, and eventually reunite as a happy family.</p>
<p>It was an extremely predictable storyline.</p>
<p>Moreover, given the dreamlike cartoon animation art style, many players assumed there wouldn't be any dramatic twists.</p>
<p>Yet even so, what intrigued players wasn't the ending, but the journey in between.</p>
<p>What trials would Cody and May endure? What levels would they face? How would they overcome challenges together and finally understand each other?</p>
<p>After being knocked back by the vacuum cleaner, the game truly began.</p>
<p>Compared to the tutorial levels, the puzzles in the actual levels became relatively more complex.</p>
<p>In these stages, a single player couldn't progress alone.</p>
<p>Players had to interact with the map together, helping each other reach certain locations so both could advance.</p>
<p>For example, there was a blowing pipe: a player entered one end and was blown out the other.</p>
<p>But going through directly wouldn't reach the destination. Another player had to lift the pipe first.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the player at the other end needed to press a corresponding switch, allowing both to clear a small level.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it wasn't just about cooperation—some levels required players to develop real-time tacit understanding.</p>
<p>For instance, in a ventilation duct level, players had to pass through three fans arranged in hot-cold-hot order. One player jumped while the other switched between hot and cold air.</p>
<p>Under cold air, the player would be lifted by the cold wind and could jump again.</p>
<p>But hot air would burn them to ashes instantly.</p>
<p>Pulling a lever switched the fan's temperature.</p>
<p>Thus, this level tested the players' tacit cooperation.</p>
<p>One player had to switch the fan temperature precisely the moment the other jumped.</p>
<p>Cooperation and tacit understanding were showcased perfectly here.</p>
<p>And the advantage of split-screen mode shone through: just as Cody and May needed to cooperate in the game, the two players behind the monitor had to work together seamlessly.</p>
<p>First update of three—same as yesterday, more tonight. Won't be less than ten thousand characters.</p>
