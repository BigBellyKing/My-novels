<p>Chapter 517: Ciri? A New Wife Has Appeared! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>After news about Chen Xu leaked out, many players also discovered the latest Easter egg content.</p>
<p>Within Monster Hunter: World, a brand-new trigger quest had been added.</p>
<p>Numerous veteran Hunters who had temporarily hung up their weapons returned to the New World en masse.</p>
<p>Curious about the new game, Song Ren went home that evening and logged into Huanyu VR, launching Monster Hunter: World and arriving at the long-unseen Ancient Forest.</p>
<p>Following the guide he had read online, he headed to Sector 7, winding his way through the area until he found a thicket. Controlling the legendary Azure Star and New World's White Wind, Song Ren stepped inside, triggering a story sequence.</p>
<p>'Partner! Look quick!'</p>
<p>The receptionist, who was always busy eating, appeared behind the Azure Star, pointing at the thicket with a look of surprise.</p>
<p>The camera shifted to reveal a creature resembling a Ghoul, crouched down and scanning its surroundings.</p>
<p>'Damn it! No way! No way! Is Mr. Chen coming back again?!'</p>
<p>Seeing this creature with a drastically different art style, Song Ren shivered. If the game could reflect real-world facial expressions, his face would have turned deathly pale.</p>
<p>The Ghoul-like monster instantly reminded him of Bloodborne and Resident Evil.</p>
<p>Was it happening again?</p>
<p>And upon further thought, hadn't Hades been similar?</p>
<p>The Underworld and its various spirits—though Hades had a more comic-like art style.</p>
<p>But this Ghoul-like creature was clearly rendered in a realistic style!</p>
<p>Just recalling those 'wonderful memories' from back then made Song Ren shudder involuntarily.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Hunter in the game completed the scout mission and returned to Astera Settlement.</p>
<p>At the base, the Commander-in-Chief and others surrounded the Ghoul, discussing its origins.</p>
<p>'Currently, its threat level is unknown. Although the target has been confirmed, this creature differs significantly from our existing biological concepts,' the receptionist analyzed.</p>
<p>The Commander-in-Chief nodded. 'I even think it's more appropriate to consider it an extraterrestrial lifeform.'</p>
<p>The group passionately debated the topic, while the Azure Star remained silent nearby, appearing aloof and cold.</p>
<p>Of course, Song Ren knew perfectly well that it wasn't the Azure Star being aloof—it simply couldn't speak.</p>
<p>At that moment, a portal suddenly appeared in the room.</p>
<p>A gray-haired woman emerged, holding a Steel Sword, wearing eye makeup, and bearing a scar on her left cheek. 'Another new world? Where is this?'</p>
<p>Seeing the sudden appearance of this gray-haired woman, Song Ren's eyes lit up.</p>
<p>After Maria and the Palico young ladies, and then Megaira from Hades, he felt like he had a new wife again!</p>
<p>The mysterious gray-haired woman subtly shifted her stance as she observed the Commander-in-Chief and others.</p>
<p>The Commander-in-Chief spoke up to answer her confusion: 'This is the research base of the New World Investigation Team. And you are?'</p>
<p>'A traveler. Ciri.'</p>
<p>'I'm fleeing from certain people. I used... well, you could call it magic... to arrive in this world.'</p>
<p>Hearing Ciri's words and recalling the earlier scene, the receptionist and Commander-in-Chief wore expressions of surprise.</p>
<p>Ciri introduced herself to the group, but when she noticed the Ghoul on the ground playing with a medicine bottle, her expression shifted slightly.</p>
<p>'This one is a Niegui... In... in a world I've been to, it's a common monster. How did it appear here?' Ciri asked the Commander-in-Chief, her tone urgent.</p>
<p>In the game, Song Ren continued observing the dialogue between Ciri and the investigators.</p>
<p>He quickly learned some key information.</p>
<p>For example, after learning about the Monster Hunter world, Ciri revealed her identity.</p>
<p>She stated she was a Witcher, willing to accept commissions to hunt monsters, and also wanted to investigate how this creature called the Niegui had appeared.</p>
<p>Song Ren, in-game, was very curious—why had Ciri come to this world?</p>
<p>And could it be that Ciri was the protagonist of the new game?</p>
<p>Moreover, from Ciri's earlier words, many intriguing details had already been revealed.</p>
<p>First, Ciri seemed to be fleeing from certain people. She possessed time-traveling abilities, though she apparently couldn't control them well.</p>
<p>Additionally, 'Witcher' was clearly another crucial clue. So would the new work be a fantasy-themed game?</p>
<p>Song Ren speculated as he officially entered the crossover Easter egg storyline.</p>
<p>But what surprised him was that this Easter egg completely changed Monster Hunter's existing gameplay.</p>
<p>Although weapons like the Long Sword and Great Sword were still used, the exploration phase transformed into a mode similar to a forensic investigation, searching for clues.</p>
<p>'It's a bit like a detective game!' Song Ren sighed with emotion, watching Ciri uncover the truth behind the enraged Hatebird.</p>
<p>But what intrigued Song Ren even more was that when praised by the Astera investigators, Ciri mentioned an elder named Geralt, whom she deeply admired, saying she had learned all her skills from him.</p>
<p>Clearly, this would also be a major character in Chen Xu's new work.</p>
<p>Another aspect that impressed Song Ren was Ciri's ability—teleportation.</p>
<p>She could instantly move behind a monster and deliver a fatal strike.</p>
<p>Absolutely stunning.</p>
<p>Combined with the Long Sword, only the word 'elegant' could describe it.</p>
<p>'These Gajalaka are pretty interesting too!'</p>
<p>Watching the Gajalaka trying to make Ciri their chief and forcing her to wear a mask and dance, pushing Ciri to promise finding their missing previous chief, Song Ren couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>Every game had its mascot. In Monster Hunter: World, the mascots were clearly the Palico and the Gajalaka.</p>
<p>After gathering some intelligence, Ciri returned to the camp to exchange information with the receptionist.</p>
<p>'By the way, where did that Hunter go? I haven't seen him around,' Ciri asked the receptionist with curiosity.</p>
<p>'He's currently on a mission, suppressing large-scale monster activities in the forest. If a large monster were to intrude, it would interfere with your investigation. This is done to prevent such incidents.'</p>
<p>'One person handling such a vast forest? Impressive!' Ciri was somewhat shocked.</p>
<p>'Well... that Hunter is truly exceptional. Though silent, his skill, judgment, and adaptability are all world-class!'</p>
<p>'Even more remarkable is his mental fortitude—once he decides on something, he sees it through to the end!'</p>
<p>'I've interacted with many Hunters due to my job, but someone like him is unprecedented and possibly unmatched in the future. Perhaps I'm living in the same era as someone who might be called a Hero!'</p>
<p>In short, just an excellent Tool-man, Song Ren thought, feeling Speechless as he recalled his past experiences in the New World.</p>
<p>But despite his grumbling, Song Ren noticed many differences.</p>
<p>The game now featured numerous dialogues and various branching options.</p>
<p>Clearly, this was entirely different from Monster Hunter: World's usual style, leaning heavily toward RPG elements.</p>
<p>So would Chen Xu's new work be an RPG? Song Ren speculated internally, since these were clear signs of RPG mechanics.</p>
<p>However, this speculation wasn't confirmed by the remaining content.</p>
<p>Because as Ciri continued her investigation, the gameplay reverted to Monster Hunter's core mechanics.</p>
<p>They discovered that the anomalies in the Ancient Forest originated from a creature called the Leshen, from another world.</p>
<p>The subsequent tracking and hunt followed Monster Hunter: World's standard gameplay, though Ciri's unique teleportation skill made the battle simpler and more entertaining.</p>
<p>After all, this was just a crossover Easter egg, so the entire sequence wasn't very long.</p>
<p>Then came the crossover rewards, which brought many African Hunters to tears.</p>
<p>Especially Song Ren, who was almost crying—he finally had Attack Jewels again!</p>
<p>Granted, they were still from quest guaranteed pulls, but still—Attack Jewels!</p>
