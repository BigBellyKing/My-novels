                <p>Chapter 103: What Healing! This is Pure Grief!</p>
<p>Liuliu, in front of her computer, felt an immense heaviness in her heart.</p>
<p>From the initial cheerfulness and humor, to a middle section where cruelty and humor coexisted, now only the most brutal manifestations of war remained.</p>
<p>Three men, one woman, and a dog—that was the full lineup of protagonists in the game.</p>
<p>As a game that depicted the cruelty of war, it adopted a graffiti-style 2D cartoon aesthetic.</p>
<p>The graffiti-style cartoon humor formed an exceptionally stark contrast with the brutality of war. Additionally, there were many collectible items in the game, each recording real historical events.</p>
<p>This made the game feel as if it were telling a true historical story.</p>
<p>Unlike most anti-war games, this one aimed not to show the external manifestations of war, but rather its inner essence.</p>
<p>It did not portray war from a macroscopic perspective.</p>
<p>None of the characters had any connection to the war; all were forcibly drawn into this world war triggered by politics.</p>
<p>Karl, Emile, Freddie, and Anna were more concerned with the happiness and well-being of their small, individual lives.</p>
<p>Not a single person actively wished to contribute to the war.</p>
<p>To them, this was a war born of pathetic arrogance, cruel misunderstandings, failed diplomatic deception, ignorant nationalism, and long-standing distrust and mutual hatred.</p>
<p>And these things, beyond destroying their humble happiness, had nothing to do with them at all.</p>
<p>Freddie sought revenge for his wife, Anna was searching for her father, and Emile and Karl were forced into the army. On the battlefield, they cared not for victory in war, but only whether their family members were safe.</p>
<p>The game allowed players to experience the pain that war inflicted on people through these ordinary individuals.</p>
<p>As a tiny part of the battlefield, the protagonist would experience hails of bullets and explosions, muddy trenches, freezing winters, and the threats posed by various weapons of war.</p>
<p>They all shared a common wish: for the war to end soon so they could return to their families.</p>
<p>It had to be said, Liuliu now felt the emotions the game sought to express.</p>
<p>Numbly controlling Karl to escape the prisoner-of-war camp, Liuliu's heart still worried about Freddie and the dog, whose fates were unknown, and Emile, who was still trapped outside the fortress.</p>
<p>But the next moment, the game's storyline made her breathe a long sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Because Freddie was not dead; it was still the dog.</p>
<p>Just as it had saved Emile earlier, the dog dragged Freddie out of the ruins.</p>
<p>Here, through Freddie's memories, Liuliu's speculation about his backstory was also confirmed.</p>
<p>Why did Freddie hate war so much? Because war had taken his wife's life.</p>
<p>On Freddie's side, Anna's father, the Old Professor, had also survived. The two repaired a damaged tank.</p>
<p>Driving the tank, the two crushed their way out of the castle, and on the other side, Emile had also successfully escaped.</p>
<p>Although the mission failed, bringing back the Old Professor and capturing a tank still greatly excited the French army.</p>
<p>The group took a photo together, and Emile wrote a letter to Anna.</p>
<p>But this time together was very brief. Soon, Emile and Freddie separated. Freddie went to Somme, while Emile was sent to Vovra Mountain to engage in mine tunnel warfare against the German army.</p>
<p>Here, both sides were strenuously digging tunnels, and the atmosphere was extremely tense.</p>
<p>In this place, the enemy and our army might be separated by only a layer of soil, so even stethoscopes, used for healing and saving lives, became tools of war.</p>
<p>"It's truly too heavy and oppressive," Liuliu sighed, looking at the game screen in front of her computer.</p>
<p>Canaries in cages, used to detect underground gas levels, and the constantly dying mine soldiers.</p>
<p>Despite still having a cartoon graffiti art style, all it brought now was a sense of oppression.</p>
<p>At this moment, a cry for help came from the right side of the screen. Liuliu controlled Emile in the game and dug to the right.</p>
<p>Compared to Emile, who had been holding a spoon earlier, he had now upgraded his equipment, successfully evolving from a cook into a miner, his spoon replaced by a military shovel.</p>
<p>"Ah, that's a German officer, not one of our own."</p>
<p>After digging open the passage, Liuliu saw a German officer who had accidentally touched a cable and was suspended in mid-air, gesticulating wildly and calling for help.</p>
<p>"Alas, they are all pitiable people of war. Wait a moment, I'm coming to save you."</p>
<p>Looking at the game screen, Liuliu sighed emotionally and, along with the dog, used the nearby handwheel to lower the German officer.</p>
<p>The German officer, once lowered, looked at Emile approaching, put away the gun in his hand in advance, and then extended his hand in a friendly manner.</p>
<p>"Am I making a German friend?" Liuliu, in front of her computer, looked surprised.</p>
<p>The left passage in the game was blocked off, so Emile could only search for a new way out with the German officer.</p>
<p>Along the way, the two cooperated and successfully escaped.</p>
<p>As Emile was about to leave, a group of German soldiers discovered them.</p>
<p>But at that moment, the German officer actively explained on Emile's behalf, helping Emile return to his unit.</p>
<p>Watching the two shake hands in an expression of friendship, Liuliu in front of her computer revealed a slight smile.</p>
<p>"How wonderful, this part of the story is so healing! In such a cruel war, such heartwarming scenes are truly rare and precious." Liuliu sighed emotionally: "I wonder if you've read a novel called 'War Horse'; there's a similar scene in it. It's truly wonderful... I feel like I've been healed."</p>
<p>"It seems Chen Xu wasn't speaking aimlessly when he said he was a Warrior of Love! How heartwarming this story is." Liuliu smiled at her computer.</p>
<p>The heavy atmosphere in the game had always made her a little uncomfortable.</p>
<p>But now, this heartwarming scene was like a warm sun suddenly appearing in winter, making her feel completely warm.</p>
<p>However... this warm sun didn't last too long.</p>
<p>Back at the Command Center in the game, Emile received a new mission: to transport a box of things.</p>
<p>After delivering the items to the destination, the soldiers uncovered a white cloth, revealing that it was all explosives.</p>
<p>Even more importantly, the game screen then showed a close-up of the environment above where the explosives were placed.</p>
<p>A familiar face appeared in Liuliu's line of sight.</p>
<p>"No way! Isn't that my friend! No way!"</p>
<p>Seeing this, Liuliu felt a bad premonition in her heart.</p>
<p>What happened next confirmed her premonition.</p>
<p>The explosives detonated, inflicting heavy losses on the German army. The German officer who had saved Emile was blown up on the spot.</p>
<p>[The French officer gloated over the heavy losses suffered by the enemy.]</p>
<p>[Emile, considering this a cowardly act and filled with indignation, refused the medal.]</p>
<p>Emile threw the newly awarded medal into the scorching flames, and at this moment, Anna delivered an even heavier blow.</p>
<p>Karl, who had attempted to escape the prisoner-of-war camp, had been executed.</p>
<p>Just like Emile in the game, Liuliu in front of her computer and other players who reached this point were all bewildered.</p>
<p>In that instant, Liuliu thought of her earlier praise for Chen Xu. Now, she only wanted to say one thing: Can I rewind?</p>
<p>What happened to the heartwarming story? What healing! This is pure grief-inducing!</p>
<p>The earlier warmth was just to make the heartbreak deeper!</p>
<p>One moment they were friends, the next I didn't directly kill Boren, but he died because of me.</p>
<p>Even though she knew this was war.</p>
<p>And perhaps, true war was even crueler than this.</p>
<p>But emotionally, it was still very uncomfortable.</p>
