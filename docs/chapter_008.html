<p>Chapter 8: Philosophy Mode, Activated (Please recommend!)</p>
<p>"Hmm, this UI interface seems quite pretty!"</p>
<p>Upon entering the game, Jiang Ping's eyes lit up at the UI interface.</p>
<p>Despite being a not-so-mature Lewd Person, Jiang Ping hadn't played many Gentleman's Games.</p>
<p>However, he still had some rudimentary experience with this type of game.</p>
<p>Although most of the games he'd played were made using the Official Game Engine, even their UI content was often a mess.</p>
<p>But this Mirror (Game), at least in terms of its UI, was actually quite good.</p>
<p>"Can I only choose one character?"</p>
<p>After clicking to enter the game, Jiang Ping looked at a diamond shape in the center.</p>
<p>Inside were various characters, but only one Dark Elf was selectable.</p>
<p>The rest were locked.</p>
<p>"So many characters to choose from? It seems... a bit rich!"</p>
<p>Jiang Ping's face showed surprise.</p>
<p>At the same time, there was a little excitement in his heart.</p>
<p>Subconsciously, Jiang Ping glanced at the dorm door.</p>
<p>The dorm door was still closed; his roommates were all out for the day.</p>
<p>Walking to the door, Jiang Ping closed and then locked it.</p>
<p>Sitting back in front of the computer, looking at the game screen he had entered, he couldn't help but take a deep breath, his expression becoming solemn and sacred.</p>
<p>Of course, in his mind, he had a different thought altogether.</p>
<p>Starting with a Dark Elf character right off the bat? This is too stimulating!</p>
<p>With a tiny bit of excitement, Jiang Ping followed the tutorial and clicked on an icon similar to a combat one.</p>
<p>"On this deep night, Blackwater Castle, somewhat isolated from the world, unexpectedly welcomed uninvited guests."</p>
<p>"Those almost invisible shadows gradually emerged."</p>
<p>Looking at the game screen and the subsequent options,</p>
<p>Jiang Ping was stunned. Isn't this a Gentleman's Game? This... why does it look like a visual novel?</p>
<p>It even has a plot?</p>
<p>Jiang Ping scratched his head, but didn't think too much, just clicked a few times randomly.</p>
<p>Seeing the game enter combat, Jiang Ping was stunned again.</p>
<p>Is this game really a Match-3 game?</p>
<p>He had seen people on forums say it was the best Match-3 game, and Jiang Ping thought they were joking.</p>
<p>But now, the gameplay really is Match-3?</p>
<p>"Hmm, orange orbs increase physical attack, sword icons are physical, stars are magic, and potions restore health."</p>
<p>"Connecting four identical orbs gives an enhanced orb, and five creates a magic diamond that deals massive damage."</p>
<p>"And there are items and special skills that can be used, though currently there's only one health-restoring item."</p>
<p>Following the newbie guide, Jiang Ping quickly understood the game's combat system.</p>
<p>Then he was a little surprised.</p>
<p>Was he playing a Gentleman's Game or a normal Match-3 game?</p>
<p>Why were there so many variations?</p>
<p>Jiang Ping looked astonished. He knew that the Gentleman's Games he used to play rarely had so many tricks.</p>
<p>Some were basically just click, click, click, and then the character art would pop up.</p>
<p>And some of the poor-quality ones were particularly perfunctory.</p>
<p>But this Mirror (Game) was something special!</p>
<p>The combat system was excessively rich!</p>
<p>Well, for a Gentleman's Game, that is.</p>
<p>Besides, there was even a plot! And the Lewd Person elements... there's something there, and a lot of it!</p>
<p>Pursing his lips and narrowing his eyes, Jiang Ping leaned forward slightly, temporarily turning off the small speaker on his desk.</p>
<p>He took a pair of earbud headphones from the drawer, plugged them into the computer, and put one earbud in.</p>
<p>After successfully completing the Match-3 game and launching an attack, the Dark Elf even had attack sound effects.</p>
<p>And when the health reached a certain level, the clothes...</p>
<p>Ah! That's right!</p>
<p>According to the previous plot, the era should be the Middle Ages, right?</p>
<p>No wonder the clothes were of such poor quality!</p>
<p>The living conditions of the people back then were truly harsh. Look at how tattered these clothes are, look at how tanned this skin is.</p>
<p>Matching five identical tiles even produced a diamond, and the damage was so high!</p>
<p>One could also use unique skills and purchase corresponding items to aid in attacks.</p>
<p>There was even a turn limit; only 13 turns left, and why did this elf still have so much health?</p>
<p>After a brief trial, Jiang Ping's attention quickly shifted from the elf's clothes to the Match-3 game.</p>
<p>He had to admit, this Match-3 game actually seemed pretty fun!</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>"The quality is absolutely explosive!"</p>
<p>After two consecutive battles, he entered PLAY mode.</p>
<p>Jiang Ping felt as if all the Gentleman's Games he had played before were a waste of time.</p>
<p>What is a Gentleman's Game?</p>
<p><em>This</em> is a Gentleman's Game!</p>
<p>What were those previous ones?</p>
<p>They only had gentlemanly content but no game.</p>
<p>Of course, if that were all, it would be acceptable, as long as the content itself was strong.</p>
<p>But some were just poorly made, did they really think gentlemen's money wasn't real money?</p>
<p>Look at this Mirror (Game). Not only is it highly practical, but the game content is also so rich. <em>This</em> is the quality a Gentleman's Game should have, <em>this</em> is what a true Gentleman's Game should contain!</p>
<p>And it even has Galgame elements?</p>
<p>And two endings?</p>
<p>Jiang Ping, who had just achieved a Pure Love Ending on his first playthrough, recalled the different choices he made.</p>
<p>Seeing that the Dark Elf character's unlock progress was only at 50%, he became incredibly excited.</p>
<p>He never expected that instead of finding the doujinshi he wanted, he would stumble upon such a divine game!</p>
<p>"Hmm, I won't play new characters yet. I'll check out the other storyline first."</p>
<p>"Following normal game logic, the second ending should probably be the Dark Elf turning evil, right?"</p>
<p>With curiosity, a tiny bit of excitement, and nervousness, Jiang Ping clicked in again.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Ten minutes later—</p>
<p>"Why is it like this?"</p>
<p>Sitting in front of the computer, Jiang Ping felt both excited and moved.</p>
<p>She was born into nobility but cared deeply for the impoverished commoners, even resorting to theft herself to help them.</p>
<p>Yet, the very commoners she had helped turned out to be ugly, shameless, and repaid kindness with ingratitude.</p>
<p>Facing the Dark Elf captured by the devil, these commoners harbored only evil thoughts in their minds.</p>
<p>Although the in-game character art was still explosive, the voice acting in this game, compared to other Gentleman's Games, was phenomenal.</p>
<p>But Jiang Ping still felt a mix of emotions in his heart.</p>
<p>Especially later, when he saw a Young Guard who came in, despite having good intentions,</p>
<p>Still couldn't uphold his moral bottom line and extended a sinful hand towards her.</p>
<p>This was like the last straw that broke the camel's back.</p>
<p>Coupled with the final scene of the devil smirking in the shadows outside the wall, it moved Jiang Ping deeply.</p>
<p>He could perhaps understand why the well-known gentlemen on the forums reacted so unusually to this game.</p>
<p>This was not just a simple Gentleman's Game.</p>
<p>It also contained a questioning of human nature and an exploration of good and evil.</p>
<p>This instantly prompted Jiang Ping to ponder some philosophical questions and thoughts.</p>
<p>Is human nature inherently good, as Mencius said, or inherently evil, as Xunzi said?</p>
<p>Why did these people repay the elf who helped them with ingratitude?</p>
<p>Why, despite having good intentions in the end, did evil prevail?</p>
<p>Jiang Ping, immersed in philosophical mode, was earnestly contemplating.</p>
<p>However, this was only the beginning.</p>
<p>Seeking all kinds of votes, the author bows down and kowtows~ [Thump, thump, thump]</p>
