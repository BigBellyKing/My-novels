                <p>Chapter 318: Level-Based Cinematic Game (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>During the New Year, players were still discussing Nebula Games' massive losses.</p>
<p>Although various little green bars made Chen Xu's hands almost too busy to keep up. After all, players had too much money to spend.</p>
<p>But since players were saying Nebula Games was losing a ton of money, then it had to lose a little, after all. After all, he was good at everything, except he was too honest and never lied.</p>
<p>So, on the official Weibo account, Chen Xu also held a daily lottery event. <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, <em>Warcraft</em>, and some cash red envelopes, with frequent interaction with players. After all, these things were just a trifle for Chen Xu now. Moreover, the wool comes from the sheep itself, right?</p>
<p>Opening the work group chat, Chen Xu also sent out some red envelopes, and chatted about some interesting things with Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue. Just then, his phone rang. Picking up the phone, Chen Xu was slightly taken aback. It was Yang Chen, the Minister of the Game Department, on the other end of the line.</p>
<p>"Happy New Year, Minister Yang," Chen Xu said with a smile as he answered the call.</p>
<p>"Happy New Year, Mr. Chen," Yang Chen on the other end also cheerfully greeted him. After a few casual remarks, Yang Chen paused before saying, "Mr. Chen, do you still remember participating in the VR test the year before last?"</p>
<p>"Of course. Does the Game Department have any new policies?" Chen Xu nodded in response.</p>
<p>"There's nothing new in that regard, it's just that the new version of VR will be launched globally after the New Year. Not only the domestic new VR, but also the latest generation of VR developed overseas will be launched," Yang Chen paused and continued.</p>
<p>"So, Mr. Chen, if your post-New Year development plan hasn't been finalized, you might consider VR. <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> has shown excellent results, and as one of the first games to support the new VR version, relevant departmental resources will also be made available," Yang Chen from the Game Department said to Chen Xu. "I've already sent the specific details to your game editor's backend. You can review them in detail yourself."</p>
<p>Chen Xu replied, "Alright, Minister Yang, I understand. I'll look into it."</p>
<p>Then Chen Xu chatted with him a bit more before opening his computer to understand the situation. Regarding the new generation of VR technology, Chen Xu had already learned about it when he developed <em>Silent Hill PT</em>. The related experience, including the level of game support, was much stronger than the current stage. Especially when combined with the resources opened up by the Game Department, it could completely bring a more immersive experience.</p>
<p>Similarly, the launch of the new VR version also brought about a market grab. Overseas, the latest VR was also being launched, and with the domestic VR launch, both sides were essentially competing for market standard discourse power. And what determined this was, naturally, games.</p>
<p>As for whether the new VR version would fail to sell due to its small market share, there was no need to worry too much about that. After all, game compatibility in the Parallel World was much more convenient than in his previous life. Moreover, with a unified architecture, developing games for the new VR version could also support the old VR version, though the immersion might not be as strong. At the same time, most players who bought the new VR version would essentially buy games released on the new VR. After all, there was no choice. If you didn't buy games for the new VR, what would you buy the new VR for? Could it be to experience old games?</p>
<p>This time, it seemed like an escort for the new VR, but in reality, it was also an opportunity. Because in the future, the new VR would inevitably phase out the old VR step by step. Similarly, in terms of game editor engines, supporting new VR development technology could allow Nebula Games to be one step ahead of some game developers. This was clearly the benefit brought by participating in the new VR test and matters related to <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>.</p>
<p>The day after the Game Department communicated with Chen Xu, Meng Zuo also called Chen Xu to discuss this matter. Of course, the other party represented NetDragon. According to NetDragon's intentions, they were not planning to develop new games but would focus on the <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> project. Although the child was not their own and had no blood relation to them, NetDragon had half the custody. If treated well, it could also bring honor to NetDragon in the future. So, NetDragon and Chen Xu reached an agreement on this matter.</p>
<p>For the PC version development and the new VR version development of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, NetDragon would be responsible, and Nebula Games would just share the porting costs according to the development expenses. As for the new VR version, NetDragon would not be involved in the first quarter. Of course, Chen Xu hadn't intended to include NetDragon in this particular venture anyway.</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>Time advanced day by day, and the seventh day of the Lunar New Year was the first official workday. Most employees in various departments at Nebula Games had returned to their posts. During this period, news about the new VR version also began to surface online.</p>
<p>However, it first came from overseas, with the announcement that a new VR version named Zeus was about to launch. Meanwhile, domestic preparations were clearly complete, and less than a day later, the latest VR version, named Huanyu, was also announced. In the initial phase of the announcement, both sides mainly promoted the performance parameters and various effects of their new VR versions. Essentially, it was all about making grand promises.</p>
<p>Until the overseas side made the first move: the renowned game developer Atrai announced its new title would be launching on Zeus. And Atrai also stated that the new game would be an IP game adapted from a movie, the popular 'Storm Action' that launched a few years ago. At that time, the movie 'Storm Action' was a huge hit globally, with a worldwide box office of 800 million USD.</p>
<p>At the same time, the domestic Channel Alliance also announced that it had reached a strategic cooperation agreement with Atrai and would be acting as the publishing agent for this game. Clearly, the target was <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, developed by Nebula Games and NetDragon before the New Year. As for TengHua, they didn't get involved this time. After all, in the new era VR battle between Zeus and Huanyu, unless TengHua had their heads squeezed by a door, they would definitely stand with the Game Department.</p>
<p>But for the Channel Alliance, it didn't matter. Except for channel providers like Hero Entertainment that had R&amp;D departments, the other channels simply followed the publishing agency route. Huanyu and Zeus had absolutely nothing to do with them. As for ordinary players, they were the most straightforward group. Whichever platform had good games to play, that's the platform I'd support.</p>
<p>For a time, players both domestically and internationally were discussing topics related to 'Storm Action' and Atrai. Similarly, within Nebula Games, everyone was also discussing it.</p>
<p>"Atrai is really rich and powerful! They directly bought such a huge IP!" Ruan Ningxue exclaimed, looking at the news.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I rewatched that movie a while ago. Although it didn't have much depth, it was so satisfying to watch!" Yang Xin agreed.</p>
<p>"Adapted into a VR game, it's definitely going to be explosive!" Qin Yi also sighed with emotion.</p>
<p>Walking over to the group, Chen Xu, who had heard the entire conversation, smiled, "That's not necessarily true. In fact, whether it's a manga adaptation or a movie adaptation into a game, sometimes they can fall into an awkward situation." Chen Xu said with a smile, "Adapting an IP is nothing more than for the original fans, but movies and games are inherently two different mediums."</p>
<p>Movie adaptations into games, or game adaptations into movies, sounded very promising. But in his previous life, there were already many bloody examples. The only truly successful one was the Resident Evil series, but even that was changed so much that its own mother wouldn't recognize it. Following the movie's plot, how do you expand a two-hour film into a main storyline of over ten or twenty hours? Endless mobs, complex mazes, and quests like an old lady needing help crossing the road? If you really did that, players would mercilessly give negative reviews.</p>
<p>The same goes for game adaptations into movies: how do you compress a ten or twenty-hour game into a one or two-hour movie? Compared to film and television adaptations, novels, which lack visual comparison, are clearly more suitable. Or simply manga and anime-themed games that are purely fan-oriented and unchanged.</p>
<p>"Besides, how can adapting an IP be as exciting as creating your own?" Chen Xu said with a smile. "Notify all departments to prepare for a meeting this afternoon. We're starting a new project."</p>
<p>"New project!?" Hearing this, Qin Yi and the others immediately became excited.</p>
<p>"What is it, Mr. Chen!?" Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin looked at Chen Xu expectantly.</p>
<p>"Didn't Atrai adapt a movie into a game? And it's a special forces theme. We'll do one too. A level-based cinematic game, and for the theme, modern warfare and special forces would be good," Chen Xu said, stretching.</p>
