                <p>Chapter 320: Rich and Reckless! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>In Nebula Games' office, Chen Xu was still discussing a detailed issue regarding the development of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare with everyone.</p>
<p>Chen Xu hadn't elaborated on the overall framework. But when it came to details, a lot could still be done. Especially the decision to render a map with abundant resources, to give players a movie-like experience. The pursuit, naturally, was the ultimate visual effect.</p>
<p>In competitive multiplayer mode, this kind of visual effect might not be what most players seek. But in the single-player story, an ultimate visual effect would definitely allow players to immerse themselves more deeply in the plot. This was beyond doubt.</p>
<p>“Regarding the physics engine, the Game Department hasn't sent over the development prototype yet, but I've already gained a rough understanding of some related data.”</p>
<p>“Although it's already very powerful compared to its current performance on VR, there are still many detailed areas that require our manual input.”</p>
<p>“The shattered glass and walls of houses all need to have a special effect created.”</p>
<p>Along with Chen Xu's various introductions, everyone present was astonished.</p>
<p>So many detailed elements!</p>
<p>“But with Mr. Chen's new VR equipment parameters, such complex and massive scenes would probably be difficult to achieve, right?” Qin Yi raised a question.</p>
<p>It wasn't that they couldn't do it, but that current equipment standards could hardly handle it.</p>
<p>“We'll apply all the VR equipment's capabilities to a single level,” Chen Xu said.</p>
<p>“But in that case, the game's sense of fragmentation would be quite severe, requiring players to endure a period of loading,” Qin Yi continued.</p>
<p>“Play the CG,” Chen Xu glanced at Qin Yi and stated succinctly.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, Qin Yi also realized.</p>
<p>Good heavens, it really was a simple and crude method!</p>
<p>How to make players unaware of loading, ensuring a consistently smooth experience?</p>
<p>The answer was simple: turn the loading screen into a CG playback, and ensure the CG playback was longer than the loading time.</p>
<p>This could be described as a very simple and crude method. Yet, few game developers would do it.</p>
<p>As for why?</p>
<p>Because it didn't significantly improve the overall game quality. And it was expensive!</p>
<p>But for Chen Xu, he clearly understood the value of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. CGI animation? A small matter, money talks! And compared to Warcraft, an RTS game that struggled to add subsequent revenue points, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, as an FPS game, like Rainbow Six Siege, could incorporate quite a few pay-to-win elements.</p>
<p>What remained was the firearm sound effects, which were also artificially created. For example, sounds like missiles were recorded using snowmobiles and then tuned. Real sound effects differ greatly from what players imagine. Just like war games, if the game depicted the grim scenes like a documentary, most players would probably lose interest. After all, what many players want is something they imagine, not reality. Just like catgirls, players want the cute, two-dimensional type, like chocolate, vanilla, red bean, or coconut, not those from grotesque stories. As for the shooting feel and actions of firearms in VR, Nebula Games originally had no experience in this area, but now Chen Xu could only say: NetDragon, thank you.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>After confirming some development details for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare with the team, Chen Xu returned to his office to refine some subsequent game content.</p>
<p>In Chen Xu's view, the gameplay of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was already quite mature. Moreover, compared to current FPS games on the market, many designs in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare were still very advanced. As for Rainbow Six Siege, which had just launched, it was a completely different type of game, and the target audience was actually different.</p>
