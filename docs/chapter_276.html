                <p>Chapter 275: Trial Version Goes Live (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>After watching the CGI animation released by Chen Xu, both players and game industry designers were bewildered.</p>
<p>Ordinary players didn't feel much, simply marveling at how well an RTS game's CGI promotional video could be made!</p>
<p>Compared to previous games like Monster Hunter: World and Dark Souls, it was significantly stronger.</p>
<p>A visible improvement!</p>
<p>But for industry insiders, what did this minute-plus video mean to them?</p>
<p>It was a stack of burning cash!</p>
<p>"I'm uncultured, but 'holy cow' is universally understood—this CGI is too awesome!"</p>
<p>"Yeah! If Chen Xu hadn't said before that Warcraft was an RTS game, I absolutely wouldn't have believed it!"</p>
<p>"At that point, surely Warcraft's story won't all be made with this level of CGI, right?"</p>
<p>"Probably not, right? How much money would that cost?"</p>
<p>"Didn't Chen Xu say so?"</p>
<p>"Holy cow, if that's really the case, does that mean all that huge sum of money was invested in CGI animation?"</p>
<p>"No way? Nebula Games is a game company, not an animation company. Is an RTS game really worth such a huge investment?"</p>
<p>"I don't think it's possible for other companies, but this is Nebula Games! Look at the Nebula Games Platform, could you have imagined someone doing this before?"</p>
<p>"Then that's truly awesome!"</p>
<p>"Now I'm more curious about the expressions of the designers at Hero Entertainment. Previously, Human Wars had a graphics reset and a major new version update, which was clearly aimed at Warcraft. Now, at the very least, this CGI has definitely blown Human Wars out of the water, to who knows where."</p>
<p>Many designers and players in the industry discussed the CGI promotional video released by Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at Hero Entertainment, Zhou Qi looked as if he'd been hit by a truck.</p>
<p>Because the CGI's performance was simply top-notch.</p>
<p>This was completely smashed out with money!</p>
<p>Could their Hero Entertainment do it?</p>
<p>Of course they could!</p>
<p>After all, this kind of thing relied on money.</p>
<p>But he was certain that a proposal for a graphics remaster could be approved.</p>
<p>However, wanting to create CGI of this caliber was basically an impossible task.</p>
<p>Could Chen Xu really have poured 700 million Yuan into an RTS game?</p>
<p>And most of it invested in CGI production?</p>
<p>Originally, he had completely disbelieved Nebula Games' boasts of "redefining RTS" and "700 million Yuan cost."</p>
<p>After all, who couldn't boast in their promotions?</p>
<p>He remembered when Human Wars launched, he almost declared it the strongest RTS game in the galaxy, bar none.</p>
<p>Just like those movies that claimed a production cost of 200 million Yuan, but was it really that much?</p>
<p>No, it wasn't!</p>
<p>But he had to admit, having money was really nice.</p>
<p>Watching the video on Chen Xu's official Weibo account, Zhou Qi felt a tinge of bitterness in his heart.</p>
<p>Of course, these thoughts lasted only a moment, and Zhou Qi quickly calmed down.</p>
<p>After all, what good was it if the CGI was amazing?</p>
<p>This was a game, not a movie or an animation.</p>
<p>As an RTS game, it still depended on its gameplay!</p>
<p>Your CGI is awesome, your graphics are awesome, but is any of that useful for an RTS?</p>
<p>Moreover, Chen Xu had never touched the RTS field before; he didn't believe this Warcraft could shock him speechless!</p>
<p>Many designers and players shared Zhou Qi's opinion.</p>
<p>However, they soon shifted their attention to the game's content.</p>
<p>In various RTS communities and forums, many players who enjoyed this genre were also discussing it.</p>
<p>"Have you guys been following the news about Warcraft?"</p>
<p>"Definitely! The CGI was absolutely incredible, I just wonder what the actual game quality will be like."</p>
<p>"I have a feeling it won't be bad. After all, Monster Hunter: World, Minecraft, and Dark Souls were all made by Chen Xu."</p>
<p>"But RTS is different!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, RTS is different from other game genres. Graphics and CGI are just icing on the cake; the main thing is gameplay and balance."</p>
<p>"Who cares? Anyway, there'll be a free trial, right? Won't we know for ourselves if we just try it?"</p>
<p>"That's true."</p>
<p>Amidst various discussions from players and industry designers, time slowly moved to November 11th.</p>
<p>The trial version of Warcraft had already opened its download channel early, allowing players to pre-download it and then enter the game to play as soon as it unlocked.</p>
<p>As for the trial content, it was similar to the previous Monster Hunter: World.</p>
<p>This was because Chen Xu had directly combined the Reign of Chaos and The Frozen Throne from his previous life into a single version.</p>
<p>Therefore, in terms of story, players could fully experience the content of the first chapter, aside from the prologue.</p>
<p>Which was the story of the disaster in the Kingdom of Lordaeron.</p>
<p>However, the online versus mode was temporarily locked.</p>
<p>Besides this, during this period, Chen Xu also successively announced some new information about Warcraft.</p>
<p>First was the official launch date, which, unlike Monster Hunter: World, was different this time.</p>
<p>It was quite a bit earlier, with the official version launching on November 15th.</p>
<p>As for the price, the domestic price was 198 Yuan, while the overseas price was 39.9 USD.</p>
<p>Just like before, there was a Steelbook Collector's Edition, priced at 899 Yuan domestically and 159.9 USD overseas. Compared to the standard digital version, the Collector's Edition included a Blu-ray DVD collecting all CGI scenes, a Collector's Edition Frostmourne collectible figure, an art book album, and related descriptions of races, characters, and the worldview background. It could be said that the content was quite substantial.</p>
<p>However, simply speaking about the pricing of the digital version, it was relatively low compared to some traditional action, RPG, and FPS blockbusters, but in the RTS genre, it was considered a rather high price point.</p>
<p>"This price is a bit expensive!"</p>
<p>"Not expensive. Look at Chen Xu's previous games; the pricing generally favored domestic players, and the quality was beyond reproach. This time, Warcraft's pricing is quite a bit higher than similar RTS games, which actually makes me more excited!"</p>
<p>"Exactly, exactly. Before, Chen Xu's games were cheaper than similar types and their quality was strong. This time, Nebula Games surprisingly gave such a high price, I think it must be worth it!"</p>
<p>"One digital version, one Collector's Edition, no explanation needed!"</p>
<p>"Awesome, bro, but I'll still download the free trial first to see what the quality is like before deciding."</p>
<p>"Right, anyway, there are still 4 days until the official launch from the trial period. If it's to my liking, I'll just buy it then."</p>
<p>Because it adopted the same strategy of first launching a free trial version, many players had no reservations and eagerly downloaded it, preparing to see what the game, which had previously released such amazing CGI, was actually like.</p>
