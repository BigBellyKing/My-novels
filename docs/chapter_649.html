                <p>Chapter 648: The One-of-a-Kind World of Warcraft (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>With the launch of World of Warcraft, players became immersed in the vivid world of Azeroth.</p>
<p>Most players' levels had basically reached the 35-tier. As for the first batch of players like Song Ren and his friends, their main levels had already reached over 40.</p>
<p>The Scarlet Cathedral had stumped them for a whole day, and they only managed to push through after grinding their levels to 40.</p>
<p>After a few days of playtime, most players had a good understanding of the game's mechanics. Various class guides, as well as dungeon guides, had also appeared.</p>
<p>The most popular class was the Mage, followed by the Warrior.</p>
<p>Although it felt quite arduous, influenced by Warcraft, the Warrior class still held a high status in players' hearts.</p>
<p>Additionally, melee combat felt very impactful when fighting monsters, which indirectly enhanced the appeal of melee classes.</p>
<p>A continuous stream of new players constantly poured into the vast world of Azeroth, joining either the Alliance or the Horde.</p>
<p>Many players were even directly captivated by World of Warcraft, resolving to purchase the latest Huanyu VR equipment.</p>
<p>On Nebula Games' official forum, hot posts about World of Warcraft were endless.</p>
<p>They all chronicled their experiences and observations in Azeroth over the past few days.</p>
<p>“Haha, I finally got a full set of Scarlet Crusader Set! Combined with the Whirlwind Axe I just got, I feel invincible!”</p>
<p>“But World of Warcraft has so many dungeons, and so many quests in each area.”</p>
<p>“Exactly, I wonder which way is faster for leveling.”</p>
<p>“I feel like grinding monsters, doing dungeons, or doing quests, the leveling speed is all similar. But I still prefer doing dungeons to farm gear.”</p>
<p>“+1, it feels like there are quests everywhere I go.”</p>
<p>“I still prefer gear.”</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Players discussed animatedly; different players, it can be said, each had their favorite way to play, able to feel the charm of World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>Players who liked PVP could enable the PVP flag in the wilderness, or enter the arena and battlegrounds to fight against players from the Horde or Alliance.</p>
<p>Players who enjoyed the story could explore the world, understanding Azeroth's tales through countless quests.</p>
<p>Of course, there were also gear-driven players, who found their greatest joy in repeatedly clearing dungeons and looting corpses.</p>
<p>Similarly, there were players who enjoyed free-form gathering professions: the Fishermen by the river, the Miners in the caves, and the Engineering and Blacksmithing professions, which only non-wealthy players could truly master.</p>
<p>Compared to other games, World of Warcraft possessed many appealing aspects in different areas.</p>
<p>Players had a multitude of choices; from level zero to max level, there might be one most efficient path.</p>
<p>But it was by no means the only path. Different maps and different methods could all lead players to max level.</p>
<p>It sounds simple, but few MMORPGs, and even most single-player games, have truly achieved this.</p>
<p>Most MMORPGs would have players reach a certain level, and the system would then prompt them that the next main quest could only be unlocked at a higher level.</p>
<p>The main questline in these games often wouldn't get players directly to that target level, usually falling short by one or two levels.</p>
<p>So, to reach that level, players would have to do side quests and engage in supplementary gameplay, such as running dungeons.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage of this design was its ease of control.</p>
<p>Because players had to strictly follow the game path prescribed by the designers.</p>
<p>When to do quests, when to run dungeons, when to grind monsters, and even when to upgrade gear and skills.</p>
<p>All of this was a meticulously planned script.</p>
<p>Players were like puppets on strings in the hands of quest designers and planners.</p>
<p>Why do it this way?</p>
<p>Because it allows for better control over the player's pace in the game, and ensures that players experience every setting the game offers.</p>
<p>But in reality, most of that content was unnecessary for players.</p>
<p>World of Warcraft, however, truly succeeded in creating a vast world.</p>
<p>Much like strong lore-driven open-world games such as The Witcher: Wild Hunt.</p>
<p>Various content was scattered throughout every corner of the game.</p>
<p>Players could discover it, but the game wouldn't force them to engage. Regardless of whether you completed quests, explored, or ran dungeons, the content was there in the game.</p>
<p>And this content wasn't just created for the sake of it; it was designed to complement the world of Azeroth, making the continent richer and more vibrant.</p>
<p>Allowing players to understand Azeroth—this was what made World of Warcraft truly unique.</p>
<p>For these very reasons, leveling up in the early days of World of Warcraft was quite challenging.</p>
<p>Especially after level 40, it took a considerably longer time.</p>
<p>During this period, some purple-tier gear became artifacts yearned for by countless players.</p>
<p>The Blazing Battle Axe, Ice Scale Armor, Headcleaver Kael'thas, Jordan's Staff, Kro's Blade... it could be said that if a player had one of these artifacts, they would definitely be the coolest kid walking around.</p>
<p>Of course, they would also be the fastest to die on the battlefield.</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>“Oh, you guys are a bit slow! When can you afford mounts?”</p>
<p>In the wilderness, Wang Han rode her horse, cheerfully watching Song Ren, Zhang Yi, Joey, and Wang Yifan.</p>
<p>Even though it was just a basic horse, accumulating 100 Gold was not something an average player could easily achieve, unless they sold game time cards.</p>
<p>Especially for Song Ren, a Warrior who had learned Blacksmithing and Engineering, his life was even harder than most.</p>
<p>“Alright, alright, we know Sister Han has a mount! Too bad Sister Han is still just a mascot,” Joey chimed in.</p>
<p>“Low damage.”</p>
<p>“Bad healing.”</p>
<p>“And can't tank!”</p>
<p>Song Ren, Zhang Yi, and Wang Yifan also complained one after another.</p>
<p>Wang Han didn't care at all, looking at the pony under her butt with a happy expression.</p>
<p>Anyway, her horse didn't cost her anything, so being at the bottom was fine!</p>
<p>Watching Wang Han's mount, despite their complaints, Song Ren and the others were still very envious.</p>
<p>Song Ren and the others showed envious expressions.</p>
<p>It must be said, getting a horse early on.</p>
<p>Aside from selling game time cards to get gold, or being a Paladin, a class that could get a horse through quests.</p>
<p>Other players, unless they pooled their money.</p>
<p>Or focused solely on making money, it was very difficult to gather 100 Gold.</p>
<p>The main reason was that World of Warcraft's economic system was incredibly well-developed.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous life where script studios existed.</p>
<p>Huanyu VR and Nebula Games' technology effectively eliminated such situations. There were only manual gold farming studios or players specializing in gathering professions.</p>
<p>Compared to other games, World of Warcraft's gathering professions were incredibly important, influencing not only combat but also the server's economy.</p>
<p>In the game, players could choose secondary professions, and their skills could bring commercial gains.</p>
<p>Moreover, the improvement of these life skills and the items they produced greatly aided players' combat power.</p>
<p>For example, if a Warrior fought a Mage without items and potions, their win rate would be 2:8. With items and potions, the win rate could be narrowed to 3:7.</p>
<p>And players who learned gathering professions naturally needed materials to craft things.</p>
<p>So, the number of high-level gathering profession players would directly impact the price of materials and crafted items.</p>
<p>PVP, PVE, casual gathering professions and commerce, combined with its inherently vast worldview, allowed World of Warcraft to create an extremely vibrant world of Azeroth.</p>
<p>It could be said that all these elements combined made World of Warcraft a truly unique existence.</p>
