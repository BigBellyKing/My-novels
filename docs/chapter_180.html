<p>Chapter 179: Dying Too Naturally! (6th update, requesting subscriptions, monthly passes)</p>
<p>Just like the seemingly difficult BOSSes in the previous game, they all had patterns.</p>
<p>For example, the Ancient Wyvern, where you climb to the top, then perform an aerial plunge attack for an execution, taking it down instantly.</p>
<p>Or Yhorm the Giant, where you grab the Storm Ruler and directly charge it five times to defeat him.</p>
<p>Song Ren believed that there must be a way to deal with the Asylum Demon before him, rather than him having to 'trim its nails' with a small knife to get through.</p>
<p>Entering the gate once again, this time he finally discovered something different.</p>
<p>In the middle of the room, near a pillar on the ground, there was an in-game message.</p>
<p>Clicking on it revealed a message: "Run!"</p>
<p>However, this message was close to the pillar, requiring the player to walk two steps forward.</p>
<p>And in those two steps, the BOSS would jump down from above, directly shifting the player's attention to the BOSS instead of the message on the ground.</p>
<p>Song Ren also keenly noticed that the great demon would pause for two seconds after jumping down.</p>
<p>Clearly, this time was reserved for players to open the message.</p>
<p>But like most players, when he first saw this BOSS, his subconscious reaction was to try and kill it.</p>
<p>Because BOSS battles in Dark Souls usually follow a design where one scene has one BOSS, and you can only proceed to the next area after defeating the BOSS.</p>
<p>Only story-kill BOSSes like the Ancient Wyvern, which show a UI health bar, allow you to find a way to leave.</p>
<p>“So that’s where you were waiting for me! It's a pity that an excellent Firelinker's excellence isn't just in their skill, but also in their mind!”</p>
<p>Slipping into the passage, Song Ren smiled faintly as the gate behind him fell.</p>
<p>Dark Souls sequel? Is that all there is to it!? Is that all there is to it!?</p>
<p>Lighting a bonfire at the entrance of the passage, it was as if he had just used Embers, and Song Ren's body was filled with confidence.</p>
<p>Continuing along the passage, Song Ren found a knight's weapons: a shield and a sword.</p>
<p>“So, I only get weapons here!” Song Ren couldn't help but grumble, looking at the weapons and shield in his equipment slot.</p>
<p>The process of picking up the equipment was smooth enough, but there was an annoying archer in the narrow passage.</p>
<p>Carelessly, Song Ren was shot twice, and seeing his health bar halved, he felt a little unaccustomed to it.</p>
<p>Because in the world of Dark Souls, half health provided too little security; a slight mistake could lead to death.</p>
<p>“Where is the Estus Flask? They didn't cancel the Estus Flask setting, did they?”</p>
<p>Muttering to himself, Song Ren walked forward.</p>
<p>However, he also noticed some differences from the previous game.</p>
<p>In the previous game, a fog gate usually meant encountering a BOSS that had already been seen.</p>
<p>At first, when Song Ren saw the fog gate, he thought he was about to fight the Asylum Demon again, knowing he was at half health and had no Estus Flask.</p>
<p>But after he passed through, he realized it was just a new area, and the fog gate had become something to obstruct the player's view.</p>
<p>He found it a bit strange why the game would be designed this way; wasn't it a bit redundant?</p>
<p>While muttering, Song Ren also discovered a knight locked in a cell, the same knight who had previously rescued him.</p>
<p>“How do I open this thing! Do I have to defeat the demon from before, and it has the key? But that doesn't make sense! Didn't I choose the Master Key as my starting gift? And where is the lock for this thing?” Song Ren felt puzzled looking at the cell in front of him.</p>
<p>He tried attacking it but found no effect.</p>
<p>He could only explore elsewhere.</p>
<p>Following the small staircase downwards, Song Ren soon surprisingly found that the iron door, which he couldn't open earlier, led to the courtyard of the previous BOSS battle outside; he could even see the burning bonfire through the cracks.</p>
<p>So, after passing through the BOSS's small door, he could actually return here?</p>
<p>This made Song Ren feel a bit surprised.</p>
<p>In fact, the previous Dark Souls also had a similar interconnected design, but they were all relatively simple.</p>
<p>But this Undead Asylum, from what looked like a passage, led through a long sewer, and then this door via the staircase could lead back – this top-down spatial connection truly astonished Song Ren.</p>
<p>After all, this was just the beginning of the game, essentially the tutorial map.</p>
<p>After a brief moment of surprise, Song Ren could only choose the other staircase leading upwards.</p>
<p>He would see if there were any other exits first.</p>
<p>With this thought, Song Ren controlled his character to run up the stairs.</p>
<p>As he slowly ascended the stairs, just as he reached the middle, Song Ren heard a 'rumble'.</p>
<p>Then he saw a huge, dark iron ball suddenly roll down the stairs.</p>
<p>Caught off guard, Song Ren had no time to dodge.</p>
<p>And he was shot several times by the archer in the corridor, leaving him with only about half his health.</p>
<p>So...</p>
<p>The familiar three words appeared on the screen again.</p>
<p>【YOU DIED!】</p>
<p>Damn it!</p>
<p>Song Ren cursed inwardly.</p>
<p>This is a scam!</p>
<p>Traps could be said to be a major feature of Dark Souls.</p>
<p>For example, Mimics, and various other traps.</p>
<p>But in the previous game, he only encountered the first Mimic trap after defeating Teacher Gundyr and reaching the High Wall of Lothric.</p>
<p>Yet now, this big iron ball came rolling down with a thump-thump.</p>
<p>He never expected it.</p>
<p>The first BOSS isn't even dead yet, and traps are already appearing?</p>
<p>Moreover, this big iron ball felt exactly like the Bone Ball in the Catacombs of Carthus.</p>
<p>The only difference was that on both sides, there weren't bottomless abysses.</p>
<p>But this death was too natural, wasn't it!?</p>
<p>However, even though he died, Song Ren made a new discovery.</p>
<p>The big iron ball had smashed through the wall of the knight's cell.</p>
<p>“So, the previous fog gate was warning me about dangers ahead?” After resurrecting at the bonfire, Song Ren re-ran the map. Because he had opened a shortcut earlier, he hadn't saved at the courtyard bonfire, so he resurrected at the bonfire in the corridor where he got the equipment.</p>
<p>After resurrecting, Song Ren quickly ran back to his death point and talked to the knight in the cell.</p>
<p>‘Ah, you… you are not a Hollow, that's great….’</p>
<p>‘I am at my limit. Once I die, I will no longer be able to maintain my sanity.’</p>
<p>‘I want to ask you for something, and you, like me, are Undead. Please accept my request and listen…’</p>
<p>Next, an option popped up: yes or no.</p>
<p>It looked like a main story quest, so Song Ren directly chose yes.</p>
<p>The knight continued to speak.</p>
<p>‘It's shameful to admit, but what I ask of you is my mission….’</p>
<p>‘I wish to entrust it to you, a stranger…’</p>
<p>‘In my family, it is said that:’</p>
<p>‘Undead signifies bearing a mission. With this Undead body, one must travel from the Undead Asylum to the Land of Ancient Kings and ring the Bell of Awakening, to learn of the Undead's mission.’</p>
<p>‘Thank you… With this, I can finally die with hope.’</p>
<p>‘Ah, one more thing, please take these as well.’</p>
<p>After a simple conversation, Song Ren received a familiar Estus Flask and the key to the second floor east side of the Undead Asylum.</p>
<p>“Five Estus Flasks? My goodness, that many?!”</p>
<p>Song Ren looked at the acquired Estus Flasks with surprise.</p>
<p>After all, in the previous game, before fighting Gundyr, there were only three.</p>
<p>Even after converting the blue pulse potion into Fruit Pulp Orange Juice at the Firelink Shrine, it was still only four.</p>
<p>And now, right from the start, there are five!</p>
<p>“But good brother, did you forget something?”</p>
