                <p>Chapter 279: Redefining RTS (Fifth Update, Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Looking at the screen, Zhang Yi, sitting in front of his computer, had only one feeling.</p>
<p>That was an overwhelming sense of frustration.</p>
<p>It was like having a delicious, steaming hot meat bun placed right in front of you. Its enticing aroma wafted over, making your mouth water. You picked up the warm bun and took a big bite. First, you savored the fluffy texture of the plain white dough, and the savory juices from the meat filling seeped into the wrapper. Your tongue had even touched the dough infused with the rich broth. But then, suddenly, someone snatched the bun away, not letting you eat it. What was even more infuriating was that, after taking away the bun where you were just about to reach the juicy filling and the soup-soaked wrapper, they didn't hide the big white bun. Instead, they held it right up to your nose, letting you smell it, but absolutely forbidding you to eat. Tell me, isn't that outrageous?! It's just too damn much!</p>
<p>It wasn't just Zhang Yi; all players who had experienced <em>Warcraft</em> immediately pre-ordered the game, then flocked to the official Weibo account to vent their frustration and 'rage'.</p>
<p>A trending topic titled 'Kill the Cliffhanger-Dog' unknowingly soared to the top of the trending list.</p>
<p>However, although the players' reactions this time were as aggressive as they were for the <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> trial version back then.</p>
<p>More players, however, were also marveling at the game's performance.</p>
<p>After all, the trial version of <em>Warcraft</em> had truly stunned them.</p>
<p>Every player who had tried it was discussing the game's presentation in relevant game communities.</p>
<p>“It's… it's just too damn amazing! Every CGI feels so stunning!”</p>
<p>“How could it not be stunning?! Now I understand why this game had a 700 million Yuan development cost!”</p>
<p>“As expected, I felt something was off with the earlier plot; Arthas truly has fallen!”</p>
<p>“The Prince of Lordaeron has become Lordaeron's Dutiful Son, sigh…”</p>
<p>“What the heck, Lordaeron's Dutiful Son!”</p>
<p>“Uther feels just like the classmates who used to tattle on others in school.”</p>
<p>“+1! It's like Uther is telling Arthas, 'You can't do this, or I'll tell the teacher!'”</p>
<p>“I wonder what fate awaits Arthas later, and what exactly is the origin of this Frostmourne!”</p>
<p>As players discussed, the popularity of <em>Warcraft</em> soared.</p>
<p>Even though it was only a trial version, it offered them more than enough.</p>
<p>In terms of graphics, gameplay, and content, <em>Warcraft</em> clearly delivered too many surprises to players.</p>
<p>Regarding the plot, although it was only a trial version.</p>
<p>It was evident that <em>Warcraft</em> possessed a world with a vast worldview, and the current stories only revealed the tip of the iceberg of the game's overall content.</p>
<p>In particular, the first chapter of the trial version, 'The Fall of Lordaeron,' fully showcased its high standard.</p>
<p>As for gameplay content, although it was only Campaign Mode, the basic gameplay elements were already fully demonstrated.</p>
<p>The innovation in unit types and hero settings within the game made it entirely appropriate to say it redefined RTS.</p>
<p>For most RTS players, <em>Warcraft</em> delivered nothing short of a shock.</p>
<p>First and foremost was the innovation in game mechanics, offering a more complete RTS control system.</p>
<p>For instance, features like Patrol, Unit Grouping, attack, and pause within the game were all executed flawlessly in <em>Warcraft</em>.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the completely new concept of heroes immediately captivated countless RTS players.</p>
<p>While the performance of multiplayer mode was yet unknown, based on the current content, as long as the balance was decent, it would undoubtedly be an excellent game.</p>
<p>Not to mention the deeply meaningful epic story and the perfectly crafted quests.</p>
<p>Even as just a trial version, it already contained an abundance of content.</p>
<p>Each of the four races had their own storyline: the Orcs' story was introduced through Thrall, the Humans' through Arthas, and the Night Elves' and Undead's stories were yet to be fully experienced by most players, thus remaining largely unknown for now.</p>
<p>Moreover, these campaign stories were not isolated but tightly interwoven.</p>
<p>For example, Thrall leading Orc warriors to rescue Hellscream demonstrated the Orcs' hostile stance towards Humans.</p>
<p>Later, the discussions among the ministers in the Royal Capital of Lordaeron also indicated their full-scale war against the Orcs.</p>
<p>The so-called plague, in turn, was linked to the Undead.</p>
<p>Arthas's fall, too, seemed inextricably linked to the Undead Scourge.</p>
<p>The plot attracted some players who were not typically interested in RTS games.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the unique, novel, and seemingly flawless RTS element designs also drew in many RTS players.</p>
<p>For countless players, the true point of concern was how <em>Warcraft</em> would perform upon its official launch on November 15th.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>At Hero Entertainment, Zhou Qi stared at the <em>Warcraft</em> game screen on his computer, completely bewildered.</p>
<p>He had considered many scenarios before this.</p>
<p>But this situation, he genuinely hadn't anticipated.</p>
<p>What he thought were mere boasts turned out to be entirely true!</p>
<p>The hero settings and related RTS elements in <em>Warcraft</em> all impressed Zhou Qi greatly, at least from a gameplay perspective.</p>
<p>If the data balance could be properly tuned, this would definitely be a top-tier RTS masterpiece.</p>
<p>Furthermore, its inherent quality completely surpassed Zhou Qi's expectations.</p>
<p>The previously mentioned 700 million Yuan development cost, he had dismissed as Nebula Games simply boasting.</p>
<p>But after actually playing the game, he knew he was wrong.</p>
<p>This wasn't boasting; Nebula Games truly was an honest company!</p>
<p>What's the point of creating such exquisite models for an RTS game?</p>
<p>And are these CGI sequences free of charge?</p>
<p>Did you really report a 700 million Yuan development cost just because it was 700 million Yuan?</p>
<p>Having played the trial version of <em>Warcraft</em>, Zhou Qi felt a little numb all over.</p>
<p>In terms of single-player plot, let alone <em>Human Wars</em>, no RTS game, domestically or internationally, could compete with Nebula Games' <em>Warcraft</em>.</p>
<p>Even some RPGs might not be able to contend.</p>
<p>The game's captivating plot went without saying, but the crucial point was how much Nebula Games was willing to invest.</p>
<p>So many CGI sequences, on one hand, introduced players to the background story.</p>
<p>On the other hand, they served as invisible rewards for players completing levels.</p>
<p>Which typical RTS game developer would dare to do this?</p>
<p>He had heard from the industry before that Chen Xu seemed to draw comics before making games.</p>
<p>Now, he probably saw his game development taking off and simply used games to make animations.</p>
<p>Zhou Qi grumbled inwardly.</p>
<p>“We've lost half the battle, but not entirely. As long as the balance values for <em>Warcraft</em>'s multiplayer battles aren't well-tuned, there's still a chance,” Zhou Qi took a deep breath, beginning his self-hypnosis.</p>
<p>After all, this was Chen Xu's first time making an RTS game; he might not necessarily be able to manage the balance well.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while the introduction of heroes seemed to add diverse gameplay, it also posed a risk to balance.</p>
<p>It could be a sharp blade for expanding territory, but this blade could sometimes wound itself!</p>
