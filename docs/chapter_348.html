                <p>Chapter 350 I have acrophobia, you jump (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>“Old Song, are you ready? We're just waiting for you!”</p>
<p>Zhang Yi woke up early in the morning and immediately got into his VR gaming pod. He even played two quick matches to warm up.</p>
<p>Although he personally didn't feel anything particularly special about this new mode, he still had high expectations due to his trust in Nebula Games.</p>
<p>This was because such situations often occurred before: a Nebula Games title might not seem like much at first glance, but it would turn out to be incredibly fun once played.</p>
<p>Especially this time, it was Cosmic VR's latest game. At least in terms of graphics and immersive experience, Zhang Yi felt that no other game could currently compete with <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>.</p>
<p>“Yeah, Old Song, we're just waiting for you! You're so slow!” Wang Han, already poised in her gaming pod, also chimed in.</p>
<p>To be honest, her interest in this FPS game was only moderate. She had completed the previous story mode, but she had only played the multiplayer mode for about ten hours so far. It was mainly a fun way to vent when she was bored.</p>
<p>“You two, don't rush. I'm logging in now, aren't I? Pull me in!” Old Song's voice came through the voice chat.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi sent a friend invitation.</p>
<p>“Holy cow, how did you all buy skins!?” Entering the game's preparation interface, Song Ren was stunned by Zhang Yi and Wang Han's characters.</p>
<p>He was using a generic default character, while Zhang Yi and Wang Han were Captain Price and Soap, respectively.</p>
<p>“It comes free with the base game; you can just click on the character to use it,” Zhang Yi explained.</p>
<p>Compared to the Warzone of his previous life, Chen Xu had made some changes. For example, players no longer needed to unlock game attachments one by one.</p>
<p>At the same time, Chen Xu had not yet added Plunder mode, which many players used to farm attachments. Only the Warzone (Battle Royale) mode was available.</p>
<p>However, even players who hadn't purchased the base game could still play Warzone mode. But for those who did buy the base game, there were some benefits.</p>
<p>For instance, in character selection, players who purchased any version could choose one character from Ghost, Captain Price, and Soap. If they bought the trilogy, they naturally got all of them.</p>
<p>“Perfect! Task Force 141, ready to deploy!” Song Ren exclaimed enthusiastically in the voice channel after switching to a Ghost character.</p>
<p>“Why are you holding a pink gun!?” Zhang Yi was speechless, looking at the pink M4 in Ghost's hands. Ghost's cool demeanor was completely ruined, wasn't it?</p>
<p>“Stop talking nonsense, let's start quickly! Haven't you heard the saying, 'The pinker the color, the harder the hit'?” Song Ren retorted.</p>
<p>Everyone was ready, and a match was found almost instantly.</p>
<p>However, a prompt window appeared in front of Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>[Automatically select parachuting location?]</p>
<p>Before he could understand what it meant, Zhang Yi instinctively chose “No.”</p>
<p>The game loaded, but the next scene almost made Zhang Yi's legs go weak with fear. Song Ren and Wang Han also let out screams in the voice channel.</p>
<p>On the game screen, his character jumped directly out of the plane cabin. The wind howled in his ears. Zhang Yi, who already had a slight fear of heights in the ultra-immersive VR mode, felt his legs go a bit soft at this sight.</p>
<p>“Damn it! Mr. Chen is really going to cure my acrophobia!” Zhang Yi immediately opened his parachute in mid-air and tilted his view upwards.</p>
<p>At this point, he finally understood what that previous option meant.</p>
<p>The previous option was mainly designed by Chen Xu for players with acrophobia. Although it was just a game, in the ultra-immersive VR experience, the feeling of acrophobia was enough to scare players.</p>
<p>Especially those with severe acrophobia, who felt a little scared even standing on a chair, would definitely be terrified by such a scene.</p>
<p>Choosing “automatically select parachuting location” allowed the in-game AI to control the jump. The accuracy was perfect, jumping exactly where indicated.</p>
<p>For speed, Chen Xu had already had the AI conduct thorough internal tests. It adopted a middle ground, slightly slower than the extreme parachuting speed.</p>
<p>However, if automatic parachuting was chosen, the only drawback was that there was no way to change course midway. If it said to jump here, you had to jump, unless the player manually canceled the automatic jump and exited the map overlay to switch from automatic to manual control.</p>
<p>The game match had already gathered 150 players, but there was still a 60-second waiting period before it started. Everyone landed at a central point on the map, starting with a fully equipped red weapon.</p>
<p>Then came the sound of gunfire, clearly a warm-up phase for players before the match.</p>
<p>Instead of firing wildly like other players, Zhang Yi controlled his character to float into a corner and then opened the map.</p>
<p>“Holy cow! This map is too big!” Zhang Yi was stunned looking at the map.</p>
<p>The game map was divided into 100 small squares, and each square appeared very large on the mini-map. Although about thirty to forty of these hundred squares were snow-capped mountains and sea, places he didn't know if he could go, the cities with resources and vehicle spawn points alone made the map huge.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Yi also noticed a detail.</p>
<p>A huge white circle encompassed about 55 squares, which was clearly the first safe zone. As time passed, gas would emanate from the map's edges, compressing the players' active area.</p>
<p>Additionally, Zhang Yi noticed a prompt on the left side of the map: Gulag Prison Deathmatch had a time limit of 20 minutes, and the countdown had already started from the current waiting phase.</p>
<p>Clearly, after this time, dying in the game would no longer allow for a fistfight revival.</p>
<p>“Where should we jump? This map is too big,” Song Ren asked the group.</p>
<p>“I don't know, I'm just following,” Wang Han said, acting like a slacker and choosing to follow Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>“I have acrophobia, Old Song, you jump,” Zhang Yi also found an excuse.</p>
<p>Song Ren, who had gained commander privileges, looked at the large number of locations on the map and felt a bit indecisive. He truly had a bit of decision paralysis!</p>
<p>“How about we jump to West Bay Avenue? It's in the bottom left corner of the map, and it's outside the safe zone, so there probably won't be many people. We can also figure out how to play this game,” Song Ren suggested, still wanting to hear Zhang Yi and Wang Han's opinions so he could pass the blame if problems arose.</p>
<p>“Following!” Wang Han replied.</p>
<p>“Same here!” Zhang Yi's answer was concise and clear.</p>
<p>“You two...” Song Ren was speechless.</p>
