                <p>Chapter 295: Dust Settles (7th update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)</p>
<p>Chen Xu's live stream, and a commentator's live stream on Shark TV, were both incredibly lively.</p>
<p>Before this, no one had anticipated such a situation. Moreover, despite being at a population disadvantage, it proved to be even more dominant than having a larger population.</p>
<p>After all, generally speaking, in RTS games, more population usually translates to greater strength. Who could have imagined that with a population disadvantage, Chen Xu would execute a "Gust Rush strategy"?</p>
<p>"Brother Sun!" Huang Donglai said, looking at Sun Yixie in the official commentary booth.</p>
<p>"Brother Huang, we're in trouble!" Sun Yixie touched the hair on his head. Why did he have to run his mouth again? At that moment, his mind recalled a game that once made it difficult for him to breathe.</p>
<p>In the RTS group chat, a group of pro gamers and high-level master players felt a new door had opened.</p>
<p>"Night Elves can actually be played like this? Truly an eye-opener, absolutely no room to fight back!"</p>
<p>"Hindsight comment, the main reason is that Guadi didn't know this strategy. Not to mention starting with a Far Seer, at least for the second hero, he would have chosen a Tauren, and would have upgraded the Tauren Totem early, instead of waiting for the opponent's Raptor Druids to form, with only two Spirit Walkers."</p>
<p>"Also, map items are very important. Unaware of the strength of this strategy, Guadi didn't buy invulnerability potions. Otherwise, with a fully equipped Blademaster who consumed an invulnerability potion, he could have at least cut down two units before being blown away."</p>
<p>"But speaking of it, Mr. Chen played four matches tonight, showcasing the characteristics of each race. Damn it, he didn't showcase the Orcs!"</p>
<p>"Now that you mention it, I remember! Why are only our Orcs suffering?"</p>
<p>Whether it was players or some RTS masters, they were engaged in a fierce discussion. Especially game designers who had been following the 'Warcraft' balance crisis, they were now silent. In the office of Hero Entertainment, Zhou Qi's face was ashen.</p>
<p>How could you compete with Chen Xu? When their games had balance issues, they cautiously made small numerical adjustments, fearing player backlash. But you, Chen Xu, on the other hand, had balance issues, and you said to the players, 'You all say Orcs are strong, right? Then I'll play a live stream to prove it. And I didn't just prove it, I even crushed the Orc pro gamer! Now you tell me, is it your skill and game understanding that's problematic, or is his game's balance problematic?'</p>
<p>In fact, this is also a form of sophistry. Because players' understanding will inevitably conflict with the game's initial settings, leading to what appears to be a balance crisis. In this situation, generally, designers only have two choices: The first is to directly nerf hero numerical values, or even rework skills, based on the players' current understanding. Then, when the player community's understanding deepens, they bring them back again, creating a feeling of constant flip-flopping for players. But in reality, this is feedback given by designers based on the general understanding of the player base. The second option is simply to nerf them. For example, if players feel a certain race is too strong, they directly nerf it, or simply buff the other three weaker races. But this situation is likely to lead to heroes originally thought to be very strong becoming completely useless as players delve deeper into the game. But now? Chen Xu directly used his performance to tell players that he actually understands the game 'Warcraft'. Naturally, this also made players trust him. At least if your skill hasn't reached Chen Xu's level, how can you have the nerve to complain that 'Warcraft's' balance is trash? And this is precisely something other designers can't learn.</p>
<p>After the game ended, looking at the screen full of bullet comments strongly demanding he play two more rounds, Chen Xu stretched and loosened his muscles and bones, then responded: "Playing two more rounds, let's just forget it. That's enough for today. I'm not a professional streamer or pro player. Additionally, 'Warcraft' will receive a rather special update later. It should be of interest to most players. Alright, that's all for today." Chen Xu said.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, countless players were stunned for a moment. Not a professional streamer or pro player? But you damn well crushed a pro player! However, after expressing their speechlessness, many players then focused on another point in Chen Xu's words: A new version of 'Warcraft'!? But what the heck is a "special update"? Could it be a new race? The Naga race from previous campaigns? Or the campaign storyline of 'Warcraft'? Many players eagerly sent bullet comments, preparing to ask questions.</p>
<p>However, the next second, something bewildering happened to countless people. The live stream screen went black. A line of large characters appeared in the center. 'The streamer you are following has ended their broadcast!' Countless players had question marks all over their faces. Damn it, 'Monster Hunter: World' had a cliffhanger in its demo version, before, 'Warcraft's' trial version also had cliffhangers, now he shows up to demonstrate balance to them, and then at the end, he makes a cliffhanger and leaves them in suspense? Is there any humanity left!?</p>
<p>The next day, Chen Xu's 'Warcraft' live stream also became the hot topic of the day. Obviously, this was a huge hot topic. Of course, it was accompanied by bald photos of the two well-known professional commentators. Many players who hadn't known about this matter were also shocked to see the news released by gaming media. At the same time, across the entire 'Warcraft' ladder, countless players simultaneously chose the Night Elf, Undead, and Human races. There was no other way, since Chen Xu only played these three races during his live stream.</p>
<p>Just like most people who watch exciting video highlights get an "itchy hand," feeling like they want to start the game and play around, all players who watched Chen Xu's live stream were the same. And after choosing their races, the scripts (strategies) these players followed were also consistent: Night Elves starting with Beastmaster, Undead barracks producing Crypt Fiends, and Humans rushing into opponents' bases with a group of peasants.</p>
<p>However, when these tactics landed in the hands of ordinary players, they formed a very strange scene. Night Elf players started with Beastmaster to harass opponents' bases, resulting in the death of summoned units and heroes. Using Ancient of War to level up at large neutral camps, they failed to manage aggro and health properly, and with insufficient Huntresses, the Ancient of War was directly destroyed by A-move command. The neutral hero Firelord was chosen, bringing a group of peasants to build Guard Towers in opponents' bases, but one collapsed after another as soon as they were built, and not a single peasant they brought survived.</p>
<p>However, for many RTS experts, Chen Xu's strategies also greatly benefited them. They began to study more seriously previously overlooked units and unit types. They also completely understood this time that the game 'Warcraft' truly cannot be understood using conventional RTS game experience, because even the same tactic, depending on the different spawn points on the map, will have different effects. Moreover, Chen Xu's strategies also aren't effective just by blindly copying them. Using the "Gust Rush strategy" on small maps against Orcs is very effective because it's convenient for harassment and scouting, and it specifically counters the Orcs' Wolf Riders. But on large maps and open maps, the Orcs' Wolf Rider tactics can achieve a complete reversal. Utilizing the Wolf Rider's mobility, constantly harassing and tying up forces, the most powerful push of the Gust Rush strategy in the mid-game with 50 population simply cannot be executed, and they can only end in bitter defeat. The Multi-Expansion strategy and Fire Demon Tower tactics are also the same; all have advantages and disadvantages, requiring a discerning choice. And this is precisely the charm of 'Warcraft.'</p>
<p>During this period, no one was saying which race was too weak or too strong, because all players understood that different races each have their own characteristics. Chen Xu had already demonstrated with his actions: there are no invincible races, only the strongest players who use appropriate tactics for different situations.</p>
<p>However, while not many people were discussing 'Warcraft's' balance anymore, another matter became a point of discussion for many players: the new version update mentioned by Chen Xu in yesterday's live stream.</p>
<p>Those who are still playing WAR3 now are simply too strong. Fire Demon Tower, Gust Rush, Ice Armor Crypt Fiends, and Multi-Expansion strategy – I specifically tried them out on the Warcraft platform. Among them, for Fire Demon Tower, I was the victim's perspective. As for the other three, I was severely beaten before they even fully formed... [Of course, it's also because these tactics are too old and don't suit the current version (it's definitely not because I'm too bad!)]</p>
