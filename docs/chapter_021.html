                <h1>Chapter 21: Rave Reviews</h1>
<p>The next day, Chen Xu arrived at the company at 7:30 AM, but to his surprise, Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue had already arrived ahead of him.</p>
<p>Seeing Chen Xu push the door open and enter, the two rushed excitedly towards him.</p>
<p>"It's blown up! It's blown up! Mr. Chen, the reputation has exploded!" Yang Xin exclaimed, holding a laptop in her hands, her face full of excitement.</p>
<p>On the screen, the rating from the official app store was displayed.</p>
<p>9.9 points, an incredibly high score.</p>
<p>And not only that, but two media outlets had already published their game reviews for <em>Undertale</em> on its second day of launch.</p>
<p>The most shocking part was that both media outlets had given it a perfect score of 10!</p>
<p>Even a review website named Game Timespace lauded it to the skies.</p>
<p>In their review, they avoided spoilers, instead building suspense throughout with a Riddler-like approach.</p>
<p>Yet, the review article cited many exaggerated descriptions.</p>
<p>For example, after completing <em>Undertale</em>, the editor remained silent for a long time.</p>
<p>It was a game that broke the constraints of traditional RPGs.</p>
<p>It subverted players' understanding of RPG games, showing that a game could be so profound.</p>
<p>Despite being a small-budget independent game, it offered a more breathtaking experience than AAA masterpieces.</p>
<p>Similar reviews also appeared in the comment section for <em>Undertale</em>.</p>
<p>It was filled with many bewildering comments.</p>
<p>For example, 'An incredible RPG, my spine was still tingling when it ended!' 'Crush your mercy, and mine too!' 'It fills you with determination!'</p>
<p>"Sales are pretty good, but we'll let it ferment for a bit," Chen Xu said, taking the laptop and checking the backend sales data, a smile gracing his face.</p>
<p>2,749 copies, not a particularly high figure.</p>
<p>This was normal; despite the previous hype with Zhong Mei, it had only really made more players aware of the name <em>Undertale</em>.</p>
<p>To many players, Nebula Games and Chen Xu were very unfamiliar.</p>
<p>Their only notable release was a gentleman's game.</p>
<p>Chen Xu had priced <em>Undertale</em> at 36 Yuan, just like in his previous life.</p>
<p>As an indie game, it wasn't expensive, and the Parallel World's socio-economic conditions were much better than his previous life's, otherwise, the gaming industry wouldn't be so prosperous.</p>
<p>From 7 PM to 11 PM, this was considered a golden time slot.</p>
<p>The Game Timespace review itself had already allowed the game's popularity to ferment, and this period was also when players were free, perfect for experiencing the game.</p>
<p>Before 7 PM, <em>Undertale</em>'s sales growth was roughly around 500 copies per hour.</p>
<p>But after 7 PM, this number more than doubled, reaching approximately 1200.</p>
<p>At the same time, the total sales successfully surpassed 14,000 copies.</p>
<p>And game reviews also gradually began to increase.</p>
<p>It was worth noting that only a day and a half had passed since <em>Undertale</em> officially launched on the game platform.</p>
<p>In the hotpot restaurant private room where they had previously dined at MixC, Yang Xin, celebrating that evening, grew even more excited as she listened to the figures Chen Xu announced.</p>
<p>Although <em>Mirror (Game)</em> had achieved astonishing sales, she hadn't been involved in its production at the time, merely watching from the sidelines.</p>
<p>However, she had participated in the entire production of <em>Undertale</em>.</p>
<p>Even though the process felt like "so easy even a dog could win," she had, in any case, handled most of the story content within the game.</p>
<p>This gave her a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>"I wonder what the final sales will be!" Ruan Ningxue took a sip of juice, equally excited.</p>
<p>"I feel like it might break a million!" Yang Xin said excitedly.</p>
<p>"Judging by the current trend of reviews, a million is only a matter of time," Chen Xu said, smiling and nodding in affirmation.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Unlike Chen Xu, who was confident, players who had been following <em>Undertale</em>, as well as some designers in the industry, went crazy seeing the game's reviews.</p>
<p>What was going on?</p>
<p>Within the Hapai Culture &amp; Sports media, Zhong Mei's eyes were wide, with no intention of leaving work.</p>
<p>Had Nebula Games bribed them? How much money did they have to pay?</p>
<p>Buying positive reviews, buying media praise, he had done such things before, but <em>Undertale</em> was going too far, wasn't it?!</p>
<p>This was his first thought, and also the first thought of everyone else who saw <em>Undertale</em>'s achievements.</p>
<p>No one believed that <em>Undertale</em>'s true quality warranted such reviews.</p>
<p>After all, it was just a small-budget independent game.</p>
<p>And a score like that could unequivocally be called a standard masterpiece.</p>
<p>Did a small-budget game like <em>Undertale</em> truly deserve it?</p>
<p>However, this also piqued the curiosity of many players: exactly what kind of game was <em>Undertale</em>?</p>
<p>And once these players became curious, they would in turn become part of the countless positive reviews, further fueling the fire.</p>
<p>The most direct manifestation of this was the game data Chen Xu had been constantly monitoring.</p>
<p>Every hour, upon refreshing, there would be a significant increase.</p>
<p>Of course, even more crucial were the game's reviews.</p>
<p>They were almost uniformly positive; the game's overall score remained at 9.9 and hadn't dropped despite the increase in sales.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that a game's rating generally tends to decrease as more and more players get involved.</p>
<p>Typically, reaching 8.5 points is considered the baseline for excellence.</p>
<p>Reaching 9 points is already a premium game, and 9.5 points or above can be called a masterpiece.</p>
<p>But even with <em>Undertale</em>'s skyrocketing sales, the player rating remained remarkably stable.</p>
<p>While it was certain that this score would eventually decline as more players joined in, it was still quite astonishing.</p>
<p>And below the store, player reviews further expressed their opinions on the game.</p>
<p>"I thought it was just a regular RPG monster-slaying game, but I have to say, Flowey's appearance and the ending really shocked me!"</p>
<p>"Initially, I was curious about Nebula Games and Chen Xu because of <em>Mirror (Game)</em>, but I have to say <em>Undertale</em> showed me what a game truly is! Seriously, it subverted my perception of RPGs!"</p>
<p>"I can only describe it as incredible!"</p>
<p>"Do NOT hurt the monsters in the game, or you'll regret it! Trust me!"</p>
<p>"The wind howls, and before you stands a true hero!"</p>
<p>"It's a phenomenal feeling! I have a premonition that <em>Undertale</em> will definitely become a massive hit!"</p>
<p>"Birds are singing, flowers are blooming... on days like these, kids like you... should be burning in hell."</p>
<p>"It fills you with determination!"</p>
<p>"Incredibly novel and astonishing game design!"</p>
<p>Countless players gave <em>Undertale</em> extremely high praise, though naturally, some negative reviews were mixed in.</p>
<p>They lowered the score by 0.1, but compared to the flood of positive reviews, these negative comments were merely a drop in the ocean.</p>
