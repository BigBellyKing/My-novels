<p>Chapter 361: Who Can Resist the Joy of Farming and Raising Pigs? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>[All environment theme content is actual in-game footage]</p>
<p>Looking at the prompt that appeared before him, Zhang Yi was stunned for a long time, then after careful thought, he finally understood what it meant.</p>
<p>“Damn it! Does this mean this theme is actually part of the game content?” Zhang Yi voiced his guess to Song Ren in the voice channel.</p>
<p>“If we haven't misunderstood, that should be it,” Song Ren replied in the voice channel, his tone a bit bewildered.</p>
<p>“But the visual presentation is awesome! It's completely on par with the previous <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>.” Zhang Yi exclaimed, looking at the environment in the theme.</p>
<p>In the distance was a small town, where he could see many horses and penned sheep, though they were a bit far and blurry.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi wanted to get closer to take a look, but was quickly blocked by an invisible wall.</p>
<p>Running around, touching the invisible wall, Zhang Yi roughly understood his range of activity.</p>
<p>As for the distant area, it was likely a town where players would be active in the official game.</p>
<p>But for now, he obviously couldn't go there, as it was just a thematic environment.</p>
<p>The area wasn't as large as he imagined, roughly one and a half basketball courts in size.</p>
<p>Unlike the lush green grass outside, the area he was in had many weeds, and as for houses...</p>
<p>He glanced in the direction of the town; although it was very blurry, he could vaguely make out what the residents' farmhouses in that town looked like.</p>
<p>And on his side?</p>
<p>A few small wooden huts built from wood; if he hadn't seen a bed inside, he would have genuinely thought they were public toilets on the street.</p>
<p>Moreover, in this Western era, public toilets probably didn't exist in mountain villages and the wilderness; everyone just took care of business wherever they were.</p>
<p>“Damn it, this thematic environment is actually a farming game!”</p>
<p>As Zhang Yi observed his surroundings, Song Ren's voice rang out in the voice channel.</p>
<p>“What do you mean, Old Song?” Zhang Yi wondered.</p>
<p>“Go into that small broken hut; there's a small notebook on the bed. Pick it up and you'll know,” Song Ren said.</p>
<p>Following Song Ren's instructions, Zhang Yi walked into the small broken hut and immediately saw the small notebook Song Ren had mentioned on the bed.</p>
<p>After opening the notebook, the UI was displayed on it.</p>
<p>It described some basic operations and similar content, but what surprised Zhang Yi was this.</p>
<p>This thematic environment actually had a small built-in gameplay element, just like the theme's name 'Farm Life': tending to one's own farm.</p>
<p>And there was also a starting fund of $500.</p>
<p>Of course, in the real Western era, $500 was clearly a huge sum, but this was a game, so Zhang Yi didn't think much of it.</p>
<p>What he was more concerned about was what kind of gameplay this thematic scene could offer.</p>
<p>“I can decorate my house, buy corresponding decorations, manage farm crops and livestock, and even expand the farm?” Seeing some of the introductions in the manual, Zhang Yi couldn't help but become interested.</p>
<p>In fact, this 'Farm Life' theme was something not present in the previous life's <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, and its content was mainly to prepare for the subsequent online mode.</p>
<p>Compared to <em>The Three Musketeers</em>, the multiplayer gameplay of <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> in his previous life actually didn't have many distinctive features.</p>
<p>After reaching max level in a profession, there was basically only the joy of online disputes.</p>
<p>At the same time, compared to flying planes and driving sports cars, most of the time in <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> online was spent on horseback.</p>
<p>Moreover, the spending points weren't as rich as in <em>The Three Musketeers</em>, with large villas, sports cars, planes, and various industries. It could be said that it perfectly created a cycle for players: lacking money, then forming groups to rob.</p>
<p>But in <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> online, there wasn't much to pursue.</p>
<p>So, in this area, Chen Xu was also preparing to add some content for players to enjoy in multiplayer.</p>
<p>For example, a Manor System.</p>
<p>In the offline story, Dutch's talk of going to Tahiti to grow mangoes never came true?</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>In online mode, you can raise pigs in Valentine, grow crops in Rhodes, and open taverns and casinos in Saint Denis.</p>
<p>Who can resist the joy of farming?</p>
<p>Of course, this was a subsequent plan; currently, in the VR environment theme, it was more about testing player feedback.</p>
<p>At the same time, this theme could also be updated continuously in the future, adding new gameplay.</p>
<p>And perhaps in the future, there might be a chance to turn it into the Oasis from a movie in his previous life?</p>
<p>Of course, with current technology, it definitely couldn't be achieved, but who knows what the future holds?</p>
<p>A Nebula Games universe, where each game world is an independent space, and players will eventually have their own independent space.</p>
<p>Special rewards obtained from playing different games could be brought back to one's own space for decoration.</p>
<p>Of course, this was an ambition; the environmental theme of <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> could only be considered preliminary preparation for this.</p>
<p>...............</p>
<p>These deep core concepts were clearly unknown to anyone except Chen Xu.</p>
<p>But at least many players were currently farming in this <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> environmental theme.</p>
<p>In fact, the farm in this environmental theme was not yet complete.</p>
<p>Compared to some management simulation games of this type, it still had some shortcomings.</p>
<p>But it also had its unique advantages.</p>
<p>First, the visual presentation was definitely top-tier, providing players with a very immersive experience.</p>
<p>In the real world, few people would be willing to farm; after all, it's so tiring.</p>
<p>But in games, it's different; many people are very interested in farming gameplay, as this stuff is, after all, ingrained in our genes.</p>
<p>Secondly, this thing was just an environmental theme.</p>
<p>Just as players enjoy discussing life philosophy in adult games, but also like to look at female characters' underpants in normal games.</p>
<p>Similarly, experiencing farm management gameplay within a VR environmental theme also surprised many players.</p>
<p>“Planting vegetables here, raising pigs here, and there's a small plot of land perfect for building a Chicken Farm. I can't quite afford cattle, horses, and sheep right now!”</p>
<p>Clearing the weeds from the farm, Zhang Yi enthusiastically studied the available space for construction.</p>
<p>“But why isn't there a friend function?”</p>
<p>“That way, I could breed my pigs with Old Song's pigs.”</p>
<p>Having planned his farm, Zhang Yi felt a bit regretful.</p>
<p>At this point, he had completely forgotten that this was actually an environmental theme for a Western game.</p>
<p>And besides, isn't it normal for cowboys to raise pigs and farm? It's their job!</p>
<p>With the launch of the 'Farm Life' environmental theme, many players discussed it with great interest.</p>
<p>Although it was just a temporary novelty, the playable content currently mainly involved managing the farm and then expanding its scale.</p>
<p>Moreover, many players also found that this thing didn't require constant grinding.</p>
<p>Just logging in every other day to deal with weeds and manure was enough; it could totally be treated as a simple Harvest Game.</p>
<p>However, seeing the small to know the big, this was, after all, an extended game theme of <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, not just a simple environmental theme.</p>
<p>From this 'Farm Life' theme, some players and gaming industry designers were also speculating about content related to <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>.</p>
