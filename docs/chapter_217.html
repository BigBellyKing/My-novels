                <p>Chapter 317: Nebula Games is Losing Big Time This Round! (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>"These points are a lot harder to earn compared to before!" Leaning back on the sofa in the experience store, Chen Xu couldn't help but sigh as he looked at the system interface in front of him.</p>
<p>After the system upgrade, the difficulty of acquiring points had significantly increased. The prosperous days after developing <code>Minecraft</code> felt like they only lasted a fleeting moment.</p>
<p>However, the item skill books obtained from gacha pulls now contained even better things.</p>
<p>Embracing the idea of a fresh start for the New Year, Chen Xu also spent all his accumulated points on gacha pulls.</p>
<p>As for the keys obtained before the system upgrade, Chen Xu decided to save them for now.</p>
<p>After all, the items in the store were genuinely a bit too expensive.</p>
<p>[Professional Knowledge: Modern Warfare (Intermediate)]</p>
<p>[Professional Knowledge: Director's Camera (Intermediate)]</p>
<p>[Art Knowledge: Battlefield Atmosphere Creation (Elementary)]</p>
<p>......</p>
<p>A whole bunch of miscellaneous items.</p>
<p>"What is this implying?" Chen Xu smacked his lips, looking at the skill books he acquired, all of which were instantly consumed.</p>
<p>Currently, the commercial success of <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code> had made NetDragon extremely excited and thrilled.</p>
<p>However, from Chen Xu's perspective, it could only be described as commendable.</p>
<p>Because <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code> was clearly a game with more hype than actual players.</p>
<p>Simply put, it was like <code>Dark Souls</code>; many players had heard of it.</p>
<p>But there weren't that many players who actually played it.</p>
<p>Just like <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code> in his previous life, for example: "Today, I, Fuze, am going to save the hostage! With walls of iron, the nursery is my tomb, I'll live and die with the mansion!"</p>
<p>The spread of these memes made many players aware that a game called <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code> existed.</p>
<p>However, very few of the players who were attracted to the game by these memes actually stayed.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it was because <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code>, as a tactical game, still had too high a barrier to entry.</p>
<p>Of course, compared to previous single-player series that were so obsessed with tactical strategy they became brain-burning, Siege could only be described as having just graduated from elementary school.</p>
<p>But for most ordinary players, it was still too hardcore.</p>
<p>Whether a game can become mainstream ultimately depends on its ease of access.</p>
<p>For example, with <code>Warcraft</code>, although its RTS gameplay deterred many.</p>
<p>Its rich single-player story and interesting RPG map gameplay were entirely sufficient to support it becoming a mainstream game.</p>
<p>For the company's next year plan, Chen Xu intended to focus on VR.</p>
<p>After all, on the PC platform, Nebula Games was pretty much stable, but on the VR platform, so far only <code>Minecraft</code> had significant influence, and even that game was a bit special.</p>
<p>As for <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code>, it was a product of the collaboration between Nebula Games and NetDragon.</p>
<p>For Chen Xu, the next game would be Nebula Games' stepping stone into the VR sector.</p>
<p>Moreover, for the team, after the development of <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code>, they had actually accumulated a certain amount of technical expertise.</p>
<p>If it came down to it, he could always talk to NetDragon and see if they would lend a development team as a favor, essentially outsourcing the work to Nebula Games.</p>
<p>While Chen Xu was pondering, Zhang Yida also reported the New Year's related event content to Chen Xu.</p>
<p>After confirming there were no issues, it was directly finalized.</p>
<p>Soon, these event details were also published online.</p>
<p>This time's Nebula Games Platform event also invigorated many players.</p>
<p>As for online games, there wasn't much to say.</p>
<p>The main focus was still <code>Sanguosha</code>, which continued to operate. Inevitably, some overpowered generals had appeared during its operation, but the operations team followed up on player feedback in real-time, minimizing negative impacts.</p>
<p>At the same time, during the operation, the team had also developed some brand new gameplay modes.</p>
<p>For instance, a PVE version of <code>Sanguosha</code> gameplay, and corresponding Nian Beast events.</p>
<p>There were both positive and negative reviews.</p>
<p>As for the <code>Sanguosha</code> events, they were quite simple.</p>
<p>New Year-themed general skins, and then a permanent skin given to players as a New Year's gift.</p>
<p><code>Rainbow Six Siege</code> was equally straightforward.</p>
<p>A new version update would be rolled out, introducing Ranked Mode, Recruit Mode, and so on. At the same time, the homepage spectator system would be updated, allowing players to watch High-tier Matches.</p>
<p>Then there were some brand new gift packs and such, with a 50% discount on loot boxes!</p>
<p>No flashy and gaudy frills; it was that simple and blunt.</p>
<p>Additionally, both the defending and attacking sides would each gain two brand new Operators.</p>
<p>Games without in-app purchases, such as <code>Dark Souls</code>, <code>It Takes Two</code>, and others, also received some changes for the New Year event.</p>
<p>Among them, <code>Warcraft</code>, which leans towards multiplayer, released two brand new Ranked Competitive Maps: one Two-player Map and one Four-player Map.</p>
<p>Both maps had a special feature: the large monster in the middle of the map transformed into a unique monster: the Nian Beast.</p>
<p>Of course, after the Spring Festival, it would revert to its original form.</p>
<p>In <code>Minecraft</code>, there would be an official New Year's Celebration Video event, adding many New Year-related elements.</p>
<p>Such as dumplings, New Year cakes, qipaos, fireworks, and so on.</p>
<p>Including the full levels of <code>It Takes Two</code>, <code>Overcooked</code>, and <code>Fall Guys</code>, which would also gain some New Year attributes.</p>
<p><code>Monster Hunter: World</code> would also follow suit, introducing a brand new hunting target: the Nian Beast.</p>
<p>And for the first successful hunt, a Decoration (Monster Hunter) of one's choice would definitely drop.</p>
<p>This was meant to be a little comfort for players who had been farming for almost a year but still hadn't gotten many Decorations (Monster Hunter).</p>
<p>As for <code>Dark Souls</code>, a brand new monster, the Nian Beast, would also be added to the punishing difficulty mode.</p>
<p>Of course, to give <code>Dark Souls</code> players an authentic experience, the Nian Beast's strength might be just a <em>little</em> bit high.</p>
<p>But it wasn't a big problem; after all this time, which of the players still playing <code>Dark Souls</code> isn't a battle-hardened masochist?</p>
<p>They might even be more excited.</p>
<p>These contents were only aimed at specific players of each game.</p>
<p>For all players on the Nebula Games Platform, there was also a major event.</p>
<p>That was, 90% of the games on the Nebula Games Platform would participate in a sale.</p>
<p>Of course, <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code>, which had just been released, was not included. On one hand, it had just launched, and on the other hand, NetDragon on the PC platform hadn't ported it yet.</p>
<p>The exact discount for game developers participating in the New Year's Big Sale was determined by the developers themselves.</p>
<p>90% off, or 10% off, it depended on the developer's willingness.</p>
<p>If you found it troublesome or had a bit of decision paralysis, that was fine; you could choose to authorize Nebula Games, and they would formulate the discounts based on backend data and player reputation.</p>
<p>In addition, there was a brand new discounted purchase event.</p>
<p>Matryoshka Coupons.</p>
<p>Every player on the Nebula Games Platform would receive a 10 Yuan and a 30 Yuan coupon, which could be used when purchasing designated games.</p>
<p>The 10 Yuan coupon could be used when purchasing games over 60 Yuan, and the 30 Yuan coupon could be used when purchasing games over 150 Yuan. Both coupons could be stacked.</p>
<p>And after using them for a purchase, another coupon would be immediately returned.</p>
<p>Of course, game developers had already been fully informed about this event, and most expressed their willingness to participate in such a promotional activity.</p>
<p>For no other reason than that by participating in this event, Nebula Games would specifically promote it.</p>
<p>Moreover, with everyone offering discounts, wouldn't not participating mean a massive loss?</p>
<p>At this, countless players instantly felt unable to control themselves.</p>
<p>The Spring Festival hadn't even arrived yet.</p>
<p>Players online had already begun discussing it.</p>
<p>"Oh my god, all these games on sale? But here's the question, why are <code>Outlast</code> and <code>Dark Souls</code> getting the biggest discounts???"</p>
<p>"These coupons aren't a bug, are they? You buy something and get another one?"</p>
<p>"No, it's just a Nebula Games event!"</p>
<p>"Holy moly, they're going to lose a ton of money!!"</p>
<p>"It's not just Nebula Games' titles, but also many third-party game developers' games, including some classic NetDragon titles, that are on sale!?"</p>
<p>"Even though I've played them all, at this price! I can't resist!"</p>
<p>Players, you see, have a very strange psychological trait.</p>
<p>I can buy this game and not play it.</p>
<p>But I can't <em>not</em> have it!</p>
<p>Such high discounts now undoubtedly gave countless players a reason to "add one more to their collection."</p>
<p>And players bought while feeling incredibly emotional.</p>
<p>Nebula Games and these game developers are truly too conscientious!</p>
<p>This wave of sales is going to make them lose a fortune!</p>
