                <p>Chapter 239: System Design Full of Targeted Features (Seeking Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Nebula Games. Ruan Ningxue looked at the various comments from players on the official Weibo account and couldn't help but exclaim, "The players have inadvertently stumbled upon the truth!"</p>
<p>"Isn't that right!" Yang Xin, who was standing nearby, chuckled cheerfully upon hearing this.</p>
<p>Chen Xu, who was standing by Qin Yi's workstation, having just reviewed the optimized AI parameter adjustments, heard this and said earnestly, "Don't spread rumors. Skipping the gameplay Expo was purely so we could better develop <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> and allow players to enter the game world sooner."</p>
<p>No trailer, so no participation in the expo?</p>
<p>Is Chen Xu that kind of person?!</p>
<p>Wouldn't his heart ache saying something like that?</p>
<p>Although, to this day, the promotional video and other outsourced materials hadn't actually been completed by the third-party.</p>
<p>But that wasn't the main core reason. The real reason was that due to the previous work on transforming the Nebula Games Platform, the entire team hadn't started any new projects.</p>
<p>It wasn't until the temporary dust settled on the channel war that they initiated new plans.</p>
<p>But by then, less than a month remained until the gameplay Expo, leaving even less preparation time compared to the previous two years.</p>
<p>With nothing ready, Chen Xu naturally didn't consider attending the gameplay Expo.</p>
<p>But looking at it now, was this acceptable?</p>
<p>Especially online, Nebula Games was being met with endless teasing.</p>
<p>Comments like, "'Don't rush, it's being made, it's being made! When has your Brother Xu ever lied to you?'" or "'It's almost done, it's nearly complete, the folders have already been created.'" Such a variety of remarks.</p>
<p>There were even memes of folders, and his previously amiable smiling face, it was simply outrageous!</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu's words, Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and Qin Yi all silently lowered their heads.</p>
<p>Others might not know, but how could they not?</p>
<p>If, in the previous conference room discussions about <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>'s difficulty curve, they only had a general understanding,</p>
<p>then as the game entered the detailed development phase and various systems were separated, everyone could say they completely grasped the game's overall tone.</p>
<p>Simply put, <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>'s difficulty is a rollercoaster-like experience.</p>
<p>First, it pushes players from the lowest valley directly to the highest peak. After players experience that peak sensation, the difficulty slowly decreases. Just when players think they've got the hang of it, the introduction of the Tempered monster mechanic once again lets players experience that previous feeling.</p>
<p>And it wasn't just the monster design; the various system designs in the game were also full of targeted features.</p>
<p>However, despite being challenging, it was also very distinctive, much like the map traps in <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>For example, a hunter's weapon in the game, after prolonged attacks, will suffer a reduction in Sharpness.</p>
<p>As for "Sharpness," it's certainly not the "taste of the blade"; it can be understood as the weapon's keenness.</p>
<p>The higher a weapon's sharpness, the more damage it deals per attack, and the easier it is to damage a monster's tough body parts.</p>
<p>When sharpness decreases, the weapon's damage output will also decrease accordingly.</p>
<p>When the weapon's sharpness is too low, attacking tough parts of a monster will cause the weapon to bounce.</p>
<p>This will not only further reduce a significant amount of Sharpness but also leave the hunter in a recoiled state.</p>
<p>To recover, players in the game must stop and dutifully use a Whetstone from their inventory to sharpen their weapon.</p>
<p>Moreover, different states are indicated by various color grades, with white being the highest.</p>
<p>For hunters with OCD, if they see their weapon's sharpness drop below white in the game, they'll likely have to pull out a Whetstone and meticulously sharpen their blade.</p>
<p>And if a Dragon Charge comes at that moment, you can only hope your health bar is full.</p>
<p>Additionally, while the game supports multiplayer hunting and lacks a friendly fire system (damage from teammates), it does feature stagger and flinch effects.</p>
<p>After attacking a teammate, they will enter a flinching state, and their ongoing actions and attacks will be interrupted.</p>
<p>At that moment, just pray your teammate can survive against the BOSS.</p>
<p>In ordinary games, teaming up is an effective way to lower game difficulty, but in <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, sometimes what's terrifying isn't the Elder Dragon you're facing, but the three Katana Bro teammates by your side.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there's no way to see a monster's health value in the game.</p>
<p>You can only judge if it's in a dying state by its injuries and behavior.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, players will probably be very 'surprised' when the time comes," Ruan Ningxue remarked with a sigh.</p>
<p>"Absolutely, because isn't the goal of us game designers to bring a surprising experience to players with every game?" Chen Xu said with a cheerful laugh.</p>
<p>Whether it's more 'shock' or more 'delight,' as long as there's <em>something</em>, that's all that matters.</p>
<p>After chatting for a few minutes in the break room, once it was working hours, everyone put away their joking around and dedicated themselves to the development of <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>.</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue's art team gradually worked on concept art design.</p>
<p>Then, through outsourced art companies, they proceeded with model asset creation.</p>
<p>For <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, the graphics and art modeling were clearly a case of 'the more refined, the better.'</p>
<p>Buildings, maps, monsters, weapons, armor, and so on – the amount of resources required was far greater than for <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>Qin Yi, on his end, continued to fine-tune various parameters of the in-game AI system, ensuring that the monsters in the game would exhibit higher intelligence, yet with a very precise control over their difficulty.</p>
<p>After all, all monsters have numerical values. If the difficulty is increased through AI performance, then the monsters must be weakened in terms of their numerical attributes, and vice versa.</p>
<p>At the same time, Chen Xu also enlisted a top-tier symphony orchestra to record the game's soundtrack.</p>
<p>After all, the music in Monster Hunter is classic, especially the series' main theme, "Proof of a Hero," which possesses an extremely powerful and awe-inspiring grandeur, making one's blood boil with excitement.</p>
<p>In every Monster Hunter title, whenever a Dragonator or Ballista appears,</p>
<p>that's right! It means someone has selected "Proof of a Hero" on their playlist!</p>
<p>Because in most cases in the Monster Hunter series, it first appears in the final battle arena when a hunter impales an Elder Dragon with a Dragonator but fails to kill it.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>While Nebula Games slowly advanced the development of <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>.</p>
<p>The gaming community was also discussing Chen Xu's previous explanation on the official Weibo account as to why they hadn't participated in the gameplay Expo.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Nebula Games was developing a new game.</p>
<p>And it sounded like it might even be a major title.</p>
<p>However, nothing had been revealed – let alone gameplay content; not even the genre was disclosed.</p>
<p>However, the vast majority of players believed that Chen Xu's next new game would likely be a Souls-like title, as <em>Dark Souls</em> was the only large-scale game Nebula Games had developed prior to this.</p>
<p>Although the story of Linking the Fire had concluded, couldn't they just tell a new story?</p>
<p>After all, <em>Dark Souls</em>'s gameplay and map design were also crucial aspects of the game.</p>
<p>Of course, some players expressed doubts, as <em>Minecraft</em> and the even earlier <em>Don't Starve</em> had directly ignited a wave of sandbox games. Coupled with the recent period where major channel alliances were also relentlessly greenlighting blockbusters, anyone could see the deeper implications.</p>
<p>Thus, many players suggested that Nebula Games might strike while the iron is hot and continue to release a large-scale sandbox game.</p>
<p>However, some players also voiced opposing views, arguing that <em>Minecraft</em>'s sales volume was simply astonishing, a miracle in the gaming world, and the kind of miracle that broke records daily.</p>
<p>In such a situation, Chen Xu would have no need to develop another sandbox game, as the risk would be too high.</p>
<p>In summary, every player had their preferred direction, until three days after the gameplay Expo concluded.</p>
<p>Nebula Games' official Weibo account and Chen Xu then finally released a piece of pre-release information about the new game.</p>
