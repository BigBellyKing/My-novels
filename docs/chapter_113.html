<p>Chapter 212 The Quintessential Sandbox Game (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games' project room.</p>
<p>Chen Xu was currently engaged in building the game's models.</p>
<p>Regarding promotion, the promotional video had already been released.</p>
<p>However, player feedback varied, as it was truly difficult to guess a game's gameplay from just one video.</p>
<p>Otherwise, there wouldn't be so many deceptive trailers.</p>
<p>Many game promotional videos are made to sound like they're the greatest masterpiece of all time, but once you enter the game, good heavens, even instant noodle commercials don't shrink their real product as much as yours.</p>
<p>Although Chen Xu was scolded by many players as a big swindler, and some players whose scalps went numb from being tortured in <em>Dark Souls</em> even angrily denounced him as an Old Geezer, the instances of him touting himself as the 'Warrior of Love' have become an indispensable Meme for Chen Xu's fans.</p>
<p>But there was one point everyone still agreed on: Chen Xu generally didn't pull any tricks in his promotional trailers.</p>
<p>But this time, <em>Minecraft</em> truly left many players a bit bewildered.</p>
<p>A pixel game, could it really offer anything spectacular?</p>
<p>Chen Xu saw all the players' doubts online and the debates within the gaming industry.</p>
<p>But he didn't explain anything. Once the early access trial began and subsequent promotions followed, players would naturally understand.</p>
<p>Anything said now would be less convincing and less impactful than directly presenting it to players when the time came.</p>
<p>In front of the computer in the project room, Chen Xu's screen switched rapidly. Some repetitive blocks were directly built using construction tools and AI.</p>
<p>Chen Xu, on the other hand, was building more complex scenes. With his current ability, creating architecture in the game was child's play.</p>
<p>Moreover, Chen Xu had already replicated various templates in advance using the Memory Capsule.</p>
<p>Now, it was basically a matter of copying a template.</p>
<p>Soon, buildings began appearing one after another in <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>
<p>“That's incredible, Mr. Chen!”</p>
<p>“It looks so real!”</p>
<p>“Oh my god!”</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen is truly too powerful!”</p>
<p>Qin Yi and Lin Tao, two grown men who had just finished their modeling tasks, stood behind Chen Xu, watching him build various structures in the game with expressions of awe.</p>
<p>Beside them, Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin, who were recreating 3D images provided by Chen Xu in the game, cast a disdainful glance at the two men.</p>
<p>Flatterers!</p>
<p>So far, roughly a third of the architectural complex had been completed.</p>
<p>According to Chen Xu's vision, besides being used for promotion, a 'Nebula Games Museum' would be specially created within the game. The IDs of all employees who participated in its creation would be included for players to visit.</p>
<p>In the later stages, more unique content would be continuously produced.</p>
<p>Furthermore, players would also be able to place these buildings into their own worlds, though only in single-player mode.</p>
<p>“Alright, I'll find something for you two to do, and you can also try something a bit more complex.”</p>
<p>“Go work on Redstone circuits. Lay a track across this entire hilltop.” Chen Xu looked helplessly at the two men behind him.</p>
<p>If you're done building houses and have nothing to do, then go build railways.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p><em>Minecraft</em> was being promoted step by step, while at the same time, TengHua had also begun promoting its game, <em>Voyage</em>.</p>
<p>During this period, <em>Minecraft</em>'s promotion primarily consisted of releasing some simple creature Concept Art and announcing the testing mode.</p>
<p>In the original plan, Chen Xu had decided to conduct small-scale testing.</p>
<p>The desired selection method was for pre-ordering players to sign up, and then a lottery would be held.</p>
<p>But this plan was quickly shot down by Chen Xu.</p>
<p>After all, it would be somewhat unfair to players.</p>
<p>One must know, while everyone is a player, some are those who can get SSRs and golden light with a single pull.</p>
<p>While others are 'Great Chiefs' who spend 100 pulls and only hit the pity timer.</p>
<p>So, in the end, Chen Xu made the decision: players could pre-order and then participate in a five-day early access test.</p>
<p>At the same time, if pre-ordering players felt the game wasn't their cup of tea, they could request a refund within five days.</p>
<p>This attracted quite a few players, as it wouldn't be long before they would discover what <em>Minecraft</em> truly was.</p>
<p>However, what puzzled the gaming industry was that <em>Wasteland</em>, which had previously rivaled <em>Voyage</em>, had suddenly gone silent.</p>
<p>As for the reason, others were unclear, but Chen Xu knew.</p>
<p>Because at this moment, Chen Xu was experiencing <em>Wasteland</em>, developed by Meng Zuo.</p>
<p>The game began with a simple tutorial, essentially explaining that after the world fell into a nuclear war, surface civilization was destroyed, and radiation spurred the mutation of various creatures and plants.</p>
<p>Players took on the role of a member inside a shelter.</p>
<p>However, everyone else in the shelter had died, leaving only the protagonist. Most of the shelter's functions had failed, and remaining there would only lead to certain death.</p>
<p>Thus, players needed to leave the shelter and venture to the surface.</p>
<p>The good news was that, for whatever reason, the post-nuclear war radiation, which caused creatures and animals to mutate, no longer posed a threat to humans by the time the protagonist emerged.</p>
<p>The game's main quest was very simple: to rebuild civilization.</p>
<p>As for gameplay, the combat mode wasn't real-time, but rather resembled the close-quarters turn-based combat of the previous life's X-COM. The game also included an evasion stat. At least during the game, Chen Xu witnessed the famous 'point-blank miss' scene, to which Meng Zuo, sitting next to him, gave an embarrassed laugh.</p>
<p>Solving this was not as simple as imagined. If a 'guaranteed hit at point-blank range' setting were added, then the question would arise: what constitutes point-blank range?</p>
<p>Does it count if there are two body lengths between them?</p>
<p>And deleting evasion, while solving the issue, would affect the entire combat system of the game.</p>
<p>Besides these, the game's main gameplay involved scavenging in the wasteland, collecting resources, and then establishing one's own camp.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game had a rather unique feature: the team.</p>
<p>During gameplay, players would encounter various NPCs in the wasteland, each with their own personality, which manifested as tags in the game.</p>
<p>These NPCs could become doctors, combat personnel, weapon manufacturers, and so on. Essentially, it was the building system found in normal games, presented in a different mode.</p>
<p>Having played through it, Chen Xu wasn't sure if the subsequent content, including Numerical Design and gameplay, would collapse.</p>
<p>But as it stood, the quality could be said to be quite excellent.</p>
<p>However, in Chen Xu's opinion, this game's strategic attributes completely outweighed its sandbox attributes.</p>
<p>Because players needed to make trade-offs regarding taking in NPCs; in this game, NPCs would also consume player resources.</p>
<p>If resources were insufficient, players couldn't support the NPCs, leading to either a mutiny, the NPCs starving or freezing to death, or simply leaving the camp.</p>
<p>At the same time, some NPCs would have negative traits, such as being prone to unrest or betrayal, yet paradoxically, they would be very useful.</p>
<p>In Chen Xu's view, this should be a survival strategy game that heavily tests players' resource allocation and management skills.</p>
<p>As for how it tied into the sandbox genre, it definitely belonged to the type that was highly replayable and could make players 'grind out several livers' (play intensely for a long time).</p>
<p>“How is it, Mr. Chen?” Meng Zuo asked.</p>
<p>“Very interesting.” Chen Xu nodded, giving his affirmation.</p>
<p>“By the way, Mr. Chen, is your new game <em>Minecraft</em> a pixel game?” Meng Zuo probed indirectly.</p>
<p>“Indeed.” Chen Xu nodded.</p>
<p>“Then, Mr. Chen, what do you think are the differences between these two sandbox games, <em>Wasteland</em> and <em>Minecraft</em>?” Meng Zuo unveiled half of the cloth covering something.</p>
<p>“There's absolutely no comparison.” Chen Xu gently shook his head.</p>
<p>Meng Zuo was somewhat taken aback. Chen Xu continued, “Because the two games are completely different types. If you insist on comparing them, it would be like Guan Gong fighting Qin Qiong. Moreover, strictly speaking, <em>Wasteland</em> is not what I consider a sandbox game.”</p>
<p>“Then, Mr. Chen, what do you consider a sandbox game?” Meng Zuo asked.</p>
<p>“What is a sandbox game? Hmm… I believe <em>Minecraft</em> is currently the quintessential sandbox game. You'll know next week, Teacher Meng.” Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, Meng Zuo froze.</p>
<p>The quintessential sandbox game? That's too arrogant!</p>
<p>Boasting, or joking?</p>
<p>But from Chen Xu's tone, it didn't seem like it!</p>
<p>His mind was filled with doubts, but Meng Zuo didn't continue the conversation on that topic.</p>
<p>After they parted ways, Meng Zuo's mind was still replaying what Chen Xu had said earlier.</p>
<p><em>Minecraft</em> would be the quintessential sandbox game?</p>
<p><em>Wasteland</em> isn't a sandbox game?</p>
<p>After mulling it over a few times, Meng Zuo finally made a decision, pulling out his phone to send a message to his assistant.</p>
<p>To publicly announce a delay in release, at least to avoid clashing with <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chen Xu also felt a surge of emotion.</p>
<p>From <em>Wasteland</em> and some previously released games, Chen Xu had also formed a rough judgment.</p>
<p>That is, these games might be excellent games.</p>
<p>But none of them had truly grasped the core essence of a sandbox game.</p>
<p>The game quality was well-managed, but they absolutely couldn't be called sandbox games; at best, they merely drew upon some characteristics of sandbox games.</p>
