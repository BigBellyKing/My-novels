                <p>Chapter 113: Found a Great Treasure</p>
<p>Speaking confidently, with his hands on the keyboard and mouse, Zhang Yi officially began his journey of Linking the Fire.</p>
<p>He was quite excited at the moment.</p>
<p>Nebula Games was one of his favorite game developers.</p>
<p>Although the games it released were a bit tormenting, for instance, <em>Overcooked</em> had him washing dishes until today, and <em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em>, which had recently wrung many tears from him.</p>
<p>But you had to admit, these games all touched the players' hearts.</p>
<p>This <em>Dark Souls</em> before him, as Nebula Games' first major title, made him incredibly excited.</p>
<p>A world of despair passing on the fire of hope, just thinking about it was thrilling.</p>
<p>Although it might also wring many tears from him, what did it matter?</p>
<p>He was ready.</p>
<p>In the game, on the path ahead, there were many incomprehensible symbols resembling bloodstains.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was not unfamiliar with this, because during the previous online live press conference, Chen Xu had already introduced this special system.</p>
<p>Players could also leave in-game messages in various scenes across the game map.</p>
<p>This was a major feature of <em>Dark Souls</em>; simply put, it was a message board.</p>
<p>Of course, leaving messages had certain format restrictions, and the content left would also undergo special review.</p>
<p>If bad remarks were left, a warning would be issued, and players who repeatedly violated this would be banned from using online features.</p>
<p>Looking at the system's in-game messages now present in the game, Zhang Yi performed various operations according to the prompts.</p>
<p>Rolling, light attack, heavy attack...</p>
<p>Unlike the flashy attack styles of other games.</p>
<p><em>Dark Souls</em> gave him a very weighty feeling.</p>
<p>Rolling, cleaving, and the feedback from directly striking stone were all quite powerful.</p>
<p>The only thing Zhang Yi found uncomfortable was how quickly the stamina bar depleted.</p>
<p>One roll, a few slashes, and it was gone.</p>
<p>Running also consumed stamina.</p>
<p>It was a bit unsatisfying!</p>
<p>But Zhang Yi didn't mind, because he figured he'd get upgrades or equipment that increased stamina later.</p>
<p>After all, he was just a blank slate character now.</p>
<p>Soon, on his way forward, he encountered the first mob.</p>
<p>Like a Skeleton Soldier, a creature called a Hollow.</p>
<p>But it was very easy to deal with; he just took his Small Club and smacked it twice.</p>
<p>The opponent's health bar was instantly depleted.</p>
<p>"This mob is so easy! But does this game not have a mini-map?" Wang Han, next to him, occasionally offered her opinion.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, who was playing, was also a bit puzzled.</p>
<p>Because even though he had just started the game, he already felt the difference between <em>Dark Souls</em> and other games.</p>
<p>There was no difficulty setting before entering the game, and these mobs were way too easy to deal with, right?</p>
<p>No challenge at all.</p>
<p>As for the mini-map, though he wasn't used to it, he also had a guess.</p>
<p>"It's probably not at a plot point yet. We should encounter an NPC later who will give us a map," Zhang Yi voiced his thoughts.</p>
<p>Continuing forward to a fountain-like area, he spotted a corpse, and from it, Zhang Yi obtained a blue potion.</p>
<p>"Estus Flask? Orange for health, blue for magic, like Fruit Pulpy Orange and Mizone," Zhang Yi said, looking at the description of the Estus Flask.</p>
<p>"Who renames things so randomly?" Wang Han next to him was speechless. But she had to admit, it did sound quite catchy and fitting?</p>
<p>He continued to push forward, and along the way, there were also in-game messages on the ground teaching players knowledge like how to raise their shields.</p>
<p>It was essentially a beginner's tutorial instruction.</p>
<p>Weapon arts, dual-wielding, and other basic operations were all learned here.</p>
<p>All along the way were small foot soldiers, slow-moving and stiff-actioned, and exceptionally fragile.</p>
<p>The Small Club that the Deprived started with could usually defeat them in two hits, and the Small Wooden Shield for defense was also very effective.</p>
<p>"What kind of 'difficult' game is this?" Wang Han, next to him, watched Zhang Yi slaughtering Hollow mobs in the game, and felt a bit depressed thinking about the "High Difficulty" tag on the store page.</p>
<p>She wasn't really going to sit there all afternoon, was she?</p>
<p>Hearing his girlfriend's complaint, Zhang Yi chuckled: "No choice, my skills are just this good. It's hard to even die!"</p>
<p>After slaying all the common soldiers, the souls in the bottom right corner kept increasing.</p>
<p>Although he didn't know what it was, Zhang Yi guessed it was either in-game currency or an experience bar.</p>
<p>But he didn't know its purpose yet.</p>
<p>He continued forward, as the chilly sunlight shone down, the rugged mountain path presented two forks.</p>
<p>One led directly to the edge of a cliff, and there was a giant, half-open stone gate, with the surrounding buildings in ruins, clearly having stood for some years.</p>
<p>The small path on the right was a winding sheep trail.</p>
<p>"The cliff side should be the main story path after all; this winding sheep trail probably hides collectible items."</p>
<p>As an experienced gamer, Zhang Yi quickly analyzed the different characteristics of the two paths.</p>
<p>After all, he hadn't played games for so many years for nothing; he had the experience he ought to have.</p>
<p>"My intuition tells me there's definitely a big treasure in here!" Zhang Yi said smugly, glancing at his girlfriend next to him.</p>
<p>Wang Han rolled her eyes: "Rare treasures usually have guardian spirits beside them; with your tiny arms and legs, you'd probably die on the spot."</p>
<p>"How could that be? Even if there are monsters, they should only be slightly stronger than the Hollows before." Zhang Yi felt very relaxed; after all, his experience of easily crushing Hollows earlier had given him immense confidence.</p>
<p>As he went deeper, the rugged path was overgrown with dry vines, and at the same time, Zhang Yi found an in-game message on the ground ahead.</p>
<p>He opened it, and it read three words: 'Turn back!'</p>
<p>Turn back?</p>
<p>Turning back was impossible; since he had come all this way, shouldn't he go in and take a look?</p>
<p>Directly ignoring this in-game message, Zhang Yi continued forward.</p>
<p>Passing through a puddle, he arrived at a place similar to a cave.</p>
<p>Not far away, a huge Crystal Lizard was lying there.</p>
<p>When he saw this giant Crystal Lizard, Zhang Yi's eyes widened.</p>
<p>Because this thing was truly enormous.</p>
<p>"You really seem to have found a big treasure," Wang Han's voice appeared at the right moment.</p>
<p>At this moment, the Crystal Lizard also seemed to have discovered an uninvited guest in its territory; it stood up from the ground, staring menacingly at Zhang Yi in the game.</p>
<p>"No big deal, this should just be a minor elite monster; its health bar is so short, watch me smash it to death with two club hits!" Zhang Yi took a deep breath, but as he said it, he started believing himself.</p>
<p>Right, the health bar is so short!</p>
<p>It definitely wasn't a BOSS; maybe it just looked strong but was weak inside?</p>
<p>Thinking this, Zhang Yi bravely charged forward with his Small Club and broken Small Wooden Shield.</p>
<p>(Sigh, I'm really short... but still shamelessly asking for recommendation votes, monthly passes...)</p>
