                <h2>Chapter 218: Slow Burn</h2>
<p>As <em>Minecraft</em> launched, countless players immediately entered the game to play.</p>
<p>But soon, many posts also appeared online, expressing opinions on <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>
<p>First off was the pixel art. Many players who had previously questioned <em>Minecraft</em>'s pixel style completely changed their minds after truly entering the game.</p>
<p>Because although it was pixelated, the textures weren't an eyesore, and with the addition of lighting and shadow effects, <em>Minecraft</em> couldn't be called top-tier visually, but it was definitely above the passing mark.</p>
<p>The one thing players discussed quite a bit was building houses in the game.</p>
<p>Many players were encountering this type of game for the first time.</p>
<p>In fact, many players had never even played with building block toys.</p>
<p>Because, honestly, building block toys were actually quite a luxury.</p>
<p>You used to think only kids played Lego, but then you realized it was rich people who played Lego.</p>
<p>Even sets with fewer blocks started at several hundred Yuan, while more complex ones with more parts cost several thousand Yuan.</p>
<p>It was precisely because of this that <em>Minecraft</em>'s "building block" gameplay sparked curiosity in many.</p>
<p>Of course, curiosity was one thing, but players who could genuinely create beautiful houses in the game were, for now, exceedingly rare.</p>
<p>For most players, what they built were matchbox houses and dark rooms.</p>
<p>As for players in survival mode, they were even more direct.</p>
<p>Initially, they enthusiastically collected materials and built houses.</p>
<p>But once the house was built and they took a look.</p>
<p>"What the heck is this? Did I really build this ugly thing?"</p>
<p>"Tear it down quickly, it's too embarrassing!"</p>
<p>Thus, for these players, an alternative <em>Minecraft</em> survival journey began.</p>
<p>Why build houses?</p>
<p>Find a large mountain, dig a hole inside, place a bed, a workbench, and a storage chest, then stick in a torch.</p>
<p>At night, sometimes fearing monsters might enter, couldn't they just seal off the entrance with materials they had on hand?</p>
<p>At this stage, players officially became cavemen, entering the primitive society phase.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>After <em>Minecraft</em> launched, many game designers had also been keeping an eye on its movements.</p>
<p>But the overall performance could only be described as lukewarm.</p>
<p>Although players gave <em>Minecraft</em> considerable praise, they didn't seem to find it particularly stunning.</p>
<p>This included the ratings; currently, <em>Minecraft</em> had received a score of 9.0.</p>
<p>This left many industry designers feeling puzzled.</p>
<p>"Chen Xu's <em>Minecraft</em> doesn't feel very stunning!"</p>
<p>"What kind of stunning experience do you expect from a pixel game?"</p>
<p>"I feel like something's off; it shouldn't be just simple building blocks, right? Otherwise, Chen Xu's promotion seems to be much grander than for <em>Don't Starve</em>, already approaching the standards of a blockbuster!"</p>
<p>"You have a point there."</p>
<p>"Could <em>Minecraft</em> have more in-depth content?"</p>
<p>"Don't be ridiculous, what depth can a pixel building block game possibly have?"</p>
<p>As <em>Minecraft</em>'s early access launched, industry designers all felt it was strange.</p>
<p>Especially as the early access period for <em>Minecraft</em> slowly passed.</p>
<p>Although players discovered more gameplay elements, such as villages and even tamable livestock in the game...</p>
<p>And some skilled players had finally built not just matchbox houses, but beautiful small duplex villas.</p>
<p>However, the overall player reviews for <em>Minecraft</em> were generally just "acceptable" or "good."</p>
<p>The game's popularity was also lukewarm, only managing a fifty-fifty split with TengHua's <em>Voyage</em> thanks to the early access topic.</p>
<p>It even felt less impactful than the previous <em>Don't Starve</em>, which perplexed many industry designers.</p>
<p>Even Meng Zuo, who had previously discussed with Chen Xu and decided to postpone <em>Wasteland</em>, was now deep in thought as he looked at <em>Minecraft</em>'s screen in his office.</p>
<p>Although it had launched five days early, could this game still have any tricks up its sleeve later on?</p>
<p>After all, even if it was an early access experience, players had already experienced its content.</p>
<p>Moreover, five days was enough time for some games, even AAA-tier blockbusters, to be largely completed by playing through the main story.</p>
<p>Yet, <em>Minecraft</em> remained lukewarm.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Meng Zuo felt that what Chen Xu had told him earlier didn't seem like a lie.</p>
<p>As a game designer, and one with so many successful titles, he simply wouldn't believe Chen Xu would misjudge a game's quality.</p>
<p>So what exactly were this game's unique features?</p>
<p>In contrast to these disinterested designers, Zhu Yi, the lead designer of TengHua's <em>Voyage</em>, let out a sigh of relief when he saw <em>Minecraft</em>'s online popularity.</p>
<p>Lately, he had an unsettling premonition for some reason.</p>
<p>After all, sandbox games were originally pioneered by Chen Xu.</p>
<p>But judging from the current situation, <em>Minecraft</em> could only be considered a decent work.</p>
<p>Moreover, he had tried playing it himself and found it very peculiar. If you said it wasn't fun, it was actually quite alright to play, but if you said it was fun, he couldn't quite pinpoint why.</p>
<p>There were no explosive points or strong anchors of attraction at all. From a gameplay content perspective, Zhu Yi felt it shouldn't be enough to threaten <em>Voyage</em>'s success.</p>
<p>Thinking this, Zhu Yi couldn't help but smile broadly.</p>
<p>Especially since NetDragon's <em>Wasteland</em> had retreated without a fight this time. Although they publicly stated it was delayed for further refinement, everyone in the gaming industry knew better, didn't they?</p>
<p>With <em>Minecraft</em> being lukewarm and <em>Wasteland</em> temporarily backing down, Zhu Yi had a premonition that sales were about to skyrocket.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chen Xu wasn't much affected by the various comments; he continued calmly building structures.</p>
<p>However, others at Nebula Games were somewhat affected.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, current sales don't seem very optimistic!" Qin Yi said.</p>
<p>"That's right, current pre-order sales are only 810,000." Ruan Ningxue also said, a little nervously.</p>
<p>Although it was an early access pre-order, it had already been five days, and there had been extensive promotion before.</p>
<p>810,000 pre-order sales couldn't be described as particularly outstanding.</p>
<p>"Don't panic, it's all under control. Haven't you also experienced the charm of <em>Minecraft</em>? There's another big wave of promotion coming." Chen Xu walked over, glanced at the relevant backend data, and smiled.</p>
<p>Looking at the current data, although <em>Minecraft</em>'s popularity seemed lukewarm, the backend data wouldn't lie.</p>
<p>Players' time spent in the game hadn't just not decreased; it had actually increased, indicating that the game's popularity was slowly rising.</p>
<p>This was normal because <em>Minecraft</em> was a rather slow-burn game.</p>
<p>Unlike other games, you wouldn't feel particularly amazed at first glance.</p>
<p>But the more you played and saw, the greater the sense of accomplishment and fun would become.</p>
<p>And in terms of promotion, this was just the beginning!</p>
<p>It's important to know that when sandbox games first launched, players were still in the exploration phase, and the game's fun hadn't been fully discovered.</p>
<p>In fact, players hadn't even grasped the true charm of <em>Minecraft</em> yet.</p>
<p>And this part, Chen Xu was only preparing to release during the second phase of promotion.</p>
<p>Having genuinely experienced <em>Minecraft</em>'s gameplay, and then feeling its charm, the resulting sense of awe would be completely different. Where were they now in the grand scheme of things?</p>
