                <p>Chapter 748: A Sequel and a Hammer!</p>
<p>Watching the game's credits roll, Zhang Yi wasn't in a hurry to exit the game.</p>
<p>Because, generally, games produced by Nebula Games or other large studios usually have a small easter egg after the credits, or something that answers players' lingering questions. And this 'New God of War' in the Norse setting had so many plot holes, he figured there would likely be some kind of easter egg or reveal at the end.</p>
<p>Controlling Kratos as he guided Atreus across the Rainbow Bridge, following the prompts to return home.</p>
<p>What greeted his eyes was the dilapidated wooden hut, the drafty wooden walls, and the large hole in the ceiling that Baldur had smashed, which still hadn't been repaired.</p>
<p>"Honestly, Kratos is a God of War, after all, isn't his living condition a bit too simple?"</p>
<p>"While Freya's place is also a broken wooden hut, that giant turtle-tree house and all the surrounding flowers and plants, plus the massive underground area, all feel much more affluent than Kratos's place!"</p>
<p>"This is probably the difference between a local resident and an immigrant."</p>
<p>Zhang Yi looked at Kratos's house and couldn't help but sigh with emotion. They were all gods, so why was there such a huge difference in their living conditions? Thinking about it, the only difference was that Freya was a local deity, while Kratos was an outsider.</p>
<p>While Zhang Yi was lamenting, Kratos and Atreus in the game also lay down to rest. The journey of scattering ashes had left them both physically and mentally exhausted.</p>
<p>As Kratos and Atreus lay down, Zhang Yi's vision suddenly plunged into darkness, then a line of text appeared: "Years Later."</p>
<p>Kratos and Atreus were startled awake from their sleep. Outside, lightning flashed and thunder rumbled, and a fierce wind howled. The huge hole in the ceiling, previously smashed by Baldur, had already been repaired. But the next moment, it was struck again by a bolt of lightning. The same spot, the same hole, but the enemy visiting was different.</p>
<p>Kratos, wielding his Leviathan Axe, rushed out. At his doorstep, a black-robed, burly figure stood without speaking, surrounded by countless lightning bolts and thunder. "Who are you!" Kratos roared amidst the thunder and wind. The other party still remained silent, the mysterious figure merely flicking his cloak back. The next moment, a warhammer wrapped in lightning was shown in a close-up, and then the game ended, returning to the initial loading screen.</p>
<p>"Thor's Hammer! That must be Thor, right? Kratos and Atreus killed Thor's son, and now his father has come for revenge?"</p>
<p>Recalling the recent scene, Zhang Yi immediately recognized the figure. Lightning and thunder, coupled with Thor's iconic weapon, Mjölnir. Although he only had a slight understanding of Norse mythology, combined with the previous storyline of God of War, Zhang Yi instantly recognized who this person was.</p>
<p>"Now we'll have a hammer to play with in the sequel!"</p>
<p>"In Norse mythology, Baldur's death triggered Ragnarök. Now Kratos has killed Baldur, prematurely initiating Ragnarök, and Thor has also appeared. This next installment should officially kick off the war with the Norse gods!"</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was somewhat excited. Looking back at the Greek mythology storyline of God of War, it was quite similar. In the first game, Kratos killed Ares, the God of War, and here he killed Baldur. The sequel would undoubtedly involve a full-scale war with the Norse gods. If all goes as expected, Thor's hammer will likely become Kratos's new toy later on. After all, a diverse array of weapons is a hallmark of the God of War series.</p>
<p>Compared to the Greek-era God of War titles, the only major criticism Zhang Yi had of this new God of War was the limited number of 'toys'. Besides his bare hands, shield, axe, and Blades of Chaos, the only other weapon was his son's bow. Although the game featured various runic magic, it felt a bit monotonous compared to the wide array of magic and weapons in previous installments. Now, in this final, easter egg-like scene, the hammer was given significant camera focus. Clearly, besides hinting at the mysterious figure's identity, it likely had another meaning: that in the next game, players could control Kratos to beat up Thor and seize his Mjölnir as a toy.</p>
<p>Not only was Zhang Yi excited, but players who had finished 'New God of War' online were also discussing the game's content with relish. After all, this new God of War had changed so much—gameplay, style, and various plot threads. Of course, the main topic of player discussion was Kratos's future. That mural depicting Kratos's death became the central point of debate.</p>
<p>"Holy crap, Kratos dies in the end? I can't accept that!"</p>
<p>"Those who say Kratos will die are too young. It's not the first time Kratos has died; in Greece, he practically visited the Underworld every single time."</p>
<p>"Didn't you hear Mimir's head? Fate has no hold over Kratos."</p>
<p>"Exactly, fate has no hold over Kratos. In the Greek era, Kratos tore apart the Three Fates themselves."</p>
<p>"That's not necessarily true. It's just a protagonist dying; do you think Mr. Chen wouldn't go through with it?"</p>
<p>"Why think so much? Didn't you notice a crucial issue? After 'New God of War', there's been no news, and with this final easter egg, don't you think Mr. Chen is hinting at something? There's a sequel, and it's got a hammer!"</p>
<p>"Damn! You're right!"</p>
<p>The players erupted into a heated discussion, feeling that any outcome was possible, as the game's various details contained many foreshadowing elements. Especially the final mural, where Kratos lay in Atreus's arms and a great serpent emerged from Atreus's mouth, left players' imaginations running wild. This included Freya, who harbored hatred for Kratos due to Baldur's death, and finally, Thor, who showed up at his door. All these elements created a sense of impending doom for Kratos.</p>
<p>But Zhang Yi sincerely hoped that, just as Mimir said, the prophecy had no effect on Kratos. After all, if he thought about it, Kratos had a pretty tragic life. In Greece, he was treated as a tool by the gods, and in a fit of rage, he slaughtered the entire Greek pantheon. Now in the Norse realm, there was again a hint of him being treated as a tool – it was too difficult. It felt like 'God of War' could entirely be retitled 'Rage of the Laborers.' In Greece, Kratos signed shady contracts with the Greek gods, working for them and being oppressed. Finally, unable to bear the exploitation, he furiously overthrew the boss and chose to migrate north.</p>
<p>"So the main story ends just like that? I feel like there are still many areas to explore!"</p>
<p>Zhang Yi glanced at the relevant game community forums, then returned to the game. The main story involved climbing the highest mountain in the Nine Realms and scattering the ashes, which concluded the narrative. But this didn't mean there was nothing else in the game. The previous Greek mythology trilogy was essentially a linear experience, like 'The Last of Us' or 'Uncharted,' with one level after another.</p>
<p>The Norse content, in terms of its main story, was indeed linear. However, the game offered much more content to explore, such as various directions in Helheim, the Lake of the Nine in Midgard, and challenges through different realm-travel gates. There were also many side quests in the game to collect materials and craft higher-grade equipment. All these elements could keep players engaged for dozens of additional hours.</p>
<p>Moreover, for Zhang Yi, who had played on the easiest difficulty, he now wanted to challenge a higher difficulty. Also, as a new God of War with many ARPG elements, Zhang Yi wanted to grind a bit to get himself a more powerful gear set. His current equipment consisted of ordinary mismatched pieces, the kind that dropped during the main progression.</p>
<p>With this thought, Zhang Yi reloaded his previous save file and found Odin's Chamber in the Foothills, where he encountered the first Valkyrie he had seen so far. After a brief skirmish, Zhang Yi frowned deeply and silently quit the game.</p>
<p>Why? Because he found that, even on the easiest difficulty, he stood absolutely no chance against the Valkyrie. Baldur, Modi, and the other Norse gods he had encountered felt like pushovers compared to her. Their fights could only be described as brutal slaughter. In front of the Valkyrie, his Kratos was like an ungrown child, ruthlessly brutalized by her.</p>
<p>Though he hadn't faced the other Valkyries yet, based on the strength of the one he encountered, Zhang Yi estimated that the others wouldn't be much weaker. Thinking about it, this was still on the lowest difficulty. Was a Valkyrie on a higher difficulty even meant for humans to fight?</p>
<p>As a player very aware of his own skill level, Zhang Yi always played on easy difficulty if available, never touching normal. The easy difficulty of God of War had indeed given him the thrill of mowing down enemies, but this Valkyrie made him feel the long-lost sensation of being mowed down by monsters.</p>
<p>If the previous joke about Kratos being the fake God of War and his son being the true God of War was just playful banter, then fighting the Valkyrie made Zhang Yi realize the accuracy of that statement. In the not-so-spacious Odin's Chamber, he was chased all over the floor by the Valkyrie. His only means of offense was his son's arrows and magic. The Valkyrie's six health bars were depleted by two before he died, and two-thirds of that damage was dealt by Atreus's arrows. God of War? How embarrassing!</p>
