                <p>Chapter 297: Warcraft's New Version (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Inside Hero Entertainment's office, Zhou Qi's expression was incredibly complex.</p>
<p>During the period when Warcraft was continuously gaining popularity, basically no other games were heard from on the PC platform.</p>
<p>At first, Warcraft, as he had expected, ran into a balance crisis, and he cheered with joy.</p>
<p>But then, Chen Xu's live demonstration completely turned his face ashen.</p>
<p>After all, he had considered countless possibilities, but he truly never imagined a designer personally stepping up and even defeating pro gamers.</p>
<p>Originally, he thought Human Wars had lost, utterly defeated.</p>
<p>But now, he strangely discovered that Human Wars' activity, which had plummeted to rock bottom, had recently rebounded.</p>
<p>Through data surveys and forum discussions, he arrived at a somewhat painful truth.</p>
<p>That is, the reason these players returned to play Human Wars wasn't because they found Human Wars particularly charming, but purely because they felt they were too clumsy to play a slightly hardcore RTS game like Warcraft.</p>
<p>It was still Human Wars where everyone mindlessly mass-produced units and then took out opponents with an all-in rush, which felt comfortable and stress-relieving, offering a sense of participation.</p>
<p>At this moment, Zhou Qi was somewhat on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>“What does this mean? Do they think Warcraft is too deep, and Human Wars is particularly mindless and requires no skill?”</p>
<p>One must remember that once upon a time, Human Wars was the most technologically representative and most balanced RTS game in the RTS genre.</p>
<p>Now it has devolved into a so-called 'casual entertainment' game, rather than a competitive game?</p>
<p>This sense of contrast made Zhou Qi uncomfortable.</p>
<p>But at the same time, he also felt a little fortunate.</p>
<p>“We lost, but not completely.”</p>
<p>At least in the segment of light casual players, he still had hope.</p>
<p>If worst comes to worst, he would initiate sweeping reforms for Human Wars; as long as they could capture the casual player market, they might still be able to make a comeback!</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Zhou Qi felt his passion boiling over once more.</p>
<p>Just as he was filled with grand visions for the future, his phone on the table chimed with a notification.</p>
<p>“'The person you are following has a new update!'”</p>
<p>A news update from someone I follow?</p>
<p>He had only been following one person recently: Chen Xu!</p>
<p>“Posted a message?”</p>
<p>“Could it be a new version of Warcraft?”</p>
<p>He immediately picked up his phone, opened the official Weibo account, and Zhou Qi froze.</p>
<p>It was exactly as he had expected.</p>
<p>Chen Xu's simple Weibo post was indeed an announcement about the latest version.</p>
<p>But why were the updated contents so strange this time?</p>
<p>“New gameplay maps, and a self-created map editor?”</p>
<p>“What is this thing?”</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Many players, like Zhou Qi, were also confused and bewildered.</p>
<p>““New version? What did they update this time?””</p>
<p>““Uh, a few maps, but they don't look like battle maps. What are 'Defend the Sword Pass' and 'Calamity of the Western World'?””</p>
<p>““And a map editor, what's that about?””</p>
<p>““I'm a bit confused!””</p>
<p>““Is it a new campaign storyline? But that's not right, what's with the Three Kingdoms setting? Isn't Warcraft a Western fantasy game?””</p>
<p>““And there are Egyptian pyramids too!””</p>
<p>““What's this map editor for? Is it for us players to create our own battle maps? Like, ones with 100 gold mines?””</p>
<p>““Don't talk nonsense, didn't they update with two CGI animations?””</p>
<p>““The quality is as high as ever! But here's the problem, Mr. Chen, you're a game company, not an animation company!””</p>
<p>With the launch of the new version, many players excitedly opened the update notes, ready to see what this version had brought.</p>
<p>But after reading them, many players were a bit bewildered.</p>
<p>Because this completely new version was entirely different from what they had imagined.</p>
<p>Two CGI animations, and 5 maps that didn't look like campaign missions or battle maps.</p>
<p>And a map editor whose purpose was unknown.</p>
<p>Driven by curiosity, many players opened these maps to figure them out.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>As a loyal player who bought the Collector's Edition with his private stash of money.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi also updated to the new version of Warcraft immediately.</p>
<p>However, unlike when the game first came out, he had recently gone to play Monster Hunter: World with his friends like Wang Han and Song Ren.</p>
<p>The main reason was that none of them were particularly good at playing RTS games.</p>
<p>They always fumbled when playing, couldn't beat anyone, and their new accounts on the ladder were all at 500 points, still hovering between 400-600 points even now.</p>
<p>Although they would occasionally play friendly matches and AI matches together.</p>
<p>But they were becoming less and less interested.</p>
<p>This time, however, the update for Warcraft piqued his interest a little.</p>
<p>“Maps with completely new and different gameplay?”</p>
<p>“Could it be a campaign storyline?”</p>
<p>With that thought, Zhang Yi clicked on the map named 'Defend the Sword Pass'.</p>
<p>There were various different modes.</p>
<p>“Matchmaking with random players.”</p>
<p>“Playing solo.”</p>
<p>“Or playing with friends.”</p>
<p>After some thought, he directly chose multiplayer matchmaking.</p>
<p>Soon, he entered the game.</p>
<p>A grand piece of music played in the game, but it wasn't Warcraft's background music; instead, it was a BGM from Sanguosha.</p>
<p>This left him a bit taken aback.</p>
<p>Then, the buildings on the map and the other unit models also made him a little bewildered.</p>
<p>“Why were they all Three Kingdoms models?”</p>
<p>““Protect Zhuge Liang, does it end if Zhuge Liang dies?””</p>
<p>““Choose a hero? So we don't build units, just control one hero?””</p>
<p>““It's a bit like an RPG game!””</p>
<p>““I want to play Zilong, big brothers, can you let me play Zhao Yun?””</p>
<p>““Damn, speak properly! Be a real man, okay?! And look, where's Zhao Yun here? They're all greenhorn recruits, 'When there are no generals in Shu, Liao Hua serves as the vanguard,' this is the late Shu Han Dynasty!””</p>
<p>““Holy crap, these heroes are awesome! Over 100 attack at level one?””</p>
<p>““Equipment and levels? Can they level up? How do I do it?!””</p>
<p>““I got a purple intelligence fan! Holy crap, over two hundred attack, doesn't that make me invincible?! Wait! Where's my equipment! What the heck is this bird? Why did it pick up my equipment? Who's so ill-mannered?!””</p>
<p>““Holy crap, why is this BOSS so strong! Zhuge Liang died just like that?!””</p>
<p>A group of new players, bewildered, played for about ten minutes, but clearly, no one had figured out how to play this defense map.</p>
<p>With the first major BOSS of the tenth wave of attack, the group of players on the field couldn't put up a fight, directly leading to Zhuge Liang's demise, unable to cope alone.</p>
<p>However, none of the players felt any frustration; instead, they found it incredibly novel, feeling as if a new world had opened up to them.</p>
<p>After exiting that round with random players, Zhang Yi quickly pulled out his phone and started gathering his friends.</p>
<p>““Old Song! Stop farming decorations, you've farmed for over 800 hours and only got one besides the guaranteed one from the story. What the heck are you farming?! Come quickly to Warcraft, the new version is out, with new game modes! It's super fun!””</p>
