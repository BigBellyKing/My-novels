                <p>Chapter 15 Undertale (Requesting Collection and Recommendation Votes)</p>
<p>At ten o'clock the next morning, in an office building in Modu.</p>
<p>Chen Xu had just finished signing the lease contract with the agent and the owner, and was sitting on the sofa chatting with Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue.</p>
<p>"Chen Xu, the rent for this office building must be quite a lot, right?" Yang Xin asked casually, looking at the surrounding layout.</p>
<p>"Hmm, I've temporarily signed for three months. The rent itself is fine, but the expenses for game development machines and other office equipment are quite significant."</p>
<p>For rent, it was 5 Yuan per square meter per day. He rented two connected units, totaling 160 square meters.</p>
<p>Just the rent alone would be 24,000 Yuan a month, with property management fees of 20 Yuan per square meter per month calculated separately.</p>
<p>Of course, if he went to a smaller city, this amount might be only a tenth. But that was clearly unrealistic; after all, the gap in talent between smaller and larger cities was too vast.</p>
<p>"That's easy. My company also just closed down, and all sorts of development prototypes and such are readily available and no longer needed. Chen Xu, you can just give a little something for them later," Yang Xin offered generously.</p>
<p>"But speaking of which, are there only two main developers in our company?" Yang Xin asked Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Currently, including himself, the company had four employees. Yang Xin was with him for game development, and the other two were former employees of Yang Xin's company. One was responsible for finance and administration, and the other for operations. After testing their work capabilities, Chen Xu hired both of them as well.</p>
<p>"Yes, for now, it's just the two of us. The core team is missing a Lead Artist!" Chen Xu sighed, then glanced at Ruan Ningxue, who was holding an ice cream nearby.</p>
<p>In Chen Xu's plan, besides himself, he also needed someone with considerable artistic accomplishment. And Ruan Ningxue was his target.</p>
<p>As for the team only having three people, Chen Xu wasn't worried about that. After all, the game development industry in this world was different from his previous life; a core development team of three was currently sufficient for Chen Xu's plan.</p>
<p>Chen Xu himself could handle the Numerical Design, Level Design, and core design aspects. Most of the remaining content, such as art modeling output, could be entrusted to outsourced teams. This wasn't specialized technical work, it just required a lot of time.</p>
<p>While outsourcing these aspects would definitely be more costly, Chen Xu preferred to invest financial capital rather than time. The next step was whether he could 'trick' Ruan Ningxue into joining the team. After witnessing Ruan Ningxue's artistic skills during the development of Mirror (Game), Chen Xu had his eye on her.</p>
<p>"That's right, Ningxue, join us… Oh, Mr. Chen, what's our company called?" Yang Xin suddenly remembered to ask.</p>
<p>"Nebula Games," Chen Xu said with a hint of helplessness.</p>
<p>"Actually, Senior Sister, I think comics and games aren't that different. Both are about presenting the stories in our hearts to readers and players," Chen Xu said seriously, looking at Ruan Ningxue. "And in the future, Nebula Games will also have comic-related business. For some games, we'll launch corresponding comic tankōbon and the like. At that time, if Senior Sister is interested, you can absolutely continue working on that area."</p>
<p>Game-extended comics, or comic-adapted games, were actually very common operations. And unlike comic-adapted games in his previous life, which mostly just milked fans for money, Chen Xu understood that in this Parallel World, while most game design philosophies lagged behind his previous life, comic-adapted games were uniquely outstanding.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Chen Xu's words, Ruan Ningxue showed an expression of interest. Finally, as if having made a decision, she nodded and said, "Then from now on, I should call you Mr. Chen, Junior Brother!"</p>
<p>"It's just a title. Senior Sister, just call me whatever feels natural," Chen Xu said with a smile, seeing Ruan Ningxue join.</p>
<p>"Xiaoxue, why did you agree so readily? I've given you similar 'motivational speeches' before!" Yang Xin looked speechless.</p>
<p>Although Ruan Ningxue's joining also made her happy, the key was that she had tried to persuade her countless times before without success, so why did it work with Chen Xu now?</p>
<p>"Sister Xin, yours were purely 'grand promises'. Even if you had succeeded with one game, I wouldn't have considered it without a second thought," Ruan Ningxue said, looking exasperated.</p>
<p>Chen Xu had Mirror (Game) as a baseline, plus a clear direction for the company's development. Your company, on the other hand, just kept making smaller games with fewer people.</p>
<p>"Alright, to celebrate Senior Sister joining us, I'll talk about some upcoming arrangements," Chen Xu said, looking at the two of them.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Chen Xu, even though they had just started and didn't even have office equipment, Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue showed very serious and expectant expressions. After all, they joined Chen Xu's company not to slack off, but to achieve results.</p>
<p>"Next, we will develop a new game, a META game," Chen Xu said.</p>
<p>Yang Xin and the other looked confused.</p>
<p>META game, meta-game?</p>
<p>"Meta-game? We're not developing 18R games anymore?" Ruan Ningxue was a little surprised.</p>
<p>"Of course not, 18R games were just our starting capital," Chen Xu shook his head.</p>
<p>He had no intention of building an Illusion (developer)-like company in this Parallel World.</p>
<p>"But Mr. Chen, what kind of game is a META game?" Yang Xin was a bit bewildered. She had, after all, developed three games and earned the Job Title of Game Designer. But she had never even heard of this so-called meta-game.</p>
<p>As for Ruan Ningxue next to her, there was even less to say.</p>
<p>"Simply put, a so-called meta-game refers to a game where content breaks out of the game itself, and there's direct interaction between the game and the player personally."</p>
<p>"Have you read Don Quixote? In the novel, the author occasionally steps into the story, commenting on the plot," Chen Xu explained.</p>
<p>"Breaking the Fourth wall?" Yang Xin was still a bit bewildered, but Ruan Ningxue seemed to understand.</p>
<p>"Exactly," Chen Xu smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>Regarding META game, Chen Xu had noticed that some types had already appeared in the Parallel World, but they hadn't yet formed a complete system. This included applications in novel and comic genres, but they also hadn't become a specific category.</p>
<p>"Our next new work will be a META game, titled Undertale. More detailed information will be discussed when we officially start working on it."</p>
<p>"Of course, besides Undertale, during this period, we also need to develop a DLC character pack for Mirror (Game) to sell more while the popularity hasn't faded yet."</p>
