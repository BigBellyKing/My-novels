                <p>Chapter 234: New Game Plans (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Within twenty-four hours, countless eyes were fixated on the performance of the Nebula Games Platform. After all, the crucial question was whether games other than those from Nebula Games itself could achieve good results on its platform.</p>
<p>This was a matter of concern for all industry designers, and simultaneously, for all major channel providers.</p>
<p>And by noon the next day, Chen Xu also released the previously compiled data online.</p>
<p>Excluding games under Nebula Games' own banner,</p>
<p>the best-selling game was titled <em>Demon and Deity</em>, a new product from a moderately well-known domestic independent game studio.</p>
<p>It was a side-scrolling action game where the main gameplay involved players acquiring various skills and corresponding buffs as they progressed. The game offered two distinct paths, and the ultimate choice between the Demon Route or the Deity Route depended on the skills and buffs acquired, along with story choices made during gameplay.</p>
<p>Priced at 48 Yuan, this game sold 112,000 copies on its first day, making it the highest-selling launch-day game on the Nebula Games Platform, excluding Nebula Games' own titles.</p>
<p>Coming in second place was a simulation game called <em>The Vagrant</em>, where players take on the role of a homeless person and strive to improve their lives. Supporting a multiplayer mode and being particularly suitable for live streaming, it was a game driven by streamers. Although it had a lower player rating than <em>Demon and Deity</em>, it still achieved an impressive 71,000 sales on its first day.</p>
<p>In addition, there were some older games with decent sales, such as a text adventure game called <em>Love Dreamland</em>, brought in by smaller channels joining Nebula Games' camp.</p>
<p>Thanks to its excellent character development and plot, it achieved 31,000 sales on its first day.</p>
<p>The release of these figures similarly caused a stir among many gaming industry companies.</p>
<p>Before this, many game designers had hesitated to commit to the Nebula Games Platform, primarily due to concerns that while it might look promising, players on the platform might still only buy games from Nebula Games itself.</p>
<p>But now, all the data clearly indicated that the Nebula Games Platform's ecosystem was entirely viable.</p>
<p>Certainly, some games performed poorly, but that was attributed to issues with their quality.</p>
<p>Even if these games were distributed through TengHua and NetDragon's channels, they wouldn't perform much better unless heavily promoted.</p>
<p>The designers who had previously been wavering were now all excited, scrambling to release their games on the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>They wanted to seize the opportunity while the initial number of games wasn't overwhelming, to secure better recommendation slots.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the major channel providers were filled with lamentation, yet helpless.</p>
<p>Because at this moment, Nebula Games had far too much confidence.</p>
<p>Coupled with <em>Minecraft</em>'s skyrocketing popularity, there was no way to undermine them.</p>
<p>Of course, there was an even more crucial reason: the Game Department had actually reposted the official Weibo announcement that Chen Xu had released earlier.</p>
<p>While there was no explicit public statement, the implications were clear.</p>
<p>A week later, major game channels successively announced their new terms.</p>
<p>From the original 50-50 split, or even a 70-30 split favoring the channel, it had been changed to a 70-30 split favoring the developer.</p>
<p>Despite this, many game companies still chose to leave.</p>
<p>Clearly, with the emergence of the Nebula Games Platform, the era where 'the channel is king' was no more.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Online, discussions continued to rage, with players and industry designers still talking about the Nebula Games Platform and the recent channel controversy.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu himself had been quite relaxed during this period.</p>
<p>Within Nebula Games, there would be a subsequent recruitment plan. After all, with Nebula Games' transformation into an open platform, the costs associated with in-game community maintenance had significantly increased.</p>
<p>While most of the customer service for refunds, community maintenance, and Workshop reviews could be outsourced, a subsequent re-evaluation would still need to be conducted by Nebula Games itself.</p>
<p>Pondering a few matters, Chen Xu took a glass of cola to the rest area.</p>
<p>Seeing Chen Xu arrive, Ruan Ningxue and the others in the rest area, unusually, weren't busy building 'dark rooms' in <em>Minecraft</em>. Instead, they were gathered together chatting. Upon seeing Chen Xu, Ruan Ningxue excitedly said, </p>
