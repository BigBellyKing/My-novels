                <p>Chapter 673: Where is My Elizabeth? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>For many players, after playing BioShock Infinite, the two most concerning points were:</p>
<p>The first point was the fate of Elizabeth, whom they dearly yearned for.</p>
<p>The second point was what kind of place that underwater city, seen at the very end of the game, truly was.</p>
<p>And in the content preview video released before this game's launch, players knew they would find answers in this installment.</p>
<p>The incredibly spectacular Rapture, flashing neon signs, and vast underwater creatures swimming by.</p>
<p>The video's scenes rapidly switched: inside Rapture, blood, corpses, and madmen.</p>
<p>The background music sounded eerily peculiar.</p>
<p>On a dark street, a small girl with red eyes holding a syringe turned her head and spoke to a large 'monster' in a diving suit.</p>
<p>After a series of fragmented edits, the scene shifted to a crashed plane.</p>
<p>As the plane plummeted into the sea, a yellowed letter gradually enlarged.</p>
<p>However, the text on it couldn't be clearly seen. The next moment, the game's camera instantly moved into a dimly lit small room.</p>
<p>'Give me back my daughter! No!'</p>
<p>A roar emerged from the darkness, and countless players who had played BioShock Infinite were instantly jolted.</p>
<p>They recognized it—it was Booker's voice!</p>
<p>What was going on?</p>
<p>But wasn't Booker killed at the source by Elizabeth in BioShock Infinite?</p>
<p>Accompanied by a cough, the scene appeared.</p>
<p>In the darkness, the large door was pushed open.</p>
<p>An elegant, mature woman in an office uniform walked in.</p>
<p>'What do you want?'</p>
<p>'How about you light my cigarette first, then we can talk?'</p>
<p>As flames ignited on Booker's hand, the woman, with her back to the camera, slowly turned around.</p>
<p>Innumerable players were filled with excitement.</p>
<p>'What's your name, miss?'</p>
<p>'Elizabeth…'</p>
<p>Then the screen went dark.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>This promotional video immediately sparked heated discussion among players.</p>
<p>Although the video content wasn't very long, the things it revealed were already quite substantial for the players.</p>
<p>What astonished them most was that Elizabeth's appearance in the video was completely different. She had become more mature.</p>
<p>Especially Booker's line, demanding his daughter back.</p>
<p>Moreover, Booker in the game didn't seem to recognize Elizabeth.</p>
<p>'It's obvious! This is a Parallel World! The original Booker is dead, but not all Bookers in Parallel Worlds are necessarily dead.'</p>
<p>'But the key question is, is this Elizabeth still the Elizabeth we know?'</p>
<p>'Completely baffling!'</p>
<p>'It'd be weird if it wasn't! The story and background of BioShock are quite deep.'</p>
<p>Players online discussed various theories, but most had many questions.</p>
<p>This was quite normal, though, as trying to understand the entire story of BioShock based on just a preview video was pure fantasy.</p>
<p>After all, this game involved aspects from various fields: religious authority, utopia, quantum mechanics, and a whole host of other complex topics that weren't so easy to grasp.</p>
<p>But no matter what, the one thing that truly excited players was that Elizabeth still had a relevant role in the game.</p>
<p>Knowing that alone was enough.</p>
<p>Especially with Elizabeth's new look, it made people's mouths water even more. Who cared about anything else?</p>
<p>Just for Elizabeth, they had to buy it! Not buying it would be inhuman!</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>After more than a week, BioShock: Rapture was successfully unlocked after Infinite. Many eagerly awaiting players entered the game immediately.</p>
<p>The forums were filled with a jubilant atmosphere.</p>
<p>'Elizabeth and Booker should finally live together happily, right?'</p>
<p>'It should be, Elizabeth probably gets to retire peacefully.'</p>
<p>'But is the Booker from the original world truly dead?'</p>
<p>'Who knows? He might not actually be dead. Like Lutece and Lady Comstock, they died biologically, but from a cognitive perspective, they were still alive.'</p>
<p>Many, many players held a very optimistic view regarding Rapture as the concluding work of BioShock.</p>
<p>Similarly, Song Ren, a player who had been eagerly anticipating the game, also entered immediately.</p>
<p>Just as Zhang Yi complained that Elizabeth was far more useful than he, a 'pig teammate,' Song Ren had the same thought while playing. He felt that if he had Elizabeth as a teammate, his multiplayer games wouldn't constantly be stuck in the 'fish pond' of low ranks.</p>
<p>His low scores were all Old Zhang's fault for being underperforming!</p>
<p>In this situation, Elizabeth's thoughtfulness only deepened his affection for the character.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen's works always follow a pattern of joy, sorrow, then joy. In the previous game, Booker might have died, which was sorrow. So, according to this logic, BioShock: Rapture should be joy,” Song Ren mused.</p>
<p>“It’s quite a contrast though, the opening scene in Infinite was a small boat, but the game map was Columbia, the Sky City. Here in Rapture, it's a plane, but the map is the underwater city of Rapture,” Song Ren mused.</p>
<p>At the same time, the in-game narration for the cutscene sounded in Song Ren's ears.</p>
<p>‘1960, mid-Atlantic…'</p>
<p>“This timeline seems to be after BioShock Infinite!”</p>
<p>Looking at a letter on the black screen, Song Ren showed a hint of surprise.</p>
<p>Then the game showed a scene inside an airplane cabin, revealing the protagonist's name: Jack.</p>
<p>This surprised Song Ren a little; had they changed protagonists?</p>
<p>Sitting in his seat, Jack held a burning cigarette butt.</p>
<p>Next, Jack's inner monologue began.</p>
<p>‘They told me: Son, you're a special person, destined to achieve great things.’</p>
<p>‘And you know what? They were right.’</p>
<p>As he spoke, Jack took a gift box from the luggage next to him.</p>
<p>A note was attached to it: To Jack, Mom and Dad love you… Would you kindly… not open until…</p>
<p>At this point, the screen plunged into darkness. Song Ren suddenly heard gunshots, explosions, and screams.</p>
<p>When the screen recovered, the scene had become the ocean.</p>
<p>The plane had crashed, and Jack was the sole survivor, falling into the sea.</p>
<p>In the distance were the plane's wreckage and an extremely dazzling, colossal lighthouse.</p>
<p>“A familiar scene!”</p>
<p>“Another lighthouse opening.”</p>
<p>Approaching the lighthouse on the sea, Song Ren looked around.</p>
<p>Unlike the lighthouse in the previous BioShock Infinite, this one wasn't as eerie inside.</p>
<p>A colossal statue of a man stood in the center of the lighthouse, with a banner hanging on it.</p>
<p>It read: Man is the master of all things.</p>
<p>“Columbia, the Sky City was about flying; now Rapture is about going underwater!”</p>
<p>Below the statue, a conspicuous submersible was parked.</p>
<p>Clearly, to reach the underwater city of Rapture, one needed to use this submersible.</p>
<p>Song Ren had already experienced this in BioShock Infinite.</p>
<p>Entering the submersible, he pulled the switch.</p>
<p>A cheerful BGM started playing.</p>
<p>The submersible's screen displayed a promotional video for the city.</p>
<p>The screen showed a man named Andrew Ryan introducing the submersible's destination to passengers: Rapture.</p>
<p>He claimed it was a utopia for scientists and artists, where everyone's labor would not be exploited by religious or political systems.</p>
<p>Accompanied by Andrew Ryan's narration, Rapture's skyscrapers appeared in the submersible's window.</p>
<p>This underwater city of Rapture gave Song Ren a visual experience no less grand than Columbia, the Sky City, had.</p>
<p>Although he had just started the game, Song Ren felt his attention was completely captivated by the deep-sea metropolis before him.</p>
<p>“Another utopian city. I have a feeling Rapture won't be a good place either.”</p>
<p>Song Ren mused.</p>
<p>Despite just starting the game, with his previous experience in Columbia, the Sky City,</p>
<p>Song Ren didn't hold much expectation for Rapture either.</p>
<p>And it wasn't just BioShock. Whether in film, novels, or games, if a story involved a utopian city, there was bound to be darkness hidden behind its prosperity.</p>
<p>After all, a utopia was a city that could only exist in ideals.</p>
<p>“But… where is my Elizabeth?”</p>
<p>After a brief moment of reflection, Song Ren realized a significant problem.</p>
