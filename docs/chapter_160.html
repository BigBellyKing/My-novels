                <p>Chapter 259: We Are a Professional Team! (Sixth update, requesting subscriptions)</p>
<p>After the four large characters appeared, Song Ren rode the Palico cart back to the camp, then chose to abandon the hunt and exit.</p>
<p>After returning to Astera Base, he went to the item box and restocked all the supplies he had used.</p>
<p>Then he alt-tabbed out of the game and entered the voice channel. Song Ren unmuted his mic.</p>
<p>“Guys? What are you all doing now?”</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>He was going to start summoning people!</p>
<p>If he was alone, Song Ren felt he still couldn't beat this Diablos.</p>
<p>But what did that matter?</p>
<p>Anjanath, Odogaron, didn't he struggle against both of them back then?</p>
<p>But what happened in the end?</p>
<p>Didn't they still die miserably at the hands of the righteous hunting squad?</p>
<p>You Diablos, are no exception today!</p>
<p>About ten seconds later, everyone started to respond.</p>
<p>“Doing a quest. What's up, Old Song?” Joey asked.</p>
<p>“I just finished fighting Anjanath and I'm about to go back and craft new gear for my Palico,” Wang Han replied.</p>
<p>And at this moment, Zhang Yi, who knew Song Ren best, chuckled knowingly: “Old Song, did you get stuck on a quest again and die?”</p>
<p>Couldn't he understand his old friend?</p>
<p>As soon as he spoke, he knew what might have happened.</p>
<p>“Ahem, ahem, a hunter, exhausted from not having enough to eat, being sent home by their Palico, how can that be described as ‘dying’?” Song Ren coughed lightly twice to dispel his embarrassment, then immediately changed the subject.</p>
<p>“Old Zhang, it's not me talking, this time I'm really not making excuses. The Diablos and Rathalos after Odogaron—the difficulty of these two quests is definitely not ordinary. If you don't believe me, just try fighting them yourself, it's too damn hard! It's really, really hard! I suspect that Diablos isn't a herbivore, but rather eats poop, it does a Dragon Charge constantly, and its attack power is insanely high!” Song Ren added.</p>
<p>“Is it as mysterious as you say?” Zhang Yi expressed doubt.</p>
<p>“It's really tough!” Song Ren said, and at the same time invited Zhang Yi and the others.</p>
<p>Soon, everyone gathered at Astera Settlement.</p>
<p>“Let me tell you about Diablos's attack methods. Basically, it can attack with its whole body, it's not safe to stand anywhere, and it does a Dragon Charge without a word. It also has burrowing attacks, and the damage is very high. I think we need to make a plan,” Song Ren said to everyone.</p>
<p>“Hmm, we do need to make a plan. After all, you're a Longsword Hero, and we absolutely can't handle that Spirit Roundslash,” Zhang Yi agreed.</p>
<p>“Ahem, ahem, I'll build up my Red Blade using other small monsters at the start. When we're fighting, I won't use Spirit Roundslash unless you guys are out of combat,” Song Ren coughed awkwardly and said.</p>
<p>“When we fight, try to fight in areas with slopes, that way I can Dual Blades back-scrub,” Joey offered his opinion.</p>
<p>“That's right, on slopes I can also use my Hammer's Windmill Attack,” Wang Han added.</p>
<p>“When we knock the Diablos to the ground, I'll go for True Charged Slash to sever its tail, and leave the front to me. The Great Sword's blocking is really powerful, and although I'm not very proficient with the Tackle yet, its hyper armor and damage reduction are undeniable,” Zhang Yi assigned his tasks.</p>
<p>“If it's down, I can hammer its head!” Wang Han added.</p>
<p>“Then I'll target the Diablos's sides, and when everyone's health drops to half, put away your weapons and heal directly.”</p>
<p>The four of them, exchanging words, immediately formulated the Diablos hunting plan.</p>
<p>Professionalism, what is professionalism?</p>
<p>This is professionalism!</p>
<p>Reasonable role assignments, a perfect combat plan.</p>
<p>Looking at the three teammates beside him, Song Ren couldn't help but feel a surge of emotion. This time, the Diablos was definitely going to die.</p>
<p>They made their Felyne Canteen meal selections based on their different roles.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, who used the Great Sword, chose the 6-fish meal for defense.</p>
<p>The others chose the more balanced Hunter's Meal.</p>
<p>Arriving at the Diablos's lair, the four of them spread out slightly and drew their weapons.</p>
<p>However, Song Ren noticed that the Diablos in front of them reacted a little differently compared to when he faced it alone.</p>
<p>Before, when he challenged the Diablos alone, the Diablos would basically just rush him as soon as it saw him.</p>
<p>But now, facing four people, the Diablos in front of them was like the Great Jagras they encountered before; it didn't immediately charge, but instead watched from a distance.</p>
<p>“This Diablos, seeing there are many of us, isn't attacking proactively? Holy crap, bullying the weak and fearing the strong! Weren't you quite aggressive before?!” Song Ren was astonished, looking at the Diablos in its lair.</p>
<p>After telling Zhang Yi and the others to get into position, Song Ren prepared to run over and initiate combat to lure the Diablos over.</p>
<p>Because their current location had a slope, and for Dual Blades and Hammer, using the slope could better leverage their skill advantages.</p>
<p>Whether it was charging attacks, Windmill Attack, or back-scrubbing.</p>
<p>Running to the side of the Diablos, he didn't use his Long Sword to initiate, but instead shot the Diablos in the face with a wrist-mounted mechanism.</p>
<p>Accompanied by a dragon's roar, the enraged Diablos charged towards Song Ren and his teammates.</p>
<p>“Old Song, the aggro is on you, pull it a bit closer!”</p>
<p>As the hunt began, seeing the Diablos lock its aggro onto Song Ren, Zhang Yi shouted loudly.</p>
<p>“No problem!” Song Ren yelled in the voice channel, then sheathed his Long Sword and ran towards their direction to allow them to deal more damage.</p>
<p>“Watch my back-scrubbing!” Joey rushed forward with his Dual Blades, performing a sliding jump to “scrub” the back.</p>
<p>Just like with the Radobaan in the Rotten Vale back then, the dazzling blade flashes and 'ding-ding-ding' sounds were incessant; it was just that the quality of the weapon was slightly lower.</p>
<p>Looking closely, it was -2, -4, -5, -3, all white-colored single-digit damage numbers, occasionally mixed with yellow weak point hitzone damage.</p>
<p>“Watch my little top!” Wang Han, who was charging up, also began spinning her Hammer at the Diablos's feet.</p>
<p>The damage was pretty good, -13, -10, -11, at least breaking into double digits.</p>
<p>A Hammer and a Dual Blades user, could be called the dual heroes of back-scrubbing and foot-trimming.</p>
<p>“Everyone move aside, in critical moments, you still have to rely on my Great Sword's power!” Zhang Yi charged forward, carrying his Great Sword, performing basic attacks, tackles, charges, then tackles and charges again, striving to achieve True Charged Slash as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>But the next moment, Zhang Yi saw his character fly through the air.</p>
<p>He, who had just positioned himself to charge, was directly tossed by the Diablos, and his health bar instantly dropped by a large chunk.</p>
<p>“Holy crap, that damage!” Just like Song Ren earlier, Zhang Yi was also shocked.</p>
<p>This damage was just unreasonable!</p>
<p>You know, his armor was fully upgraded, and he even ate a 6-fish meal from the Palico Canteen!</p>
<p>And with one hit, he lost a quarter of his health?</p>
<p>While Zhang Yi was still questioning life due to the Diablos's damage, he then saw Joey fly up in the air, and with a horn attack from the Diablos, his health bar on the left instantly dropped by half.</p>
<p>“Ah! Sister Xin, your Hammer charge hit me!” Joey's voice had a hint of despair.</p>
<p>“I didn't mean to! Your Dual Blades are always flailing around when you attack!” Wang Han explained, but as soon as her voice fell, she saw herself get scraped by a flurry of blades, she was stunned, and then got knocked by the Diablos's massive horns, her health also instantly vanished by half.</p>
<p>“No, Old Song, didn't you say you wouldn't use Spirit Roundslash!?” Wang Han was also bewildered.</p>
<p>“No, I didn't use it! The Long Sword's attack range is just that wide. I kept bouncing off here, so I could only attack here!” Song Ren expressed his grievance.</p>
<p>The scene immediately became extremely chaotic.</p>
<p>“Old Song, hold on for a bit, we two will disengage and heal!” Wang Han and Joey indicated they were going to retreat for a bit.</p>
<p>When playing solo, there were still Palicos to assist, occasionally bringing Vigorwasps.</p>
<p>But when teaming up, the Palicos weren't there.</p>
<p>They could only watch their own health and heal.</p>
<p>“No! Old Zhang, stop dazing off, I'm done for!” Song Ren's desperate voice came from that side.</p>
<p>As a cloud of dust rose, it seemed as if the entire underground cave of the Wildspire Waste began to shake; the Diablos in front of them directly performed a charge.</p>
<p>They saw a Longsword Hero fly up into the air and land on the ground, his health bar already depleted, and two Palicos from who knows where, carried him onto a stretcher.</p>
<p>“It's fine, Old Song, it'll be easier for us to fight now that you're dead!” Looking at Old Song, who had collapsed from exhaustion, Zhang Yi 'comforted' him.</p>
<p>This was the excellent quality of a professional team leader.</p>
<p>When a teammate dies, you absolutely cannot put pressure on them; instead, you must comfort them, stating that while they died, it doesn't significantly affect the battle.</p>
