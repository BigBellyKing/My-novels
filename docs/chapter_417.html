                <p>Chapter 416: Too Much to Eat, It's Annoying! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>One could say that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild doesn't strictly dictate how players must play.</p>
<p>Like Minecraft, it encourages players to use their brains and find ways to overcome challenges.</p>
<p>This is the most important aspect of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</p>
<p>For example, instead of using Perfect Guard at the start, one could choose to relentlessly blast a Guardian with Remote Bombs for over an hour until it’s defeated.</p>
<p>Isn't that also a method?</p>
<p>Though the experience might not be great.</p>
<p>After composing himself and restarting the game, Zhang Yi made a new discovery.</p>
<p>“That mysterious old man from before, if you prepare a dish for him, you can exchange it for a warm doublet. Otherwise, you’ll freeze to death in the snowy mountain shrine, and torches won’t help much because there are monsters on the way,” Wang Han kindly reminded him from the sofa, watching the game screen displayed on the TV connected to the dock, speaking as someone who had been through it.</p>
<p>“A warm doublet? As a true warrior, I don’t need such a thing at all!”</p>
<p>Standing before the snowy mountain, Zhang Yi chuckled.</p>
<p>Then he opened his inventory.</p>
<p>It was filled with all sorts of food.</p>
<p>Roasted apples, fruit skewers, and roasted fish.</p>
<p>He had everything imaginable.</p>
<p>Who needed a warm doublet?</p>
<p>Looking at the snowy mountain before him, Zhang Yi controlled Link and rushed forward.</p>
<p>Walking through the icy and snowy landscape, Link’s face was runny with snot, and he hugged himself, shivering all over.</p>
<p>His health dropped by one segment after a while.</p>
<p>At this point, Zhang Yi decisively opened his inventory and ate two roasted apples.</p>
<p>His health instantly recovered, and he continued to control Link, advancing into the ice and snow.</p>
<p>“See! This is my Link! A warm doublet? I don’t need such a thing!” Zhang Yi said proudly.</p>
<p>Hearing Zhang Yi’s words, Wang Han, sitting beside him, opened her Switch, activated the Sheikah Slate, and teleported to the shrine on the snowy mountain. Wearing a warm doublet, she comfortably gazed at the distant scenery.</p>
<p>“My Link can admire this magnificent snowscape and take in Hyrule’s splendid views,” Wang Han retorted, unwilling to concede.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing special, acting like my Link can’t do the same.” Zhang Yi also controlled Link, who was now shivering and purplish, with snot bubbles, to stand on the edge of the snowy mountain cliff and look at the distant scenery.</p>
<p>He ate roasted apples and roasted fish as he watched.</p>
<p>“My Link can not only enjoy the scenery but also feast on a grand meal!” Zhang Yi expressed his disdain.</p>
<p>After collecting food for half an hour, why would he fear mere cold?</p>
<p>Warm doublet? Food to ward off the cold?</p>
<p>Don’t give me all these flashy and gaudy things.</p>
<p>My Link doesn’t need any of that.</p>
<p>Eating all the way, charging all the way. What can a little cold do to me?</p>
<p>Too much to eat, it's annoying!</p>
<p>As Hyrule’s biggest foodie, with enough food, let alone a snowy mountain, he could traverse Antarctica.</p>
<p>Each shrine in the game is like a simple labyrinth where players must utilize Link’s various powers to solve the puzzles.</p>
<p>Upon solving them, they receive a Trial Certificate.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi had a good grasp of this from exploring the previous shrines.</p>
<p>In this shrine, Zhang Yi gained a brand-new ability: the strange power to turn water into ice pillars, Cryonis.</p>
<p>Like the previous shrines, the levels inside were basically not difficult.</p>
<p>The main purpose was to teach players how to use this peculiar energy.</p>
<p>With the completion of this final shrine, Zhang Yi had successfully explored all four shrines.</p>
<p>At this point, Zhang Yi also realized just how vast the content of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild truly was.</p>
<p>Because he found that, so far, he seemed to still be playing the newbie tutorial.</p>
<p>For example, when he first descended the mountain, he met the mysterious old man, who taught players how to cook food and about environmental interaction.</p>
<p>In the jungle, the old man taught players how to hunt.</p>
<p>In the forest, players learned how to chop trees and use fallen trees as roadblocks to reach the other side of a cliff.</p>
<p>Before heading to the snowy mountain, in a small wooden hut, players learned how to combine various ingredients to create more effective dishes.</p>
<p>Besides these, there were many other details, and the four shrines were specifically designed to teach players four different powers:</p>
<p>Magnesis, which controls metal; Remote Bomb, for remote-controlled explosives; Stasis, which can freeze time, apply kinetic energy to an object, and then release it for greater force or to change its direction; and Cryonis, which creates unmelting ice pillars as footholds.</p>
<p>Moreover, Zhang Yi felt there was still much content he hadn’t encountered, such as the combat system, particularly Perfect Guard, which he knew nothing about.</p>
<p>If he had known about this skill, would he have spent an hour throwing bombs to defeat the Guardian?</p>
<p>Of course, these weren't the main points. The truly crucial aspect was that he hadn't found any of the initial Great Plateau tutorials boring; instead, he had thoroughly enjoyed them.</p>
<p>While playing, Zhang Yi never felt like he was going through tutorial levels.</p>
<p>In fact, he felt he had discovered much of the content himself.</p>
<p>It wasn't until he finished exploring these areas and looked back that he realized they were all guiding him through the game’s mechanisms.</p>
<p>“This is too extravagant!” Zhang Yi exclaimed, now aware of it.</p>
<p>Yes, extravagant!</p>
<p>A newbie tutorial in the Great Plateau with so much content that it took him three or four hours, and he still found it incredibly fun.</p>
<p>Isn't that extravagant enough?</p>
<p>After completing the four shrines, the old man reappeared and told Zhang Yi to go to the intersection of the four shrines, where he would reveal the full truth.</p>
<p>Then Song Ren (Link) arrived at the quest destination.</p>
<p>Having collected all four certificates there, he could now exchange them for either a stamina bar upgrade or a health upgrade.</p>
<p>After some thought, Zhang Yi decided to prioritize stamina.</p>
<p>He realized that stamina was incredibly important in this game; theoretically, with enough stamina, he could climb any mountain, no matter how high.</p>
<p>Although health was also important, given the game's rogue-like eating mechanic, as long as Link wasn't instantly killed, he could essentially be immortal.</p>
<p>But with too little stamina, he felt it would be hard to truly 'roam freely' across the vast land of Hyrule.</p>
<p>Because of this, Zhang Yi chose to increase his stamina.</p>
<p>However, the resulting stamina bar after the exchange left Zhang Yi speechless.</p>
<p>He had expected a large increase.</p>
<p>But it was so petty?</p>
<p>Only added this much? Zhang Yi was truly at a loss for words.</p>
<p>But having added it, there was no way to go back.</p>
<p>Sighing, Zhang Yi controlled Link to climb onto the rooftop.</p>
<p>The mysterious old man also appeared there.</p>
<p>Through their conversation, the old man revealed all the truths to Link.</p>
