                <p>Chapter 319: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games' meeting room, everyone was holding their first post-New Year meeting.</p>
<p>The others were also discussing the content of this meeting.</p>
<p>Just then, Chen Xu walked into the meeting room, and everyone quieted down.</p>
<p>Chen Xu looked at everyone and said, "Everyone must have heard, right? Regarding the competition between zeus and Huanyu, just like other domestic game developers, we will use Huanyu as the prototype for our new game's development. Without further ado, let's take a look at our new project."</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (Cinematic Story [Level Design], Multiplayer, Fictional War)</p>
<p>Looking at the title displayed on the big screen.</p>
<p>Everyone present felt a bit curious.</p>
<p>"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare," clearly this was the name of the new game project.</p>
<p>And just like the subtitle, it should be set against a modern warfare theme.</p>
<p>However, after seeing some of the tags below, many people became curious.</p>
<p>Multiplayer, fictional war — these were relatively easy to understand.</p>
<p>It simply meant the game would have a multiplayer mode, and the setting would be a fictional war.</p>
<p>But what did "cinematic story" and the emphasized "level design" mean?</p>
<p>Looking at the title, everyone felt a bit strange.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, are we also going to buy an IP?" During the Q&amp;A session, someone asked curiously.</p>
<p>After all, the most talked-about news recently was atrai's 'Storm Action'.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Chen Xu, although it wasn't explicitly stated, with one game launching on the zeus platform and the other on the Huanyu platform, a competition was clearly brewing.</p>
<p>In this situation, were they also going to buy a major IP?</p>
<p>However, Qin Yi, Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, and others who had already discussed it with Chen Xu knew this wasn't the case.</p>
<p>"Of course not, we'll create our own IP." Hearing this, Chen Xu smiled and shook his head.</p>
<p>"This new game project will be somewhat different from what you might expect. We need to create a linear FPS game."</p>
<p>"As for 'cinematic,' you can understand it as making the game feel like a movie, giving it a cinematic quality, with the rhythm and presentation of a Hollywood blockbuster."</p>
<p>Chen Xu slowly spoke as he looked at everyone.</p>
<p>In his previous life, the Call of Duty series became the largest FPS game IP.</p>
<p>It could be said that it all started with this installment of Modern Warfare.</p>
<p>So, what kind of impact did the Modern Warfare series have on the Call of Duty brand?</p>
<p>Firstly, in terms of single-player story, the Modern Warfare series could be considered a peak for Call of Duty.</p>
<p>Unlike Half-Life, which pioneered FPS narrative, or Halo, which perfected the 30-second fun loop.</p>
<p>Modern Warfare was more about showcasing a cinematic feel.</p>
<p>Cinematic games, in this Parallel World, didn't yet have a precise concept; many game designers simply aimed to make the game's graphics better.</p>
<p>But cinematic games were far from that simple, broadly divisible into three types.</p>
<p>The first type involved techniques like the one-shot camera in New God of War, as well as homages within games, such as a segment in Little Nightmares 2 where traversing a corridor clearly paid tribute to Roman Polanski's classic thriller Repulsion. This was an application of cinematic techniques, aimed at providing players a more immersive experience.</p>
<p>Then there was interactive cinematic storytelling, with Detroit and Heavy Rain being prime examples.</p>
<p>Finally, and the mode used by more games, presenting a cinematic experience through game content: the broad narrative threads of Uncharted, The Last of Us's almost perfect camera work, and Metal Gear's seamless camera transitions.</p>
<p>Along with the audio-visual experience and level design, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was truly perfect.</p>
<p>Most FPS players only realized that an FPS game could feel like watching a blockbuster movie starting from this installment of Modern Warfare.</p>
<p>The camera work and narrative rhythm could easily be seen as those of a major motion picture.</p>
<p>What was even more outstanding was that it didn't just cinematize the story content; it cinematized the levels that players experienced.</p>
<p>Each installment of the Modern Warfare trilogy featured several classic level designs that players found unforgettable.</p>
<p>Especially the flashback mission called 'All Ghillied Up,' which was hailed as a classic by countless players.</p>
<p>Of course, in addition to its excellent story, which allowed Call of Duty to become an annual title selling tens of millions, there was its multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>Killstreaks, abundant items, and a tense, thrilling, fast-paced experience.</p>
<p>These directly laid the core foundation for the entire Call of Duty series' multiplayer gameplay.</p>
<p>The sole purpose of everything was to give players an exhilarating experience.</p>
<p>Engaging single-player story, excellent multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>This was Chen Xu's primary reason for choosing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.</p>
<p>As for Black Ops, while also excellent.</p>
<p>Especially characters like Reznov were remembered by countless players, but some levels were rather sensitive, and content review was a serious issue, so Chen Xu temporarily didn't consider it.</p>
<p>Before the project began, Chen Xu also explained some of the settings within Call of Duty: Modern Warfare to everyone.</p>
<p>As an FPS game.</p>
<p>The most important aspects were the shooting feel and the related actions in the game.</p>
<p>Although the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare series was outstanding in terms of story, level design, and pacing, from a current perspective, there were still many details that needed improvement.</p>
<p>For example, a richer action system; Chen Xu referenced the rebooted Modern Warfare from his previous life. Although IW's demonization of Russians in the story was a bit excessive, the rebooted Modern Warfare itself had a very strong foundation.</p>
<p>"We actually applied some cinematic storytelling in 'It Takes Two'."</p>
<p>"But in the single-player story of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, we need to go even deeper."</p>
<p>Looking at everyone, Chen Xu also briefly outlined some important considerations for the game.</p>
<p>One difference from other FPS games lay in the story.</p>
<p>Modern Warfare utilized a multi-threaded narrative.</p>
<p>Players wouldn't play a fixed protagonist or belong to a fixed faction.</p>
<p>Instead, the entire Modern Warfare story would be introduced from multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game deeply characterized teammates outside of the player-controlled protagonist.</p>
<p>Teammates in the game would genuinely help players, rather than being useless persons who just cheered you on while holding you back like pig teammates.</p>
<p>The interaction and sense of reliability amidst a hail of bullets would make players feel that their teammates were flesh and blood.</p>
<p>Especially in his previous life, many players didn't even complete high-difficulty modes on their own.</p>
<p>They relied on NPC teammates to get through them.</p>
<p>In this aspect of NPC teammates, it happened to be one of Nebula Games' strengths.</p>
<p>Nebula Games wouldn't claim to have world-class technology in other areas.</p>
<p>But in AI performance, they were in a league of their own.</p>
<p>Moreover, compared to their previous AI performance, Zhong Yue and his team had made new progress recently.</p>
<p>Of course, the R&amp;D costs were also substantial.</p>
<p>As for the story of the entire Modern Warfare series, Chen Xu planned to develop all three installments as a trilogy.</p>
<p>In his previous life, the Modern Warfare story was quite outstanding.</p>
<p>Unexpected suspense and twists, with an overall atmosphere leaning towards darkness and despair.</p>
<p>The entire Modern Warfare story wasn't a hymn to heroes but a brutal tale of military power, self-interest, and sacrifice.</p>
<p>However, in terms of story length, if any single installment of the trilogy was taken alone, its main campaign wouldn't be very long, not even exceeding 10 hours.</p>
<p>Such a short duration was far too brief for a major title.</p>
<p>But considering the trilogy's timeline and the switching of various characters, forcefully merging them into one might even create a sense of fragmentation.</p>
<p>So, Chen Xu ultimately decided to make three separate installments. However, this trilogy would be released as a bundle, allowing players to choose to purchase any single installment or buy all three directly as a bundle.</p>
<p>As for multiplayer mode, players could access online play by purchasing any single installment.</p>
