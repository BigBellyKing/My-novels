                <p>Chapter 218: Slow Burn (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>As Minecraft launched, countless players immediately entered the game to play.</p>
<p>However, soon many posts appeared online, expressing opinions on the game Minecraft.</p>
<p>First was the pixel art. Many players who had previously questioned Minecraft's pixel style completely changed their minds after truly entering the game.</p>
<p>Although it was pixelated, the materials weren't an eyesore, and with the added lighting and shadow effects, Minecraft might not be top-tier in terms of visuals, but it was definitely above the passing line.</p>
<p>The only thing players discussed more was building houses in the game.</p>
<p>Many players were encountering this type of game for the first time.</p>
<p>In fact, many players had never even played with building blocks/Lego toys.</p>
<p>Because, frankly, building blocks/Lego are quite luxurious toys. You might have thought only kids played with Lego, but later you realize it's mostly wealthy people. A small set of blocks starts at hundreds of Yuan, and more complex sets with more parts can cost thousands of Yuan.</p>
<p>It was precisely because of this that Minecraft's 'building blocks' gameplay made many people curious.</p>
<p>Of course, curiosity aside, players who could truly create beautiful houses in the game were, at present, extremely rare. For most players, they built what amounted to matchbox houses or dark rooms.</p>
<p>As for some Survival Mode players, they were even more straightforward. At first, they were eagerly collecting resources and building houses. But once the house was built, they'd look at it and think:</p>
<p>What the heck is this? Did I really build this ugly thing?</p>
<p>Quick, tear it down, it's too shameful!</p>
<p>And so, for these players, they embarked on an alternative Minecraft survival journey. Why build houses? Just find a large mountain, dig a hole, put down a bed, a crafting table, a storage chest, and then stick in a torch. When night fell, if they were afraid monsters might enter, couldn't they just seal off the entrance with the materials they had? At this stage, players officially became cavemen, entering the primitive society phase.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>After Minecraft launched, many game designers also paid close attention to its developments. But its overall performance could only be described as lukewarm.</p>
<p>While players gave Minecraft a lot of praise, it didn't seem to feel particularly stunning. This included the ratings, with Minecraft currently sitting at a score of 9.0.</p>
<p>This left many industry designers puzzled.</p>
<p>“Chen Xu’s Minecraft doesn’t feel very stunning!”</p>
<p>“What do you expect from a pixel-style game?”</p>
<p>“I feel like something’s off. It shouldn't be this simple building block game, right? Otherwise, Chen Xu’s promotion seems much higher than for Don't Starve, almost at the standard of a blockbuster game!”</p>
<p>“You’re right about that.”</p>
<p>“Could it be that Minecraft has deeper content?”</p>
<p>“Stop messing around, what kind of depth can a pixelated building block game have?”</p>
<p>As Minecraft’s Early Access trial launched, industry designers all felt it was strange. Especially as the Early Access trial period for Minecraft slowly passed, players did discover more gameplay elements, such as villages and livestock that could be domesticated. And some skilled players finally built something other than matchbox houses, constructing beautiful small duplex villas.</p>
<p>But overall, players’ evaluations of Minecraft were generally only acceptable to excellent. The game's popularity was also lukewarm, barely managing a 50-50 split with TengHua’s Voyage, relying solely on the Early Access topic.</p>
<p>It even felt inferior to the previous Don't Starve, which perplexed many industry designers. Meng Zuo, who had previously discussed with Chen Xu and decided to postpone The Wasteland, was now in his office, staring at Minecraft’s visuals, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Even though it launched five days early, could this game really have more tricks up its sleeve later on? After all, despite being an early access trial, players had already experienced its content. And five days, even for some AAA-tier blockbusters, would be enough to clear the story-driven playthrough.</p>
<p>Yet, this Minecraft was only lukewarm. Moreover, Meng Zuo felt that what Chen Xu had told him before didn't sound like a lie. As a game designer, and one with so many masterpieces under his belt, he didn't believe Chen Xu would misjudge a game's quality.</p>
<p>So what exactly made this game special?</p>
<p>In contrast to these designers with no vested interests, Zhu Yi, the lead designer for TengHua’s Voyage, let out a sigh of relief when he saw the online discussions about Minecraft's popularity.</p>
<p>Recently, for some unknown reason, he had an ominous premonition. After all, sandbox games were originally pioneered by Chen Xu. But from the current situation, Minecraft could only be considered a decent game. He had also tried it out and found it quite peculiar. He couldn’t say it was bad, as it was somewhat enjoyable, but he also couldn’t pinpoint exactly what made it good. It completely lacked any explosive highlights or attraction anchors. From a gameplay content perspective, Zhu Yi felt it shouldn't threaten Voyage's performance.</p>
<p>Thinking this, Zhu Yi couldn’t help but smile widely. Especially since NetDragon’s The Wasteland had retreated without a fight this time. Although they publicly stated it was delayed for polishing, everyone in the gaming industry knew better, didn't they? With Minecraft lukewarm and The Wasteland temporarily backing down, Zhu Yi had a premonition that sales were about to explode.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>Chen Xu wasn't greatly affected by all the various comments, calmly continuing to build structures. However, others at Nebula Games were somewhat impacted.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, current sales seem a bit pessimistic!” Qin Yi said.</p>
<p>“Yes, current pre-order sales are only 810,000,” Ruan Ningxue also said with some nervousness.</p>
<p>Although it was an Early Access pre-order, five days had passed, and there had been extensive promotion. 810,000 pre-order sales couldn't be described as particularly outstanding.</p>
<p>“Don’t panic, it’s all under control. And haven’t you all experienced the charm of Minecraft? There’s a big wave of promotion coming later,” Chen Xu walked over, glanced at the relevant backend data, and smiled.</p>
<p>Based on the current data, while Minecraft might appear lukewarm in terms of popularity, backend data wouldn't lie. Players’ time spent in the game had not only not decreased but had actually increased, indicating that the game’s popularity was steadily rising.</p>
<p>And this was normal, because Minecraft was a relatively slow-burn game. Unlike other games, you wouldn't feel particularly stunning on your first impression. But the more you played and the more you saw, the greater the sense of achievement and fun became.</p>
<p>Moreover, the promotion had only just begun! It was important to remember that when sandbox games first launched, players were still in the exploration phase, and the game’s fun had not yet been fully unearthed. In fact, players hadn't even experienced Minecraft’s true charm yet.</p>
<p>Chen Xu planned to release this part in the second phase of promotion. Experiencing Minecraft's gameplay firsthand, and then truly feeling its charm, would bring a completely different sense of impact. Where were we even at right now?</p>
