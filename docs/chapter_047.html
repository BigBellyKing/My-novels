                <p>Chapter 47: Hot Discussion Among Players and the Industry</p>
<p>In the early hours of October 31st, Chen Xu, on schedule, uploaded a pre-recorded video to his official Weibo account.</p>
<p>At the same time, he posted a message: Guess what the new game is?</p>
<p>Although it was the early hours of the morning, it must be said that at this time, there were still quite a few night owls among the players following Chen Xu's official Weibo account.</p>
<p>As soon as this message was posted, it quickly caught the attention of some players.</p>
<p>'What's happening? Look what I found? Chen Xu has a new game?'</p>
<p>'Damn, releasing news in the early hours, isn't that a bit... much?'</p>
<p>'Oh my god, what kind of video is this! Posting it late at night, I thought it was something good!'</p>
<p>'Wait, what the heck is this video! A horror game?'</p>
<p>'Damn, this DV art style is too grim!'</p>
<p>'So the next game, Chen Xu is making a horror game?'</p>
<p>'I don't really care about horror games, but the key is the timing, isn't this too grim!?'</p>
<p>'So the next game is related to DV?'</p>
<p>Many players were taken aback.</p>
<p>After all, Chen Xu's intention was quite obvious; this extremely grim video was clearly telling players that the next new work would be a horror game.</p>
<p>What players discussed even more was the timing of the announcement.</p>
<p>The next day, Chen Xu's Weibo post triggered numerous media reposts and reports.</p>
<p>After all, Chen Xu still had a bit of buzz left from winning the first prize in the Sci-Fi Game Design Competition with "To the Moon".</p>
<p>Furthermore, November was approaching, and there were no major blockbusters worth mentioning on the market yet.</p>
<p>As for Chen Xu's video, players discussed it animatedly, analyzing what theme his new game might have.</p>
<p>After all, even horror games have thematic classifications.</p>
<p>'There's a DV and it seems to be an indoor office, so it should be a modern setting.'</p>
<p>'Someone holding a DV is filming something, but the entire video is eerily silent, and considering the room in the video is very chaotic, we can boldly guess: Do ghosts only become visible through a DV?'</p>
<p>'Holding a DV, walking through dark corridors and rooms, and as they walk, a ghastly face appears on the DV screen, then pulls the filmer into a dark abyss!'</p>
<p>'MMP, a bunch of drama queens, there's nothing there, can we stop with the wild guesses? It's broad daylight and I'm getting chills!'</p>
<p>'You're too timid, giving up already? I advise you to wear a diaper when you play or watch it.'</p>
<p>'It's really too grim. I stumbled upon it past midnight yesterday, it didn't reveal anything, but I scared myself into thinking there was someone under the bed, and it kept me on edge for half the night.'</p>
<p>Players on the internet discussed animatedly, but it was mostly wild speculation, as Chen Xu's video only hinted to players that the next work would be a horror game.</p>
<p>However, the specific type had not yet been revealed.</p>
<p>Likewise, it wasn't just players; it also sparked heated discussions among game designers and media in the industry.</p>
<p>'Did you hear? Chen Xu's new work is actually a horror game!'</p>
<p>'It's a bit unexpected, I didn't think Chen Xu would choose horror games as his entry point.'</p>
<p>'But it's not too surprising. For small teams and independent game designers, horror games can be a relatively good point of entry.'</p>
<p>'Small team? Chen Xu isn't a small team. Haven't you seen the introduction to Nebula Games? Chen Xu's team isn't exactly small anymore.'</p>
<p>'It's normal, after all, "Undertale" and "To the Moon" both sold quite well.'</p>
<p>'But horror games are still quite niche. Let alone domestically, even internationally, there don't seem to be many outstanding horror games, right?'</p>
<p>'Yeah, although VR seems to fit horror games well, market and cost are still big issues.'</p>
<p>'I think Chen Xu's horror game might be like "hanging a sheep's head and selling dog meat" (a Chinese idiom meaning to sell something under false pretenses).'</p>
<p>'How so?'</p>
<p>'Look at "To the Moon" and "Undertale"; it's clear Chen Xu is a designer who is good at storytelling. So, is it possible that this so-called horror game is merely cloaked in a horror facade to tell a heartwarming story?'</p>
<p>'When you put it that way, it doesn't seem impossible. After all, didn't Chen Xu say he was a Warrior of Love before?'</p>
<p>'That makes sense!'</p>
<p>Game designers in the industry discussed Chen Xu and news of his new work.</p>
<p>However, for various gaming self-media outlets chasing traffic, it was a bit of a chaotic spectacle.</p>
<p>"Strange Video Released Late at Night, What Is Chen Xu's Intention?"</p>
<p>"From Heartwarming to Horrifying? Designer Chen Xu Switches to Horror Games!"</p>
<p>"Abandoning a Familiar Field, Trying Niche Horror Games, Confidence or Blindness?"</p>
<p>......</p>
<p>Reports flooded various websites and forums.</p>
<p>Some larger media websites were still able to maintain a degree of neutrality.</p>
<p>But for some marketing accounts and second- and third-tier small gaming media, it was all about setting the narrative.</p>
<p>This was mainly due to the type of game Chen Xu chose.</p>
<p>After all, the industry hadn't seen an excellent horror game in many years.</p>
<p>While the entire horror game industry wasn't quite a stagnant pool, it certainly lacked vitality.</p>
<p>Some horror games that sold reasonably well on the market were mostly IP series, and their annual sales were continuously declining.</p>
<p>The types of horror games were also incredibly diverse.</p>
<p>Domestic zombie and female ghost themes.</p>
<p>Foreign serial killer and demon themes.</p>
<p>Realistic, surreal.</p>
<p>It could be said there were all sorts of types.</p>
<p>But none of them sold particularly well.</p>
<p>This was mainly because these horror games hadn't broken out of a certain mold.</p>
<p>They still relied on a tight mode of jump scares, gunfights, and linear storytelling.</p>
<p>It wasn't that this mode was bad, but it was truly difficult to make it outstanding.</p>
<p>In his previous life, among the many games combining gunfights and horror, how many were truly memorable?</p>
<p>Essentially, only "Resident Evil" and "Dead Space" stood out. Of these two IPs, only the former could still be considered a top-tier IP, while the latter essentially died out until many years later, when EA ran out of old rice to fry and decided to bring it back to stir-fry again.</p>
<p>However, for Chen Xu and the entire Nebula Games team, these online discussions didn't have much impact.</p>
<p>Because the game's development progress was visibly increasing.</p>
<p>Although the game wasn't yet complete, some of its early content was already playable.</p>
<p>After experiencing it, Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue, along with others in the team, all had but one thought.</p>
<p>That was... "Damn it, this absolutely cannot be played at night!"</p>
<p>There was no helping it; it was simply too terrifying.</p>
<p>Even though everyone was involved in the game's development, and every aspect was created through their collective efforts.</p>
<p>That didn't mean they weren't scared!</p>
