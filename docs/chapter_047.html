                <h2>Chapter 47: Players and Industry Buzz</h2>
<p>In the early hours of October 31st, Chen Xu punctually uploaded a pre-recorded video to his official Weibo account.</p>
<p>He also posted a message: Guess what the new game is?</p>
<p>Though it was early morning, it must be said that among the players following Chen Xu's official Weibo account, there were quite a few night owls.</p>
<p>This message quickly caught the attention of some players after it was posted.</p>
<p>'What's going on? Look what I found? Chen Xu has a new game?'</p>
<p>'Damn, posting a message in the early morning, isn't that a bit...?'</p>
<p>'Oh my god, what kind of video is this! Posting it late at night, I thought it was something good!'</p>
<p>'Wait, what the heck is this video! A horror game?'</p>
<p>'Holy crap, this DV footage is so creepy!'</p>
<p>'So, Chen Xu's next game is going to be a horror game?'</p>
<p>'I don't really care about horror games or anything, the key is the timing, it's just too eerie!?'</p>
<p>'So the next game is related to DV?'</p>
<p>Many players were momentarily stunned.</p>
<p>After all, Chen Xu's intention was very clear; this incredibly creepy video was plainly telling players that his next new work would be a horror game.</p>
<p>However, what sparked even more discussion among players was the timing of the announcement.</p>
<p>The next day, Chen Xu's Weibo post was forwarded and reported by many media outlets.</p>
<p>After all, Chen Xu still had some residual buzz from winning first prize in the Game Design Competition with <em>To the Moon</em>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, November was just around the corner, and there were no major titles worth mentioning on the market at the moment.</p>
<p>Regarding Chen Xu's video, players also discussed and analyzed what theme his new game might have.</p>
<p>Even horror games have thematic classifications, after all.</p>
<p>'There's DV footage, and it seems to be an indoor office, so it looks like a modern setting.'</p>
<p>'Someone is holding a DV camera and filming something, but the entire video is eerily silent, and considering how messy the room in the video is, we can boldly guess if ghosts can only be seen with a DV camera?'</p>
<p>'Someone walking through dark corridors and rooms with a handheld DV, and then suddenly a ghostly face appears on the DV screen, pulling the cameraman into a dark abyss!'</p>
<p>'Damn it, you're all drama queens! There's nothing there, can we not make wild analyses? Watching it in broad daylight is giving me chills!'</p>
<p>'You're too timid, is that all it takes? I advise you to wear a diaper when you play or watch it later.'</p>
<p>'It's really too creepy. I scrolled past it in the early hours of yesterday morning. It didn't reveal anything, but I scared myself into thinking someone was under the bed, leaving me drained for half the night.'</p>
<p>Online players discussed it fervently, though most were various wild guesses, as Chen Xu's video merely hinted that the next work would be a horror game.</p>
<p>But the specific type had not yet been revealed.</p>
<p>Similarly, it wasn't just players; it also sparked heated discussions among industry designers and media outlets.</p>
<p>'Did you hear? Chen Xu's new work is actually a horror game!'</p>
<p>'It's a bit unexpected; I didn't think Chen Xu would choose horror as his entry point.'</p>
<p>'But it's not too surprising. For small teams and independent game designers, horror games can be a relatively easy entry point.'</p>
<p>'Small team? Chen Xu isn't a small team. Haven't you seen Nebula Games' introduction? Chen Xu's team isn't that small anymore.'</p>
<p>'That's normal, after all, <em>Undertale</em> and <em>To the Moon</em> both sold quite well.'</p>
<p>'But horror games are still quite niche. Let alone domestically, even internationally, there don't seem to be many outstanding horror games, right?'</p>
<p>'Yes, although VR and horror games seem to be a good match, the market and cost are huge problems.'</p>
<p>'I think Chen Xu's horror game might be like hanging a sheep's head to sell dog meat.'</p>
<p>'How so?'</p>
<p>'Look at <em>To the Moon</em> and <em>Undertale</em>; it's clear that Chen Xu is a designer who is good at storytelling. So, is it possible that this so-called horror game is merely cloaked in a layer of horror, and then tells a heartwarming story?'</p>
<p>'When you put it that way, it doesn't seem impossible. After all, didn't Chen Xu say he was a Warrior of Love before?'</p>
<p>'That makes sense!'</p>
<p>Game industry designers discussed Chen Xu and news of his new work.</p>
<p>However, for various game self-media outlets chasing traffic, it was a chaotic frenzy.</p>
<p><em>Late-Night Release of Eerie Video, What Is Chen Xu's Intent?</em></p>
<p><em>From Heartwarming to Horror? Designer Chen Xu Shifts to Horror Games!</em></p>
<p><em>Abandoning His Expertise to Try Niche Horror Games, Confidence or Blindness?</em></p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>Reports flooded various websites and forums.</p>
<p>Some larger media websites managed to maintain a relatively neutral stance.</p>
<p>But for some marketing accounts and second- and third-tier small game media, it was all about setting the narrative.</p>
<p>This was mainly due to Chen Xu's choice of game genre.</p>
<p>After all, the industry hadn't seen an excellent horror game in many years.</p>
<p>To say the entire horror game industry was a stagnant pool wouldn't be quite right, but it certainly lacked much vitality.</p>
<p>Most of the horror games that sold reasonably well on the market were basically IP series, and their annual sales were continuously declining.</p>
<p>And the types of horror games were equally diverse.</p>
<p>Domestic Chinese themes included zombies and female ghosts.</p>
<p>Foreign themes included serial killers and devils.</p>
<p>Realistic, surrealistic.</p>
<p>One could say there were all types.</p>
<p>But none of them managed to achieve massive sales.</p>
<p>Mainly because these horror games didn't break out of a certain mold.</p>
<p>They still employed a tight model of jump scares, shooting, and linear storytelling.</p>
<p>It's not that this model is bad, but making it truly brilliant is incredibly difficult.</p>
<p>In my previous life, among so many games combining gun combat and horror, how many managed to leave a lasting name?</p>
<p>Mostly just <em>Resident Evil</em> and <em>Dead Space</em>, and even among these two IPs, only the former can still be considered a top-tier IP, while the latter completely died out until years later, when EA had run out of old ideas to rehash, they brought it back for a quick re-fry.</p>
<p>However, for Chen Xu and the entire Nebula Games team, these online topics didn't have much impact.</p>
<p>Because the overall game development progress was visibly increasing.</p>
<p>Although the game was not yet complete, the initial content could already be experienced.</p>
<p>And after experiencing it, Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, and the rest of the team all had only one thought.</p>
<p>That is... this damn thing absolutely cannot be played at night!</p>
<p>There was no other way; it was simply too terrifying.</p>
<p>Even though everyone participated in the game's development, and every aspect was created through their collective effort.</p>
<p>But that didn't mean they weren't scared!</p>
