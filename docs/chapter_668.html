                <p>Chapter 667: Give Me Back My ‘Wife’! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>In this third world, the entirety of Columbia was engulfed in war.</p>
<p>Here, the People's Voice waged an all-out war against the higher-ups of Columbia Sky-City.</p>
<p>Witnessing the city ablaze with war, Elizabeth fell into confusion, for prior to this, she had sympathized with the rebels.</p>
<p>But everything now made her doubt her perceptions.</p>
<p>However, compared to the melancholic Elizabeth, Booker's thoughts were far simpler.</p>
<p>He comforted Elizabeth, and compared to the people of Columbia, at this moment, Booker was more concerned with how to get the First Lady Airship from Daisy's hands so he could take Elizabeth away from the sky-city.</p>
<p>But things were not smooth. When Booker found Daisy, she not only refused to help him but even tried to kill him, claiming he was an impostor Booker.</p>
<p>Because Daisy clearly understood that the Booker before her was not the Booker she knew.</p>
<p>Regardless, Booker had already become a propaganda symbol for their rebel army.</p>
<p>A dead Booker was clearly more advantageous than a living one.</p>
<p>By this time, the industrial district had completely fallen. Booker and Elizabeth fought their way to the corporate headquarters of industrial magnate Fink.</p>
<p>Here, Daisy had already killed Fink, and 'seemingly' intended to wipe out Fink's son as well.</p>
<p>"Holy crap? Big villain? You're done for!" Zhang Yi, seeing Daisy attempting to kill the little boy, immediately issued a death sentence notice to this NPC.</p>
<p>After all, this was an unwritten rule: whether in TV shows or games, characters who laid hands on children generally met a bad end.</p>
<p>To this day, Zhang Yi still remembered the troublesome players he encountered when he first went to Saint Denis while playing Red Dead Redemption.</p>
<p>Just as Zhang Yi had guessed, right when Daisy was about to wipe out Fink's son.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, to stop Daisy, ambushed her from behind and killed her with a pair of scissors.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, having killed for the first time, found it hard to accept. Covered in blood, she turned and ran into the First Lady Airship.</p>
<p>No matter how Booker tried to comfort her outside, Elizabeth remained silent until the airship started.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Yi noticed a very subtle detail: the coordinates originally displayed on the airship were for Paris.</p>
<p>After so many events, Booker had completely given up on bringing Elizabeth back to New York to complete his mission.</p>
<p>Instead, he wanted her to leave Columbia and go wherever she wished.</p>
<p>Just like Joel facing Ellie in The Last of Us.</p>
<p>Just then, the sound of a door opening came from behind him.</p>
<p>Elizabeth emerged from within, her eyes no longer holding innocence, but instead, a touch of sorrow.</p>
<p>She had changed into a blue dress, one her mother wore in life, and had cut off her long hair.</p>
<p>Looking at Elizabeth, transformed with a new appearance, Zhang Yi in the game couldn't help but feel a pang of heartache.</p>
<p>From a Lewd Person's perspective, Elizabeth with her new look seemed more alluring and mature.</p>
<p>Yet, he still preferred the earlier Elizabeth, dressed in white.</p>
<p>However, there wasn't much time for Zhang Yi and Booker in the game to lament.</p>
<p>Because at that moment, the cry of a strange monstrous bird rang out.</p>
<p>The Songbird had appeared in this third world, attacking them and forcing them to fall back into Columbia.</p>
<p>Finally, Booker and Elizabeth realized that no matter which world they were in, only by subduing the Songbird could they successfully leave Columbia Sky-City.</p>
<p>And then, the mysterious Lutece siblings appeared once more, giving Booker and Elizabeth new guidance.</p>
<p>That is, the method to control the Songbird was with Comstock.</p>
<p>Next, Booker and Elizabeth entered Comstock's location. Although the detection device mistakenly identified Elizabeth as the Prophetess, the fingerprint mismatch still prevented their entry.</p>
<p>So Elizabeth and Booker had no choice but to go to the graveyard, to use the First Lady's remains.</p>
<p>But here, Comstock had already set a trap; a powerful Siphon device drained most of Elizabeth's power, and a terrifying ghost of the First Lady was also created.</p>
<p>However, on normal difficulty, this was nothing for Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>What he cared about more was the game's story. After defeating the First Lady, who then vanished in a puff of smoke, Elizabeth and Booker hadn't yet recovered.</p>
<p>Yet, the elusive Lutece siblings appeared again, perfectly timed every single time, as if they had been watching them all along.</p>
<p>What made Zhang Yi feel even more eerie was that this pair of siblings was digging graves, and they were their own graves.</p>
<p>The Lutece siblings guided Elizabeth and Booker to search for the wife's memories from before her death, trying to help her regain her sanity.</p>
<p>And with this journey, combined with some information collected before and after,</p>
<p>The conspiracies and various truths behind Columbia's founding history were gradually unveiled.</p>
<p>It turned out that the siblings they had encountered multiple times before were not siblings at all.</p>
<p>The Lutece siblings were actually the same scientist, just different versions in two different worlds.</p>
<p>Just like the setting of Parallel World, constants and variables.</p>
<p>Lutece existed in both worlds, which was the constant.</p>
<p>But in one world, Lutece was male, and in another, Lutece was female – this was the variable.</p>
<p>Long ago, the female Lutece began researching quantum mechanics. With Comstock's help, she successfully elevated Columbia into the sky.</p>
<p>But what was different was that she also had a hidden discovery: the existence of Parallel Worlds.</p>
<p>Through quantum entanglement, Lutece discovered another version of herself in a Parallel World.</p>
<p>So after Columbia ascended, the female Lutece, with Comstock's strong support, continued her research.</p>
<p>And she also built a machine capable of temporarily creating spatial rifts.</p>
<p>This also earned Comstock the title of 'Prophet,' as his so-called prophecies were visions from other worlds.</p>
<p>And Elizabeth was the infant the Lutece siblings found for him, after his wife became infertile from prolonged use of the machine.</p>
<p>Because in his prophecy, his descendant would rule Columbia.</p>
<p>This child was Elizabeth. After Elizabeth arrived in Columbia, various spatial rifts also began to appear randomly throughout the city.</p>
<p>Some, by means of these spatial rifts, discovered the art of Parallel Worlds and became artists.</p>
<p>Others, through spatial rifts, discovered the technology of Parallel Worlds and built commercial empires.</p>
<p>Fink, from the industrial district, was one such person; even magical technologies like potions originated from the technology of Parallel Worlds.</p>
<p>However, what that world was truly like remained unknown.</p>
<p>Comstock's wife had originally believed Elizabeth to be her husband's illegitimate daughter, but after confronting Lutece, she learned that the so-called prophecies were all lies. Since the Prophetess herself was a devout fanatic, she wished to expose these falsehoods after discovering them.</p>
<p>But how could Comstock allow her to destroy his ideal nation?</p>
<p>So he directly strangled the Prophetess and framed a maid in their household.</p>
<p>And that person was Daisy, which in turn led to the birth of the rebel army.</p>
<p>At the same time, Lutece, due to Comstock, was blown up during an experiment.</p>
<p>But fortunately, their fragmented bodily remains, at that very instant, formed a peculiar existence through the power of quantum entanglement.</p>
<p>They were both dead, yet alive in another way, existing across various Parallel Worlds.</p>
<p>"Is this Schrödinger's Lutece!?" Zhang Yi couldn't help but quip. He had to admit, anything unresolvable could just be attributed to quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>After uncovering this series of great secrets, just as Booker and Elizabeth were preparing to head to Comstock's Mansion, they were once again attacked by the Songbird.</p>
<p>To protect Booker, this time Elizabeth willingly allowed herself to be captured by the Songbird and taken into the mansion.</p>
<p>This was the second separation of Booker and Elizabeth in the game.</p>
<p>"Damn it!"</p>
<p>Watching Elizabeth, tears streaming down her face, being taken away, and finding himself alone once again, Zhang Yi let out a "polite and gentle" greeting.</p>
<p>Unlike their previous separation, when Elizabeth had knocked him out with a wrench.</p>
<p>In the game, after experiencing so many stories.</p>
<p>Just like Joel and Ellie in The Last of Us, Zhang Yi's feelings for Elizabeth were now very deep.</p>
<p>Now he had only one thought: Give me back my wife!</p>
<p>There was nothing he could do; after all, BioShock Infinite wasn't a realistic style game, but leaned towards a cartoon art style.</p>
