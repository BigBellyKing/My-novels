                <h1>Chapter 255: Happy Players (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h1>
<p>Of course, it wasn't just the Long Sword.</p>
<p>Almost all attacks in the game could interrupt teammates' output, and truthfully, the Long Sword's actual damage wasn't that high.</p>
<p>The Hammer's Uppercut and Home Run, and the Gunlance's Wyvern's Fire, could send a Hunter flying directly into the sky.</p>
<p>However, while these weapons had strong offensive power, their AOE range was relatively small.</p>
<p>But the Long Sword's Spirit Roundslash was absolutely devastating!</p>
<p>If it were just the final Spirit Roundslash, players might tolerate it, as it was just a single strike.</p>
<p>But the key issue was that for most players, they didn't understand much about the weapon mechanics in the game.</p>
<p>Especially the difference in output between a Long Sword with and without its Spirit Gauge active, it was like night and day. Yet, most players didn't know how to use Foresight Slash to activate it. They either chained Reaching Slash into Spirit Roundslash throughout the fight, or slowly charged their energy bar to use a 'clumsy' Spirit Gauge activation.</p>
<p>When the Long Sword swung, it felt like a five-meter radius around the player was scorched earth.</p>
<p>This directly led to Long Sword players becoming somewhat isolated.</p>
<p>After all, if the Bow's wide-range Arc Shot interrupted teammates, you could just choose not to use it. If the Light Bowgun's mines were a problem, you could just maneuver around teammates. Gunlance and Hammer users could also generally avoid hitting allies.</p>
<p>But the Long Sword's Roundslash had an absurd range!</p>
<p>One Spirit Roundslash, and three teammates were on their knees.</p>
<p>In the early stages, most people didn't understand the relevant attributes, and even if they did, there wasn't much they could do. After all, there were no Flinch Free Decorations or Rocksteady Mantle in the early game.</p>
<p>And so...</p>
<p>Even though the game had just launched, the standing of Long Sword players in pick-up teams took a nosedive.</p>
