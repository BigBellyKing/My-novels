                <p>Chapter 252: Players' Strong Demands (Sixth Update, Requesting Subscriptions)</p>
<p>Looking at the prompt in front of him, Zhang Yi then saw the game automatically exit and return to the starting UI interface.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was completely bewildered. He was just getting into it, and it was over? Even if it was a Beta Version, this was too short!</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was utterly speechless; this sudden stop was just too much!</p>
<p>The story itself was fine.</p>
<p>To be honest, up until now, Zhang Yi hadn't paid too much attention to the story of Monster Hunter: World.</p>
<p>So far, he only knew a few things: the Elder Dragons were migrating, the Hunter's Guild had come to investigate its secrets, and a new Fleet arrived every ten years, with 50 years having passed since the protagonist's arrival.</p>
<p>The Investigation Team Leader was still the Commander's grandson who remained in the New World.</p>
<p>As for anything else? He knew nothing.</p>
<p>But the crucial point was that the first half of this Demo Content primarily taught players about the game's content and various systems.</p>
<p>For instance, combat, gathering materials, hunting methods, and weapon introductions.</p>
<p>After players understood these, they basically wanted to go on a hunt themselves.</p>
<p>And in the game, they indeed did so.</p>
<p>Jagras, Crown-Horned Dragon, Great Jagras – three consecutive different battles, even including a BOSS battle.</p>
<p>It could be said that this demo experience was actually quite complete.</p>
<p>But the key issue was that it was just too fun!</p>
<p>Especially regarding the Combat Content, the difficulty in the game wasn't high, allowing every player to easily get the hang of it.</p>
<p>At the same time, because they had just started playing, they weren't yet very familiar with weapon skills and combos.</p>
<p>Many players, after experiencing the BOSS battle with the Great Jagras, felt they had gained a deeper understanding of the weapon they chose.</p>
<p>They were very eager to challenge new monsters and also test their own abilities.</p>
<p>But now?! The climax was gone?!</p>
<p>Soon after, the voices of Song Ren, Wang Han, and others gradually appeared in the voice channel.</p>
<p>“Damn, it’s over just like that? I’m not satisfied yet! I only got to use the Long Sword’s Helm Breaker a few times!” Song Ren said, extremely frustrated, in the voice channel.</p>
<p>“Yeah! It’s too short, I haven’t even figured out how to use this Hammer yet!” Wang Han also said, feeling very annoyed.</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah!” Wang Yifan and Joey echoed.</p>
<p>All of them shared the same feeling: they hadn't had enough fun before it suddenly ended.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>While Zhang Yi and the others were discussing, the official Monster Hunter: World community forums were already overrun by agitated players.</p>
<p>There was nothing they could do; it was just too frustrating.</p>
<p>The game, right at its most exciting point, suddenly cut off.</p>
<p>Who could possibly endure that?!</p>
<p>Countless people were @-mentioning Chen Xu's official Weibo account and Nebula Games' community, all expressing the same sentiment.</p>
<p>They hoped Monster Hunter: World could be launched early, as the Demo Content suggested it was already quite complete.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if it wasn't finished yet, for a game of this scale, there would only be a week between the Demo Content and the official launch. Could there really be any fundamental changes in such a short time?</p>
<p>So the answer was simple: Monster Hunter: World had already been completed.</p>
<p>However, while players petitioned, many also understood that the launch time wouldn't change.</p>
<p>They were just letting off some steam.</p>
<p>Therefore, the fervor surrounding the abrupt end of the Beta Version came and went quickly.</p>
<p>However, the quality of Monster Hunter: World's Beta Version became a topic of widespread discussion among players.</p>
<p>Throughout the game's hunting process, many players found it very enjoyable and felt a strong sense of immersion.</p>
<p>For example, after being injured, the Great Jagras wouldn't foolishly continue fighting players.</p>
<p>Instead, it would try to escape.</p>
<p>If it accidentally got away, and enough information hadn't been gathered beforehand.</p>
<p>Then they would need to continue investigating the clues it left behind to successfully track it.</p>
<p>At the same time, there were many interactive environmental traps throughout the game.</p>
<p>For example, in the Jagras's den during the first hunt, there were many Flashflies, resembling fireflies.</p>
<p>If these Flashflies were triggered, any nearby monsters that looked directly at them.</p>
<p>Those monsters would then fall into a stunned state.</p>
<p>There were also many plants in the game.</p>
<p>For instance, vines could entangle monsters, allowing players a few seconds of free damage.</p>
<p>In Monster Hunter: World, every creature possessed a unique characteristic.</p>
<p>Just like the game's subtitle, “World.”</p>
<p>It gave players a strong sense of realism.</p>
<p>As if in a Parallel World, in some universe, such a real world truly existed.</p>
<p>After killing a monster, its body wouldn't immediately disappear, but would remain in place.</p>
<p>There was also a creature called the Hatebird that would come to eat these corpses.</p>
<p>Of course, players could also capture them.</p>
<p>The New World was teeming with various plants that could be gathered and ores that could be mined.</p>
<p>The novel worldview, peculiar creatures, and rich combat system made many players feel incredibly refreshed.</p>
<p>If there was one thing that left players dissatisfied, it was the difficulty.</p>
<p>Each mission had an exceptionally long time limit of 50 minutes, and 3 opportunities for Carting.</p>
<p>But when playing, it felt completely unnecessary.</p>
<p>As for Carting? Many players felt it was almost impossible.</p>
<p>The Palico drew aggro, they carried so many healing potions, and there were also some unique environmental supplies built into the game.</p>
<p>For example, collecting honey to make large healing potions, honey fruit growing on some vines, and even Palicoes would call honey bugs to deliver honey fruit.</p>
<p>It felt like dying was a difficult task.</p>
<p>Many players had the feeling of “I haven't even gotten serious yet, and you're already over.”</p>
<p>To that end, many players also offered various suggestions under Chen Xu's official Weibo account.</p>
<p>“Strongly suggest Mr. Chen to increase the difficulty in Monster Hunter: World later on.”</p>
<p>“Yeah! The current difficulty is too easy!”</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, don't underestimate us. For those of us tempered by Dark Souls, we're absolutely top-notch!”</p>
<p>“Exactly!”</p>
<p>Some casual players also agreed.</p>
<p>Because even they felt that the game's difficulty seemed a bit too low.</p>
<p>Facing the suggestions put forth by these players, Chen Xu didn't remain silent as he had when players petitioned for the game to be launched quickly.</p>
<p>Instead, he gave a very clear reply.</p>
<p>“Everyone, please rest assured. The difficulty balance in Monster Hunter: World has been strictly controlled by me and the development team. The difficulty will be introduced gradually, and as game content continuously progresses, players will also unlock new difficulties, featuring Tempered monsters—beings that have endured countless battles—using Nebula Games' latest AI technology. Therefore, whether you are a casual player or one seeking hardcore challenges, I believe you will find satisfaction in the New World.”</p>
<p>Following Chen Xu's official Weibo post, many players were very satisfied.</p>
<p>However, Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, and others within Nebula Games looked at Chen Xu with a slight change in their gaze.</p>
<p>That statement, indeed, contained no lies.</p>
<p>But these Tempered monsters, and the so-called gradual progression, might deviate slightly from what you players expect.</p>
<p>Looking at the jubilant players online, Qin Yi and the others couldn't help but sigh with emotion.</p>
