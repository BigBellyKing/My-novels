                <p>Chapter 152: Players' Complaints (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>As a thread-based game, the scale of <em>It Takes Two</em> was considerable. But the entire process, not counting repeatedly playing various mini-games, was approximately 12 hours.</p>
<p>And as the first batch of players cleared the game, the content within the game also sparked a lot of discussion.</p>
<p>‘Honestly, this should be the most interesting game of the year so far, right!?’</p>
<p>‘Agreed, and I think it's not just this year; this is definitely one of the most interesting games in recent years. And if we narrow it down to two-player co-op, I think it can definitely be ranked first!’</p>
<p>‘+1, I feel like this game is just mind-blowingly cool! Every level has a different theme, and there are special items, it's just incredible!’</p>
<p>‘Exactly, it's like watching an animated movie!’</p>
<p>‘The most crucial thing is that the gameplay is so rich! From the first level to the last, the various items and level designs are simply amazing.’</p>
<p>‘Haha, exactly! I had so much fun playing with my girlfriend! This time, Chen Xu really wasn't kidding!’</p>
<p>‘Indeed! The Warrior of Love has finally made a heartwarming game this time!’</p>
<p>‘Yes, watching the story till the end truly brought out many emotions.’</p>
<p>‘Exactly, exactly! Especially the ending, which showed all the items encountered, it was just fantastic.’</p>
<p>‘However, the part in the middle where Little Cutie was destroyed, that plot point really made my heart ache.’</p>
<p>‘Indeed, that part almost made my girlfriend withdraw and stop playing.’</p>
<p>‘Damn, you're playing with your girlfriend!’</p>
<p>‘But seriously, doesn't anyone remember the Rhinoceros Beetle in the Big Tree? You promised it nectar, so why was the beehive blown up!?’</p>
<p>‘2333333, you mentioning it reminded me, I totally forgot! Rhinoceros Beetle, the most tragic character!’</p>
<p>‘Haha, the forgotten Rhinoceros Beetle, when you put it that way, it really is quite tragic.’</p>
<p>‘Rhinoceros Beetle: Heh heh, I might not be human, but you guys are real dogs! Just a tool, huh?’</p>
<p>On various related forum communities, many players who experienced <em>It Takes Two</em> were captivated by the game.</p>
<p>Regarding the overall content of the game, almost all players uniformly gave positive reviews for its gameplay.</p>
<p>On the Nebula Games Platform, <em>It Takes Two</em>'s player rating reached as high as 9.8 points.</p>
<p>As for some players who gave negative reviews, aside from some who were just playing on memes, most of them focused on the game's only controversial plot point.</p>
<p>That was the part in the game where Cody and May thought their daughter Rose's tears were the antidote.</p>
<p>So they forcibly destroyed Little Cutie.</p>
<p>Many players expressed that this segment of the plot made them very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>After all, Elephant Princess Little Cutie in the game was truly harmless.</p>
<p>So innocent and cute, yet she was ruined by May and Cody.</p>
<p>This made it difficult for people to accept.</p>
<p>Many players sided with their daughter Rose and the toys like Little Cutie, feeling that Cody and May, as parents, were simply too awful.</p>
<p>Just like the space ape, as toys they knew how to keep Rose from being sad, but Cody and May, as Rose's parents, tried to make Rose sad.</p>
<p>However, some players expressed understanding for Cody and May.</p>
<p>After all, from the perspective of the plot and characters, May and Cody suddenly turned from humans into puppets and clay dolls; how could they remain calm?</p>
<p>Believing they had found the right method, they would certainly pursue that goal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they didn't actually want to harm Rose; they just wanted to make the child cry.</p>
<p>Which parents in real life haven't made their child cry? To conclude from this alone that Cody and May don't love their child is completely unreasonable.</p>
<p>After all, from the dialogue in the game, it's clear that May works outside, often doing overtime, but still remembers her daughter's dentist appointment.</p>
<p>And although Cody is a stay-at-home dad, even though he forgot to take Rose to the dentist at the start, he is truly very concerned about Rose; the Lego toy castle in the game was built by Cody for his daughter.</p>
<p>If there's anything wrong with Cody and May, it's their ‘self-righteousness,’ whether facing their partner or their child.</p>
<p>That is their biggest problem.</p>
<p>Of course, this was just a debate among a portion of players who focused on the plot setting.</p>
<p>There was also another group of more serious players whose focus wasn't on this aspect.</p>
<p>“Speaking of which, did no one notice Rose? Don't you think, if you look at this game from a different perspective, a joyful game instantly turns into a thrilling horror game!”</p>
<p>“Haha, when you think about it that way, it really is! Parents mysteriously fall into an unawakable sleep, supernatural occurrences frequently happen at home. What exactly is the reason behind all of this? Stay tuned for tonight's <em>Approaching Science</em> program!”</p>
<p>‘The daughter is at home, perfectly fine, then the vacuum cleaner suddenly explodes, the toolbox breaks, the beloved Little Cutie toy falls from nowhere, the cuckoo clock self-repairs, the withered flowers in the garden suddenly revive, and eerie sounds come from the gramophone in the second-floor mezzanine, holy cow! It's utterly terrifying when you think about it deeply!’</p>
<p>‘That's enough, you guys! It was originally such a joyful game, but you've made me get goosebumps just talking about it!’</p>
<p>And besides these in-game contents, the out-of-game experience also attracted many complaints from players.</p>
<p>The game's theme is fixing a marital relationship, the characters in the game are a husband and wife, and the game type is two-player co-op.</p>
<p>Moreover, being a game announced on Valentine's Day, it was clearly labeled as a couple's game.</p>
<p>But the problem was, where are there so many couples?</p>
<p>Or rather, many players, let alone young ladies, even quite a few solo players were single!</p>
<p>Additionally, <em>It Takes Two</em> itself, as an adventure game, not only required tacit cooperation but also had some demands on player control in certain levels.</p>
<p>Thus, the online trend began to shift a bit.</p>
<p>At first, everyone was praising the game's level design and the combination of its thematic art style and story.</p>
<p>But after two or three days, as more and more people cleared the game, all sorts of strange complaints began to emerge.</p>
<p>And these complaints gained considerable approval from many players.</p>
<p>Major game forums and the game's own review sections were filled with comments like these.</p>
<p>‘An incredibly valuable game, priced at 146 Yuan, no worse than a blockbuster title. My only regret is that I don't have a young lady to play with!’</p>
<p>‘It's simply a masterpiece, but I found my wife too bad at it, so I dumped her and played with my bro for two days. Brothers, do you think I did the right thing?’</p>
<p>‘The game is good, it's just a shame the title isn't quite accurate. Others play <em>It Takes Two</em>, but I play <em>Male Bonding Takes Two</em>.’</p>
<p>‘Help! I played this game with a good bro from my dorm, and now he looks at me a little strangely, and he insists on pulling me along every time he showers!’</p>
