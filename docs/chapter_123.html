                <p>Chapter 123: As Expected</p>
<p>Online players held differing opinions, and the debate quickly escalated from text to video.
Player videos of "Dark Souls" began to circulate, including live streams from streamers who started playing "Dark Souls" immediately.</p>
<p>Some players released battle videos of the first BOSS, Gundyr the Ash, which differed from the actual gameplay demonstration video shown at the online promotional launch event.
In these videos, Gundyr the Ash appeared utterly formidable.
His halberd spun and twirled, and with a player's scream, directly emptied their health bar.
It perfectly demonstrated what "horrible to behold" truly meant.</p>
<p>Besides these, there were also videos of players being flattened by Crystal Lizards, and the Uchigatana Guy instantly killing them with an Iai combo slash.
However, before these types of videos could fully ferment, other players began uploading new ones.</p>
<p>Again, it was a confrontation with Gundyr the Ash.
But the performance was completely different from before.
A character in the game, clad in Knight's armor, wielding a shield in one hand and a sword in the other.
Facing Gundyr the Ash's slash, the left hand holding the shield lightly flicked up.
It directly parried Gundyr the Ash's weapon, followed by an immediate execution.
Throughout the entire process, including the second phase, Gundyr the Ash didn't manage to land a single hit.
He was, in effect, completely toyed with.</p>
<p>The same BOSS, yet completely different results.
This instantly left players bewildered.
What was going on? Was this game difficult or not?</p>
<p>It was the same on live streaming platforms; some streamers cried and screamed as they died.
But there were also streamers who, having just left Cemetery of Ash, were toying with Gundyr the Ash, the Uchigatana Guy, and the Lothric Knight.</p>
<p>Of course, what rookie players didn't realize was that whether it was videos or streamers, while some truly were gifted players,
a considerable portion had actually practiced for a long time beforehand, or had died countless times and gained experience.
These numerous examples, coupled with the game having just launched, created an information gap for many players, preventing a unified understanding. This, in turn, made even more players curious.
What kind of game was this, after all?</p>
<p>Some players indeed drew parallels to the earlier "Outlast."
They felt that someone was trying to pull off something big.
However, this only made them more curious.
After all, people are naturally curious about the unknown, and this was just a game.
Moreover, "Dark Souls" didn't seem to be a horror game like "Outlast."
One might be afraid to step through the asylum gates in "Outlast," but could one really be afraid to Link the Fire in "Dark Souls"?
With this thought in mind,
countless players eagerly jumped into the "Dark Souls" trap.</p>
<p>Subsequently, these players who entered the game a second wave were completely dumbfounded.
Just like the initial batch of players,
these new players encountering "Dark Souls" for the second time immediately felt the game's deep malice.
Despite the in-game messages and death footage left by veteran players,
countless players still experienced during their gameplay how this was a game where they could die so thoroughly and satisfyingly.</p>
<p>Looking at the tall, burly Gundyr the Ash, and recalling the cool scene in the video demonstration where Gundyr was effortlessly defeated in a few punches and kicks,
only when it was their turn did they discover they were cut down like chopping vegetables.</p>
<p>As for the Fire Keeper, who had made their hearts itch with anticipation from online videos, there was even less to say.
To meet her, they had to defeat Gundyr the Ash!
Otherwise, they wouldn't even be able to touch the bronze gate of Firelink Shrine.</p>
<p>High difficulty, no mini-map, insidious and malicious level design.
Many players who were initially attracted instantly joined the ranks of those complaining bitterly.
"I'm done! This game is too hard!"
"Why are there no difficulty options? Why no mini-map?"
"Those who said this game was easy, don't your consciences hurt?!"
"Died 10 times in 1 hour, heaven knows how I managed it!"
"I eagerly expected a hack-and-slash game, but now you're telling me I'm the grass being cut?"</p>
<p>In Nebula Games' office.
Although it was the National Day holiday, the core development members of the entire project largely stayed in the company voluntarily to work overtime.
After all, "Dark Souls" was Nebula Games' first major project, and everyone was very concerned about its trajectory.
Of course, another reason was the very high overtime pay and benefits, which made everyone willing to work extra hours.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, in the game community, the company's official Weibo, and your official Weibo, many players are discussing the difficulty of Dark Souls!" Qin Yi from the project team expressed some concern.
"Yes, will the game be updated with a difficulty selection system later?"
"And a mini-map,"
Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin also added in the office.</p>
<p>"The game's systems and difficulty don't need to be changed, and it's too early to draw conclusions now," Chen Xu said with a smile, then turned to the Customer Service Department and asked, "What about the relevant data?"</p>
<p>"Data from third-party platforms cannot be compiled yet, but on the Nebula Games Platform, as of now, the game has sold 495,721 copies within 24 hours of launch. Only 24,916 copies have been refunded; four percent of players cited the game being too difficult as the reason, while the other six percent had various other reasons."</p>
<p>After all, it was Nebula Games' first major production, and it had been continuously promoted and warmed up for some time.
Coupled with Nebula Games' previous reputation, a first-day sales volume of nearly 500,000 copies was not particularly surprising.
At the same time, due to discount coupons, most players chose to make their purchases on the Nebula Games Platform.
Regarding refunds, "Dark Souls" indeed had a higher number compared to typical games.
However, this was also within Chen Xu's expectations; in fact, the refund rate for "Dark Souls" was even lower than that of "Outlast" back then.</p>
<p>Is "Dark Souls" a game suitable for everyone?
Clearly not.
Or rather, no game is truly "suitable for everyone."
Because gaming is a very personal experience.
Some people find AAA-tier games fun, some prefer mobile games, and others enjoy web games.
So, what game one likes ultimately depends on the player's personal preference.</p>
<p>Yet, "Dark Souls" is definitely a game that, as long as players calm down and immerse themselves, they can feel its charm.
The game's overall high difficulty is intimately connected to everything else.
The design of BOSS levels, the map design, the combat system within the game, and even the art design.
All of these are tightly linked.
If the game's difficulty were to be lowered, it would be akin to breaking a link in a chain, causing the entire chain to snap.
This would be counterproductive.</p>
<p>Furthermore, compared to the comments from players online,
as the game's developer, Chen Xu could understand the true situation of "Dark Souls" more clearly through the backend server data.
Currently, it was much better than Chen Xu had previously imagined.
And besides those complaining, there were also many players speaking up for the game.
It was currently in a 40-60 split mode, and more crucially, the players' online duration had not continuously declined.
In fact, seventy percent of the first batch of players had already played beyond the 2-hour refund period.
This was quite unexpected for Chen Xu.
Clearly, the M attribute of players in this Parallel World was higher than he had predicted during his previous market research!</p>
<p>These data also completely reassured Chen Xu.
All that remained was time, allowing the fragrance of "Dark Souls" – this fine wine – to slowly spread.
Thus enabling more players to savor the aroma of this exquisite game.
Of course, during this period, some appropriate guidance would also be necessary.
Otherwise, it would still affect "Dark Souls'" performance.</p>
