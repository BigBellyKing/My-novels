                <p>Chapter 222: Official Launch (Seventh Update, Seeking Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>While players were discussing online how the piano from before was made in Minecraft, three days had once again passed.</p>
<p>Chen Xu released another video.</p>
<p>The content of the video was very simple: "How to Build a Fully Functional Calculator in Minecraft."</p>
<p>Looking at the calculator and its components, all constructed from pixel blocks, and the final demonstration of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, players who had thought the previous piano was exaggerated could only admit that there was no most exaggerated, only <em>more</em> exaggerated.</p>
<p>Calculators are not uncommon; many games even have built-in calculator items.</p>
<p>But the key is that those games have them pre-programmed.</p>
<p>In the Minecraft video Chen Xu released, this entire thing was built by himself.</p>
<p>Didn't that mean they could also do it in the game?</p>
<p>From the release of the first video until now, the popularity of Minecraft was frighteningly immense. It could be said that it had captured the attention of the entire gaming industry.</p>
<p>Indeed, any player who was still connected to the internet and visited gaming communities would, to some extent, know about this game.</p>
<p>"Holy cow, holy cow, is this a 'savvy move' every three days?"</p>
<p>"This game can be played like this? My mind is completely blown!"</p>
<p>"It seems the original promotional trailer wasn't lying at all! The only limit to gameplay is the player's imagination!"</p>
<p>"Absolutely phenomenal! I must make one too when it comes out!"</p>
<p>"Honey, don't brag, Mommy's scared! That volume just looks terrifying to me; I'll give you a hundred years to do it!"</p>
<p>"Damn it, male Mommy, get lost! Don't look down on people; when I figure out the principle, I'm definitely going to grind one out!"</p>
<p>"It's incredible; if you can make a calculator in the game, why not a computer?"</p>
<p>Accompanying these four new videos, countless players expressed their amazement.</p>
<p>However, what the players didn't know was that it was indeed possible to build a computer in this game.</p>
<p>In fact, if a player's computer specifications were sufficient, it would even be possible to play Minecraft <em>within</em> Minecraft.</p>
<p>Of course, such a requirement was too high.</p>
<p>But building a computer that could play Snake, input Chinese characters, and play Minesweeper was certainly possible.</p>
<p>As for why it wasn't done, it was mainly because the demonstrations of the piano and calculator were already sufficient.</p>
<p>Choosing these as promotional videos, besides showcasing the charm and potential of Minecraft to players, also had specific directions.</p>
<p>The "Along the River During the Qingming Festival" and Forbidden City models, needless to say, were purely to show players what could be achieved with Minecraft's seemingly simple block-building gameplay.</p>
<p>The subsequent piano performance and calculator were to let players understand the extent to which Redstone technology could be used in the game.</p>
<p>Similarly, Chen Xu naturally had a special guide for this fifth video.</p>
<p>That was to make players understand that Minecraft was not just a block-building game, nor was it an adventure RPG game.</p>
<p>Amidst the anticipation of countless players, the fifth video was officially launched.</p>
<p>And this time, the content displayed was an amusement park.</p>
<p>A series of complex tracks, with countless pixelated figures sitting in carts, enjoying the thrill of a roller coaster.</p>
<p>In the southwest corner, a carousel and a Ferris wheel were operating.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the central area of the amusement park, there was a giant maze built using Redstone technology. Every so often, the maze would irregularly transform, and countless pixelated figures were playing mini-games involving clearing levels inside.</p>
<p>On the water, there was also an obstacle course, much like the variety show obstacle courses in Fall Guys, where many players were competing.</p>
<p>The gameplay was still Minecraft's inherent mechanics, but through building structures and Redstone technology mechanisms, it presented a completely different gaming experience.</p>
<p>Players could play Hide and Seek, race on tracks, and there was even a circulating car track where players sat and shot at moving targets with bows and arrows.</p>
<p>Amidst the exclamations and fervent discussions of countless players,</p>
<p>the time also arrived at New Year's Eve, the very last day.</p>
<p>On this day, the video Chen Xu released was somewhat different from the previous ones.</p>
<p>It wasn't a display of advanced skills or fresh content.</p>
<p>Instead, it was a New Year's Celebration Video produced using Minecraft content.</p>
<p>There was nothing new in the video; it merely made some changes to the content of previous videos.</p>
<p>In "Along the River During the Qingming Festival," the banks of the Bian River were enveloped in a festive Spring Festival atmosphere, with fireworks blooming and river lanterns flowing.</p>
<p>It was still the Forbidden City, but this time it was filled with numerous NPC figures, bustling with excitement.</p>
<p>The piano was still playing, but it wasn't the melancholic "To Liva"; instead, it was a cheerful New Year's song.</p>
<p>Finally, the video shifted to the amusement park. Amidst the fireworks, the camera zoomed in on the blocky figures in the amusement park, and then each blocky figure displayed their respective names or codenames.</p>
<p>They were all employees of Nebula Games.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>On New Year's Day, after Chinese New Year's Eve, Minecraft officially launched.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, TengHua's "Voyage" ultimately chose to be delayed.</p>
<p>The old excuse was given: hoping to further polish the game, thus making the difficult decision to delay its launch.</p>
<p>In the past, announcing a launch date and then delaying it would surely have provoked a torrent of abuse from players.</p>
<p>But this time, it barely caused a ripple.</p>
<p>Because all players' attention was focused on Minecraft.</p>
<p>On New Year's Day, Minecraft was officially unlocked.</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>At Zhang Yi's home in the Imperial Capital, after visiting relatives and exchanging New Year's greetings, he, like most impatient players bombarded by the previous videos, immediately returned home to experience Minecraft.</p>
<p>His hands were simply itching to play!</p>
<p>Those previous videos had completely ignited his creative inspiration.</p>
<p>He logged into the game, and then Zhang Yi discovered something.</p>
<p>Wang Han, Song Ren, Wang Yifan, and Joey were all online!</p>
<p>"Everyone's here!?" Zhang Yi entered the voice channel, and then he heard a cacophony of shouts.</p>
<p>"We were just talking about you! Old Zhang, haven't you two met each other's parents yet?" Song Ren chimed in.</p>
<p>"Visiting on the fourth day! Hurry up and get into the game, I'll pull you in. You wouldn't believe how beautiful and stunning it is! Mr. Chen actually set up a dedicated server; we can even visit the previous 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' and Forbidden City, and there are even scenes that weren't demonstrated in the videos!" Wang Han said excitedly.</p>
<p>"Wait, I'll be there right away!" Hearing this, Zhang Yi also felt a surge of excitement.</p>
<p>He could actually experience it in the game?</p>
<p>That was too amazing!</p>
<p>He clicked on the game; it needed an update, and it was quite large.</p>
<p>Fortunately, his home internet speed was very fast.</p>
<p>After entering the game, Zhang Yi quickly noticed that this was different from previous experiences!</p>
<p>For example, when entering the game now, after the Nebula Games logo flashed by, the opening animation had changed.</p>
<p>Accompanied by a sun slowly rising over the eastern horizon.</p>
<p>Under the sunlight, the beach, green grass, lush mountains, and forests looked incredibly beautiful.</p>
<p>Then Steve walked on the beach, and the surrounding space continuously changed.</p>
<p>He traversed from the beach to the banks of the Bian River a thousand years ago, experiencing the scenery and human customs of that era.</p>
<p>The next moment, he arrived at the magnificent and grand Forbidden City.</p>
<p>Afterward, he rested briefly before the bonfire in the Firelink Shrine.</p>
<p>Then, some scenes Zhang Yi didn't recognize flashed by one by one, before Steve arrived at the amusement park to play.</p>
<p>Finally, the sun slowly set, and the screen returned to the scene of the Bian River banks. Countless Kongming lanterns twinkled in the sky, forming the characters for "Minecraft."</p>
<p>At the same time, the game's UI interface had also changed. It was no longer the previous island, but a painted pleasure boat on the Bian River.</p>
<p>Along the river's edge corresponded items like 'Start Game' and 'Options.'</p>
<p>But before he could finish looking, Wang Han sent him an invitation from the friends list, asking if he wanted to join her server.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Zhang Yi directly confirmed.</p>
<p>Accompanied by the loading black screen, Zhang Yi's heart was filled with anticipation.</p>
<p>He also had a plan.</p>
<p>That was to learn from it.</p>
<p>He certainly couldn't build "Along the River During the Qingming Festival."</p>
<p>But he intended to take a good look at the residential houses within "Along the River During the Qingming Festival" and build one himself later!</p>
