                <p>Chapter 309: We Are a Professional Counter-Terrorism Team! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>After completing the new player tutorial, everyone's level was only one.</p>
<p>Currently, only quick play was available.</p>
<p>It randomly selected one of three modes: Bomb, Hostage, or Secure Area Mode (point capture).</p>
<p>It adopted a best-of-four format, with two rounds of attacking and defending alternating. If the score was 2:2, a tie-breaker would be played.</p>
<p>Systems like the ranked system were already in place, and regular matchmaking also calculated hidden MMR and team scores according to the ranked system's mechanics, allowing players to be matched with equally skilled opponents.</p>
<p>However, since everyone was completely new to the game, there was no need to enable the ranked mode yet.</p>
<p>As for the Recruit Mode, specifically prepared for new players in the previous world, it was clearly not needed at the moment, as all players were rookies.</p>
<p>After the game had been operating for some time, the Recruit Mode would be launched to separate veteran players from those who had just entered the game.</p>
<p>Clicking "matchmake", it took almost only a second for Song Ren and his team to enter the game.</p>
<p>"The other team seems to be a five-person party queue too!" Zhang Yi exclaimed, looking at the IDs of the five opponents on the game interface.</p>
<p>Moreover, these five opponents clearly looked like people with very fast hand speeds.</p>
<p>Because their five names were very specific; if one didn't have extremely fast hand speed and internet speed, it would be impossible to register such names.</p>
<p>The five IDs were: ASD, QWE, ZXC, 123, and ABC.</p>
<p>Very disciplined.</p>
<p>In contrast, Zhang Yi's side used their usual game IDs, so their morale was immediately suppressed!</p>
<p>"It's normal. After all, party queue players play against party queue players, and solo queue players play against solo queue players, to ensure game balance," Song Ren said, not overly surprised.</p>
<p>After all, this was a feature of most games.</p>
<p>Although <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, like most games, had voice chat.</p>
<p>However, there was usually a gap in tacit understanding and cooperation between random public teams and players who played in pre-made parties.</p>
<p>The mode randomly selected was Bomb, which was a relatively familiar mode for many FPS players.</p>
<p>It involved entering the bomb site to plant the bomb, then defending it until time ran out or defuse the bomb.</p>
<p>From a mode perspective, only the terminology had changed.</p>
<p>As for the map, it was randomly selected to be Chalet.</p>
<p>"For attacking, which Operators should we pick?" Song Ren spoke up, asking.</p>
<p>"Old Song, you should assign them. After all, you've played Terrorist Hunt a bit more than us, so you have more experience," Zhang Yi said from beside him.</p>
<p>The Operator selection position was a scapegoat position; if they lost, why?</p>
<p>Because the team composition was unreasonable, of course!</p>
<p>As old friends, Song Ren understood this was a small trap.</p>
<p>However, he couldn't say a word.</p>
<p>Why did he have to go play Terrorist Hunt first?</p>
<p>Of course, if he had really learned something, it would have been fine, but he still hadn't figured out anything.</p>
<p>Well... not <em>nothing</em>.</p>
<p>At least he knew that the AI on Realistic difficulty was ridiculously tough, and the rappelling and breaching windows he saw in the videos seemed impractical, at least for him right now.</p>
<p>"Hmm... then I'll use my experience to assign everyone their Operators," Song Ren coughed twice, clearing his throat.</p>
<p>"Hurry up, there are only twenty-seven seconds left, no time! If you don't say, I'll just pick randomly, don't give me a default Recruit Operator," Zhang Yi urged.</p>
<p>Any Operator was fine, but not Recruit.</p>
<p>That thing had no abilities, and you couldn't even see what it looked like, how lame!</p>
<p>"One of those big shield guys and one of those small flash shield guys!" Song Ren spoke up.</p>
<p>These two were the Operators he remembered most vividly.</p>
<p>And for counter-terrorism, how could they proceed without a riot shield leading the charge?</p>
<p>"I'll take the large shield. I've already selected that Operator!" Wang Yifan accepted the task and began choosing his equipment attachments after selection.</p>
<p>"Then I'll take the flash shield," Wang Han chimed in.</p>
<p>"Next for the attacking team, one Sledge! And another entry fragger, Fuze, equipped with a shield to cover the rear. I'll take IQ!" Although he had no idea how to play, Song Ren wasn't sure if these Operators' abilities would be effective in actual combat.</p>
<p>But this didn't stop him from mentally picturing a perfect scenario.</p>
<p>The large shield and small shield Operators would lead the way, shields raised. Sledge would follow closely, and if they encountered an unbreachable wall, he'd smash it with one swing.</p>
<p>As for Fuze, he would be holding a pistol and shield, covering the rear. Why did he choose IQ?</p>
<p>The most important reason was that he was drawn to her ability to scan electronic devices.</p>
<p>After all, the defenders could use cameras. Since everyone was unfamiliar with the map, he figured it would be hard to find cameras, and even if they kept getting warnings about being scanned, they probably wouldn't find them easily for a while.</p>
<p>So with IQ, a quick scan could help them locate cameras better.</p>
<p>Moreover, he had seen in the Operator's video introduction that not only cameras, but also electronic devices, mechanisms, and electronic trap devices could also be detected.</p>
<p>In this way, the enemies' eyes would essentially be blinded.</p>
<p>And they had ten drones to gather intelligence and information. How could they lose?</p>
<p>This was them, a professional counter-terrorism team!</p>
<p>As the game began, the five players' drones headed into the Chalet.</p>
<p>Their current objective was to locate the two bombs inside the mansion.</p>
<p>Then they had to defuse either one.</p>
<p>"This map is so complicated!" Controlling his drone, Song Ren felt a bit dizzy.</p>
<p>The new player tutorial was fine before, but now in actual combat, he was a bit lost.</p>
<p>It was quite winding, and he had no idea which part of the map led where.</p>
<p>At least for now, he followed the stairs from the main entrance to the second-floor office, and then he got lost.</p>
<p>"It's fine, if we're confused, the opponents are probably confused too. Let's just wander around," Zhang Yi said.</p>
<p>Why did he say that?</p>
<p>Because he was lost too.</p>
<p>"Found it! I found a bomb! It's in the basement garage! Oh no... my drone got shot down!"</p>
<p>Although Zhang Yi and Song Ren were lost, Wang Han successfully located one bomb.</p>
<p>The other bomb's location shouldn't be too far either.</p>
<p>A yellow marker appeared on the map. Song Ren, Zhang Yi, Wang Yifan, and Joey, the four of them, controlled their drones and headed towards it.</p>
<p>But even though the point was marked, the few people inside the house couldn't find a way to get in.</p>
<p>Although the Chalet map was quite small, for them, who were encountering the game for the first time, it still felt a bit complex.</p>
<p>And for this map, Chen Xu had chosen the pre-rework version, not the post-rework one.</p>
<p>After all, it was more relatable to real life, and its replayability and entertainment value were still very high, especially the entire interior of the map, which was basically made of wooden floors. Theoretically, players could completely tear down the entire house.</p>
<p>Of course, some improvements were also made. For example, the basement garage leaned towards the post-rework version, adding some cover instead of being empty and mainly for gunfights.</p>
<p>At least for casual matchmaking, it was perfectly fine.</p>
