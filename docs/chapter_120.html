                <p>Chapter 219: Along the River During the Qingming Festival (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>With the conclusion of the Early Access trial of <em>Minecraft</em>, players online had varied opinions on the game.</p>
<p>Some felt the game seemed somewhat interesting, and this block-building, brick-like gameplay style was quite novel.</p>
<p>Many other players, however, hadn't quite grasped how <em>Minecraft</em> was meant to be played.</p>
<p>Because the entire game seemed to lack any specific objective.</p>
<p>In <em>Don't Starve</em>, players needed to gradually develop themselves in order to survive.</p>
<p>For instance, in <em>Don't Starve</em>, if players didn't quickly gather resources, the first hound attack would basically be a death sentence.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with the change of seasons, some bosses would also attack, in addition to the hounds.</p>
<p>It could be said that surviving in <em>Don't Starve</em> was not an easy task, even on easy mode.</p>
<p>Yet, in <em>Minecraft</em>, many players felt that surviving was almost too easy.</p>
<p>The most dangerous time in the game was only at night.</p>
<p>But unlike <em>Don't Starve</em>, where you needed to stay by a campfire...</p>
<p>...the nighttime atmosphere in <em>Minecraft</em>, though still a bit scary...</p>
<p>...was much easier to get through than in <em>Don't Starve</em>.</p>
<p>Dig a hole, bury yourself a little, count to five, and you didn't even need to sleep in a bed; just wait seven minutes for daytime, and you'd basically be out of danger.</p>
<p>As for hunger, there were cattle, sheep, and chickens.</p>
<p>Such creatures weren't uncommon in <em>Minecraft</em> either.</p>
<p>If surviving in <em>Don't Starve</em> was a luxury...</p>
<p>...then in <em>Minecraft</em>, it was a very relaxed affair.</p>
<p>Of course, a higher difficulty setting was another matter entirely.</p>
<p>It could be said that as long as players didn't actively seek death, their lives were completely guaranteed.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, many players couldn't figure out what the main point of <em>Minecraft</em> really was.</p>
<p>This was also why Chen Xu added various new player guides to <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>
<p>Because players in the Parallel World had no concept of sandbox games, let alone anything like open-world games.</p>
<p>So Chen Xu needed to provide some guidance to help them understand where the game's fundamental charm and unique features lay.</p>
<p>Once they understood, that would be the time for players to let loose and express themselves freely.</p>
<p>While the industry was discussing <em>Minecraft</em>'s lukewarm performance...</p>
<p>...Chen Xu and Nebula Games finally made their move.</p>
<p>Numerous domestic game media portals jointly published a series of messages and news articles.</p>
<p>‘In <em>Minecraft</em>, You Can Even Visit Bianjing, the Capital of the Northern Song Dynasty!’</p>
<p>‘Is This Really Just a Pixel Game?’</p>
<p>‘How to Recreate 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' in <em>Minecraft</em>!’</p>
<p>Regarding promotion, how could Chen Xu remain indifferent? He had long since made arrangements.</p>
<p>The topic of <em>Minecraft</em> instantly exploded.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the attention of many industry designers and players was drawn.</p>
<p>But what followed was a wave of utter confusion.</p>
<p>'Along the River During the Qingming Festival'?</p>
<p>What connection did 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' have with <em>Minecraft</em>?</p>
<p>Could it be that Nebula Games had used building blocks to piece together a scroll of 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' within <em>Minecraft</em>?</p>
<p>Many players looked utterly bewildered, completely unsure what it all meant.</p>
<p>Players, whether they had played the game or not, clicked on the video links in these articles out of curiosity after seeing the news.</p>
<p>The video began with a piece of text: ‘This video contains actual in-game footage; all structures can be recreated within the game...’</p>
<p>When players saw this text, they didn't react much.</p>
<p>But the next moment, when the video content appeared, all players were instantly stunned.</p>
<p>“Holy crap! My roommate asked me why I was kneeling in front of the computer!”</p>
<p>“Is this a pixel game? Is this a damn pixel game? Is this really that pixel game I’ve been playing for the past few days?”</p>
<p>“Ah Wei died! This scene! Chen Xu, don't fool me, this must be a CG animation, right!?”</p>
<p>“Holy crap, it really is 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival'! I thought you were just recreating a painting, but you actually brought Bianjing itself to life for me!?”</p>
<p>Countless players who had clicked on the video were instantly stunned by the scene before their eyes.</p>
<p>Everyone completely disbelieved their own eyes.</p>
<p>Those who hadn't played it were one thing, but players who had played <em>Minecraft</em> were now incredibly excited and bewildered.</p>
<p>Because the scenes in this video – could they possibly be from the same game they had been playing before?</p>
<p>The video first showed a hazy drizzle.</p>
<p>As raindrops fell to the ground, it felt as if they had traversed a thousand-year span, returning to the banks of the Bian River from a millennium ago.</p>
<p>In the continuously gloomy rain, the pitter-pattering rain fell on the empty streets of Bianliang.</p>
<p>It seemed to be hinting at the hidden crisis behind this prosperous city.</p>
<p>Melodious background music began to play, and the next moment, the video's camera slowly ascended, encompassing the entirety of Bianliang and the Bian River.</p>
<p>The camera slowly zoomed in on the buildings on the streets, allowing people to clearly see the structures in the main streets and narrow alleys, as well as the temples and pavilions.</p>
<p>Passing through streets, canals, tall buildings, and fields, the rain gradually stopped.</p>
<p>The sun slowly rose, and sunlight illuminated the streets of Bianliang.</p>
<p>Countless common folk, filled with cheers and laughter, slowly appeared on the streets of Bianjing.</p>
<p>Then, the video's visuals began to change with the camera's movement.</p>
<p>Vendors selling goods and sightseers filled the main streets and narrow alleys.</p>
<p>Boats came and went on the canal, carrying poets, merchants, and high-ranking officials and nobles.</p>
<p>On the roads outside Bianliang, along the street were merchants leading cattle and horses.</p>
<p>In the fields were toiling farmers and playing children.</p>
<p>As time progressed, Bianliang gradually entered night.</p>
<p>Painted pleasure boats moored in the center of the Bian River, and countless Kongming lanterns floated in the sky.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the video's scene gradually plunged into darkness, and the melodious music slowly faded away.</p>
<p>And after this, there was also a behind-the-scenes clip.</p>
<p>Using fragmented, fast-forwarded edited shots, it recreated how this 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' had been built up piece by piece.</p>
<p>From scratch, it showed that all these things could be recreated within the game, as long as players desired.</p>
<p>Moreover, for the lighting and shadows in this 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' rendition, Chen Xu did not use any post-rendering; it was entirely displayed relying on the game's inherent lighting and shadow effects.</p>
<p>Although post-rendering would certainly make the visual fidelity a bit better, for ordinary players, it would clearly look a bit fake.</p>
<p>It was like a photo: if you promised a bare-faced picture and then uploaded a beauty-filtered photo, especially one with makeup, wasn't that deceiving people!?</p>
<p>But even so, just the 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' crafted within <em>Minecraft</em> itself had completely stunned players.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in this demonstration, Chen Xu also applied a new technology.</p>
<p>That was the AI visual enhancement technology that Galaxy Smart Tech had been researching.</p>
<p>The 'prop' used last year had finally been completed just in time.</p>
<p>Including Zhong Yue, who had already applied for relevant patents concerning this latest technology.</p>
<p>Chen Xu was also using it for the first time in <em>Minecraft</em>, specifically in this 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' demonstration.</p>
<p>From the perspective of its effects, it could be said to have completely met Chen Xu's expectations.</p>
<p>However, in terms of current optimization, using the latest AI technology was still quite resource-intensive.</p>
<p>It also required relatively high player system specifications, so currently, Chen Xu had Qin Yi and his team at Nebula Games perform further optimization.</p>
<p>However, for players watching the video, they clearly couldn't fully perceive this yet.</p>
