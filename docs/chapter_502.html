                <p>Chapter 501: Players with Shattered Morale (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Looking at the shield in his hand, Song Ren harbored a tiny bit of doubt.</p>
<p>Because the design of this shield was simply subpar.</p>
<p>It was tattered and broken, like a wooden door plank.</p>
<p>This is supposed to be the wooden shield?</p>
<p>However, despite his slight doubt, Song Ren had to admit that with the shield, he felt his confidence had significantly increased.</p>
<p>Wielding the shield, he explored in other directions, and soon Song Ren saw a giant holding a great axe.</p>
<p>Its enormous size and the visually impactful great axe in its hand unmistakably indicated that this was a formidable foe.</p>
<p>“I’ll try out my shield on you first!”</p>
<p>Song Ren looked at the short-handled hunting axe he held and the wooden shield, taking a deep breath.</p>
<p>Facing the Great Axe Giant before him, Song Ren declared he wasn't scared in the slightest.</p>
<p>With a shield in hand, he felt invincible, and he still had 20 blood potions on his back. How could he possibly not defeat the Great Axe Giant in front of him?</p>
<p>He ran directly up to the Great Axe Giant and swung his axe.</p>
<p>The opponent’s health bar visibly dropped by one segment. Song Ren’s heart brightened; a good omen!</p>
<p>At least this Great Axe Giant wasn't unbeatable.</p>
<p>The attacked Great Axe Giant turned around, fiercely swinging its great axe down.</p>
<p>If it were before, Song Ren would surely have used a nimble sidestep to evade, but now?</p>
<p>Song Ren stood his ground, raising his shield to face the enemy, even though there was no Perfect Guard in Bloodborne.</p>
<p>But Song Ren felt it was still very reasonable.</p>
<p>Gun and shield, one for offense, one for defense.</p>
<p>Perfect Guard for stun lock, then a Visceral Attack – that’s offense.</p>
<p>Holding a sturdy shield, playing steady and cautious while seeking a counterattack – that’s defense.</p>
<p>One game, two styles and playstyles!</p>
<p>Perfect!</p>
<p>‘Bang!’</p>
<p>The great axe struck the shield, emitting a crisp sound.</p>
<p>Song Ren only felt his vision shake slightly.</p>
<p>Then he saw his stamina bar in the upper left corner instantly disappear.</p>
<p>The in-game character immediately fell into a stun locked state.</p>
<p>At that moment, the Great Axe Giant’s big foot lifted, kicking Song Ren in his lower abdomen, and then the axe, with its handle reversed, savagely plunged into his body.</p>
<p>【YOU DIED!】</p>
<p>Three blood-red characters appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>At the same time, all the Blood Echoes he had accumulated earlier in the top right corner disappeared.</p>
<p>Returning to the lamp, Song Ren’s mouth hung open, still not having fully recovered his senses.</p>
<p>Wha… what just happened?</p>
<p>Where’s my stamina bar? Where’s my health bar? I just died like that?</p>
<p>This shield was broken by one axe blow!?</p>
<p>Song Ren looked at the broken wooden shield in his left hand, and recalling the experience from a minute ago, he fell into deep thought.</p>
<p>Is this the shield in Bloodborne?</p>
<p>He didn't even do anything!</p>
<p>Blocking the Great Axe Giant’s attack with the shield, and then his stamina bar was emptied, and he was stun locked?</p>
<p>This is too much, isn't it?</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s only when facing the Great Axe Giant that it’s so useless?”</p>
<p>Song Ren looked at the shield in his hand, a hint of doubt.</p>
<p>After all, that Great Axe Giant looked truly fierce.</p>
<p>Perhaps this shield was just a basic shield, incapable of blocking elite monsters or BOSSes.</p>
<p>There might be more advanced shields later.</p>
<p>Or perhaps he could upgrade this shield in the Hunter's Workshop?</p>
<p>With these thoughts, Song Ren lit the lamp in Central Yharnam and found a torch-wielding enemy holding a farm tool.</p>
<p>Looking at the charging torch-wielding enemy, his face showed a hint of expectation as he raised his shield.</p>
<p>One minute later, having respawned at the lamp again, Song Ren silently tossed the shield into the depths of his inventory and re-equipped his shotgun.</p>
<p>What trash!</p>
<p>Song Ren, returning to the Cathedral Ward, was almost flabbergasted.</p>
<p>Now, how could he not know that this shield was a complete scam?</p>
<p>What was this broken wooden shield good for?</p>
<p>Even crows pecking at rice could drain a large chunk of his stamina and health, let alone blocking the attacks of common enemies, not to mention future BOSSes.</p>
<p>Lamenting, Song Ren continued to explore the Cathedral Ward. There, he followed a broken staircase to a place called Old Yharnam.</p>
<p>A seal was affixed to the gate of Old Yharnam: “This street has been abandoned. Turn back.”</p>
<p>But he didn't pay much attention, pushing open the gate directly.</p>
<p>What met his eyes was an old street enveloped in lingering bonfires and black smoke.</p>
<p>The moment he stepped into Old Yharnam, someone shouted from a tall building in the distance.</p>
<p>‘Hey! Hunter! Did you not see the warning?! Turn back, there’s nothing worth exploring here anymore.’</p>
<p>A living person?</p>
<p>Hearing the voice, Song Ren couldn't help but be surprised.</p>
<p>“If you tell me not to explore, and I don't, I’d lose all face!”</p>
<p>But soon, Song Ren would find out if he had any face left.</p>
<p>As he advanced, the voice from before continued: “You are a very sharp hunter, your hunting skills are very mature… But precisely because of that, I must stop you!”</p>
<p>Stop me, with what...</p>
<p>“Damn it!”</p>
<p>Just as he muttered something in his heart, Song Ren's eyes widened in shock.</p>
<p>What did he see?</p>
<p>On the distant, white mist-shrouded tower, the person who issued the warning was shooting at him with a Gatling gun?</p>
<p>Song Ren, who was fighting a monster, was caught off guard and sprayed with a burst of bullets, losing more than half his health.</p>
<p>He was also stun locked, and the next moment, the monster swiped at him with a claw.</p>
<p>Before Song Ren could recover, his health bar disappeared.</p>
<p>【YOU DIED!】</p>
<p>The familiar three big characters appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>Song Ren opened his mouth.</p>
<p>Damn it! It was bad enough that he used a gun like Father Gascoigne before, but what the heck is this Gatling gun?</p>
<p>He respawned and tried again. This time, Song Ren ran a little further than before, but the key was, what did he see?</p>
<p>A hunter just like him!</p>
<p>A hunter who knew how to do everything: rolling, gun parrying, Visceral Attacks!</p>
<p>Coupled with the Gatling machine gun on the rooftop, Song Ren’s fragile heart was utterly shattered here.</p>
<p>Of course, it wasn't just Song Ren. All the players experiencing the 'hospitality' of the Yharnamites in Bloodborne had their ardent hearts shattered by malicious monsters and traps.</p>
<p>Many of the first players to enter Bloodborne were veteran players who had cleared Dark Souls.</p>
<p>Among them were many gaming masters; an eighth playthrough was a piece of cake.</p>
<p>Only those who could clear the eighth playthrough with low-level characters and various impressive tricks could be considered true masters.</p>
<p>Yet, even these players found themselves dying until their minds were hazy in Bloodborne.</p>
<p>Besides malicious level design, complex maps, and stronger mobs, there were other reasons, such as art design choices.</p>
<p>For example, Insight: some traps in the game environment could only be seen if your Insight was high enough.</p>
<p>If your Insight wasn't high enough, you wouldn't even know how you died.</p>
<p>There was also the Cthulhu Mythos-style background setting, which made the monsters and atmosphere in the game barely better than a horror game. Especially with the VR immersive experience, it caused players' SAN values to plummet, leading many players to completely break down.</p>
<p>On major video and live streaming platforms, countless players' suffering experiences were like unedited movie clips.</p>
<p>They were the kind that needed no editing; they could be taken as-is and played.</p>
