                <p>Chapter 357: Believing Players Will Understand (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Returning to Nebula Games from the Game Department, Chen Xu was in a good mood as <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> successfully passed review.</p>
<p>Of course, Chen Xu also knew that the main reason for such a quick approval was the fierce competition between Huanyu and Zeus. Although <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> had already secured a victory, overseas has always been Zeus's home turf. Therefore, Huanyu VR indeed needed more flagship titles to bolster its image.</p>
<p>As for why <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> was chosen instead of Mr. Dumas's famous masterpiece, <em>The Three Musketeers</em>, one reason was censorship considerations. Compared to <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, the latter's background setting was slightly sensitive.</p>
<p>The second reason was the activity from Atrai. Not paying attention doesn't mean Chen Xu was completely unaware of the situation. Chen Xu had always asked his assistant, Lin Rou, to collect news and information about the industry for him daily.</p>
<p>For most ordinary players, they would only find out after Atrai made an official announcement or when third-party media widely reported it. But Chen Xu had already received the news in advance.</p>
<p>Previously, Chen Xu hadn't decided which game to present. After all, apart from some very specific games, Nebula Games now had the capital to try almost anything. However, after learning this news, Chen Xu had no hesitation. After all, the two sides were already competitors, so why not fight them to the death?</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, Atrai has released more news. It feels like the Western theme has suddenly become popular," Ruan Ningxue remarked in the office, showing Chen Xu some concept art.</p>
<p>"That's normal. Westerns are a niche genre, so Atrai naturally wants to hype up the topic by making it their next AAA project," Chen Xu smiled.</p>
<p>"So we're just reaping the benefits?" Ruan Ningxue mused.</p>
<p>"Exactly. So, in terms of game development progress, just like with <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, we should try our best to get ahead of Atrai," Chen Xu said with a smile and a nod, looking as if to say, "You're teachable."</p>
<p>Just then, a knock sounded, and Qin Yi and Yang Xin entered, each reporting on some preliminary preparations for <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>.</p>
<p>"Alright, let's stick to this model. Yang Xin, stay behind. I'll discuss the game's story and background settings with you. Of course, your team won't be able to handle this project alone, so I'll specifically find some professors specializing in Western history to consult with your team," Chen Xu told Yang Xin.</p>
<p>Yang Xin, sitting on a stool, nodded and listened intently to Chen Xu.</p>
<p>"Compared to the Western-themed games currently on the market, <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> will be quite unique."</p>
<p>"Most Westerns on the market tend to portray the 'goodness' of the West. This is quite normal, just like how many people view <em>Water Margin</em> as chivalrous, but in reality, most of them were bandits. Lu Junyi, in particular, had a truly tragic fate."</p>
<p>"It's the same with Westerns. The real West wasn't that great. Many Western films mythologized cowboys, depicting good white settlers threatened by violence, and brave cowboys and lawmen bringing peace and order?" Chen Xu shook his head slightly as he spoke.</p>
<p>"Indeed, in any era, there are good people and bad people. So-called cowboys naturally had their good and bad sides; there were those like the heroes in Western films, but more often, they were a group of bandits, a group of criminals. With the arrival of the so-called era of law and civilization, these people would face their end. Of course, whether this 'civilized era' was truly civilized will also be a key point," Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>The expansion of the West was not as romantic as imagined. Instead, it was a brutal expansion.</p>
<p>Even Western films in his previous life were the same, directly mythologizing the so-called cowboy culture and spirit.</p>
<p>It was only later Italian Westerns that truly depicted what the Western era was like.</p>
<p>Cowboys who were both good and evil, an era where savagery and civilization coexisted, but ultimately, with the arrival of a new era, it gradually faded away. The West was definitely not a beautiful, romantic label, but a label where savagery was replaced by 'civilization'.</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu, Yang Xin, sitting there, seemed a little excited. After all, from Chen Xu's introduction, this so-called Western story was completely different from what was currently on the market.</p>
<p>What were they? Pioneers!</p>
<p>Of course, a more important point was that Atrai was heavily hyping up the so-called Western elements. When news then spread that Nebula Games was also working on similar content, just imagining Atrai's expression made Yang Xin want to laugh out loud.</p>
<p>Especially that designer named Antorini, who Yang Xin found very annoying recently. Why did he have to bring up their <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> when talking?</p>
<p>"Take a look at the main story content. I'll add more details later, but first, get a general understanding. If you have any ideas during this time, you can write them down for reference," Chen Xu handed a printed document to Yang Xin.</p>
<p>With an excited expression, Yang Xin opened the document. The content wasn't extensive, as it was just an outline, about two A4 pages.</p>
<p>However, by the end, Yang Xin was stunned. This ending...</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, this!" Since it was just a story outline, currently Yang Xin didn't feel much emotion. But the key was, Arthur Morgan was the protagonist, right?! Why did he just die at the end and turn into this character named John?</p>
<p>"Don't be so surprised. Moreover, if players grasp the meaning of redemption in the game, Arthur's death will be valuable and deeply moving," Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Can protagonists and important characters die? Of course they can. Just like Roach, Ghost, and later Soap and Yuri sacrificed in <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>. But their deaths must have value, not just being inexplicably killed by a villain who breaks their head with a stick. That wouldn't make players feel shocked and reflective; it would just make them bewildered and angry.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, that's not the point at all!" Yang Xin couldn't help but feel speechless. That wasn't the core issue. The real core issue was that the character players had invested emotions in died! And <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> had just finished its heartbreaking story not long ago! Was this because of a deep understanding of the 'Warrior of Love' that he completely let himself go?</p>
<p>"It's fine, I believe players will understand. Besides, although Arthur Morgan sacrificed himself, he completed his redemption. Isn't John Marston living well? In a way, John Marston is Arthur's final redemption, and proof that he once existed," Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>As for John Marston following in his footsteps in the sequel, that's a matter for the sequel. Besides, isn't there Little Jack?</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu, Yang Xin felt that not a single word after "fine" could be trusted.</p>
<p>(I've revised parts of the previous two chapters. To see the connection, long-press or scroll down the directory to refresh.) The masterpiece <em>The Three Musketeers</em> by the great French literary giant Mr. Dumas cannot be written now. As for why, I don't know, and the editor doesn't know either, but I personally guess it might be related to next month. So, I'll try to court disaster again in the future~</p>
