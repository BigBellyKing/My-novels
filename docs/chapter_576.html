                <h2>Chapter 575: This Is Called Repayment! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h2>
<p>At this moment, Song Ren only wanted to offer Chen Xu his sincerest greetings.</p>
<p>If he could, he wished he could turn back time to last night and delete the official Weibo post he sent.</p>
<p>How could such a person exist? How could such a game exist?</p>
<p>If before it was a mix of fright and thrill, now it was only fright with no thrill left.</p>
<p>Because in this level, Ethan's firearms had been taken away by the Puppeteer.</p>
<p>And not just his firearms, but all the money on him had been pilfered too.</p>
<p>In such a situation, the entire game environment and experience instantly turned eerie.</p>
<p>The narrow small house gave Song Ren an endless sense of familiarity.</p>
<p>Even worse, though the house wasn't small in area, it was divided into countless tiny sections in the game, and the corridors were extremely narrow, winding and twisting, encountering a corner after just a few steps.</p>
<p>Coupled with the dim lighting, it felt incredibly oppressive.</p>
<p>Especially in some rooms, there were densely arranged dolls.</p>
<p>These dolls had large eyes, and as soon as he entered, they were staring towards the entrance. Combined with the red emergency lights, it felt as if these dolls had come to life, making it utterly sinister and terrifying.</p>
<p>And that wasn't all. This level required players to repeatedly investigate and find clues to escape.</p>
<p>As for where the clues were?</p>
<p>They were on the puppet resembling Mia, initially on something like a workbench.</p>
<p>Players needed to investigate different parts of this doll to get crucial clues.</p>
<p>Puzzles, combined with a creepy environment, had already pushed many players to their breaking point.</p>
<p>But did you think that was the end of it?</p>
<p>How much fun did players have with Lady Dimitrescu and her three daughters before?</p>
<p>Stabbing Lady Dimitrescu's unspeakable parts with a small knife, using shotguns and sniper rifles to shoot to their hearts' content – shouldn't all of that be repaid now?</p>
<p>What is this called? This is called repayment!</p>
<p>And thinking about it another way, if it was just Ethan, controlled by the player, alone in this small room, wouldn't solving puzzles be too monotonous and lonely?</p>
<p>So, to keep players from feeling too lonely, this scene also featured a “very cute” Big-Mouth Monster.</p>
<p>This was a monster resembling a mutated infant, twice the size of a human, with an incredibly bloated body and an extremely gruesome face. It crawled on the ground like a maggot, and when facing the player, it could open its enormous maw and swallow the player whole.</p>
<p>Unlike Lady Dimitrescu's footsteps, this Big-Mouth Monster, once it got close, would emit a wailing sound like a baby.</p>
<p>And unlike Lady Dimitrescu, who could withstand damage with hand sanitizer and trade knife blows, this Big-Mouth Monster would instantly kill the player if it caught them.</p>
<p>“Holy cow! Please, just let me out!”</p>
<p>Song Ren's voice even had a slight sob.</p>
<p>The contrast between before and after was simply too great.</p>
<p>Initially, in the gloomy environment, his mind hadn't completely broken, but once he solved the puzzles, the mutated infant appeared in the room, chasing him everywhere.</p>
<p>All he needed to do was get into the restarted elevator and escape this cursed place.</p>
<p>But it sounded easy, yet it was genuinely difficult to do.</p>
<p>“It should… have left by now, right?” Ethan in the game didn't dare to breathe, and Song Ren, completely immersed, also lowered his breathing.</p>
<p>Confirming the monster had gone far, Song Ren then controlled Ethan to crawl out from under the bed.</p>
<p>Exiting the room, the dark corridor was silent. Clearly, the monster had gone far away.</p>
<p>“Elevator, elevator… It should be this way.” Song Ren ran straight towards the elevator.</p>
<p>Passing through corridors, Song Ren finally reached the elevator, connected the fuse, and pressed the elevator door switch. The elevator made a ‘rumbling’ sound and successfully started.</p>
<p>But that rumbling sound also attracted the Infant Monster.</p>
<p>‘Waaah… da-la-da… hee hee hee…’</p>
<p>Goosebump-inducing cries and bizarre wails echoed through the corridor.</p>
<p>While waiting for the elevator, Song Ren turned around, and a scene that terrified him appeared.</p>
<p>A very unique-looking little thing was slowly approaching him.</p>
<p>With two huge, pitch-black eyes and a mouth as big as half its body, this monster, dragging its bloated, decaying corpse, crawled towards Song Ren using its hands.</p>
<p>“Hurry up, elevator, hurry up…” Leaning against the elevator door, Song Ren felt cold sweat breaking out.</p>
<p>He forced himself not to look back, silently praying for the elevator to come down faster.</p>
<p>“Hurry, hurry, please hurry!” Song Ren looked at the still-rising elevator, completely panicked.</p>
<p>What brand of elevator was this?</p>
<p>It was as slow as an old lady crossing the street! Could it be any slower?</p>
<p>As if hearing Song Ren's inner plea, the old elevator gate finally opened, unhurriedly.</p>
<p>At the same time, that eerie, soft-bodied Infant Monster finally stepped into the doorway.</p>
<p>The moment the elevator door opened, Song Ren controlled Ethan to dart inside.</p>
<p>The instant he turned around, the infant was already at his heels.</p>
<p>“Eat shit, you!”</p>
<p>Safe! Song Ren, now inside the elevator, let out a sigh of relief, turning his inner fear into an angry curse.</p>
<p>But the next moment, something happened that nearly made him piss his pants.</p>
<p>He realized that this monster actually entered the elevator. It was then that he saw an activation button on the door next to the elevator.</p>
<p>“Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh…”</p>
<p>In the immersive first-person view, Song Ren watched his Ethan being embraced by the monster’s hands, then stuffed into its disgusting, huge mouth. His vision turned red, then black, accompanied by the sound of bones crunching.</p>
<p>‘你死了【YOU ARE DEAD】’</p>
<p>He had to press the elevator button himself, damn it!</p>
<p>Looking at the death screen, Song Ren’s hands were trembling, but fortunately, after loading the save, he breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Because Mr. Chen wasn't that cruel; his location was still the scene where he had previously activated the elevator, so he didn't have to wander through the dark house again.</p>
<p>At this moment, he even felt a sense of gratitude, truly an old Stockholm Syndrome patient.</p>
<p>This time, with experience, it was much smoother. The moment the elevator door closed, Song Ren’s first action was to press that round elevator button.</p>
<p>The instant he looked up, the bizarre infant’s massive face was about to get up in his face, making him shiver again.</p>
<p>But fortunately, the elevator finally started, and the metal gate closed, blocking the infant outside. Amidst the infant’s incessant screams, the elevator slowly ascended.</p>
<p>“Phew…” Song Ren let out a long breath, then entered the menu options screen, which functioned as an in-game pause.</p>
<p>He felt he needed to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>This segment of finding his way through the mansion’s plot was simply too grim!</p>
<p>(End of Chapter)
