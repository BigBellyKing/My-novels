                <p>Chapter 48: Horror Games Are As Easy As Breathing For Me</p>
<p>By mid-November, roughly seventy percent of the game content for <em>Outlast</em> was essentially complete.</p>
<p>The remaining thirty percent primarily involved voice acting, corresponding scene construction, and performance aspects.</p>
<p>For Chen Xu, the biggest gain from <em>Outlast</em>'s development was a deeper understanding of how to use the editor.</p>
<p>At the same time, <em>Outlast</em>'s game content, with his current 2048M resource access, meant the monthly quota was entirely sufficient.</p>
<p>Besides game development, the Nebula Games Platform also quietly launched during this period.</p>
<p>Chen Xu promoted it on his official Weibo account.</p>
<p>However, it didn't cause much of a stir.</p>
<p>There was no talk of industry giants taking notice or media outlets reporting on it; none of that actually happened.</p>
<p>Some media outlets, having run out of news, simply placed this information in a sub-section.</p>
<p>If you didn't specifically look for it, you wouldn't even see it.</p>
<p>Currently, the only games launched on the platform were <em>To the Moon</em> and <em>Undertale</em>.</p>
<p>As for sales, the two games combined sold a total of 172 copies.</p>
<p>However, the cumulative playtime was less than 50 hours in total.</p>
<p>Clearly, the players who bought them must have been Chen Xu's fans, simply purchasing an extra copy on his platform to support their favorite designer and game company.</p>
<p>Chen Xu wasn't particularly discouraged by this, as platform development doesn't happen overnight.</p>
<p>Days passed, and it was early December.</p>
<p>The entire development of <em>Outlast</em> was also drawing to a close.</p>
<p>Corresponding promotions began one after another.</p>
<p>One day, Chen Xu suddenly posted on his official Weibo account.</p>
<p>The Weibo post was very simple: a paragraph of text and a game poster.</p>
<p>'Only by escaping can you survive the ordeal!'</p>
<p>'December 15th, Outlast begins!'</p>
<p>Below this text was the game poster for <em>Outlast</em>.</p>
<p>The poster's background appeared to be a hospital room, with scattered medical equipment covering the floor and tables.</p>
<p>On the wall were two large characters: 'Escape'.</p>
<p>The color, in night vision mode, appeared black, immediately making people think of bloodstains.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, under the bed in the corner, a person with a face full of fear was cowering, their right index finger pressed to their mouth, looking extremely eerie.</p>
<p>As Chen Xu's Weibo post went out, major media outlets began reporting on <em>Outlast</em> one after another.</p>
<p>Moreover, <em>Outlast</em> was launched early on the Official Game Platform.</p>
<p>Of course, it was currently in pre-sale mode.</p>
<p>Priced at 65 Yuan, it wasn't a particularly high price.</p>
<p>After all, <em>Outlast</em> wasn't a very large game in terms of content.</p>
<p>At the same time, major gaming communities and forums were buzzing with discussions about <em>Outlast</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, this wasn't spontaneous player activity. Although <em>Undertale</em> had gained some minor fame and <em>To the Moon</em> had won first place in the Sci-Fi Game Design Competition.</p>
<p>Merely relying on reputation wasn't enough to generate a hot topic; Chen Xu's current fame wasn't sufficient for that.</p>
<p>What caused all this, naturally, was Money Power.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>As time progressed day by day, <em>Outlast</em> finally ushered in its launch.</p>
<p>On Shark TV's gaming section, a livestream room named </p>
