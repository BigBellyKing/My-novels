                <p>Chapter 329: The Importance of Teammates (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>"Am I really that fragile?"</p>
<p>The game reloaded to a previous save, but thankfully it wasn't far, about ten seconds of progress.
However, the crucial thing that baffled Zhang Yi was how incredibly accurate the enemy AI was.
It immediately reminded him of the Realistic difficulty in <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code>'s Terrorist Hunt Mode.
And this <code>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</code> felt every bit its equal!</p>
<p>After respawning, this time Zhang Yi didn't charge in recklessly. Instead, he hid behind cover, waiting for the attack helicopter to help them clear out the enemies on the second floor.
Only then would they assault the interior of the cargo ship.</p>
<p>"Griggs, Valcoff, secure our rear. The rest of you, follow me."
"Understood, sir!"
As the enemies on the deck were cleared, Price issued the command.</p>
<p>This experience gave Zhang Yi a very exhilarating feeling.
Especially after entering the cargo ship, Captain Price and his teammates would meticulously search every corner of the vessel, ensuring that as they advanced, no enemies would suddenly appear behind them.</p>
<p>"Now <em>this</em> is an elite unit!" Zhang Yi couldn't help but exclaim.
It was completely different from many story-driven FPS games he had played before.
In those older FPS games, teammates were basically decorative characters who would narrate the plot, but when actual fighting broke out, they were nowhere to be seen.
But <code>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</code>, as Zhang Yi currently experienced it, had built an excellent atmosphere.
Moreover, the teammates beside him were exceptionally reliable.</p>
<p>The only downside, Zhang Yi felt, was that the veteran difficulty was simply too realistic.
Following his past experience playing FPS games, especially single-player story games,
Zhang Yi would see an enemy, charge forward with his gun, and then his screen would turn red, then gray.
A famous quote would then appear before his eyes.
It was too damn real!</p>
<p>Just like playing <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code>, two shots and you're gone.
I charged! Down in one shot, what's there to say?
Of course, if he didn't charge, then his in-game teammates were simply unbelievably fierce.</p>
<p>For example, after passing through a narrow corridor in the cargo ship level, he was ambushed two or three times by enemies hiding behind crates.
Eventually, he arrived at a door that could only fit one person.
He had died several times here, so he decided to hide behind the door and try to pick off enemies one by one.
Because the enemy AI in the game didn't instantly kill him; one shot turned the screen red, two shots left him gasping, and if he was lucky, he could withstand a third shot.</p>
<p>Of course, if hit by four shots, that famous quote would definitely flash before his eyes.
With the regenerating health mechanic, it was as if he had infinite health in the game.
But if he lingered too long at the doorway, his NPC teammates in the game were unbelievably fierce.
Flashbangs and grenades flew out, annihilating the enemies in an instant.
He hid behind them, occasionally firing a couple of shots to match the atmosphere, but it felt like he was just along for the ride.</p>
<p>Furthermore, compared to its previous life's version, Chen Xu had made some modifications to <code>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</code> regarding its level performance.
Because the original <code>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</code> from his previous life was a 2007 game. While its level design might still be excellent, much like the 1-1 level design in Mario is filled with numerous psychological cues, including question mark blocks functioning as attraction anchors.
But while the level design was excellent, it also suffered from outdated technology, which limited its potential for better presentation.</p>
<p>In the original Modern Warfare from his previous life, enemies actually had a predefined patrol area. For instance, you could be bombarding point A,
But as long as you didn't step into point B, you would never encounter the enemies at point B; they wouldn't react at all.
Also, in certain levels of <code>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</code>, enemies would respawn infinitely.
As long as you didn't advance the story, you could kill an entire division's worth of enemies right where you stood.
Therefore, in this aspect, Chen Xu made the AI much smarter, and this was also Nebula Games' strongest technological suit.
Of course, this also led to an interesting phenomenon.</p>
<p>That is, on veteran difficulty, players could completely rely on their teammates.
In the game, Zhang Yi controlled Soap, performing a slide to hide behind a metal crate, watching his teammates fight valiantly through the cover, while he cheered them on from behind.
In terms of actions, Chen Xu had also made many optimizations compared to the original, making the game smoother. For example, the slide move, which is essential in most FPS games.</p>
<p>"Gaz, good shooting, bro!"
"Captain, awesome!"
"Griggs is amazing!"
"Teammates, my eternal gods!"
Watching his teammates eliminate all the enemies one by one, Zhang Yi couldn't help but give them a thumbs-up in his heart.
Although the game's progression was a bit slow, it was exceptionally stable!</p>
<p>After clearing all enemies inside the ship's cabin, Soap and Price discovered their objective: a cargo manifest.
However, at that moment, the atmosphere in the game suddenly grew tense.
Enemy aircraft appeared and began firing wildly at the cruise ship.
Following Captain Price and Gaz, they sprinted towards the exit of the cargo ship's hold.
Then... boom!
A massive hole was suddenly blown open in the ship's cabin, and seawater immediately surged in, reaching their waists in an instant.
The explosion's shockwave shattered the cabin windows, and Soap and the others in the game were directly thrown back, crashing heavily to the ground.</p>
<p>"Holy cow, what's happening! Save me, save me! I can't get up! Damn it!"
Soap, controlled by Zhang Yi, lay on the ground, his vision blurry.
His ears were ringing from the colossal explosion.
Just as he finished speaking, Gaz next to him shook him: 'The ship's sinking! We gotta go! Get up!'</p>
<p>As Brother Gaz shook him, Zhang Yi felt the game's visuals and audio clear up a bit.
Of course, Chen Xu had adopted the plot from the remake for this section and made some optimizations to better showcase the camaraderie among soldiers in the game.
Because in the original, our old friend Gaz just ran off without looking back.</p>
<p>At the same time, Captain Price's voice came from nearby.
'Big Bird! This is B-6, we're extracting! Get up, soldier! We need to move quickly!'
Price looked at Soap, who was sprawled on the ground, and pulled him up in one swift motion.
That single moment made Zhang Yi's heart tremble.</p>
<p>This was what camaraderie meant!
Previously in FPS games, players always embodied heroes, always going to rescue others.
But now, he was just a rookie!</p>
<p>With this unusual feeling, Zhang Yi quickly maneuvered Soap to follow Captain Price.
Along the way, the ship's hull continuously exploded, and seawater outside surged into the cabin through pipes.
At the same time, the entire vessel had begun to tilt.
Under these circumstances, Zhang Yi felt his heart hanging in suspense.</p>
<p>Fires and seawater blurred his vision, explosions and waves muffled sounds.
Additionally, various fragments from the explosions hindered his movement.
Furthermore, in veteran mode, being hit by the surging seawater would result in a slowdown effect.</p>
<p>So, lines of text appeared before Zhang Yi.
[You're running the wrong way!]
[You're too slow!]</p>
<p>Luckily, although the save points weren't too far apart, after failing three or four times due to being too slow and getting lost,
Zhang Yi finally guided Soap through the complex ship's cabin pipes and emerged onto the deck.
At this moment, the ship's hull was tilted at a 45-degree angle.
The helicopter ahead was waiting, about to depart.
Gaz, Griggs, and Price each jumped aboard.
At the last possible second, Zhang Yi finally caught up, leaping and gripping the helicopter's ladder with both hands.</p>
<p>But with the helicopter taking off and the rain washing over him,
Soap couldn't climb up at all; instead, he kept sliding down.
"No! Help! Captain! Help!" Seeing this, Zhang Yi completely panicked.</p>
<p>As if he'd heard Zhang Yi's shouts,
Captain Price also noticed Soap's peril, instantly dropped his gun, rushed over, grabbed Soap's hands, and pulled him up.
'Got ya!'
Looking at Captain Price in front of him, Zhang Yi, like Soap in the game, breathed a sigh of relief.
Combining this with his gameplay experience, he now profoundly understood how crucial reliable teammates were.
If he had teammates like this when playing <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code>, he'd have no worries about climbing the ranks!</p>
