                <p>Chapter 273: Industry and Player Attention (6th update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)</p>
<p>Is the RTS market big?</p>
<p>It's still a relatively large market.</p>
<p>Not just domestically, but also internationally.</p>
<p>But it's difficult to get involved in.</p>
<p>It's the same reason: RTS games aren't hard to make, but they are hard to make well.</p>
<p>Moreover, RTS games are different from typical ARPG and RPG games.</p>
<p>For typical RPG games, if there's a good one and a slightly inferior one, it doesn't mean the slightly inferior one will completely flop.</p>
<p>Because the content of these games is limited.</p>
<p>After players experience one, if they're still interested in the same genre, as long as it's not too outrageous, a portion of players will usually still buy it.</p>
<p>This is also a characteristic of single-player games; the market isn't a zero-sum game.</p>
<p>But RTS games are different.</p>
<p>Because RTS is a competitive game, it's not just about single-player content, but more about player-versus-player confrontation.</p>
<p>In this situation, an excellent RTS game can often sweep the entire market.</p>
<p>Unless there are equally excellent and evenly matched RTS games on the market, or games with unique features.</p>
<p>For example, if my RTS has a modern warfare setting, and your RTS has an ancient warfare setting, this difference can attract different player demographics, but this is based on the premise that the gap isn't too large.</p>
<p>However, once there's a significant gap in balance or player experience, one of those RTS games will inevitably monopolize the entire player market.</p>
<p>Because when the player count decreases, it means the player pool shrinks.</p>
<p>It becomes increasingly difficult to match with players of similar skill levels; new players and veterans get matched together, directly leading to a deteriorating competitive environment.</p>
<p>Of course, when the deterioration reaches a certain point, the environment will slowly improve again.</p>
<p>Because by then, only players who have a deep understanding of the game will remain, with no new players at all.</p>
<p>Everyone is evenly matched, forming a small circle.</p>
<p>For players who still love the game, this feels like a good thing.</p>
<p>But for a game developer and designer, when a game exhibits such a phenomenon, it's essentially already halfway in the grave.</p>
<p>Any talk of a sequel in the short term is basically out; perhaps after five or six, or seven or eight years, one could try to evoke player nostalgia for a sequel or a remake.</p>
<p>It is precisely because of these characteristics that, although the RTS market size is not small, very few game developers, both domestically and internationally, are willing to engage in it.</p>
<p>But now Nebula Games suddenly wants to make an RTS, which clearly isn't a spur-of-the-moment decision.</p>
<p>The collaboration with Monster Hunter: World and Minecraft is enough to prove that Nebula Games is serious.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the game with the highest concurrent online players on the Channel Alliance side is Human Wars, which also happens to be an RTS game.</p>
<p>Combine that with Nebula Games' official Weibo account's statement 'redefining RTS', it's quite obvious!</p>
<p>'Clearly, Nebula Games is targeting the Channel Alliance!'</p>
<p>'It's normal, after all, they are already competitors, and Chen Xu surely knows that the Channel Alliance won't stand idly by; the previous indirect support from TengHua and NetDragon was just the beginning.'</p>
<p>'What surprises me, though, is that Chen Xu chose RTS; that's what the Channel Alliance is best at!'</p>
<p>'Yeah, and shouldn't Chen Xu be good at RPG and action-adventure types?'</p>
<p>'Indeed, looking at Chen Xu's previous games, this is probably his first RTS.'</p>
<p>'I'm more concerned about Chen Xu's alleged 700 million Yuan. That's a bit of an exaggeration. It's not a VR game, so how can it cost 700 million? If he said Monster Hunter: World cost that much, I might believe it.'</p>
<p>Regarding Chen Xu's new game, many designers in the industry were discussing it, but most were clearly not optimistic.</p>
<p>The reason is simple: it seems Chen Xu is new to the RTS genre.</p>
<p>On the Channel Alliance side, although their reputation in the gaming industry isn't great, after jointly establishing the Channel Alliance, the game Human Wars, which was already a leader in the RTS genre, greatly expanded its player base with this wave of user resources, even continuously dominating the Channel Alliance's sales charts.</p>
<p>On the Channel Alliance side, in the office.</p>
<p>Human Wars designer Zhou Qi was also discussing this matter with Yang Hong, the president of Hero Entertainment.</p>
<p>They are collectively called the Channel Alliance, but in reality, each company just opens its channels.</p>
<p>For Hero Entertainment, their flagship title is Human Wars, and it can be said that both its esports and merchandise aspects are very well-managed.</p>
<p>Moreover, with the establishment of the Channel Alliance, Human Wars also experienced a significant surge in player popularity.</p>
<p>Previously, Nebula Games' sudden intervention in channels caused major changes, and Hero Entertainment also saw a significant decrease in revenue; at least for the second half of this year, their main revenue relied on Human Wars.</p>
<p>If Nebula Games makes an RTS game, Hero Entertainment will be the most affected.</p>
<p>"700 million Yuan in cost, that's definitely boasting!" Zhou Qi, as the lead designer, shook his head as he looked at the online news.</p>
<p>Only a ghost would believe Chen Xu would actually spend 700 million Yuan to make an RTS.</p>
<p>Isn't that just having too much money to burn?</p>
<p>"It might be an exaggeration, but it's at least over 100 million Yuan. This time, Nebula Games is definitely coming on strong!" Yang Hong next to him seemed a bit flustered.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Mr. Yang. While I admit Chen Xu is a genius in the gaming field, with Dark Souls, Monster Hunter: World, and Minecraft all being groundbreaking works, the RTS genre isn't enough with just creativity. Balance is the most crucial aspect of RTS." Hearing Yang Hong's words, Zhou Qi wasn't too concerned.</p>
<p>He was quite confident in the RTS genre.</p>
<p>"Of course, we can't do nothing. Mr. Yang, I think we can remake Human Wars to give players better graphics, and at the same time, coordinate a wave of discount promotions." Zhou Qi said to Yang Hong.</p>
<p>"Additionally, regarding public opinion, we can also hire internet trolls to stir up some discussion, for example, about Nebula Games' false advertising." Zhou Qi added.</p>
<p>Although when discussing Chen Xu's WarCraft RTS game with Yang Hong, he felt it was nothing to worry about, tactically, he still took it seriously. After all, even a lion uses its full strength to hunt a rabbit, let alone WarCraft, which is backed by the Nebula Games Platform. If they're not careful, they could get bitten badly.</p>
<p>"The internet trolls are a bit tricky; Nebula Games' legal department is quite aggressive. As for a graphics remake, that's not an issue; the budget will be approved directly by the finance department." Yang Hong nodded, making the decision.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Under the attention of the industry and players.</p>
<p>Hero Entertainment also began its counterattack, leveraging the power of the Channel Alliance.</p>
<p>Firstly, the game's graphics will be remade, and a free upgrade service will be provided.</p>
<p>At the same time, they also made many grand promises regarding some subsequent version updates.</p>
<p>As for why they were called "grand promises," it's because there hadn't been any news about them before.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chen Xu also announced a piece of news.</p>
<p>That is, WarCraft will offer a free trial experience, just like Monster Hunter: World.</p>
<p>As for the date, it's November 11th.</p>
<p>Although this date made many single players want to complain, wondering if it was Chen Xu's dark humor.</p>
<p>But it also made many excited players, as well as skeptical ones, look forward to it.</p>
<p>After all, whether Nebula Games can truly make a good RTS, and whether the alleged 700 million Yuan development cost is boasting.</p>
<p>Won't it be clear once you get to play the trial?</p>
