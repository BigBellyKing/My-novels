                <p>Chapter 719: Which One of Us is the Support?! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>For players, sometimes it can be said that even a wrong equipment build is better than being completely confused.</p>
<p>A game is actually divided into many different types of gameplay.</p>
<p>The professional competitive scene is one type of gameplay, high-tier matches are another type, the better-than-average, but not top-tier middle-tier is yet another, and the lowest-ranked matches are a different type of gameplay altogether.</p>
<p>And all players, whether high-level players or ordinary players, are actually confused when they first start a new game.</p>
<p>At this point, a detailed equipment guide can be said to be very necessary.</p>
<p>As for the purpose of these equipment items, and when to buy which items, this is something players start to consider as their understanding of the game deepens.</p>
<p>And when players start considering these things, their skill levels have already diverged.</p>
<p>Players who don't want to think too much and simply follow the recommended equipment builds formulaically will naturally be matched with teammates and opponents of the same skill level.</p>
<p>Players who want to improve themselves will slowly climb to higher ranks.</p>
<p>Thus, the game offers different game experiences based on rank tiers.</p>
<p>However, it's clear that players in the game haven't experienced these differences yet. They are mostly feeling the fun aspects of DOTA from other areas, such as continuously developing their heroes and defeating opponents.</p>
<p>As a ranged creep fell, Zhang Yi and Wang Han's heroes both reached level six simultaneously.</p>
<p>As first-time DOTA players, although the new player tutorial mentioned the difference between support and carry, it was clear that players at this stage couldn't understand what supports should do, such as pulling creeps, roaming, or giving up experience.</p>
<p>Wang Han stayed on the lane with Zhang Yi the entire time, casting a few skills, then hiding nearby to watch him last-hit.</p>
<p>Therefore, the experience gained by both of them was quite balanced.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, who had a general understanding of skills from their text descriptions, immediately activated his ultimate ability, Dragon Form, upon reaching level six.</p>
<p>"Slyrak, it's all up to you!" Accompanied by the skill dialogue, Davion in the game transformed into a bronze dragon.</p>
<p>"Everything is in my eyes, all of them are mere ants!" He immediately unleashed a Dragon Tail towards Sven the Wanderer Swordsman, who had two-thirds of his health remaining, stunning him in place.</p>
<p>Although this hero was a strength hero, and he had used an armor-buffing skill during their previous exchanges, he was clearly easier to kill than the Windranger next to him.</p>
<p>Earlier, Zhang Yi and Wang Han had also tried to kill the Windranger, but when she was at low health, she activated a skill that made her incredibly fast, and basic attacks against her resulted in infinite misses.</p>
<p>"Meet the same fate as the other kingdoms!" After the stun, Zhang Yi decisively followed up with a Breathe Fire, reducing Sven's health to just half.</p>
<p>"Quick, cast your skills!" Zhang Yi hurriedly reminded Wang Han, who was beside him.</p>
<p>"Oh oh oh!" Hearing Zhang Yi, Wang Han clicked on the system-recommended Arcane Boots, increasing her mana.</p>
<p>Although it was her first time playing and she hadn't completely figured many things out, having played Warcraft, World of Warcraft, and many other games, Wang Han clearly had her own understanding.</p>
<p>That was, she didn't immediately rush to cast the crowd control skill Fireblast. Instead, she first cast Ignite, waiting until Zhang Yi's Dragon Tail stun was about to end before following up with Fireblast.</p>
<p>"We are geniuses!"</p>
<p>"Of course!"</p>
<p>Fireblast, Multicast!</p>
<p>Accompanied by the Ogre Magi's voice, Zhang Yi saw two fireballs appear above Sven's head. Sven, with just over three hundred health, was instantly evaporated.</p>
<p>"What the heck! What kind of damage is that!?" Zhang Yi's eyes widened!</p>
<p>What kind of outrageous damage was that!?</p>
<p>His skill point allocation followed the system's recommendation: two levels in Dragon Blood, two levels in Breathe Fire, and one level in Dragon Tail.</p>
<p>But Wang Han's Ogre Magi, while primarily leveling Fireblast, only had one more level in it.</p>
<p>The damage was too absurd!</p>
<p>Who was the carry, and who was the support!?</p>
<p>Shouldn't the carry have higher damage output?</p>
<p>And what was this Multicast thing?</p>
<p>As he spoke, a notification suddenly appeared on the screen, stating that the Ogre Magi had killed the Windranger.</p>
<p>【DOUBLE KILL!】</p>
<p>The notification sound effect echoed across the entire game, and a double kill prompt appeared in the center of everyone's screen, along with Wang Han's ID name and hero icon.</p>
<p>"Eh! How did Windranger die too?"</p>
<p>Looking at the kill experience gained and the bounty received, Wang Han was also a bit bewildered.</p>
<p>"It seems like she was burned to death by your second skill, Ignite," Zhang Yi said, a little unsure.</p>
<p>"Ah, I see!" Wang Han suddenly understood. Then, pleased with the seven hundred gold she had, she opened the store interface and bought an accessory acceleration glove called Hand of Midas from the system's recommendations.</p>
<p>Compared to Wang Han's delight, Zhang Yi was a little uneasy.</p>
<p>He even started to suspect that Mr. Chen had gotten the hero role tags in this game wrong.</p>
<p>Why did the Ogre Magi's damage feel higher than his Dragon Knight's!</p>
<p>And more crucially, his Dragon Knight was level 6, while the Ogre Magi had secured Sven's kill, and the Windranger was killed by Ignite outside the experience acquisition range, so that kill was solely gained by the Ogre Magi. This kill experience directly boosted Wang Han's Ogre Magi from level 6 to level 7.</p>
<p>So, who exactly was the support? Zhang Yi was speechless even as he continued to last-hit.</p>
<p>Wang Han, however, was pleased because this kill not only brought economic and experience gains.</p>
<p>More importantly, the system provided strong positive feedback.</p>
<p>In the game, besides First Blood and the first kill being announced, kill streaks and cumulative kills also came with additional voice prompts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the heroes in the game had very special interactive dialogue.</p>
<p>For example, when she killed Windranger and Sven just now, the Ogre Magi in the game would talk to himself in a Q&amp;A style.</p>
<p>Although the hero's dialogue was indeed a bit comical, it still made her very happy.</p>
<p>Secondly, there was the sense of presence. Even though she was playing support in the game and hadn't last-hit a single creep on the lane, she could still cast skills and assist in attacks. Compared to being a ruthless mining machine in Warcraft, the game experience had increased significantly.</p>
<p>Moreover, this act of controlling a hero and protecting their carry to farm gold gave her the feeling of raising a son.</p>
<p>In the early game, ensure that your 'son' – no, your carry – farms gold diligently to increase combat power, and then wait for the carry to emerge and provide for the support in the late game.</p>
<p>Of course, since it was a competitive game, Wang Han figured there might be times when the 'son' she raised was underperforming, or even turned into an unfilial son.</p>
