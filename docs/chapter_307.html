                <p>Chapter 306: Torrential Promotion (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>After watching the entire promotional video, many players were quite excited.</p>
<p>"This counter-terrorism game is completely different from the previous ones!"</p>
<p>"Yeah! The gadgets are so rich! Riot shields, concussion grenades, breaching rounds, and that big breaching hammer is really awesome!"</p>
<p>"And it's so cool! I thought it would still be the old FPS game style!"</p>
<p>"So you can choose different Operators inside? And I noticed each Operator has unique abilities!"</p>
<p>"Ying and Ash, I'm good!"</p>
<p>"You're 'good' with that too?"</p>
<p>"Putting aside everything else, this feels too exciting!"</p>
<p>"But honestly, even though most of the special forces personnel look really cool, there seems to be one handsome guy who only made an appearance from beginning to end and then disappeared!"</p>
<p>"Now that you mention it, I think I do remember a sniper."</p>
<p>"How is he not doing anything? Isn't he just looking through his sniper scope over there?"</p>
<p>"Speaking of which, this game feels a bit hardcore. Will we be in this state in the game later? Dying instantly and then just watching from the side?"</p>
<p>"Not necessarily, besides, in an FPS game, you can at least kill people."</p>
<p>"Exactly, and looking at the matchmaking system in <em>Warcraft</em>, isn't it pretty good? Phoenix Chicks and Crouching Dragons meet their match; you'll always find opponents and teammates at your level."</p>
<p>"Stop bragging! The game isn't even out yet! Is there any veteran player who can analyze the specific gameplay or anything from this video?"</p>
<p>As soon as this promotional CG video was released, it instantly ignited the players' enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The most important point was: it was cool!</p>
<p>Ordinary FPS games in the past, even those with a counter-terrorism theme, mostly focused on the background story. As for the actual gameplay content, there wasn't much change.</p>
<p>It was basically still about gunfights, with throwable items as support.</p>
<p>However, the <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> before their eyes completely showcased different characteristics to the players.</p>
<p>The game featured unmanned reconnaissance vehicles, riot shields, flash shields, breaching hammers, and a series of dazzling high-tech gadgets.</p>
<p>Combined with intense shooting scenes, surgical strike-like assaults, and various explosion scenarios.</p>
<p>It made every Operator look incredibly cool, even making players imagine themselves entering a VR pod, transforming into one of these Operators, and completing assault missions, their achievements deeply hidden and their names unsung.</p>
<p>It fully demonstrated to players what modern counter-terrorism was all about.</p>
<p>Of course, most ordinary players didn't actually know what modern counter-terrorism entailed.</p>
<p>And real-world counter-terrorism operations are certainly completely different from what's shown in games and promotional videos.</p>
<p>Genuine modern counter-terrorism operations would undoubtedly be more cautious and prudent than depicted in games.</p>
<p>Furthermore, powerful lethal weapons like explosives are generally rarely used.</p>
<p>The main methods are still riot shields, concussion grenades, standard firearms, and some specific auxiliary tools.</p>
<p>However, this is a game after all, and players aren't truly looking to experience real-world counter-terrorism operations.</p>
<p>For players, they want to experience what <em>they</em> perceive as counter-terrorism operations.</p>
<p>Cool Operators, combined with necessary tactics and cooperation, and relevant cool gadgets.</p>
<p>That was already enough.</p>
<p>Players were incredibly excited, holding immense passion for this game.</p>
<p>If it were just NetDragon, considering their works in recent years, players would still be skeptical.</p>
<p>But now it was different; with Nebula Games' name attached, many players felt reassured.</p>
<p>Suddenly, FPS game enthusiasts were filled with anticipation for this game.</p>
<p>Facing such a situation, Chen Xu had been quietly updating the game content.</p>
<p>He was subdividing content for the military version and the standard version, pushing forward the game's progress bit by bit.</p>
<p>But NetDragon was different.</p>
<p>Based on Meng Zuo's feedback, combined with some game-related information currently provided by Nebula Games, NetDragon was brimming with confidence.</p>
<p>In addition, recently, TengHua and the Channel Alliance had also released some news about new FPS titles, making many players exclaim that a big FPS craze was coming.</p>
<p>So, in terms of promotion, NetDragon truly pulled out all the stops.</p>
<p>How to describe it?</p>
<p>If Nebula Games' previous external promotions were like drawing a grand promise, then producing content intermittently, squeezing out a little content every now and then, but not always crucial content for players.</p>
<p>Then NetDragon's promotion could be described as a "torrential promotion," like having eaten at Wallace.</p>
<p>A CG story video for one Operator every five days.</p>
<p>At the same time, it also showcased some maps that might appear in the game.</p>
<p>Mansion, Cafe, Bank, Consulate, Plane, Farm...</p>
<p>Elite squad members from various countries, along with their related background stories, were introduced little by little.</p>
<p>It also briefly revealed the game's background story, letting players know why it was a 5v5 battle.</p>
<p>Because the PVP mode wasn't real counter-terrorism; it was just daily counter-terrorism training for Rainbow Team members.</p>
<p>And the PVE content, which involved teaming up against AI, was the true Terrorist Hunt.</p>
<p>However, players were also well aware that, despite this, what truly attracted them was actually the so-called exercise content.</p>
<p>After all, both attackers and defenders had unique skills, and the gathering of information, tactical planning and deployment, combined with assault and defense.</p>
<p>Clearly, fighting against real people was more interesting.</p>
<p>Players were full of anticipation, and Chen Xu's development progress, on the other hand, was even faster than before.</p>
<p>Although it was the first time developing an FPS game and also the first major VR project.</p>
<p>The developers at NetDragon were indeed more professional and mature in this area than Nebula Games' team.</p>
<p>However, during the development process, Qin Yi and others were also constantly learning about this aspect of content.</p>
<p>For example, the gun feel and corresponding design.</p>
<p>Such as the sounds of explosions and gunfire; many uninformed players might simply think that directly recording real-world explosions and gunshots would be more realistic.</p>
<p>But in reality, this is a completely mistaken idea.</p>
<p>Because if you actually used so-called real-world gunshots, it would absolutely be torture for players' ears.</p>
<p>And it would be an unbearable torment; gunshots in games are very rhythmic, almost musical.</p>
<p>But real-world gunshots?</p>
<p>Those are purely noise.</p>
<p>In addition, in the game, because it's a VR game, Chen Xu also added some new detailed content, regardless of whether it was the military or standard version.</p>
<p>For example, in-game rappelling: in the original game, you first had to damage the wooden boards before you could rappel down and kick them in.</p>
<p>Here, Chen Xu added a new setting: players can directly kick through the wooden boards to enter, but unlike the original, they cannot aim and shoot simultaneously while kicking. Instead, there will be a delay of approximately one second, during which only hip fire is possible, and accuracy will be further spread.</p>
<p>However, there's also a flashier move, such as placing a breaching charge on the wall and then rappelling down to enter as it explodes.</p>
<p>This design, on one hand, is closer to reality, and on the other hand, it's to enhance the cool performance of players in VR mode.</p>
<p>Of course, to ensure balance, there are also restrictions.</p>
<p>A perfect explosion phase, then entry.</p>
<p>Because it explodes first, then you rappel down and aim inside the room.</p>
<p>So, players inside the room will also have about 0.3 seconds to react.</p>
<p>For a normal entry, there will be approximately a 0.6-second delay.</p>
<p>Of course, this move, as cool as it is, requires players to time it perfectly, otherwise, some rather comical scenes might occur.</p>
<p>As time progressed little by little, finally, amidst NetDragon's torrential promotion after their involvement.</p>
<p>Nebula Games and NetDragon officially announced the news of the <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> experience test.</p>
