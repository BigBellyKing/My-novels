                <p>Chapter 873: The Depth of Smash Bros.</p>
<p>“Why is it so hard!” Zhang Yi cried, frustrated.</p>
<p>“Exactly! So hard!” Song Ren sighed as well.</p>
<p>When they watched the videos, it didn’t seem difficult at all. Every move, they felt, they could master proficiently. But in actual operation, they found themselves flustered.</p>
<p>“Don’t lose heart, don’t be discouraged. It’s not your first time, anyway,” Wang Han, observing, added a precise jab.</p>
<p>They had known each other for so long; how could she not understand their style? Every time they saw spectacular plays and highlight reels, they’d want to show off in front of each other, only to transform into cocky aces.</p>
<p>The only pity was that they were playing the VR version of Smash Bros.; otherwise, it would have been truly comfortable if she had popcorn in one hand and a soft drink in the other.</p>
<p>“It’s just a lack of practice. As long as I practice more, I can definitely execute perfect moves!” Zhang Yi declared confidently. Hadn't he eventually mastered all those previous games?</p>
<p>“Couldn’t agree more!” Song Ren nodded in agreement. Back then, he dared to clear Resident Evil, Outlast, and Silent Hill. So now, a combo technique in a fighting game? How could he not learn it? With enough perseverance, an iron rod can be ground into a needle!</p>
<p>In reality, it wasn't just Song Ren and Zhang Yi. Many Smash Bros. players, after watching Link’s maneuvers in the video, immediately jumped into online matchmaking, eager to personally replicate the spectacular moves and achieve success in their mental training.</p>
<p>However, for most players, these moves were clearly too difficult—the kind that are easy to understand but hard to execute. So, in online matchmaking, many players who were just casually playing and unaware of the Link video, strangely discovered something.</p>
<p>That is, a large number of Link players appeared in matchmaking. While fighting, they would accidentally blow themselves up or, after being launched off-stage by an opponent, instead of making a proper recovery, they would throw bombs mid-air, turning a potentially recoverable situation into an irrecoverable one.</p>
<p>For casual players, these antics were merely entertaining to watch, a lesson in futility. But for some hardcore players, the appearance of this video was cause for elation.</p>
<p>Sometimes, for players, all they need is a direction and inspiration.</p>
<p>Smash Bros. had only been released for a week. Many players had only scratched the surface of the game, completely unaware of some of its deeper core systems. But now, with the video released by Chen Xu, a clear direction had been pointed out to these deep-diving players who loved to research.</p>
<p>It instantly showed them what made Smash Bros. different from other fighting games.</p>
<p>The knockback gameplay created its own unique mechanism: the pursuit game. This offers a completely different experience from traditional fighting games.</p>
<p>In traditional fighting games, combat mostly takes place on the ground, and there’s no such thing as environmental kills. Moreover, defensive moves can block any attack, with the only cost being a reduction in health. But in Smash Bros., these methods are completely ineffective. Aside from perfect guards, a normal guard will deplete the shield's thickness, and when attacked by an enemy, the circle representing the Parry Value will gradually shrink. When the Parry Value reaches zero, the character will enter a stun-locked state, leaving them at the mercy of their opponent.</p>
<p>This makes the game’s pace favor offense rather than defensive counter-attacks. Furthermore, the game also has a grab mechanic. Simple defense is merely a path to certain death.</p>
<p>Then there are the effects of the moves. Taking Link as an example: after launching an opponent, while they are stun-locked and unable to move, he can execute a perfect combo using his own skills. This is arguably the most spectacular phase of Smash Bros.</p>
<p>Coupled with the game’s inherent knockback mechanism, high-level players prefer to engage in constant duels at the edge of the stage. Unlike traditional fighting games, where victory is determined by health bars, Smash Bros. is full of uncertainty.</p>
<p>For instance, the classic scene in the previous life’s Street Fighter, where Daigo Umehara, at the most crucial moment, used Ken to continuously parry Wang Pang's Chun-Li's 17-hit combo and ultimately turned the tide from a sliver of health to victory—such desperate counter-kills are rarely seen in traditional fighting games. However, in high-level matches in Smash Bros., such last-minute comebacks are common. Even if you’ve dealt 100% damage to an opponent, it’s still possible to be counter-killed.</p>
<p>This is because in Smash Bros., as long as a character hasn't been knocked off-stage, you only have an advantage, not a decisive victory. This situation leads to one outcome: skilled players constantly push the battle to the edge of the arena for intense confrontations. Casual players lack the psychological and technical prowess of high-level players, but they still maintain a sense of anticipation for the battle's outcome. Because they always have a chance to turn the tables.</p>
<p>And the video Chen Xu released on the official Weibo account clearly pointed a direction for all Smash Bros. players. It showcased the infinite possibilities within this game.</p>
<p>Many people thought this was just a fun Smash Bros. game where players mindlessly played on the map. But after watching Chen Xu’s video, all players realized that while Smash Bros. appeared to have an extremely low barrier to entry, the unique characteristics of each fighter and the changes in game mechanics also gave it a very high skill ceiling.</p>
<p>Upon understanding this, many players who loved fighting and action games felt as if they had been given a shot in the arm. Previously, many players questioned the game, believing Smash Bros. lacked sufficient depth and challenge. But clearly, players felt that way simply because their exploration of Smash Bros. was too superficial.</p>
<p>This game still holds countless techniques awaiting players to discover. Before this, everyone had approached the game with their past fighting game experience. They believed that by simplifying or even cutting out certain elements from traditional fighting games, Smash Bros. would lack depth. But now, looking at the combat mechanics of Smash Bros., it’s far from simple; it’s actually quite hardcore. Psychology, reactions, and on-the-spot operations—almost everything is covered. If such a game could still be said to lack depth in its combat system, then what would other fighting games even be?</p>
