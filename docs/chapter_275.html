                <h2>Chapter 274: Are You Filming CGI Movies, Or Making Games? (7th update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)</h2>
<p>Regarding the external situation, Chen Xu was not affected in the slightest, as he generally didn't pay attention to such doubts; whether a game was good or not would only be known once it was made.</p>
<p><em>Warcraft</em> continued its development according to plan, and simultaneously, Zhang Yida's side also began its promotional warm-up.</p>
<p>After Chen Xu's official Weibo account announced the trial play date, players and the gaming industry actively discussed <em>Warcraft</em>.</p>
<p>However, there wasn't much more explosive news. Chen Xu's official Weibo account had been handed over to his assistant Lin Rou for management during this period, and Nebula Games' official Weibo account was also currently managed by Lin Rou.</p>
<p>Every day, these two official Weibo accounts, like squeezing toothpaste, released one piece of concept art at a precise time.</p>
<p>Dwarves, Humans, Night Elves, Undead – familiar races from Western fantasy settings were gradually revealed by Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Player anticipation also grew daily.</p>
<p>Overseas, Target Software, as before, slowly began its promotional warm-up. Following <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, Overseas Nebula Games already had a significant number of loyal fans and players. Regarding <em>Warcraft</em>, these overseas players mostly expressed their anticipation.</p>
<p>If there was anything that truly dissatisfied players, it was that they had no idea about the development progress or the current status of <em>Warcraft</em>. And the trial date was still almost two months away! How were they going to endure these days!</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Online, players felt like a year passed in a day.</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games' project office, however, it was bustling with activity.</p>
<p>"Damn it! Mr. Chen, you're too strong! We strongly demand that you only have 50% health!"</p>
<p>"Exactly, and no summoning heroes!"</p>
<p>"No upgrading to Tier 2 tech!"</p>
<p>"And your population cannot exceed 60!"</p>
<p>"Also, the four of us have to be on one team!"</p>
<p>Inside the office, Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, Lin Tao, and Yang Xin chimed in one after another, making Chen Xu, who was sitting in front of the computer, speechless.</p>
<p>"You might as well just tell me not to build any structures at all," Chen Xu retorted in annoyance.</p>
<p>As of now, the overall combat framework for <em>Warcraft</em> was largely complete. The remaining work involved the unfinished campaign storyline and some races that still needed testing.</p>
<p>As for the current testers, it was naturally themselves. Although the four of them were having a blast, in Chen Xu's eyes, they were essentially RTS novices. And while <em>Warcraft</em> might seem simpler than other RTS games on the market, it was much more complex to truly master.</p>
<p>Chen Xu himself was quite familiar with the game's content, having played it for many years in his previous life. Coupled with his relatively quick reactions, he might not be comparable to some top-tier professional players, but he could easily defeat the four novices in front of him.</p>
<p>After chatting with them about game-related matters, Chen Xu looked over at Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin. The two of them were clearly more interested in the story, even though they had also had a hand in writing it. But they were still excitedly experiencing the campaign together.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Qin Yi and Lin Tao teamed up to fight four maddening AI opponents. Of course, they had enabled 'greedisgood 99999'.</p>
<p>Regarding <em>Warcraft</em>'s current balance, Chen Xu couldn't claim it was perfectly balanced. That was an impossible feat. But at the very least, Chen Xu believed it was close to balanced. Through his actual tests, and by embedding various strategies and playstyles into the AI, he conducted multiple tests in rounds of 100. Currently, the win rates of all four races were basically even, with the largest disparity being no more than 3%.</p>
<p>This was already quite perfect. After all, there were simply too many variables in <em>Warcraft</em>. Different strategies for each race all had counter-measures and solutions. And on the competitive stage of <em>Warcraft</em> tournaments, players of all four races had managed to claim championship titles. At least at this stage, Chen Xu felt that no numerical balance adjustments were necessary.</p>
<p>Of course, for an RTS game, future adjustments were inevitable. Because for <em>Warcraft</em>, every slight adjustment represented a radical shift in the entire game's meta and strategies. For example, early Orc strategies typically started with the Blademaster, but many years later, after a major patch, the experience granted by the Far Seer's Feral Spirits upon death was reduced. The Far Seer's status saw a significant rise, and similarly, the Undead's Crypt Fiends also benefited.</p>
<p>Naturally, there was also a period of balance weakness in <em>Warcraft</em>'s early days, where the Night Elves were incredibly strong, but many people didn't realize it. It wasn't until MOON, relying on his understanding of the Night Elf race, almost dominated the scene, winning the championship with a streak of 13 consecutive victories without a single defeat, that players witnessed the true power of the Night Elves. And then what? The Night Elves were heavily nerfed. For example, the build time for the Night Elf Tree of Life was extended by 10 seconds, and the armor of buildings and the attack power of Ancients were reduced.</p>
<p>The Human race, thanks to TH000 and Sky, also received similar treatment, with Defense Towers turning from bricks into tender tofu. However, these numerical nerfs and the buffs to other races actually fostered more new strategies and playstyles. This was precisely the charm of <em>Warcraft</em>: unit types, tech, heroes, and racial characteristics gave rise to an enormous number of variables.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>There was still some time before the game would be open for player trials. Although the game's overall framework was complete, only the campaign storyline remained to be fully polished. In terms of visual presentation, operational experience, and CGI performance, the current <em>Warcraft</em> absolutely surpassed its previous life's version.</p>
<p>However, there weren't entirely no other tasks remaining. Chen Xu wasn't in a hurry to launch the Map Editor. Instead, he planned to release it after players had experienced the core content of <em>Warcraft</em>. This period would also allow for further refinement of this 'divine tool'.</p>
<p>The main remaining work was the combat system settings for <em>Warcraft</em>. First and foremost was the matchmaking system, primarily based on RANK points. Players would start with 500 points, and matches would be made based on rank and win rate.</p>
<p>In addition, there would be a replay system and an in-game spectator system. For instance, ordinary players could watch high-ranked player matches in real-time from the spectator interface. Of course, to prevent peeking at expansion bases and starting heroes, there would be a 3-minute delay. These features were designed to help players better observe masters, learn from others' experiences and strategies, and further elevate the overall skill level of players in the game.</p>
<p>There was also a more comprehensive achievement system and a friend system.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>In mid-October, all news about <em>Warcraft</em> had been released little by little, like squeezing toothpaste, which made players grit their teeth in frustration. After all, in the past, even with the slow drip of information and grand promises, there was at least a promotional video to let them know how delicious the pie would be. Now, there wasn't even a trailer?</p>
<p>Almost every day, players flooded Chen Xu's official Weibo account, strongly demanding more information and content. Of course, this was just an outlet for their frustration.</p>
<p>But to the surprise of many players, Chen Xu actually responded that day, and he painted an incredibly grand picture for them—a promotional video they had always wanted.</p>
<p>Many players, upon discovering it, eagerly clicked on the short video, which was just over a minute long, wanting to catch a glimpse of <em>Warcraft</em>'s grandeur.</p>
<p>After clicking on the video, a passionate BGM, like war drums, echoed in their headphones. Then, Nebula Games' Logo flashed across a black transition screen, and a line of text appeared: (The following video is an in-game CGI).</p>
<p>Following this, the sound of war drums slowly faded, replaced by whistling wind. The first thing to appear on screen was a tattered flag.</p>
<p>'We never heeded the ancient prophecies.'</p>
<p>As the narration ended, an Human soldier and an Orc soldier were engaged in fierce combat on a cloudy prairie. Sword and axe clashed, sparks flew, and endless clanging echoed.</p>
<p>'Foolishly clinging to old hatreds.'</p>
<p>The battle was undecided. The Human soldier was well-equipped with armor, sword, and shield, but the Orc warrior possessed natural strength.</p>
<p>'Generations fighting ceaselessly.'</p>
<p>On the vast prairie, the Human soldier and Orc soldier faced off. Suddenly, lightning and thunder flashed. A meteor, burning with green smoke and flames, streaked across the sky, catching their attention.</p>
<p>'Until that day, fire rained from the sky, and new enemies appeared.'</p>
<p>Countless fireballs tore through the sky, one of which landed near the Human and Orc soldiers. Flames engulfed the entire prairie, and from a gigantic crater, enveloped in green fire, an enormous stone golem crawled out, like a demon from hell. At this moment, both the Human and Orc soldiers gripped their weapons, turning to confront the colossal flaming stone golem.</p>
<p>Then the camera shifted. In a puddle on the prairie, an unknown number of days had passed. Two scarred arms appeared in the frame, one belonging to an Orc and the other to a Human.</p>
<p>'Now we stand on the brink of destruction. The Reign of Chaos has finally arrived.'</p>
<p>The video wasn't long, but it left all players feeling absolutely blown away. After watching this video, countless players were stunned. Was this in-game CGI? This was simply too powerful! The quality was absolutely phenomenal! Looking closely, one could even discern the different textures on the Human and Orc hands at the end of the scene.</p>
<p>This entire CGI animation, less than two minutes long, had every frame worthy of being a screenshot. "Are you filming CGI movies or making games?" Before, Chen Xu had mentioned a cost of 700 million Yuan. Could it actually be true? If most of <em>Warcraft</em>'s story was presented with CGI of this quality, it didn't seem impossible! But then, wouldn't a large portion of that 700 million Yuan have been spent on CGI?</p>
<p>Innumerable players, including industry designers, were left speechless and bewildered after watching this CGI animation.</p>
