                <p>Chapter 202: Immensely Popular (Please subscribe, monthly tickets)</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games, Chen Xu was also paying close attention to the performance of Don't Starve.</p>
<p>Compared to the games he had launched previously, Don't Starve's performance wasn't particularly high.</p>
<p>The first-day sales of 230,000 didn't look very encouraging. After all, Don't Starve's own price wasn't high, and it had received some market promotion. Moreover, Chen Xu was no longer the unknown nobody he once was, so these sales were far from a surprise.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu himself wasn't overly disappointed, because unlike previous releases, Don't Starve wasn't launched on other platforms this time.</p>
<p>Nebula Games itself described it as a genre relatively unfamiliar to many players: a sandbox game.</p>
<p>All of these factors led many players to adopt a wait-and-see attitude. Another crucial point was that Don't Starve currently held a player rating as high as 9.6, which was already an extremely impressive score.</p>
<p>Of course, this was also related to the fact that most of the current Don't Starve buyers were fans of Nebula Games. Once more players flocked in, the rating would inevitably be pulled down.</p>
<p>As the word-of-mouth from the first batch of players exploded, more and more players became curious about Don't Starve and purchased it.</p>
<p>When these players subsequently bought and entered the game, and after playing it a bit to understand its mechanics, they were instantly captivated by this wonderful game world.</p>
<p>"This is the survival game I've always wanted, it's practically a classic!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, it feels like this might be the most in-depth small game Chen Xu has made in recent years, gameplay-wise?"</p>
<p>"Agreed!"</p>
<p>"At least this game is definitely a big surprise, I never expected it to be so interesting before!"</p>
<p>Players who enjoyed Don't Starve enthusiastically praised the game.</p>
<p>Indeed, Don't Starve's various mechanics and settings were very effective at retaining players.</p>
<p>First and foremost was the clear objective upon entering the game.</p>
<p>When players haven't yet grasped a game's deeper core and gameplay modes,</p>
<p>there must be a clear objective. For example, in a PVP game, the clear objective is to defeat opponents and win the match.</p>
<p>For PVE games, it's defeating the final BOSS to complete the level.</p>
<p>And in Don't Starve, as a sandbox game, when players didn't quite understand what a sandbox game actually was, it directly gave them a clear objective: to survive and live as long as possible.</p>
<p>With this clear objective, the next step was to extend it into richer gameplay.</p>
<p>In Don't Starve, centered around the main goal of survival, the gameplay that emerged revolved around various physiological needs.</p>
<p>The concept that "people die when they are killed," which sounds like a truism, was arguably taken to its extreme in Don't Starve.</p>
<p>Without food, you will starve.</p>
<p>If the weather is too cold, you will freeze to death.</p>
<p>If your sanity drops too low, you'll suffer from mental instability, leading to hallucinations and being hunted by phantoms.</p>
<p>So, to avoid starvation, players need to find food; to avoid freezing to death, they need to build shelters and Warming Stones.</p>
<p>Besides these, the game also features many dangerous monsters, and during specific periods, monster attacks will even occur.</p>
<p>This requires players to craft weapons to protect themselves.</p>
<p>All of these are phased objectives that emerge around the theme of survival.</p>
<p>Once players become familiar with these elements,</p>
<p>ensuring they can survive in a corner of this perilous world,</p>
<p>that's actually when the game truly begins.</p>
<p>Because when players realize they won't die as long as they don't do anything reckless, exploring the broader world becomes their pursuit.</p>
<p>To experience this living world.</p>
<p>In this world, there are its own operating rules, from the grand changes of seasons to the subtle alternation of day and night, and each season has its own characteristics.</p>
<p>For instance, spring often brings continuous overcast and rainy weather. If you don't prepare equipment like umbrellas or Rain Hats, you'll quickly suffer from excessively high humidity, lowering your body temperature and sanity. One careless mistake and you'll kick the bucket.</p>
<p>And if your luck is bad enough to be caught in a thunderstorm while hiding under a tree, you'll have to be extra careful not to get struck by lightning.</p>
<p>Summer, on the other hand, brings surging heatwaves. While it's quite quick to dry jerky during this season, the continuous high temperatures can easily cause you to suffer from heatstroke.</p>
<p>Trees in the forest or equipment in your base might even spontaneously combust due to excessive heat.</p>
<p>If, regrettably, you've built your base too compactly, a summer fire will quickly make you understand what it means to be beyond tears.</p>
<p>As for the most terrifying season, winter, it's even harder to endure. Besides the lethal cold,</p>
<p>almost all crops in the entire world, except for trees, stop growing. This means that without sufficient preparation, winter can lead to a predicament of no grass, no twigs, and no food.</p>
<p>The desire to eat one's fill becomes so intense in winter, making players experience the true essence of the game's title, Don't Starve, for the first time.</p>
<p>Moreover, seasons aren't just this simple; they even affect the habits of various creatures.</p>
<p>For example, it's best not to approach Beefalo in spring, as spring flowers bloom, signaling the mating season.</p>
<p>For instance, food items all have their own shelf life; after a certain period, they will gradually become stale or even spoiled, eventually turning into rotten food if left unattended.</p>
<p>Then there's combat. In traditional games, fighting monsters usually just requires good equipment and excellent skills.</p>
<p>But in Don't Starve, the sole problem of fighting monsters has countless solutions.</p>
<p>You can craft the best equipment and brew the best potions, then go head-to-head with monsters.</p>
<p>But you can also be a Trap Master, find an open area, fill it with traps, and then, with skillful positioning, eat dessert while watching monsters flip and tumble in your trap array.</p>
<p>You can even employ the strategy of "driving tigers to devour wolves," watching monsters fight among themselves and then reaping the benefits.</p>
<p>If you accidentally place items too close to a campfire, they might catch fire. If not extinguished promptly, even the most precious items will turn into a pile of ashes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the random map generation ensures that each of the player's survival journeys is a unique experience.</p>
<p>Of course, there's also the most important point: like most sandbox games, aside from official DLC content,</p>
<p>the player-created MODs alone have brought a lot of enjoyment to the game.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Workshop feature itself has become a hallmark of the Nebula Games platform.</p>
<p>Don't Starve is no exception. Chen Xu plans to officially release some special MODs that don't heavily impact balance, such as numerical displays and geometric placement, as a way to "cast a brick to attract jade" and encourage more players to create their own.</p>
<p>After all, that's the nature of sandbox games; only with player involvement can a sandbox game's vitality be sustained and various interesting gameplay styles emerge.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>However, compared to ordinary players immersed in Don't Starve's rich gameplay, game designers in the industry who had been paying attention reacted much more strongly than players.</p>
<p>Clearly, no designer would underestimate Chen Xu.</p>
<p>After all, to this day, Chen Xu could be said to have an illustrious track record.</p>
<p>Putting other achievements aside, just last year's and this year's Dark Souls series alone were enough to impress many.</p>
<p>However, the unique qualities of Dark Souls determined that it was a game very difficult to imitate. Dark Souls' global success was driven by its overall game quality, not just a single outstanding aspect.</p>
<p>For example, the game's level map design was exquisite and unparalleled.</p>
<p>But relying solely on level map design was clearly insufficient.</p>
<p>The game's difficulty curve design was very reasonable, allowing players to gradually overcome powerful enemies through continuous struggle.</p>
<p>But if it only had this difficulty curve, could Dark Souls have succeeded?</p>
<p>The answer is also no.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would have achieved some success, but it definitely wouldn't have exploded in popularity as it has now.</p>
<p>Level map design, difficulty curve, and a magnificent story world view setting.</p>
<p>It was the combination of all these elements that led to Dark Souls' current success.</p>
<p>As for the so-called Souls-like games, many players in his previous life simply equated them with high difficulty, which was a completely mistaken perception.</p>
<p>Because a "Souls game" refers not to a single aspect, but to the overall performance.</p>
<p>Therefore, to this day, although many game designers have been envious of Dark Souls and attempted to emulate it, none have managed to make a splash, let alone reach the heights of Dark Souls.</p>
<p>However, Don't Starve was completely different.</p>
<p>Its appearance made many game designers in the industry feel as if they were back to when Chen Xu, fresh from finishing an 18R Adult Game, brought them Undertale.</p>
