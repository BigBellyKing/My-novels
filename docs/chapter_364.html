                <p>Chapter 363: Players love me deeply! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>After watching the entire game's promotional trailer, many players felt a bit bewildered and completely at a loss.</p>
<p>While there was a fair amount of dialogue, many players simply didn't understand it. This was mainly because the story content within the entire trailer adopted a fragmented and pieced-together mode. Simply put, early-game story dialogue and late-game story dialogue were split apart and put together. Without knowing the plot, it would be basically impossible for players to guess what was happening.</p>
<p>Of course, the purpose of doing this wasn't to be Riddler-like, but to give players a basic understanding of the game's background and core content without revealing the full plot.</p>
<p>With the release of the promotional trailer, players who had been following Red Dead Redemption also began discussing it heatedly.</p>
<p>There were still some things to uncover in this short video, just over a minute long. First, there was nothing to say about the graphics. Including the 'Farm Life' theme previously released by Nebula Games, it was clear that Red Dead Redemption's visuals would absolutely not be an issue.</p>
<p>And while it wasn't clear whether this promotional trailer was CGI or real-time rendered in-game footage, Nebula Games obviously had no need to sacrifice its reputation in this area. After all, unlike gameplay and story which require in-depth experience, graphics were too easy to discern whether corners had been cut.</p>
<p>What truly captured players' attention was the game's setting. Because it seemed like the players weren't playing as good guys.</p>
<p>"It feels a bit different from typical Western themes! Are we playing as bad guys?"</p>
<p>"Yeah! It feels completely different from the 'Beautiful World' style. I read that novel, and the protagonist seemed like an outlaw hero like Robin Hood, but here, robbing trains and banks, it feels like we've done all sorts of bad things!"</p>
<p>"I actually find it quite interesting. I've seen too many good-guy protagonists. It's my first time seeing a bad-guy protagonist."</p>
<p>"I'm more curious about the gameplay. Is it still a level-based game like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare?"</p>
<p>Players were discussing all sorts of topics related to Red Dead Redemption. What concerned them most was the game's depiction of the Western world.</p>
<p>Even though a more expansive world hadn't yet been fully revealed, the tip of the iceberg shown in the promotional video was enough to get players excited.</p>
<p>Moreover, compared to Atrai's 'Beautiful World,' Nebula Games showcased a thriving city. A city gradually moving towards modernization. It featured modern amenities like streetcars and streetlights, yet also retained lingering historical elements such as horse-drawn carriages. This blend of progress and the past was undeniably captivating.</p>
<p>While players discussed online, Chen Xu was working overtime with his team to develop content for Red Dead Redemption.</p>
<p>Currently, they were divided into two sub-teams. One team was specifically responsible for Red Dead Redemption's gameplay content, such as fishing, hunting, bounty hunting, and so on, which Lin Tao oversaw. The other team focused on the detailed content of Red Dead Redemption, as well as collaborating with Yang Xin's team on mission architecture, which Qin Yi was responsible for.</p>
<p>Inside the Huanyu VR gaming pod, Chen Xu was controlling Arthur Morgan as he shaved, his face clearly reflected in the in-game mirror. The realism was extremely high; one could even see a wrinkle on Arthur Morgan's forehead. Besides this, there would be a considerable amount of interaction in the game, even more than in the previous life's Red Dead Redemption. For example, mirrors, wooden planks, and bricks on the ground could all be picked up, even used as weapons. Additionally, players could truly set fire to and destroy some wooden houses, which would leave behind ruins after burning. Of course, these were specific designated houses in the wilderness; otherwise, a spectacular scene of Saint Denis burning might occur. While that would indeed be cool, the current hardware capabilities and physics engine technology were still quite strained.</p>
<p>Beyond the main quests, there were also side quests and Stranger missions. Chen Xu referenced The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Before accepting a quest, players could even directly kill the quest NPC, causing that quest segment to disappear entirely. Furthermore, players could attack horse traders and black market merchants in the wilderness. After killing them, that functional NPC would be gone. Of course, these actions would not affect the progression of the main story. This made the entire game more free and also more realistic and rich. In the previous life, many features couldn't be included due to technical limitations. However, in this Parallel World, it was clearly possible to do much better.</p>
<p>Exiting the gaming pod, Chen Xu nodded in satisfaction. Some minor details still needed tweaking, but the overall framework was basically sound. Next, there was the camera review for the storyline segment.</p>
<p>"For this segment of the story, don't use the default camera; use cinematic camera angles instead."</p>
<p>"Here, players won't have as much freedom, because the goal is for them to watch and immerse themselves in Arthur's identity, not their own."</p>
<p>"Also, when traversing the forest, the background music 'That's the Way It Is' should play with the camera, along with flashback dialogue from NPCs that players have encountered in the game, to elevate players' emotions to their peak. This way, players can experience the meaning of redemption just like Arthur does in the game."</p>
<p>Watching a DEMO demonstration displayed on the holographic projection, Chen Xu instructed the team members beside him. Unlike other games, Red Dead Redemption's pace was relatively slow, evoking the style of old movies from the last century. Many scenes in the game were not from the player's default perspective, but rather specially crafted cinematic camera angles. Players could also switch to cinematic camera angles during gameplay. The entire game was developed using three camera perspectives: third-person, first-person, and cinematic. For certain key moments, using cinematic camera angles combined with the game's soundtrack would completely draw players into the game. Especially the scene where Arthur bids farewell to Sadie and Abigail, pulls his hat down, and rides determinedly towards the camp, it's definitely one of the most classic scenes in gaming history.</p>
<p>Returning to his office from the project room, Chen Xu was in a good mood. After all, the project's development was proceeding very smoothly.</p>
<p>Leaning back in his chair after finishing work, Chen Xu opened his phone and scrolled through the official Weibo account and other industry news. As expected, most of the online discussions were currently centered around Red Dead Redemption and Beautiful World.</p>
<p>Chen Xu glanced at the discussions. Players talking about Beautiful World mostly focused on two aspects: the fidelity to the original story and the so-called gameplay content. According to Antorini and Atrai's promotional points, they mainly emphasized 'freedom.'</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the discussions around Red Dead Redemption were more varied. Game type, plot content—everything was being discussed.</p>
<p>Two of the most discussed aspects were that many players felt the storyline might be a tragic storyline. After all, the previous Call of Duty: Modern Warfare had left a deep impression on them, and here, players were playing as Arthur Morgan, a gang outlaw. Could he really have a good ending? If it were an ordinary game designer, they wouldn't immediately think this way, but who was Chen Xu? The Warrior of Love! Pouring love onto players? Pfft! Chen Xu's love was to torment players, either through game difficulty or through the plot.</p>
<p>The other aspect was the gameplay. Many players thought it would be a level-based game with separate level maps, similar to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.</p>
<p>Watching the players' discussions, Chen Xu, sitting in his office, couldn't help but sigh with emotion. Just as he loved his players, his players loved him deeply. Like a tapeworm in his belly, they knew each other's thoughts perfectly.</p>
<p>Looking at the hot posts online, Chen Xu also stepped forward to address the two hottest topics on the official Weibo account.</p>
