<h1>Chapter 376: Gun in Hand, Kill Micah the Dog (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h1>
<p>The popularity of Red Dead Redemption was soaring, coupled with Chen Xu's considerable reputation among players.</p>
<p>This official Weibo post immediately caught the attention of players.</p>
<p>However, the content within it sparked much discussion among them.</p>
<p>'The final ending satisfies us? Mr. Chen is lying again!'</p>
<p>'Satisfied? Absolutely not! We strongly demand Arthur's resurrection!'</p>
<p>Looking at Chen Xu's official Weibo, many players saddened by Arthur's death vented their emotions through comments.</p>
<p>But there were also many players who grew even more curious about the final ending Chen Xu mentioned.</p>
<p>And these players clearly understood one thing:</p>
<p>Arthur's death was almost an unchangeable fact.</p>
<p>Given this, what would the subsequent story be like?</p>
<p>What would become of the Van der Linde gang members?</p>
<p>After venting on the official Weibo, Song Ren, like many other players, entered the game to play from John Marston's perspective.</p>
<p>The timeline had now advanced to eight years after Arthur's death.</p>
<p>During this period, John Marston had been living incognito with his wife Abigail and son Little Jack.</p>
<p>The game's story leaned more towards a peaceful, family-oriented narrative.</p>
<p>Taking his wife and son, John Marston found work on a ranch near Strawberry Town.</p>
<p>He lived a simple life, milking cows and chopping wood.</p>
<p>Then there was the ranch owner's wife, who even wanted to invite John Marston to her room for a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Well, let's skip that part.</p>
<p>Most cowboys, in reality, were different from the imagined figures who lived by the gun, licking blood from their revolvers.</p>
<p>They were more often found milking cows, helping mares give birth to foals, and engaging in other farm activities.</p>
