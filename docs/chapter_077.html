                <h2>Chapter 176: Dark Souls Prequel, Launched! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h2>
<p>The launch date for <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em> was drawing nearer.</p>
<p>Related advertisements had slowly begun to roll out across major websites.</p>
<p>Concurrently, pre-release promotion had also started in the Overseas Target Software segment.</p>
<p>The promotional efforts overseas were more substantial compared to the domestic market.</p>
<p>This was because, during July, most game developers had not yet prepared to release any new works.</p>
<p>On one hand, news had only just been announced at previous exhibitions, leaving insufficient time for development. On the other hand, Chen Xu had already announced early that <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em> would be launched in early July.</p>
<p>As a sequel to an IP game, and specifically a sequel to the game that won Game of the Year for Best Role-Playing Game last year, with its launch date clearly stated, there were essentially no game companies stubborn enough to deliberately challenge it.</p>
<p>Similarly, for players, this period of waiting was utterly agonizing.</p>
<p>The promotional video from the previous exhibition had been rewatched countless times by players.</p>
<p>Combining various elements from the previous title, many Souls scholars had even created three-hour-long lore analysis videos based solely on that three-minute promotional clip.</p>
<p>Of course, besides these incredibly hardcore Souls scholars, many ordinary players were also quite afraid that Chen Xu's official Weibo account might suddenly post an announcement, stating that to provide players with an even better experience, they had decided to delay the release.</p>
<p>After all, game delays are quite common in the gaming industry, so these players were genuinely worried that Nebula Games might also pull such a move, even though Nebula Games had never done so before.</p>
<p>But that was also because, to date, Nebula Games hadn't released any large-scale games; if one had to name them, it would only be <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>It Takes Two</em>.</p>
<p>However, as June began its countdown, more <em>Dark Souls</em> advertisements went live, simultaneously announcing the price of <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em>. Especially with the corresponding pre-order interface appearing in the Nebula Games Platform store, many players felt a sense of reassurance.</p>
<p>This time, <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em> was cheaper than its predecessor, priced at 198 Yuan compared to 268 Yuan. Additionally, as before, purchasing through the Nebula Games Platform granted a 20% discount.</p>
<p>As for overseas, the price also saw a reduction to $39.9 USD.</p>
<p>Due to time differences and relevant regional policies, the game would be launched simultaneously worldwide, with only a few regions experiencing a delay of about two days.</p>
<p>Time quickly arrived at the day nearing the game's unlock.</p>
<p>Numerous veteran Firelinkers had already pre-ordered and pre-downloaded the game, eagerly awaiting the moment to enter the game.</p>
<p>In community forums and various player chat groups, many waiting <em>Dark Souls</em> players chatted with each other, full of anticipation for the upcoming Firelinking journey.</p>
<p>In a particular chat group, a group of people were conversing.</p>
<p>“Old Song, Old Zhang, have you guys finished downloading the game?”</p>
<p>A player with the ID “Old Song” replied: “Of course I've downloaded it! Is that even a question?”</p>
<p>“Exactly, I can't wait,” another player with the ID “Old Zhang” chimed in.</p>
<p>Old Zhang: “Oh right, Old Song, what class are you picking at the start?”</p>
<p>Old Song: “Is that even a question? Definitely the Deprived! As a qualified Firelinker, only the Deprived can truly showcase our skill.”</p>
<p>Old Zhang: “Thought the same! How about we have a competition to see who makes faster progress?”</p>
<p>Old Song: “No problem!”</p>
<p>The conversation between Old Song and Old Zhang also ignited the enthusiasm of other Firelinkers.</p>
<p>“Almost there, almost there, only five minutes left, we'll be able to play soon?!”</p>
<p>“I wonder if the new <em>Dark Souls</em> will be harder?”</p>
<p>“It’ll definitely be harder, but I don't think we'll have any trouble, after all, we’re all qualified Firelinkers.”</p>
<p>“You got that right!”</p>
<p>The chat group was filled with laughter for a while.</p>
<p>However, five minutes later, it was as if everyone had collectively lost internet connection; there wasn't a single sound.</p>
<p>In a residential community in the Imperial Capital.</p>
<p>Song Ren, also known as Old Song from the chat group, excitedly opened <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em> on the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>The opening CGI was the same as the one shown at the gameplay Expo.</p>
<p>Clearly, Chen Xu was quite economical in this aspect, adhering to the tradition of using cutscenes as promotional videos, or vice-versa.</p>
<p>Although Song Ren had seen this cutscene countless times by now, he still watched it again.</p>
<p>And watching the cutscene wouldn't make much difference to his competition with Old Zhang.</p>
<p>As the cutscene finished playing, Song Ren felt a little nervous looking at the game's UI interface.</p>
<p>After all, this was <em>Dark Souls</em>; he had suffered quite a bit in the previous game.</p>
<p>Moreover, according to information Chen Xu had previously revealed, the new work's difficulty seemed to have increased.</p>
<p>“It’s just a sequel! How could it possibly stop us Firelinkers?”</p>
<p>Giving himself a pep talk and reciting a slogan, Song Ren entered the game.</p>
<p>The beginning was still the familiar <em>Dark Souls</em> character customization and class selection stage.</p>
<p>In the character customization section, Song Ren noticed a special prompt:</p>
<p>“<code>[Detected that you have a *Dark Souls* save file, would you like to use your previous character customization data?]</code>”</p>
<p>“Hey, this is a pretty good feature! The face I painstakingly crafted before can still be used!” Song Ren was pleasantly surprised, then chose to ignore it and re-created a more unique face.</p>
<p>Can a Firelinker's face be called ugly? No, it’s called personality!</p>
<p>Next, for the starting class, although he had boastfully declared in the group that he would choose the Deprived, he now quietly selected the Knight.</p>
<p>After all, in the previous game, the Knight was considered the most versatile early-game progression class.</p>
<p>Then, for burial gifts, Song Ren noticed some differences.</p>
<p>Like the previous game, Goddess's Blessing, Life Ring, and Black Firebomb were all available.</p>
<p>But many items had also been replaced, such as Twin Humanities, Telescope, Old Witch's Ring, and Master Key, none of which were present in the previous game.</p>
<p>For a moment, Song Ren wasn't sure what any of these items were for.</p>
<p>After some thought, Song Ren chose the Master Key.</p>
<p>The Black Firebomb would definitely be very useful for fighting early-game BOSSes, but having cleared the previous game, he had some confidence in his own abilities.</p>
<p>And there was another crucial point: having played the previous game, he knew one of <em>Dark Souls</em>' features was its various shortcuts on the map.</p>
<p>However, these could only be opened later. Now that he had the Master Key, could it be used to open all sorts of shortcuts?</p>
<p>Of course, it could also have other uses, such as good items hidden in a room that required a specific key, and his Master Key could open it directly, or perhaps it was related to rescuing an NPC trapped in a room, like the thief in the previous game.</p>
<p>In any case, he felt that the Master Key should be a relatively good and useful item.</p>
<p>After creating his character, Song Ren clicked to enter the game with anticipation.</p>
<p>Ready to officially begin his Firelinking journey.</p>
