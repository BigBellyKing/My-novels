                <p>Chapter 283: Esports Planning and New Version Plans (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>During the period since <code>Warcraft</code> launched.</p>
<p>Aside from the <code>story</code> in the game, which attracted <code>ordinary players</code>, many <code>players</code> who were keen on <code>RTS</code> gameplay were also studying the <code>gameplay</code> and content of <code>Warcraft</code>.</p>
<p>Completely on par with <code>Warcraft</code>'s <code>single-player story</code>, many <code>players</code> discovered that the <code>RTS</code> gameplay content of this game was far more complex than they had imagined.</p>
<p>In the beginning, most <code>players</code> basically just kept <code>producing units</code>, creating <code>heroes</code>, then <code>fast tech</code>-ing to <code>all-in push</code>.</p>
<p>As for anything else, they were completely baffled.</p>
<p>But as <code>players</code> gradually gained understanding, many <code>RTS masters</code>, leveraging the game's characteristics, discovered the impact of high-level <code>heroes</code> on the battle.</p>
<p>Moreover, <code>heroes</code> could also use <code>items</code>, and some simple <code>tactics</code> were invented.</p>
<p>For instance, in the <code>early game</code>, letting <code>common soldiers</code> accompany <code>heroes</code> to <code>level up</code> to increase <code>hero</code> levels faster.</p>
<p>At the same time, there were some targeted playstyles, such as the <code>Orc</code> <code>Blademaster</code> having <code>Wind Walk</code>, allowing them to <code>harass</code> <code>Peasants</code> in the enemy's base.</p>
<p>They would tail enemy <code>creeping</code> units, then use <code>Wind Walk</code>'s bonus damage to <code>last hit</code> to <code>snatch experience</code> and <code>items</code>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to counter early <code>harassment</code> from <code>Blademasters</code> and faster-moving <code>Demon Hunters</code>, some <code>players</code> also discovered the mysteries of <code>Warcraft</code>'s <code>building placement</code>, such as blocking the path to the <code>gold mine</code> to prevent <code>harassment</code>.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>In <code>Nebula Games</code>' office, <code>Chen Xu</code> was currently testing <code>Warcraft</code>'s <code>Map Editor</code>.</p>
<p>Just then, a knock sounded on the office door. After receiving the notification, <code>Lin Rou</code> walked in.</p>
<p>“<code>Mr. Chen</code>, <code>Shark TV</code> contacted us, saying they hope to obtain authorization for a <code>Warcraft</code> <code>esports event</code>,” <code>Lin Rou</code> said to <code>Chen Xu</code>.</p>
<p>“<code>Esports event</code>? Elaborate,” <code>Chen Xu</code> asked, slightly taken aback by <code>Lin Rou</code>'s words.</p>
<p>The <code>esports event</code> aspect was actually part of <code>Chen Xu</code>'s plan.</p>
<p>It was just that <code>Chen Xu</code> hadn't considered it for the current stage.</p>
<p>Mainly because the skill level of <code>Warcraft</code> <code>players</code> was still <code>uneven</code>.</p>
<p>To be honest, hosting a <code>Warcraft</code> tournament wouldn't have much <code>credibility</code>.</p>
<p>Moreover, for <code>players</code>, it was still largely a <code>learning phase</code>, and the <code>spectator appeal</code> wasn't that strong.</p>
<p><code>RTS</code> was considered a relatively special genre among <code>esports</code> titles.</p>
<p>If one understood it, it was absolutely the most <code>spectator-friendly</code>.</p>
<p>But if one didn't understand it, it would be <code>completely baffling</code>.</p>
<p>Because even if you didn't understand <code>esports</code> titles like <code>FPS</code> and <code>MOBA</code>,</p>
<p>You could still grasp simple information like <code>solo kills</code> or a <code>one-health comeback kill</code> against <code>one hundred health</code>.</p>
<p>But what about <code>RTS</code>?</p>
<p>That involved <code>macro</code> aspects.</p>
<p>For instance, if a <code>hero</code> died once, some <code>players</code> would immediately <code>call GG</code>; if a few <code>Peasants</code> died, they'd immediately <code>call GG</code>.</p>
<p>For <code>players</code> who understood the <code>game mechanics</code>, they knew this was quite normal.</p>
<p>Because they were already too far behind, this amount of time was enough for the opponent to build a significant advantage and <code>macro</code> them to death.</p>
<p>But for <code>players</code> who didn't understand, it felt <code>bewildering</code>; they had no grasp of the <code>tactics</code>. From their perspective, one side lost a <code>hero</code> and three <code>units</code>, then suddenly surrendered. They might even suspect <code>match-fixing</code>.</p>
<p>At this stage, launching <code>RTS</code> competitions wasn't, in <code>Chen Xu</code>'s opinion, a particularly good idea.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the <code>Parallel World</code>, the <code>esports industry</code> wasn't as backward as one might think; on the contrary, it was quite prosperous.</p>
<p><code>Third-party event organizers</code>, various <code>sponsorship channels</code>, well-regulated <code>clubs</code>, and corresponding <code>guilds</code> were all very well-established.</p>
<p>This also meant that there were quite a few <code>RTS esports</code> titles.</p>
<p>Although <code>Warcraft</code> was <code>popular</code>, did people want to operate <code>esports</code> projects for it right after launch?</p>
<p>With <code>doubt</code>, <code>Chen Xu</code> listened to <code>Lin Rou</code>'s explanation and then <code>suddenly realized</code>.</p>
<p>“<code>Shark TV</code> wants to organize a <code>platform</code> event?” <code>Chen Xu</code> asked, looking at <code>Lin Rou</code>.</p>
<p>It was simple: the <code>live streaming platforms</code> saw that <code>Warcraft</code>'s <code>popularity</code> was very high, and there were also many <code>RTS masters</code> among the <code>streamers</code> signed to the <code>platform</code>. So, they wanted to purchase a <code>platform event authorization</code> from <code>Nebula Games</code> to host a <code>Shark TV Warcraft Monthly Tournament</code> format, where <code>Shark TV</code>'s contracted <code>streamers</code> would compete.</p>
<p>As for <code>sponsorship</code>, <code>prizes</code>, and <code>operations</code>, <code>Shark TV</code> would handle everything. <code>Nebula Games</code> would merely <code>oversee</code> it, <code>glancing</code> over things, and then <code>collect the money</code>.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, the <code>platform</code> wanted to hold an <code>event</code> and attach an <code>esports</code> name to it. As for the content, it would be similar to the early <code>internet cafe tournaments</code> of <code>esports</code>.</p>
<p>There would be no <code>offline audiences</code> or <code>offline venues</code>.</p>
<p>“Contact the people at <code>Shark TV</code> regarding this; we can discuss it. However, we should also establish a dedicated <code>department</code> ourselves to first learn the relevant content and <code>insights</code>,” <code>Chen Xu</code> said to <code>Lin Rou</code> after some thought.</p>
<p><code>Chen Xu</code> also valued the <code>esports event</code> sector highly.</p>
<p>It wasn't for money or <code>tournament revenue</code>.</p>
<p>What <code>Chen Xu</code> cared about most was the <code>promotion</code> of the game through such <code>esports events</code>.</p>
<p>When a game has a suitable pond (environment), <code>esports</code> can be a great way to consolidate <code>player stickiness</code> and <code>IP</code>.</p>
<p>For example, in his <code>previous life</code>, games like <code>League of Legends</code> and <code>DOTA</code> — even if their <code>player</code> numbers decreased, the overall <code>IP value</code> of the games did not decline at all.</p>
<p>Because many <code>players</code> would still <code>watch matches</code> even if they didn't play the game, and for <code>Warcraft</code>, cultivating such <code>IP value</code> was clearly very necessary.</p>
<p>Of course, it was also important to strike a balance: <code>third-party events</code> and <code>official events</code> should proceed simultaneously.</p>
<p>Like <code>Blizzard</code> in his <code>previous life</code>, if you say they had the ability, they wanted to <code>monopolize profits</code>, which led to <code>StarCraft 2</code> falling out with <code>third-party organizers</code> during its <code>golden age</code>, <code>squandering</code> a good hand.</p>
<p>But if you say they lacked ability, for games like <code>Overwatch</code>, whose <code>popularity</code> continued to decline, the <code>clubs</code> and <code>events</code> were still managed well, even to the point where <code>everyone had a livelihood</code>.</p>
<p>This collaboration with <code>Shark TV</code>, besides further <code>promoting the game</code>, also aimed to cultivate <code>Nebula Games</code>' internal understanding of the <code>esports industry</code>.</p>
<p>After all, <code>Nebula Games</code> would inevitably develop this type of game in the future.</p>
<p>And <code>esports-type games</code>, if <code>operated well</code>, were essentially <code>evergreens</code>.</p>
<p>As for how <code>Shark TV</code> would actually organize the first <code>Warcraft</code> '<code>internet cafe tournament</code>', that could be discussed later.</p>
<p>After speaking with <code>Lin Rou</code>, <code>Chen Xu</code> also sent a message in the <code>work group chat</code>.</p>
<p>Asking <code>HR</code> to see if there were any <code>employees</code> willing to <code>transfer positions</code>, and to <code>recruit new staff</code>.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>“<code>Mr. Chen</code>, are we going to hold an <code>esports tournament</code>?” After talking with <code>Lin Rou</code>, <code>Chen Xu</code> stretched a bit and walked towards the <code>project office</code>. Seeing <code>Chen Xu</code> arrive, everyone seemed a little <code>curious</code>.</p>
<p>“Just granting authorization for <code>Shark TV</code> to organize it. Our own direct <code>department</code> will learn from the experience. Even if we officially host one later, it'll mostly be outsourced to <code>third parties</code>. We just need to understand this area and know how to <code>operate competitive games</code>,” <code>Chen Xu</code> said, shaking his head.</p>
<p>“But speaking of which, <code>Warcraft</code> indeed meets the conditions for hosting tournaments now,” <code>Qin Yi</code> said.</p>
<p>Currently, <code>Warcraft</code> has been online for a while, having passed its <code>initial phase</code>, and <code>player</code> skill levels have gradually diverged.</p>
<p>Coupled with <code>Warcraft</code>'s <code>popularity</code> in the country, it has essentially <code>crushed</code> other <code>RTS</code> games.</p>
<p>Therefore, various <code>clubs</code> have been rumored to be <code>transitioning</code> their <code>other RTS game divisions</code> into <code>Warcraft</code> divisions.</p>
<p>With the influx of other <code>RTS</code> <code>professional players</code>, there's no shortage of so-called <code>master players</code>.</p>
<p>“Alright, enough talk. You've had enough rest lately, so start preparing the <code>new version plan</code> for <code>Warcraft</code>,” <code>Chen Xu</code> said, smiling at them.</p>
<p>He took out a <code>document</code> that had already been printed beforehand.</p>
<p>“Uh! A <code>new version plan</code>!?” Everyone was a little <code>surprised</code>. A new version so soon?</p>
<p>However, when they saw the <code>document</code> in front of them, they were even more <code>bewildered</code>.</p>
<p>What is this supposed to be?</p>
<p>‘<code>Defend the Sword Pass</code>’ ‘<code>Pyramid Escape</code>’ ‘<code>Demon Hunter Chronicles</code>’ ‘<code>Monopoly of the World</code>’ ‘<code>Calamity of the Western World</code>’ What are these?</p>
<p>How did <code>Warcraft</code> get involved with <code>Pyramids</code> and <code>Sword Pass</code>?</p>
