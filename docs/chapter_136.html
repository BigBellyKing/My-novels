                <p>Chapter 235: Monster Hunter: World (Fifth Update, please subscribe for monthly votes)</p>
<p>After Chen Xu left, the team members couldn't help but start discussing.</p>
<p>“Hunting? The new game is actually a hunting theme? This genre seems rather niche, doesn't it?” Ruan Ningxue said, somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>Although Nebula Games Platform is currently flourishing, and <em>Minecraft</em>'s popularity is soaring.</p>
<p>However, according to the subsequent development Chen Xu discussed with them in the meeting, Nebula Games should focus on large-scale games next.</p>
<p>The main goal is to further expand the stickiness of platform players.</p>
<p>After all, for a platform, while Independent Games and medium-to-small scale games from second and third-tier developers are the cornerstone,</p>
<p>blockbusters that serve as the platform's face are equally important, as they need to continuously attract players.</p>
<p>But for hunting games, whether domestically or internationally, there doesn't seem to be anything particularly outstanding.</p>
<p>“That's right, the best-selling hunting game seems to be <em>The Wilderness</em> from a foreign UA Company, and games of this genre also seem very prone to opposition from some animal protection associations abroad,” Yang Xin agreed with a nod.</p>
<p>“Oh, by the way, Brother Qin, weren't you previously responsible for the optimization and research of the new AI technology? The new game will definitely apply it, right?” Lin Tao asked, thinking of something, looking at Qin Yi, who had been silent.</p>
<p>Hearing that someone finally asked him, Qin Yi, who had been silent, smiled and lightly coughed twice: “Cough, cough, of course! The performance of the new AI technology will definitely be very impressive. Actually, it is said that Mr. Chen's initial plan was to create a game that could utilize a large number of NPCs.”</p>
<p>“However, during testing, it was discovered that the current technical capabilities were still slightly insufficient, even for VR platforms. While it wouldn't be impossible to scale it back, doing so would eliminate the maximum AI expressiveness. So, as a compromise, Mr. Chen proposed a solution: apply the AI to specific monsters, allowing players to experience the joy of hunting. That's how a hunting game was finally decided upon.” Qin Yi recalled his previous conversation with Chen Xu in the office, his face also filled with excitement.</p>
<p>“I see!” Ruan Ningxue and the others suddenly understood, and various scenes began to form in their minds.</p>
<p>“The latest AI technology, providing players with a vivid hunting experience. This does seem to have some potential,” Lin Tao speculated.</p>
<p>“Lions, tigers, and we can even be bolder! For example, extinct saber-toothed tigers, mammoths – all of these could be prey for hunting!” Yang Xin boldly hypothesized.</p>
<p>“But what about the game's setting?” Ruan Ningxue considered the game background.</p>
<p>“That's simple, a Time Travel Machine! Like present-day poachers, in the future, the Time Travel Machine has been successfully developed. However, criminals use these machines to go back in time to hunt rare and extinct animals from the future. But this creates a Time Paradox, causing the existence information of these creatures to completely disappear in the future. So, the player's role is to stop these temporal poachers.” Yang Xin's imagination ran wild.</p>
<p>“Sister Xin, wouldn't that make it an action-adventure game? Mr. Chen said it's a hunting game. This would be about restraining poachers; you can't knowingly break the law, right?” Ruan Ningxue said.</p>
<p>“Then have players act as poachers? No, that wouldn't be very morally sound,” Yang Xin scratched her head.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the lounge, while Ruan Ningxue and the others were still making bold hypotheses and pondering carefully.</p>
<p>In his office, Chen Xu was refining the Concept Drafts for the upcoming game.</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, the project name for the game to be developed next, was displayed on the computer screen.</p>
<p>In fact, before this, thanks to the latest AI technology, Chen Xu had originally intended to develop other types of games.</p>
<p>For example, an open-world type game.</p>
<p>Compared to sandbox games, open-world games are arguably an equally great game genre.</p>
<p>But they are completely opposite to sandbox games.</p>
<p>Both share a common core: allowing players to feel free.</p>
<p>However, they also have completely different points of conflict.</p>
<p>Namely, sandbox games are about creating a world, while open-world games involve the designer creating a world for players to become a part of.</p>
<p>This is why many players often confuse these three different genres: sandbox, box garden, and open world.</p>
<p>And to present a vibrant open world to players, NPCs are an indispensable part.</p>
<p>With the latest AI technology, if NPCs in the game can behave more logically, it would undoubtedly lead to an explosive increase in player experience.</p>
<p>Because a lively world is the standard for an open world. Of course, exploration and puzzle-solving like in <em>Breath of the Wild</em> falls into another major direction.</p>
<p>However, after testing, given the current technology and player hardware standards, it was still insufficient to achieve the effect Chen Xu desired.</p>
<p>But for a small number of individual or multiple creatures, showcasing AI performance is entirely feasible.</p>
<p>Therefore, after some tests, Chen Xu decided to choose <em>Monster Hunter</em>, as it seemed quite fitting with the current feedback.</p>
<p>As for why <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> was chosen, it's mainly because it's quite special.</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter: World</em> is definitely a monumental installment in the <em>Monster Hunter</em> series.</p>
<p>One could even say that its release directly saved the <em>Monster Hunter</em> series, which was on the verge of death.</p>
<p>In his previous life, <em>Monster Hunter</em> had always been released on handheld consoles, but the series' sales continuously declined. Sales peaked at 5 million with P3, but by XX, they hadn't even reached 2 million.</p>
<p>So, the series finally decided to make a revolutionary breakthrough: move away from the weak performance of handheld consoles and release console and PC versions.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> captivated all players.</p>
<p>Because it was with this installment that players truly realized how magnificent the Ancient Dragons they hunted truly were.</p>
<p>And how splendid the world inhabited by Ancient Dragons truly was.</p>
<p>At the same time, the new <em>Monster Hunter</em> also received specific optimizations, such as the removal of loading zones. Players no longer had to <em>ding</em> and strike an awkward pose when drinking potions.</p>
<p>While preserving the authentic core fun, many negative experiences were optimized, making the overall game combat much smoother.</p>
<p>Of course, reduced difficulty was also a factor, as previous series had difficulties like Super Special and G-Rank 140.</p>
<p>In comparison, the Arch-Tempered Elder Dragon setting in <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> was much gentler.</p>
<p>After all, in Super Special and G-Rank 140 difficulty modes, our cute little hunter could be brushed by a dragon's foot, tail, or wing and might have to return to camp to regroup. How could a normal player withstand that?</p>
<p>Better catering to beginner experiences, coupled with a seamless open world, a complete and vibrant ecological chain, and thrilling hunting experiences.</p>
<p>These factors made <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> the best-selling installment in the series.</p>
<p>First-month sales exceeded 7.5 million.</p>
<p>In just one month, it broke the series' previous highest sales record.</p>
