<p>Chapter 135 (Fifth Update, Requesting Subscriptions)</p>
<p>While Chen Xu was developing the subsequent new modes,</p>
<p>the overseas version of <em>Dark Souls</em>, after a period of promotional warm-up, finally launched and unlocked in multiple countries.</p>
<p>According to different regional standards, the game's price varied.</p>
<p>For example, in European countries, the game was priced at 44.9 Euros, in North America at 44.9 US dollars, and in the UK at 44.9 pounds sterling.</p>
<p>Compared to typical blockbusters on the market, it was priced 5 dollars cheaper.</p>
<p>Of course, it was still considerably more expensive than in China, as we are a developing country, and prices are naturally set lower.</p>
<p>After <em>Dark Souls</em> launched,</p>
<p>many overseas players who had been following the game in advance purchased it immediately.</p>
<p>They were very curious about this game, which had received high scores from multiple media outlets like GameSpot.</p>
<p>As for whether it would live up to its reputation, it didn't matter; after all, there was always the refund option.</p>
<p>However, upon entering the game, they could immediately confirm one thing:</p>
<p>This game was not a misleading trailer. The actual in-game experience largely matched the previous external promotions.</p>
<p>As they delved into the game's content and time progressed, players worldwide quickly felt the unique charm of <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>...............</p>
<p><strong>[YOU DIED]</strong></p>
<p>In the Cemetery of Ash, Gundyr the Ash, who had been trivialized domestically, finally showcased his might once again overseas.</p>
<p>In different countries, facing different Firelinkers,</p>
<p>Teacher Gundyr's halberd once again demonstrated its terror.</p>
<p>At the same time, through the meticulously crafted death animations, countless foreign players realized that in one game, they could die so naturally, so colorfully, and even learn some Chinese characters along the way.</p>
<p>And when overseas players finally managed to defeat Gundyr the Ash, arrived at the Firelink Shrine, and then proceeded to the High Wall of Lothric,</p>
<p>just like domestic players, they were all abused to the point of dazedness.</p>
<p>Insidious monster placements, cunning ambush traps—</p>
<p>All players experiencing <em>Dark Souls</em> were instantly bewildered.</p>
<p>How could there be such a game?!</p>
<p>Although game media outlets like GameSpot had consistently mentioned 'malicious (game design)' and 'high difficulty' in their reviews,</p>
<p>most players hadn't paid much attention, completely disregarding it.</p>
<p>After all, no matter how malicious or difficult a game was, could it truly beat them to death?</p>
<p>Now they knew: it truly could!</p>
<p>Simultaneously, across major community forums, overseas players were generally discussing the difficulty of <em>Dark Souls</em>, just like domestic players had before.</p>
<p>However, compared to the initial ignorant early-game progression of domestic players who knew nothing,</p>
<p>the large number of overseas players didn't discuss the difficulty topic for too long.</p>
<p>On one hand, media outlets like GameSpot, and even Target Software during their external promotions, hadn't shied away from this topic; it was just that as players, they had never imagined it could be <em>this</em> difficult.</p>
<p>On the other hand, various strategy videos for <em>Dark Souls</em> in China, although not yet covering every aspect and still exploring new approaches,</p>
<p>already had some polished content. Some foreign players specifically came to China to repost <em>Dark Souls</em>-related strategy and analysis videos.</p>
<p>Additionally, some streamers on overseas live-streaming platforms were also following subsequent level guides for <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>This indirectly accelerated the spread of <em>Dark Souls</em>' gameplay.</p>
<p>Therefore, compared to the first batch of domestic players who entered the game at launch and experienced all sorts of malicious levels, overseas players had access to more detailed guides, which made their in-game experience slightly more bearable.</p>
<p>Of course, only <em>slightly</em> more bearable.</p>
<p>“My God, the difficulty of <em>Dark Souls</em> is just too high! I swear, before playing this game, I wouldn't have believed any game dared to do this!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, and the most crucial thing is that this game doesn't even have a difficulty selection feature. You either accept the game's difficulty or you choose to give up on it.”</p>
<p>“I have to say, this is just too cool. This game company did something other game companies wouldn't dare to do. I'm starting to like this game company and the designer who developed this game a little bit.”</p>
<p>“I wonder if this game company has any other works!”</p>
<p>“You can check on YouTube. This is the first large-scale game this company has made. Before this, they were all involved in the independent game field, but their works were equally outstanding.”</p>
<p>“Really? I wonder when they'll be introduced. I want to know more about their works!”</p>
<p>With the launch of <em>Dark Souls</em> overseas, its popularity gradually surged.</p>
<p>If one were to consider just a single country's market, China's population naturally made it incredibly vast.</p>
<p>However, compared to the entire overseas market, even just counting Asia, Europe, and North America, the market was very substantial.</p>
<p>As the buzz slowly fermented, <em>Dark Souls</em>' overseas first-week sales figures were successfully released.</p>
<p>The global single-day sales totaled 220,000 units, which was neither exceptionally high nor particularly low, especially since Nebula Games and Chen Xu didn't have much influence overseas.</p>
<p>Even Target Software, the publishing agent, had little established presence.</p>
<p>It was primarily thanks to ratings from media like GameSpot and online advertising that many overseas players became aware of the game.</p>
<p>Moreover, on the first day, many players adopted a wait-and-see attitude, so sales increased rather than decreased on the second day. When compiling the overseas first-week sales, the figure had already reached 2.3 million units.</p>
<p>And with the current momentum of its popularity, this clearly wasn't the peak.</p>
<p>Overseas monthly sales were very likely to exceed 4 million units.</p>
<p>This wouldn't be a difficult feat.</p>
<p>Almost perfectly mirroring the reactions of domestic players, as players gradually progressed through the story and understood the narrative of <em>Dark Souls</em>,</p>
<p>overseas players also turned their attention to the game's plot. Target Software had already planned promotions in this area.</p>
<p>Collaborating with relevant video creators, various <em>Dark Souls</em> plot background analysis translated/subtitled videos allowed overseas players to grasp the game's epic narrative and despairing story.</p>
<p>These factors also led to another increase in <em>Dark Souls</em>' sales.</p>
<p>Including domestic sales, it was safe to say that <em>Dark Souls</em> joining the ten million sales club was a certainty.</p>
<p>As for the revenue, since it was foreign income, with associated taxes and so on,</p>
<p>it would still take some time for this money to be deposited into the company's account.</p>
