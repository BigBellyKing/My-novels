                <p>Chapter 154: This is Mr. Chen's Original Intention (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Exceptionally high ratings from both media and players, along with discussions and popular posts inviting friends across various gaming communities and forums, all kept the popularity of <em>It Takes Two</em> soaring.</p>
<p>It wasn't just players who paid attention; many game industry designers were also watching <em>It Takes Two</em> and studying the reasons for its success.</p>
<p>Although <em>It Takes Two</em> had very rich content, its main questline offered over a dozen hours of gameplay.</p>
<p>From the first level, the Shed, to the last level, the gramophone, it spanned multiple scenes.</p>
<p>However, at its core, it was still a mid-tier game.</p>
<p>For some independent game designers, the scope of <em>It Takes Two</em> was clearly too large.</p>
<p>But for some second and third-tier game developers, the scale of <em>It Takes Two</em> was definitely something they could afford.</p>
<p>Moreover, compared to the major first and second-tier game developers, who mostly focused on FPS, ARPG, and similar genres as their entry point,</p>
<p>Game developers lacking in both funding and capability would generally choose to work on more niche game types and themes.</p>
<p><em>It Takes Two</em> was clearly an excellent model.</p>
<p>There were already relatively few co-op games on the market, and the success of <em>It Takes Two</em> also ignited players' enthusiasm for this genre.</p>
<p>This naturally created a market.</p>
<p>So, what exactly was the secret to <em>It Takes Two</em>'s success?</p>
<p>Could its success be replicated?</p>
<p>Could it be learned from?</p>
<p>These became the core focus points for many game developers and designers.</p>
<p><em>It Takes Two</em>'s level design, numerical design, guidance, visual art, music, and various details</p>
<p>were all repeatedly studied and had clearly become a benchmark for co-op games.</p>
<p>However, for Chen Xu, <em>It Takes Two</em> had come to a close.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this game was different from previous titles like <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Overcooked</em>.</p>
<p>This game was not suitable for a Workshop.</p>
<p>Because this game was too complex; the art style of its scene themes, level design, and special item functions were all designed in conjunction with the game's plot and theme.</p>
<p>Any alteration to any part of it would cause damage to the entire game experience.</p>
<p>Therefore, although <em>It Takes Two</em> was a level-designed game, it was completely unsuitable for a Workshop.</p>
<p>Moreover, Chen Xu was largely satisfied with the achievements of <em>It Takes Two</em>.</p>
<p>After all, the initial intention behind releasing this game was to let players experience the joy it offered.</p>
<p>Looking at it now, it could be said to be absolutely perfect.</p>
<p>In Nebula Games' office, Chen Xu leaned back in a massage chair, holding his phone, browsing his official Weibo account and relevant community forums.</p>
<p>Below Chen Xu's official Weibo post were countless comments from players who had experienced <em>It Takes Two</em>.</p>
<p>They were mostly similar, and predominantly full of praise.</p>
<p>However, what made Chen Xu particularly happy was that players had finally come to know him again!</p>
<p>In one sentence, to describe it, it was that the 'Warrior of Love' truly lived up to his name.</p>
<p>As Chen Xu was scrolling on his phone, a knock came at the office door. After receiving a response, Lin Rou entered and informed Chen Xu, "Mr. Chen, the Game Timespace reporter has arrived."</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll be right there." Chen Xu nodded.</p>
<p>After <em>It Takes Two</em>'s reputation and popularity exploded, Game Timespace also contacted Nebula Games to see if they could conduct an exclusive interview with Chen Xu on a gaming topic.</p>
<p>After all, recent major hot topics all revolved around <em>It Takes Two</em>, and Game Timespace wanted to create a news story.</p>
<p>As for Chen Xu, Nebula Games itself had a close collaboration with Game Timespace last year.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Chen Xu had been interviewed by this media outlet before, and the content of the subsequent reports did not make Chen Xu feel uncomfortable, so this time, after learning about it, Chen Xu also agreed to the interview.</p>
<p>Inside the reception room, Chen Xu pushed open the door and entered.</p>
<p>The three Game Timespace staff members sitting on the sofa stood up. Chen Xu actually had a slight impression of the reporter standing in the middle.</p>
<p>"Last year, for Game Timespace's interview with me, it seems like it was also...?" Looking at Wu Tian's name written on the other party's work badge, Chen Xu spoke.</p>
<p>"That's right, Mr. Chen has an excellent memory!" Wu Tian smiled, but in his mind, the scene from last year at this time reappeared.</p>
<p>He was too naive back then, and throughout the entire interview, he unwittingly became a transcriber, completely taken for a ride.</p>
<p>This year, he absolutely couldn't make that mistake again.</p>
<p>Looking at Chen Xu in front of him, Wu Tian, with a smile on his face, thought to himself.</p>
<p>Determined not to make a mistake again, this time he took the initiative: "Mr. Chen, thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule. Shall we start now?"</p>
<p>"No problem, let's get straight to the point. Xiaolin, bring a few bottles of cola." Chen Xu nodded and sat on the sofa, turning to Lin Rou.</p>
<p>Lin Rou, standing nearby, acknowledged and took several bottles of cola from the ice chest to distribute to everyone.</p>
<p>"Thank you..." Taking the iced cola from Lin Rou's hand, Wu Tian instinctively thanked her.</p>
<p>But then he paused, a little stunned; this scene seemed a little familiar.</p>
<p>However, Wu Tian, who had made changes, was smarter this time. As the interviewer, he immediately took the lead: "Mr. Chen, last year, the <em>Dark Souls</em> you developed had a profound impact worldwide and won the Best Role-Playing Game award last year."</p>
<p>"At the same time, online, <em>Dark Souls</em>' plot also sparked heated discussions among players. Many players believed your next work would likely be a sequel to <em>Dark Souls</em>, telling the complete story of <em>Dark Souls</em>. But why did you bring us <em>It Takes Two</em>, a very different kind of game, this year?"</p>
<p>Chen Xu smiled and nodded: "It was mainly a gift for the players. Before this, especially after <em>Dark Souls</em> launched, I found that many players had a slight misunderstanding of me, thinking I particularly enjoyed watching players suffer. Especially after the Game of the Year event, many players misinterpreted my acceptance speech at the time. To be honest, that hurt me quite a bit."</p>
<p>"After all, I have always thought from the players' perspective. ARPGs, RPGs, action-adventure, and casual simulation games—I am not a designer who will stick to the same genre indefinitely. I prefer to challenge myself with various different types of games."</p>
<p>"Of course, one thing will never change, which is my original intention for making games: Every game I make carries my love for the players. I have always been dedicated to bringing players games that can warm and heal their hearts."</p>
<p>"Many players know <em>Dark Souls</em> for its high difficulty, but if players actually study it carefully, they will find that the difficulty of <em>Dark Souls</em> is not so high that it deters everyone. In fact, once you understand <em>Dark Souls</em>' level design, BOSS design, and combat mechanisms, the game becomes very simple."</p>
<p>"The key lies in whether players can find the methods within the game. When players can't find the tricks, they naturally feel it's very difficult, but after finding the tricks, most people can clear the game relatively smoothly. It's just like <em>It Takes Two</em>: once players have synergy and solve the puzzles, they naturally complete the game without much effort. <em>Dark Souls</em> is the same."</p>
<p>"The only difference is that in <em>Dark Souls</em>, this is expressed implicitly, whereas in <em>It Takes Two</em>, I made it explicit."</p>
<p>Wu Tian nodded as he listened to Chen Xu's explanation; something seemed off, but he couldn't quite pinpoint it.</p>
<p>Because these were all facts!</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, may I ask about something players are quite concerned about? That is, will there be a sequel to <em>Dark Souls</em>?" Wu Tian decided to change the topic, fearing he would get drawn in again if they kept talking.</p>
<p>"Of course, it's already in our development plan. The sequel to <em>Dark Souls</em> will be presented as a prequel. However, it might still take some time before it's truly available to players, but players can look forward to it at the gameplay expo in May." Chen Xu smiled.</p>
<p>Although compared to last year, this time, not even a folder had been created, but could a game producer's grand promises be called merely making grand promises? This was called early warm-up.</p>
<p>However, Wu Tian was clearly unaware. At this moment, he was already mentally visualizing the demo for the <em>Dark Souls</em> prequel at the gameplay expo more than a month later.</p>
<p>Wu Tian was excited: "Mr. Chen, what about the difficulty of the <em>Dark Souls</em> prequel?"</p>
<p>Chen Xu smiled: "I've already mentioned this. For every game, I want to bring joy to players and provide them with a heartwarming experience. Furthermore, when making games, I don't consider the question of whether it's difficult or not. It's more about whether it's reasonable."</p>
<p>"As for what I can reveal, I can only say it will be a brand new and insane adventure. Players will experience even greater surprises than before, and I believe it will surpass its predecessor in both artistic merit and gameplay."</p>
<p>Sitting on the sofa, Chen Xu and Wu Tian discussed many related topics, besides <em>Dark Souls</em>, including other content that players were concerned about.</p>
<p>For example, the overseas performance of some Nebula Games titles, and so on.</p>
<p>But for Wu Tian, today's interview content was absolutely explosive!</p>
<p>Especially the thought that there was news about a <em>Dark Souls</em> prequel made him even more excited. After all, he himself was a devoted Firelinker!</p>
<p>Under the sidelong glances of many Nebula employees, Wu Tian left the Nebula Games office building with an incredibly bright smile.</p>
<p>The next day, on Game Timespace's homepage, an exclusive interview article with bold, red font was released: 'This is Mr. Chen's Original Intention.'</p>
