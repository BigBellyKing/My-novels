                <p>Chapter 254: This Is Persecuting Us Longsword Players! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>With the official launch of <code>Monster Hunter: World</code>, countless players immersed themselves in the magnificent <code>New World</code>.</p>
<p>For many players, the first thing they did upon entering the game was naturally to call upon friends and hunt together.</p>
<p>Regarding this aspect, <code>Chen Xu</code> also made some improvements compared to the original version. That is, if friends wanted to team up, the initiator could directly invite three other <code>Hunters</code> to their <code>Astera</code> to depart together, instead of having to accept each quest and then invite them as before.</p>
<p>Of course, during quests, sending a distress signal still involved a <code>Wingdrake</code> making a spectacular entrance.</p>
<p>However, many players, upon starting to play, found that this team-up mode was a little different from what they had imagined.</p>
<p>“No! <code>Sister Han</code>, how did you pull the <code>BOSS</code>'s aggro?!”</p>
<p>In the <code>voice channel</code>, <code>Zhang Yi</code>, who was hunting with <code>Song Ren</code> and the others, heard <code>Joey</code>'s desperate voice.</p>
<p>They saw <code>Joey</code>, armed with <code>Dual Blades</code>, facing the <code>Great Jagras</code>. He had just activated <code>Demon Mode</code>, and without a word, rushed forward with a red glow around him, unleashing a <code>Demon Dance</code>.</p>
<p>But the key was that the first horizontal slash did hit, but then <code>Wang Han</code>, wielding a <code>Hammer</code>, struck the <code>Great Jagras</code>'s rear, and the <code>Great Jagras</code> immediately turned and ran towards <code>Wang Han</code>.</p>
<p>Then everyone watched as <code>Joey</code>'s <code>Dual Blades</code> kept <code>swinging at air</code>, like a <code>cringey dance</code>.</p>
<p>Everyone: ……</p>
<p><code>Wang Han</code> was also speechless: “You can't blame me for this! I can't control who the <code>BOSS</code> attacks.”</p>
<p>But no sooner had she spoken than the <code>Great Jagras</code> turned around and sent <code>Wang Han</code>'s <code>Hunter</code> flying far away with a headbutt.</p>
<p>“Let me handle this! I'll show you the might of my <code>Great Sword</code>! Watch closely, <code>Old Song</code>, and see who truly wields the <code>New World</code>'s ultimate weapon!” <code>Zhang Yi</code> shouted, then charged forward, carrying a <code>Great Sword</code> taller than himself.</p>
<p>Standing directly in front of the <code>Great Jagras</code>, he immediately <code>charged up</code>. The <code>Great Sword</code> was all about momentum: small knife 50, big knife 100.</p>
<p>Spot it… close your eyes… <code>charge up</code>, end the fight!</p>
<p>One swing of this sword, and you might just die!</p>
<p>Once <code>charged up</code>, the <code>Great Sword</code>, gleaming with charging light, smashed heavily into the ground.</p>
<p>Dirt and pooled water splashed up over a meter, and a small crater was formed in the ground.</p>
<p>“Is that your <code>Great Sword</code>? Are you trying to make me die of laughter?!” <code>Song Ren</code>, who had been spectating, finally couldn't hold back when he saw this scene.</p>
<p>The <code>voice channel</code> was filled with his booming laughter.</p>
<p>“Accident! That was an accident!” <code>Zhang Yi</code> felt a bit embarrassed. He had just <code>bragged</code> and then <code>missed completely</code>, how awkward!</p>
<p>But mainly, <code>Zhang Yi</code> had also discovered something in this multiplayer mode: the monsters were truly much harder to hit.</p>
<p>In single-player mode, while having a <code>Palico</code> could be a bit <code>annoying</code>...</p>
<p>...the <code>Palico</code> basically stayed by his side and didn't move much.</p>
<p>The monster would just stand there and let him hit it, sometimes leading to aggro being drawn away, and sometimes making the monster act like a training dummy.</p>
<p>But this was completely different in player multiplayer mode!</p>
<p>Because when facing monsters, players would use <code>rolling</code> to dodge attacks.</p>
<p>This dodging would naturally create distance from the <code>BOSS</code>, and after the person who drew aggro pulled away, the <code>BOSS</code> would follow up, leaving players using charged attacks in the awkward predicament of <code>hoeing the ground</code>.</p>
<p>“Stop explaining! Explaining is just covering up! Let me show you the prowess of my <code>Longsword Hero</code>! A single <code>Long Sword</code> and one person is a magnificent and ultimate performance. Watch me show off!” <code>Song Ren</code>, wielding his <code>Long Sword</code>, sharpened it with a <code>Whetstone</code> nearby.</p>
<p>Although his sharpness was full, what he pursued wasn't sharpness, but the <code>sheathing animation</code> after sharpening his blade.</p>
<p>How stylish, how cool!</p>
<p>This was him, a legendary <code>Longsword Hero</code> of the <code>New World</code>!</p>
<p>“Your <code>Great Sword</code> is no good! Watch my <code>Hammer</code>'s <code>spinning attack</code>!” <code>Wang Han</code> burst out laughing when she saw <code>Zhang Yi</code>'s <code>hoeing the ground</code>. She then slowly <code>charged up</code> her <code>Hammer</code> and ran towards the <code>Great Jagras</code>.</p>
<p>And at this moment, <code>Song Ren</code>, who had finished his <code>sheathing animation</code>, finally made his move.</p>
<p>“Slash, Cleave, <code>Diagonal Slash</code>, <code>Spirit Roundslash</code>!” <code>Song Ren</code> in the game shouted out each of his moves with a strong <code>sense of immersion</code>.</p>
<p>They saw the <code>Longsword Hero</code> in the game perform a very stylish slashing action, filling his <code>Spirit Gauge</code>, followed by a <code>Spirit Roundslash</code>.</p>
<p>And then…</p>
<p>Three teammates who had just approached immediately knelt on the ground, and <code>Wang Han</code>, who was <code>charging up</code> to unleash her <code>spinning attack</code>, was also stunned.</p>
<p>One <code>Spirit Roundslash</code>, with him at the center, left <code>not a blade of grass growing</code> in the vicinity.</p>
<p>“<code>Damn it</code>! <code>Old Song</code>, your <code>Long Sword</code> is insane!” <code>Zhang Yi</code>, who had just approached only to be <code>staggered</code> and then sent flying by the <code>Great Jagras</code>, was <code>bewildered</code>.</p>
<p>Including <code>Joey</code>, who was about to continue his <code>Demon Mode</code> <code>cringey dance</code>, and <code>Wang Han</code>, who was preparing to unleash her <code>Hammer</code>'s <code>spinning attack</code>, they were all <code>bewildered</code>.</p>
<p>It was then that everyone realized that while <code>Monster Hunter: World</code> didn't have so-called <code>friendly fire</code>, attacking teammates could interrupt their moves and cause <code>stagger</code>.</p>
<p>“Oh, don't mind those details! Just get out of the way and let me handle it. A <code>Long Sword</code> is an ultimate performance by one person; just watch me show off!” After unleashing the <code>Spirit Roundslash</code> and successfully <code>entering the Spirit Gauge state</code>, <code>Song Ren</code> struck a pose, preparing to deliver some <code>burst damage</code> with a very cool <code>Helm Breaker</code>.</p>
<p>After two consecutive <code>rolls</code> to create distance from the <code>Great Jagras</code> in front of him, <code>Song Ren</code> unleashed a <code>Spirit Thrust</code>.</p>
<p>They watched as the <code>Hunter</code> in the game took a slight step back, gripped his <code>Long Sword</code> with both hands, and charged straight forward.</p>
<p>With a 'whoosh', the sharp blade pierced the <code>Great Jagras</code>'s body. The <code>Hunter</code> then stomped on the <code>Great Jagras</code>'s body, leaping up with the leverage. Wielding his blade with both hands in the air, the <code>Hunter</code> swung downwards, like a falling meteor.</p>
<p>And then… the <code>Hunter</code> in the game, gripping his <code>Long Sword</code>, slammed it fiercely into the ground.</p>
<p>“Is that your <code>Long Sword</code>'s ultimate performance? Give me a break!” Seeing <code>Song Ren</code>'s attack miss, <code>Zhang Yi</code> couldn't help but laugh out loud.</p>
<p>“Accident, accident, didn't you also make an <code>empty charge</code>?! Hey! What are you guys doing? Stop <code>slacking off</code>! Come quickly and deal damage with me, we've been fighting for ages and this dragon doesn't even have a scratch!” <code>Song Ren</code>, who was currently fighting the <code>Great Jagras</code>, turned around and was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>The three people behind him: one had taken out a <code>capture net</code> and was catching rabbits.</p>
<p>Another had pulled out a <code>Folding Stool</code> and a <code>Portable Grill</code>, sitting there <code>roasting meat</code>.</p>
<p>And one more had taken out a fishing rod and was walking towards the edge of the jungle, seemingly wanting to go fishing by the sea.</p>
<p>“Then stop using <code>Spirit Roundslash</code>!” <code>Zhang Yi</code> said to <code>Song Ren</code>, exasperated.</p>
<p>“Exactly! With your <code>Spirit Roundslash</code>, we can't even move!” <code>Wang Han</code> chimed in.</p>
<p>“He's right!” <code>Joey</code> agreed.</p>
<p>“How can that be?! A <code>Long Sword</code> without a <code>Spirit Roundslash</code>, how can I <code>enter the Spirit Gauge state</code>?! Even after a successful <code>Foresight Slash</code>, I still need to follow up with a <code>Spirit Roundslash</code>!” <code>Song Ren</code> exclaimed, indicating this was unacceptable.</p>
<p>The <code>Long Sword</code> relies on <code>Spirit Roundslash</code> to <code>enter the Spirit Gauge state</code>; if he doesn't use <code>Spirit Roundslash</code>, wouldn't he be <code>dealing very low damage</code> the whole time?</p>
<p>Wouldn't he become a <code>useless person</code> then?</p>
<p>“A <code>Long Sword</code> is a solo performance, <code>Old Song</code>, I'm rooting for you!” <code>Zhang Yi</code> chuckled.</p>
<p>“The <code>Long Sword</code>, a symbol of the strong, and the strong are always solitary!” <code>Wang Han</code>, holding her fishing rod, slowly shuffled her feet towards the edge of the jungle.</p>
<p>“Teammates? Those things are no longer needed. A single <code>Long Sword</code> will conquer the entire <code>New World</code>!” <code>Joey</code>, who had successfully caught a bunny, also exclaimed.</p>
<p>“No, don't! I won't use <code>Spirit Roundslash</code> anymore! Come help me!” Looking at the three people in front of him, and then at the <code>lively and vigorous</code> <code>Great Jagras</code>, <code>Song Ren</code> finally gave in to reality.</p>
<p>Everyone chuckled as they continued fighting the <code>Great Jagras</code>.</p>
<p>The battle proceeded relatively smoothly. Although the monster's <code>health</code> increased in online multiplayer mode...</p>
<p>...with four people, if someone's <code>health</code> was low, they could immediately create distance and drink healing potions, which actually made it safer.</p>
<p>“I suddenly feel like four people teaming up to fight monsters isn't as efficient as when I play alone!” <code>Zhang Yi</code> couldn't help but sigh after the battle.</p>
<p>“Why isn't it efficient? Don't you three have any <code>self-awareness</code>?! You're persecuting us <code>Longsword players</code>!” <code>Song Ren</code> cried out the thoughts in his heart, representing the vast number of <code>Longsword players</code>.</p>
