<p>Chapter 316: No Player Can Resist the -90% Green Bar (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games' office, Chen Xu leaned back on the sofa, chatting with Meng Zuo via video call.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, the Game Department gave Rainbow Six Siege a very high evaluation!" Meng Zuo said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>The media scores weren't particularly high or low.</p>
<p>But apart from players, Rainbow Six Siege also received high praise from the Game Department.</p>
<p>This was mainly because Rainbow Six Siege's characteristics were too distinct.</p>
<p>From a training perspective, the military version of Rainbow Six Siege was actually more about training ideology.</p>
<p>For example, teamwork, timely reporting of various information, and feedback.</p>
<p>When it came to actual combat, the content in VR certainly couldn't be the primary focus.</p>
<p>But even so, compared to other games, even the military versions provided in previous years, Rainbow Six Siege performed exceptionally well.</p>
<p>"How are your preparations for the subsequent versions at NetDragon?" Chen Xu smiled, not directly answering, but instead asked.</p>
<p>"The ranking system has been completed. There's already a significant gap between the current casual player base and high-level players, and it will likely go live after the New Year," Meng Zuo said.</p>
<p>During this period, he was also feeling quite pleased with himself.</p>
<p>He participated in the Rainbow Six Siege project, which could be said to be a great success, and Chen Xu was unaware of it.</p>
<p>As a NetDragon employee, Meng Zuo had quite a few information channels.</p>
<p>As for TengHua and the Channel Alliance, the new game they had been promoting for a while was now silent.</p>
<p>Ordinary players didn't know yet, but according to some internal information from NetDragon, it was highly likely that the project had been cut.</p>
<p>After all, Rainbow Six Siege's performance was arguably too outstanding.</p>
<p>In this situation, both the market and the Game Department found it difficult to overshadow Rainbow Six Siege.</p>
<p>Immediately canceling the project to cut losses was a relatively rational move.</p>
<p>This also caused considerable excitement within NetDragon.</p>
<p>Including Meng Zuo, who stood with the faction supporting NetDragon's cooperation with Nebula Games, he also received a promotion and a raise.</p>
<p>And now he had entered NetDragon's management, gaining a certain degree of influence.</p>
<p>After chatting with Meng Zuo for a while, Chen Xu hung up the phone.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the PC version of Rainbow Six Siege would be ported and developed by NetDragon.</p>
<p>Based on the VR version, some detailed actions and visual fidelity might be reduced.</p>
<p>However, the main content would not differ much from the VR version.</p>
<p>At the same time, cross-platform matchmaking would also be added to the game.</p>
<p>After all, the VR version and PC version had slightly different control schemes.</p>
<p>To be honest, in the Parallel World, the VR version was actually easier to control than the PC version.</p>
<p>This was because it offered stronger realism and immersion, while shooting in real life was actually very difficult.</p>
<p>But VR was still a game after all, so compared to the PC platform, which used mouse and movement for aiming.</p>
<p>Generally, VR games used eye-tracking combined with aim correction.</p>
<p>Therefore, this cross-platform matchmaking needed to be enabled, allowing players to choose freely.</p>
<p>As for the projects, there wasn't much left to do.</p>
<p>Because the Spring Festival was approaching.</p>
<p>The main focus was to seize the opportunity to launch some events for the platform and the games currently in operation.</p>
<p>Launching events essentially served three purposes: one was to boost game popularity, another was revenue, and the third was to appease players.</p>
<p>Sometimes, even if you don't want to rely on holiday events to boost popularity or revenue, you still have to hold events.</p>
<p>Because if you don't hold events, the players will revolt.</p>
<p>Other games are holding events! Why aren't you?!</p>
<p>What, you're saying other games hold events to trick players into spending money?</p>
<p>Then we're willing to be tricked into spending money for cool skins and fashion!</p>
<p>If you release a swimsuit Auntie IQ skin, see if we won't buy it like crazy!</p>
<p>Hmm... that's not right either, after all, the art style and game background are too conflicting.</p>
<p>So, forget the swimsuits! If you release a pink, anime-style gun, see if we won't buy it like crazy!</p>
<p>For many players, sometimes a continuously operated game, especially one with in-app purchases.</p>
<p>During holidays and festivals, if there are no such temporary events, players feel utterly uncomfortable!</p>
<p>As for Chen Xu, there really wasn't much he could do.</p>
<p>Because Nebula Games currently operated quite a few games.</p>
<p>Including the original Overcooked, which was still being stably operated.</p>
<p>Although the daily peak concurrent player count was only around ten thousand.</p>
<p>But it was still stably operating, just without any official content updates.</p>
<p>It relied more on the Workshop player community and official reviews and approvals of player suggestions.</p>
<p>Currently, the truly operable games were only Sanguosha, Fall Guys, and the recently launched Rainbow Six.</p>
<p>However, there wasn't much that could be done with the game content itself.</p>
<p>But Nebula Games' biggest asset right now wasn't games, it was the platform!</p>
<p>"Let's proceed with this model. Game developers will voluntarily participate in the events, and we'll clearly explain the pros and cons to them," Chen Xu said, nodding at Zhang Yida.</p>
<p>This year marked Nebula Games' first major promotion.</p>
<p>Last year, when the Nebula Games Platform was just established, Chen Xu didn't adopt any major promotion models due to the limited number of games.</p>
<p>It relied more on the platform continuously releasing new games.</p>
<p>The situation was different now; NetDragon and Nebula Games had formed a strategic partnership.</p>
<p>The game library immediately became richer. As for promotions, Chen Xu had already communicated with NetDragon in advance.</p>
<p>NetDragon had no objections and was quite cooperative.</p>
<p>Chen Xu guessed that Rainbow Six Siege's performance had clearly satisfied NetDragon.</p>
<p>At the same time, Rainbow Six Siege was not a one-time transaction.</p>
<p>Subsequent weapon skins and other items were also important revenue streams.</p>
<p>The rest was communication with various major developers.</p>
<p>"But Mr. Chen, isn't this discount a bit too generous? Many manufacturers also have concerns about this," Zhang Yida asked.</p>
<p>"What's there to worry about? Digital games aren't physical products; players will buy them immediately when they can be sold at their maximum potential. Besides, the games in the major promotion are basically those that have been online for over a year. Aren't Monster Hunter: World and Warcraft not among them?" Chen Xu said.</p>
<p>Zhang Yida nodded, then discussed this platform event with Chen Xu again.</p>
<p>Some classic games, as well as some niche games with good reputations, would all be included in this New Year's special offer.</p>
<p>No one could resist the temptation of a -50% or even higher green bar; it was the last straw that broke the camel's back.</p>
<p>It was the wicked little hand reaching into players' wallets.</p>
<p>When they saw that percentage green bar, a man's smile involuntarily appeared in the players' minds.</p>
<p>As if under some control, players willingly handed over their wallets.</p>
<p>Besides the popular green bar.</p>
<p>The rest were the company's event arrangements.</p>
<p>After all, Nebula Games had quite a few employees.</p>
<p>They arranged it at a five-star hotel and hired a professional performance team.</p>
<p>As for year-end bonuses, all departments had already distributed them.</p>
<p>At that time, every employee attending the annual meeting, regardless of their position, would receive a uniform 5888 red envelope, and the annual meeting prizes would basically be closely related to games.</p>
<p>Such as custom-made themed computers, mobile phones, VR gaming pods, and so on.</p>
<p>Employees across all departments were very happy, immersed in this joyful atmosphere.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu certainly had happy emotions, but this was more of a ceremonial formality; the main focus was still next year's R&amp;D plan.</p>
