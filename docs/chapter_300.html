                <p>Chapter 299: VR Game Design Competition Announcement (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Many people thought of another game under Nebula Games: Minecraft.</p>
<p>The reason Minecraft became so popular, besides its unique gameplay, was primarily its very complete game community.</p>
<p>And now, Warcraft's map editor is clearly the same.</p>
<p>Paired with the Nebula Games Platform's Workshop, it creates a player community.</p>
<p>Many designers in the industry were amazed.</p>
<p>Especially when recalling the early situation of the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>Clearly, since the launch of Overcooked, Nebula Games had already been consciously maintaining this aspect of its community.</p>
<p>Of course, not all game designers were moved to sigh.</p>
<p>For example, Zhou Qi from Hero Entertainment.</p>
<p>He felt he should probably go to the hospital for a check-up.</p>
<p>The ups and downs of life were simply too stimulating.</p>
<p>He originally thought that Warcraft would carve up the RTS player base, and Human Wars might carve up the casual player base.</p>
<p>But now, he clearly understood one thing.</p>
<p>That is, Warcraft wants it all.</p>
<p>He had been happy for nothing these past few days.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Compared to the designers who showed various emotional changes because of the Warcraft editor,</p>
<p>Chen Xu's mood was quite good at the moment.</p>
<p>For Chen Xu, the overall layout for Warcraft was basically complete.</p>
<p>On the Ladder Ranking, various other types of tactics had also been developed by players.</p>
<p>For example, some simple, all-purpose tactics from his previous life, Heaven and Earth Dual Ghosts, and even some tactics Chen Xu had never seen before, which were unfamiliar yet refreshing, had also been developed.</p>
<p>As for whether they were effective, that hadn't been demonstrated on the professional stage yet, so no one could say for sure.</p>
<p>In addition, various overseas and domestic competitions had already shown signs of emerging.</p>
<p>All of this would keep Warcraft active for a period in the future.</p>
<p>As for Warcraft's content itself, for these core RTS players, it could be said that even playing for ten years probably wouldn't make them tired of it.</p>
<p>Beyond that, a large number of players who weren't particularly interested in RTS gameplay had flocked to play RPG maps.</p>
<p>In fact, this segment of the player base was even larger.</p>
<p>According to the current backend data statistics from the Nebula Games Platform,</p>
<p>The number of people playing RPG maps daily was gradually catching up to regular RTS matches.</p>
<p>This was somewhat expected.</p>
<p>After all, not everyone possessed enough hand speed to experience the pure charm of RTS.</p>
<p>Including Warcraft in his previous life, even without the impact of later MOBA games, it would still have its players gradually siphoned off by RPG, FPS, and other types of games. This was unchangeable.</p>
<p>Unless the RTS gameplay was simplified.</p>
<p>But without the troop deployment and tactical decision-making, could RTS still be called RTS?</p>
<p>Currently, Minecraft and Warcraft, along with the earlier Sanguosha and Fall Guys, still have a stable player base.</p>
<p>Coupled with the openness of the Nebula Games Platform, there are actually quite a few third-party multiplayer games as well.</p>
<p>It can be said that for the current platform, this area is basically stable.</p>
<p>But as for what to do next, Chen Xu hadn't quite figured it out yet.</p>
<p>However, after more than half a year of continuous high-load operation for the company's internal teams, Chen Xu made a decision.</p>
<p>That was to organize a vacation activity for all employees.</p>
<p>Of course, it would be in batches, as the company still needed staff.</p>
<p>As for the vacation destination, they wouldn't go abroad.</p>
<p>After all, foreign countries were quite chaotic, and weren't the beautiful mountains and rivers of their own country worth seeing?</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>Returning to the company from the airport, the journey was quite smooth.</p>
<p>Sitting in the car, Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, Qin Yi, and others were still discussing the various sights and experiences from their trip, organizing the corresponding photos.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chen Xu received a call from an old acquaintance, the enthusiastic Teacher Meng.</p>
<p>"Hello?" Chen Xu was a little curious why Meng Zuo was calling him at this time.</p>
<p>On the other end, Meng Zuo spoke up: "Mr. Chen, have you seen the announcement from the Game Department?"</p>
<p>Chen Xu paused slightly, a bit confused: "Announcement? What announcement?"</p>
<p>"It's the Game Department's Game Design Competition! Mr. Chen, you don't know?" Meng Zuo also paused.</p>
<p>"Game Design Competition? I don't really pay attention to that. After all, it wouldn't be very appropriate for me to participate in any Game Design Competition now." Chen Xu was puzzled.</p>
<p>He had participated in Game Design Competitions two years ago.</p>
<p>But starting last year, he basically ignored them.</p>
<p>After all, with Nebula Games' current scale, participating in such a Game Design Competition would be bullying, wouldn't it?</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, Meng Zuo on the other end understood what was going on: "No, Mr. Chen, log in to the Game Department's official website with your account. This time it's a VR Game Design Competition."</p>
<p>"Ah? Teacher Meng, wait a moment." Chen Xu paused, then pulled out his laptop from his backpack and logged into the Game Department's official website.</p>
<p>At this point, Ruan Ningxue, Qin Yi, and the others beside him also quieted down, curiously watching Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Upon entering the Game Department's official website, Chen Xu understood exactly what Meng Zuo was talking about.</p>
<p>A long string of text announcements, but Chen Xu understood the gist of it.</p>
<p>Simply put, VR games have always been used in various industries, including the military.</p>
<p>Both domestically and internationally, there are VR games specifically for military use.</p>
<p>However, this area is relatively backward in China, so this time there will be a reform.</p>
<p>Of course, real training and actual combat exercises are definitely the main focus. The so-called VR training is more about creating conditions that cannot be replicated in real-world exercises.</p>
<p>Simply put, it's to better cultivate situations like crisis response.</p>
<p>After all, it's impossible to truly put soldiers in danger during real combat exercises.</p>
<p>This time, it's a political task, but participation is voluntary.</p>
<p>After all, the research and development funds for a VR game can easily run into hundreds of millions, and the Game Department obviously can't afford that much.</p>
<p>There will be corresponding subsidies, but they certainly won't be high enough to cover the cost of a game.</p>
<p>The goal is to make the game satisfy the Game Department while ensuring it's profitable.</p>
<p>Of course, there will definitely be two different versions later: one for the military and one for players.</p>
<p>As for the benefits, they are naturally there.</p>
<p>Various cutting-edge technologies developed by the Game Department will be made available to these designers and companies.</p>
<p>And this VR Game Design Competition will also provide designers with the most advanced VR technology currently available.</p>
<p>On one hand, it's to provide specialized training games for the military, and on the other hand, it's to pave the way for new VR equipment.</p>
<p>After reading the entire announcement, Chen Xu had a clear understanding.</p>
<p>"Teacher Meng, you didn't call me just to tell me this, did you?" Chen Xu asked.</p>
<p>"Ahem, I can't hide anything from you, Mr. Chen! This time I'm acting as a bridge. I'm representing NetDragon to contact you, Mr. Chen, hoping to collaborate on a VR game." Meng Zuo said to Chen Xu.</p>
<p>"Hmm?" Chen Xu was surprised.</p>
<p>"After all, a large-scale VR game, especially one with such a special political task, could very well result in a total loss. Sharing the risk is a very normal thing."</p>
<p>"Also, Mr. Chen, NetDragon also wants to establish a strategic partnership with the Nebula Games Platform. If you're interested, Mr. Chen, we can set a time to sit down and talk." Meng Zuo said on the phone.</p>
<p>"Okay, how about the day after tomorrow at 2 PM? Teacher Meng." Chen Xu suggested a time, chatted for a couple of sentences, and then hung up.</p>
<p>At the same time, Chen Xu himself was very surprised.</p>
<p>After all, NetDragon had previously launched its titles on the Channel Alliance, just like TengHua, hadn't it?</p>
<p>Now they were turning around and wanting to cooperate with him.</p>
<p>Although surprised, Chen Xu still decided to meet.</p>
<p>To see what NetDragon's situation was.</p>
<p>The rest was about this VR game.</p>
<p>Chen Xu actually had some ideas for the direction of this Game Department VR Game Design Competition.</p>
