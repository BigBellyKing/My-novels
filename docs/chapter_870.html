                <p>Chapter 869: A Perfect Experience</p>
<p>Kirby in the game, waving his pink little fists, punched Link repeatedly.</p>
<p>Combo counter UI constantly popping up in his vision, coupled with excellent vibration feedback, made Song Ren feel like he had become a fighting master!</p>
<p>Even though it was just the lowest-level AI, it made him feel a unique sense of exhilaration.</p>
<p>This type of fighting game, although Song Ren wasn't very fond of playing them, he had some exposure to them.</p>
<p>For the fighting games he had played before, Song Ren only had one feeling: that they were too difficult to pick up.</p>
<p>Special moves relied entirely on button mashing; if he didn't look at the move list, he wouldn't know how to perform the moves at all. Sometimes, even if he did look, he still couldn't execute the skills.</p>
<p>It could be said that those fighting games, for him, felt like he had bought an incomplete version, where his fighter naturally had fewer special skills than others. What was the point of playing then?!</p>
<p>But this Smash Bros. game gave him a completely different feeling at first glance.</p>
<p>At the previous Direct presentation released by Nebula Games, he could sense that this game lowered the barrier to entry, but only when playing it himself did he truly realize how convenient this game was.</p>
<p>The entire game only involved directional input combined with buttons. For example, with Kirby, the fighter he was currently using, except for not knowing what the skills did when first starting out, there was basically no situation where he couldn't perform a skill.</p>
<p>And after a little research, Song Ren understood the purpose of the fighters' skills in the game.</p>
<p>In fact, it wasn't just Song Ren; all players currently experiencing the Smash Bros. game had this thought in their minds.</p>
<p>That is, this game was simply too easy to pick up.</p>
<p>Especially the first time experiencing multiplayer mode, it made many players who had never played fighting games before feel absolutely thrilled.</p>
<p>No need to worry about health bars; as long as you were careful not to be knocked off the stage, you could just fight freely.</p>
<p>Coupled with various strange items and events on the map itself, it made combat full of randomness.</p>
<p>Especially players who had never played fighting games before could get an excellent experience in the game.</p>
<p>In addition, for some players who didn't like to fight others, players who got into the game simply because there was an IP character they liked, even more so in the World of Light single-player story mode, felt the charm of fighting games.</p>
<p>Compared to traditional fighting confrontations, in the World of Light story mode, which is mainly about collecting, it also has RPG progression elements and some strategic elements. Furthermore, in World of Light, it also has some sandbox-like features.</p>
<p>After experiencing the normal fighting gameplay in the game, Song Ren did not immediately engage in online battles but chose single-player mode.</p>
<p>Because he wanted to wait for Old Zhang, and then start his first online battle in Smash Bros.</p>
<p>It wasn't because the two had made an appointment; he simply wanted to ensure his first online battle ended in victory.</p>
<p>If he played online against random players, what if he encountered a seasoned fighting game player?</p>
<p>What if he encountered a highly perceptive player?</p>
<p>Song Ren, who was very confident in his skills, felt that there was a high probability his first online battle would fail.</p>
<p>But Old Zhang was different; the other person was still at work at this time, while he could practice for one or two hours. By then, it would be a dimension-reducing strike!</p>
<p>Is it unfair? Unethical? That's right!</p>
<p>“So, here, the Aegis of the Sky is needed to break these mechanisms?”</p>
<p>Song Ren, currently in World of Light, looked at the in-game map with a surprised expression.</p>
<p>The pink, chubby Kirby had now arrived in a highly futuristic city.</p>
<p>He recognized it at a glance: This was the map from </p>
