                <p>Chapter 232: Major Upheaval in the Industry (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Following Nebula Games' official announcement of its platform's transformation.</p>
<p>The entire gaming industry instantly erupted.</p>
<p>Whether it was players, game designers, or major game developers and channel providers, everyone was furiously discussing this major event.</p>
<p>“Damn it! Haven't you heard? The Nebula Games Platform is transforming into a comprehensive digital platform! All game designers' works can now be launched on the Nebula Games Platform!”</p>
<p>“How could anyone <em>not</em> have heard about it? The key is the commission rate! It's actually only a 25% commission rate!?”</p>
<p>“Is that real or fake? It feels too mystical, couldn't be a scam, right?”</p>
<p>“What are you thinking? Nebula Games' official Weibo account has already stated it, and the platform's contract terms have been released directly. The entire industry, including players, is watching, so how could it be fake? Besides, don't you think this looks like something Nebula Games had planned long ago?”</p>
<p>“Indeed! Minecraft directly ignited the attention of countless players, causing Nebula Games' popularity to skyrocket. And right at this moment, the news of the platform's transformation broke out.”</p>
<p>“Actually, this can be considered expected. Nebula Games' development has been too smooth these past two years. And I wonder if you've noticed the details of Nebula Games in the last two years? In its early days, games under Nebula Games basically launched simultaneously on all major channels, but their own platform adopted preferential strategies. In recent years, whether it was It Takes Two or Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame, both launched first on the Nebula Games Platform, and then later on other distribution platforms.”</p>
<p>“Exactly! And this time, Minecraft, along with the previous Don't Starve, didn't even launch on other distribution platforms. Yet, even so, Don't Starve's sales are almost breaking ten million, and Minecraft is heading for twenty million or even higher. At the very least, this indicates one thing: the Nebula Games Platform definitely has a healthy payment environment.”</p>
<p>“I wonder what Chen Xu is thinking. With such a low split, isn't he making money? And this is challenging the unwritten rules of the entire industry!”</p>
<p>“It's a price war! Once the Nebula Games Platform establishes itself, they might change the platform's commission rate. But at least for now, it's definitely a great opportunity! After all, the Nebula Games Platform doesn't have many games yet, so going there now will surely get you some excellent recommendations. With such a large user base there, you're bound to make some money!”</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Inside the NetDragon Games conference room.</p>
<p>Ma Lei, as the president, listened to his subordinates report some data related to the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>“Domestic channels have always followed a 50-50 split rule. If Nebula Games merely wanted to enter the distribution channel arena, there would be no need for such a method. Not to mention how much immediate profit they're giving up, just the number of channel providers they'd offend in the industry would be immense, essentially making enemies of the entire channel system.” Ma Lei's fingers gently tapped on the table as he said in a deep voice.</p>
<p>“But the most crucial point is that Nebula Games has been making steady progress these past few years. Whether it's blockbusters like Dark Souls, independent titles like Don't Starve, Fall Guys, and Valiant Hearts: The Great War, or medium-sized works like Outlast and It Takes Two, they've covered it all. Coupled with the explosion of Minecraft, Nebula Games truly has the confidence for this. Their user base has already formed; even in the worst-case scenario where they lose the channel war, they will still stand undefeated.” Yao Guang, the head of the Platform Channels and Content Business Group, said with some emotion.</p>
<p>“Indeed, it's mainly because Minecraft is just too phenomenal! This one game alone is enough for Nebula Games to establish a firm foothold.” At this point, Ma Lei couldn't help but feel helpless.</p>
<p>Since its release, it has maintained a scorching momentum, with its ultimate peak completely unknown.</p>
<p>Just with this one game, without mentioning anything else, it's enough for Nebula Games to live off its past successes for at least ten years.</p>
<p>And that's not even counting releasing sequels or anything.</p>
<p>Although Minecraft is a buy-to-play game, and its price, excluding the VR version, didn't even exceed one hundred Yuan.</p>
<p>Yet, such enormous sales have already made Nebula Games extremely profitable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a game's revenue isn't solely derived from its in-game store and sales figures.</p>
<p>For some games, IP derivative income can even be more profitable than the game itself.</p>
<p>Minecraft's inherent block-building gameplay clearly has immense development potential.</p>
<p>The crossover with eponymous building block toys, as well as the game's own MOD modules, combined with tie-in toys launched in reality.</p>
<p>For example, by adding a QR code or serial number, players who purchase physical collectible figures can recreate their structures in the game. To differentiate them from ordinary buildings, special features could also be added.</p>
<p>Sitting in his office, Ma Lei, in this very moment, thought of countless ways for Minecraft to generate profit, regretting only that this game didn't belong to NetDragon.</p>
<p>“So, Mr. Ma, what's next?” Yao Guang asked, looking at Ma Lei.</p>
<p>“For now, stabilize the various independent game designers within our channels, and consider lowering our split as a backup plan. Besides, we're not the most anxious ones; TengHua is probably also watching the show. The truly anxious ones should be those pure channel platforms that lack R&amp;D capabilities.” Ma Lei mused for a moment before speaking.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>After Chen Xu announced the transformation of the Nebula Games Platform, TengHua and NetDragon, as the two industry giants, remained on the sidelines, observing.</p>
<p>However, strategies targeting third-party game developers and designers were secretly put into action.</p>
<p>This was mainly because NetDragon and TengHua differed from typical channel providers.</p>
<p>Although both companies are the largest channel providers in the country, and channel commissions are a major source of their income, they do not solely rely on channels.</p>
<p>However, for some purely channel-based platforms, their reactions were much more significant.</p>
<p>Firstly, they directly targeted a large number of independent game designers and third- and fourth-tier game developers, signing exclusive publishing deals.</p>
<p>At the same time, some channel providers directly began to barrage Nebula Games and Chen Xu, stating that this was destroying the game market.</p>
<p>This was mainly because Nebula Games had put too much pressure on them.</p>
<p>If it were just an ordinary game platform engaging in this kind of price war,</p>
<p>with no users and no resources, what reason would game designers have to go there?</p>
<p>Just because your split is low?</p>
<p>You'd still need to be able to sell the games!</p>
<p>But Nebula Games was completely different.</p>
<p>Whether it was resources, users, or capital, they had enough to support their entry into this channel war.</p>
<p>For a time, the entire gaming industry was abuzz with commotion.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chen Xu, at the center of the storm, was quite relaxed.</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games' conference room, a meeting was underway.</p>
<p>“First and foremost, everyone knows that Minecraft has achieved tremendous success. But this is just the beginning. I believe Minecraft's potential extends far beyond this. As more players join and delve deeper into it, this game will have a very long lifespan, so related operations must be handled well.”</p>
<p>“This includes programs summarizing players' game history, and the maintenance of the community environment. These are all things we need to do. Also, regarding the needs of players and MOD makers, we can consider them as appropriate, but everything must revolve around two core points: 'freedom' and 'creativity'.” Chen Xu said, looking at everyone.</p>
<p>He then paused, and Chen Xu continued: “Furthermore, I believe everyone should be aware that Nebula Games is currently facing a significant challenge. Therefore, we will be developing more complex games moving forward, and we must try to accelerate progress. If there's a shortage of personnel, contact the Human Resources Department directly, finalize arrangements, and conduct your own interviews. The final interviews will then be decided by me.”</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu's words, everyone present was extremely excited.</p>
<p>Clearly, the transformation of the Nebula Games Platform, and especially the unprecedented breaking of the entire game distribution channel's unwritten rules, made everyone in the team feel incredibly thrilled.</p>
<p>As gaming professionals, it's safe to say that no one liked the domineering style of current channels.</p>
<p>And now, without a doubt, Nebula Games was playing the role of a dragon slayer.</p>
<p>This real-life 'RPG' undoubtedly filled everyone on the team with surging emotions.</p>
<p>“Next is our future plan. Let me give you an inside scoop: for the foreseeable future, we need to focus on large-scale games to increase player attention on the Nebula Games Platform.” Chen Xu said seriously, looking at everyone.</p>
<p>What is the cornerstone of a game platform?</p>
<p>Blockbusters?</p>
<p>Not really. The cornerstone of a game platform is actually various independent small games, and medium-to-small scale games.</p>
<p>Just like Valiant Hearts: The Great War, Don't Starve, and It Takes Two.</p>
<p>But to support a platform, it needs more than just one or two such games.</p>
<p>Therefore, the participation of third-party developers is essential.</p>
<p>And how to attract third-party game developers?</p>
<p>Nebula Games is currently doing exactly that.</p>
<p>Firstly, with low splits, and secondly, with more active players.</p>
<p>And how to attract player users?</p>
<p>The answer is also simple: blockbusters that can attract players, and specifically exclusive blockbusters.</p>
<p>“Before that, however, Qin Yi, you should continue your research into new AI technology. It will be applied to new games later.” Chen Xu said, looking at Qin Yi.</p>
<p>“Alright, that's all for now. Zhang Yida, please stay; the rest of you can return to your work.”</p>
<p>Inside the conference room, Zhang Yida reported some recent developments to Chen Xu.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, there has been a lot of smear news about us online, and some narratives driven by internet trolls. We have already signed relevant contracts with Sanyuan and Yihua Law Firm and are prepared to initiate lawsuits.” Zhang Yida said.</p>
<p>Currently, Nebula Games has not yet established its own legal department, primarily because it's not yet necessary.</p>
<p>Therefore, all legal affairs are outsourced, and these two firms specialize in civil and commercial law, as well as the online domain.</p>
<p>“You can handle this area. Additionally, regarding platform operation and promotion, we also need to expedite efforts with third-party game designers and developers.”</p>
<p>Chen Xu nodded, told Zhang Yida some things that needed attention, then slowly exhaled and pulled out his phone to check it.</p>
<p>Various chat groups in the industry were all flooded with “+999” messages. At the same time, many game designers with contact information were privately inquiring about the Nebula Games Platform, and the official Weibo account was full of all sorts of comments.</p>
<p>After thinking for a moment, Chen Xu opened the official Weibo account, edited a message, and sent it.</p>
<p>‘Regarding the transformation of the Nebula Games Platform into a comprehensive digital platform, I will simply say two things.’</p>
<p>‘Firstly, the platform's transformation is actually quite reasonable. The Nebula Games Platform has always been committed to providing players with a better gaming experience: a good community environment, a rich Workshop, an evaluation system that can provide feedback for games, including cloud saves and trophy achievement records. We have always hoped to bring players the best possible experience.’</p>
<p>‘As for the commission rate issue that industry peers and players are concerned about, the answer is very simple: Nebula Games does not intend to wage a price war, pushing out competitors and then opportunistically raising prices. The 25% commission rate strategy will never change. Furthermore, for games highly rated by players, the commission rate will be further reduced, to as low as 12%.’</p>
<p>‘As for the question of profitability, I can only say that based on the current platform and community operations, after deducting costs, and according to the current commission ratio, we can achieve a profit of approximately 7%. As the scale expands, the profit margin could reach 9%–10%.’</p>
<p>‘The Nebula Games Platform has never intended to monopolize the so-called game distribution channels. Instead, it aims to provide more developers with a more lenient development environment, bringing players more interesting and enjoyable games.’</p>
<p>Two updates first, the rest as usual.</p>
