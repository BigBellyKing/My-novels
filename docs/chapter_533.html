                <p>Chapter 532: Didn't Backstab? Mr. Chen Has Really Changed! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Of course, while verbally stating that this was something a human could do, Song Ren still personally indulged in such an act within the game.</p>
<p>There was really nothing he could do, he was curious!</p>
<p>He was quite curious about what kind of developments Geralt could have with these different female characters, and what if he missed some hidden plotline?</p>
<p>Just like in White Orchard, there was a quest where Temerian and Nilfgaardian soldiers, fighting on the battlefield, decided to escape together. One soldier asked Geralt to find his brother.</p>
<p>But if Geralt hadn't gone with the brother at that time, the other ordinary soldier would have been abandoned, and only death would await him. The quest to take in the other soldier would only trigger if Geralt went.</p>
<p>So now Song Ren also visited the brothels with a purpose of exploration, but unfortunately, he was disappointed that no hidden quests were triggered.</p>
<p>After lingering in the brothels for a while, Geralt, controlled by Song Ren, was ready to head to the final area: Skellige Isles.</p>
<p>Of course, before going, he also helped Triss solve some problems, working with Dandelion to help Triss and the sorceresses in the city escape.</p>
<p>Just like with Keira, Geralt spent another romantic night with Triss at the top of the watchtower that evening.</p>
<p>At this moment, Song Ren suddenly recalled a line from the White Wolf in the game.</p>
<p>In the game's map, besides various side quests, there were also monster nests, hidden treasure chests, and Places of Power that could increase skill points. When a Place of Power was nearby, the White Wolf would say: “My medallion’s vibrating. Must be a Place of Power.”</p>
<p>But now Song Ren felt that the 'Place of Power' could easily be changed to 'sorceresses,' especially when he had seen Philippa, persecuted by Radovid, on the Novigrad ship earlier. She had even quipped that everyone on board, except for two people, had slept with Geralt.</p>
<p>This wasn't Geralt; this was Geralt the God!</p>
<p>According to the current vibe, Song Ren felt there must be many more to come. He was sure Yennefer couldn't escape, he just didn't know if there were other women.</p>
<p>“Ah, there’s no way to refuse Triss! And there's Yennefer over there, what should I do?” Song Ren couldn't help but sigh.</p>
<p>Could he choose to have them all?</p>
<p>However, while Song Ren was agonizing and the White Wolf in the game was still reminiscing, Dandelion was leaning against a pillar outside the lighthouse.</p>
<p>He said he had an important matter to discuss with Geralt.</p>
<p>“So you stayed in this corner all night?” Song Ren looked at Dandelion in front of him, speechless.</p>
<p>But he was quickly drawn in by the quest plot that Dandelion spoke of next.</p>
<p>Dandelion stated that as long as Radovid, that bald king, existed, his insane persecution would not cease. Furthermore, Dandelion himself was wanted by Redania.</p>
<p>So, whether for the White Wolf himself, for Triss and the other sorceresses, or for Dandelion's own sake, Dandelion decided to assassinate Radovid and wanted to draw the White Wolf into their faction.</p>
<p>“Can I really decide the rise and fall of empires in the game?” Song Ren was also surprised.</p>
<p>Because here he found he had the right to accept or refuse.</p>
<p>This wasn't a fixed path, but rather different branching endings?</p>
<p>Song Ren speculated in his heart.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, he didn't immediately choose to accept the quest.</p>
<p>After all, Ciri was still waiting for him.</p>
<p>Although along the way, he played Gwent, had crude sexual encounters with female elves and sorceresses, and boxed, he hadn't been idle at all, yet he was still very concerned about Ciri's safety.</p>
<p>Arriving at the Skellige Isles, the landscape here was inspired by real-world Norse regions. The people were fierce and believed in nature religions, and the island's kingship was not hereditary but chosen by vote, much like a tribal system.</p>
<p>And here, as Song Ren expected, the main focus shifted to Yennefer.</p>
<p>When Geralt arrived, a funeral was being held on the island for the previous leader. During this, the White Wolf and Yennefer's playful banter and jabs made people smile knowingly.</p>
<p>“You smell wonderful.”</p>
<p>“Geralt, there’s a funeral going on.”</p>
<p>“You still smell wonderful at this funeral.”</p>
<p>Of course, banter was banter, but serious business still had to be done. And by 'serious business,' it wasn't about Yennefer and Geralt having a delightful night on a unicorn; it referred to the investigation into Ciri's whereabouts.</p>
<p>At the same time, players could also feel Yennefer's concern for Ciri here.</p>
<p>Compared to Geralt's composure, Yennefer was much more decisive, and also carried a touch of madness.</p>
<p>At the funeral, she stole the Archdruid's dangerous magic mask and even used forbidden necromancy, causing the island's sacred garden, revered for a thousand years, to wither.</p>
<p>During this time, the two also caught a Djinn. From the conversation between the White Wolf and Yennefer, Song Ren also learned more.</p>
<p>That is, the reason Yennefer and the White Wolf were together was initially due to the magic of this strange creature.</p>
<p>And what Yennefer wanted to do now was to undo the magic to see if their love was magic or real. After lifting the curse, Yennefer felt relieved, stating that everything was the same as before, and she still loved the White Wolf.</p>
<p>At the same time, players could make corresponding choices here. Looking at Yennefer in front of him, Song Ren in the game also sighed.</p>
<p>How to choose?</p>
<p>He had been with Triss before, but could he really bear to refuse Yennefer now?</p>
<p>Clearly, there was no way to refuse!</p>
<p>Sighing, Song Ren silently chose the 'still love' option.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen is simply too much! This is forcing my Geralt to be a scumbag!</p>
<p>But why did he also feel a sense of secret delight?</p>
<p>Song Ren in the game smiled very happily.</p>
<p>As the plot progressed, Yennefer and the White Wolf finally pieced together Ciri's experiences.</p>
<p>The Skellige Isles were where Ciri first appeared and also where she last appeared. The mysterious elven sorcerer from before was Ciri's companion during her escape.</p>
<p>And the strange little monster Geralt saw earlier in Velen was likely either the elven sorcerer or Ciri.</p>
<p>So Geralt returned to Velen, retrieved Uma, and brought him to Kaer Morhen.</p>
<p>Here, old Vesemir wanted to try a gentler method to see if Uma's curse could be lifted, as it was very likely to be Ciri under a curse, but it would take one night.</p>
<p>During this time, Geralt finally had some time to relax. The three Wolf School brothers, reunited after a long separation, drank all night. There was even a scene of them stealing Yennefer's clothes for cross-dressing play, directly demonstrating what 'three brothers under the moon' meant.</p>
<p>The next day, old Vesemir disappointedly stated that his method didn't work. Yennefer, however, decided to boldly use a 'fight fire with fire' approach, employing the witcher's Trial of the Grasses, Ciri's artifact left with Junior, and sorceress's methods.</p>
<p>With this three-pronged approach, the curse was lifted, but it wasn't Ciri, but the elven sorcerer. However, he revealed that he had hidden the heavily injured Ciri.</p>
<p>The White Wolf, having obtained the clue, immediately set off to find Ciri, while the others remained in Kaer Morhen, preparing to confront the approaching Wild Hunt.</p>
<p>But when the White Wolf arrived at the indicated small island, he only found Ciri's cold corpse.</p>
<p>“Holy cow… no way? Mr. Chen isn’t doing it again, is he?” Song Ren’s heart trembled. This was all too familiar; this was a classic Mr. Chen move.</p>
<p>Making you feel joy first, then delivering a brutal blow afterwards.</p>
<p>Could Ciri really be dead?</p>
<p>The White Wolf in the game was also stunned. From his trembling footsteps, one could feel his profound sadness. Walking to the bed, the White Wolf embraced Ciri.</p>
<p>But the next moment, a pair of hands also embraced the White Wolf. It turned out Ciri had merely used magic to enter a state of suspended animation.</p>
<p>“Indeed! I knew Mr. Chen wouldn’t be so heartless! Luckily, I hadn’t even had time to cry!” Song Ren couldn’t help but break into a joyful smile.</p>
<p>With that joyful rhythm and atmosphere earlier, and no betrayal now, had Mr. Chen truly changed?</p>
<p>From profound sorrow to immense joy, it was but an instant.</p>
<p>This scene of father and daughter reuniting made Song Ren decide that after finishing the game, he absolutely had to heap praise on Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Anyone who dared to badmouth Mr. Chen, he'd be the first to get angry with them!</p>
