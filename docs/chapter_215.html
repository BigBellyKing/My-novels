                <h3>Chapter 315: All Kinds of Memorable Scenes (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</h3>
<p>Although it was a so-called Early Access trial, this wave essentially marked its official launch.</p>
<p>Countless players poured into <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>.</p>
<p>Naturally, many players also engaged in all sorts of shenanigans within the game.</p>
<p>Among the most common phenomena was the act of protecting your enemies and striking down your teammates.</p>
<p>Team-killing with grenades could only be described as standard practice.</p>
<p>For example, shield operators in the game are almost invincible from the front when deployed.</p>
<p>However, players wielding large shields often employ a unique skill of swaying left and right.</p>
<p>It seems they feel uncomfortable all over if they don't wiggle a couple of times.</p>
<p>And with that wiggle, their teammates behind them are directly exposed to enemy gunfire, left to be slaughtered.</p>
<p>The lone shield operator is then left to back themselves into a corner, cosplaying a fearful meme expression.</p>
<p>Similarly, Fuze is also considered by many players to be the operator with the most meme-worthy effects.</p>
<p>With his Cluster Charge, he deploys the device on a destructible wall or wooden panel, and then you hear "Thump-thump-thump..." as five grenades are fired into the building.</p>
<p>It could be said that before Fuze, all were equal.</p>
<p>Especially when everyone was unfamiliar with the maps, many players would directly pick Fuze in Hostage Mode and start "Thump-thump-thumping" at the hostage room.</p>
<p>Thus, a scene like this would often occur:</p>
<p>'Breaching device destroyed +10'</p>
<p>'Enemy killed +100'</p>
<p>'Enemy killed +100'</p>
<p>'Friendly killed -200'</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>'You damaged the hostage -5'</p>
<p>'You killed the hostage -500'</p>
<p>【Action Failed】</p>
<p>【Player (Fuze) has engaged in malicious behavior and has been kicked from the match and banned for 30 minutes as a warning. All operators are kindly requested to treat new players with friendliness, enjoy a harmonious game, and cherish their accounts.】</p>
<p>What hostage?</p>
<p>I, Fuze, don't know what a hostage is!</p>
<p>Isn't the main reason we hesitate to act against terrorist personnel, fearing to hurt the innocent, precisely because they have hostages?</p>
<p>Then the problem is very easy to solve: as long as the other side doesn't have any hostages, isn't that better?</p>
<p>Of course, this is just a joke, but in the game, there were many instances where Fuze players, completely unaware of the map and mechanics, would deploy a Cluster Charge right onto a wall, leading to numerous memorable scenes.</p>
<p>There's also the baby's room in the Chicago Mansion, which many rookies felt was simply invincible. Its cramped terrain, combined with reinforced panels, seemed like an impenetrable fortress if the door was blocked!</p>
<p>It wasn't until they were "Thump-thump-thumped" that they understood what it meant to catch a turtle in a jar.</p>
<p>And they were the turtle.</p>
<p>Besides these, there were many other interesting points that players found amusing.</p>
<p>For example, the old auntie IQ in the game, whose ability is to scan electronic information devices, is an attacking operator.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the defending side, there's an agent wielding a Heartbeat Sensor, bald and wearing sunglasses, who looks fierce at a glance, and his ability is also scanning.</p>
<p>As long as you get close to him, he can detect your heartbeat through his scan.</p>
<p>But here's the crucial part: IQ's scan range is roughly more than twice that of the Heartbeat Sensor.</p>
<p>So, a common situation arises where IQ detects a heartbeat, but the Heartbeat Sensor user is still scanning a wall, completely unaware.</p>
<p>Then, in certain scenarios, such as going up and down stairs in the Chicago Mansion, and some scenes with penetrable wooden walls, IQ would simply pick up her weapon and unleash a fierce burst through the wall.</p>
<p>This was humorously referred to by many players as </p>
