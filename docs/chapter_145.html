                <p>Chapter 144: Players Will Eventually Understand Their True Feelings (Seventh Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>After completing the <code>It Takes Two</code> concept draft explanation, the entire team began operating efficiently.</p>
<p>Art assets such as characters and related actions had already been produced before the New Year.</p>
<p>The team's main work now is focused on scene levels and story presentation.</p>
<p>Their own warehouse, the big tree in the courtyard, the corroded garden, the first love's snow globe, a medieval castle built with Lego toys...</p>
<p>Chen Xu explained the characteristics of each themed scene in the game to Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue.</p>
<p>These themed scenes in the game are not just simple backgrounds; they also symbolize the different emotional journeys and changes of the two protagonists, Xiaomei and Cody.</p>
<p>“The Cuckoo Clock level needs to have a sharp metallic feel. At the same time, the special item functions in this level are all time-based, hinting that Cody and Xiaomei can start over.”</p>
<p>“The Snow Globe here is a metaphor for Cody and Xiaomei's relationship. Their feelings were once as hot as fire, but now they are completely frozen, just like the scene inside the snow globe.”</p>
<p>“But the melting ice at the end of the Snow Globe level is also a metaphor, indicating that the layer of ice that froze Xiaomei and Cody's relationship now has hope of breaking.”</p>
<p>“Similarly, the Magnets in this level show that Cody and Xiaomei's relationship, from being initially repulsive to now attractive, is getting closer and closer.”</p>
<p>Chen Xu explained each scene in great detail, ensuring that Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue understood the effect he wanted.</p>
<p>After fully presenting the requirements for the scenes and the deeper meaning of the plot.</p>
<p>They wouldn't need to rack their brains thinking too much; they could just follow the existing requirements and make some detailed modifications based on Chen Xu's simple draft.</p>
<p>There was no need for second or third versions, or to restart previous work.</p>
<p>Even though it wasn't their first time experiencing this, having already deeply felt it during the development of <code>Dark Souls</code>, the employees in the art team were still greatly moved.</p>
<p>Such a work experience, not to mention Nebula Games' generous benefits, even if they were slightly below average, would still leave no reason for anyone to leave.</p>
<hr />
<p>As <code>It Takes Two</code> development progressed, after the New Year, many players on major gaming forums and communities felt a bit lost, falling into a <code>game drought</code>.</p>
<p>Although some game companies released new titles during this period, the <code>Dark Souls</code> from before the New Year, and TengHua and NetDragon's two VR blockbusters, had already spoiled their appetites.</p>
<p>“Boring! Any new game recommendations, everyone?”</p>
<p>“None. The few that launched recently don't look very good!”</p>
<p>“No choice. Although TengHua and NetDragon have some studios with new games, I don't think the quality is that great.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, at least we had <code>Overcooked</code> around this time last year. This year, there's nothing.”</p>
<p>“Don't even mention <code>Overcooked</code>. Because of <code>Overcooked</code>, I've been washing dishes for a whole year!”</p>
<p>“Speaking of which, it's already after the New Year. Why hasn't Chen Xu made any moves yet?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, all the developers at the Game of the Year event had new game announcements, but Chen Xu hasn't done anything. Besides the new <code>Dark Souls</code> mode before, he hasn't even let out a fart since then.”</p>
<p>“I bet he's waiting for a big move; a <code>Dark Souls</code> sequel might just be around the corner!”</p>
<p>“<code>Dark Souls</code> is too hard. I'd rather play some family-friendly games, like <code>Fall Guys</code>.”</p>
<p>Not only were players discussing it in major communities, but Chen Xu's official Weibo account also had people @-mentioning him daily, asking about follow-up project news from Nebula Games.</p>
<p>Many players were particularly looking forward to a <code>Dark Souls</code> sequel.</p>
<p>Seeing all the players @-mentioning him, Chen Xu thought about it and decided to reveal some news.</p>
<p>He immediately sent out an official Weibo post with the following content.</p>
<p>‘A new game is already in development: a couple's co-op game that will let you experience a warm and friendly game. There will be the latest news on Valentine's Day. Stay tuned.’</p>
<p>Chen Xu also included an image: a clay doll and a wooden doll holding a dandelion, floating in the air.</p>
<p>This official Weibo post exploded the moment it was released, attracting countless replies from players following Chen Xu's activities.</p>
<p>‘Holy crap, look what I refreshed! A new game is coming!?’</p>
<p>‘Wait! Couple's co-op? Valentine's Day! WTF! Chen Xu, do you know I just got a girlfriend and you're eager to make me single!?’</p>
<p>‘From the image, the cartoon style looks very friendly, but the blood and tears of <code>Overcooked</code> tell us this is a huge trap!’</p>
<p>‘Once a year, it's Valentine's Day again this year, isn't it!’</p>
<p>‘It's that time of year again to bring up old memes. Everyone, fill in the blank: Chen Xu's nickname is ____?’</p>
<p>‘Last year's <code>Overcooked</code> made me do all the dishes at home. This year, you want me to do all the laundry, don't you?’</p>
<p>Players erupted, as a game with similar rhetoric at this time last year had left too deep an impression on them.</p>
<p>However, despite the talk, discussions about ‘Chen Xu's’ new game continued to rise on gaming media websites.</p>
<p>And in the gaming industry, the news also spread.</p>
<p>‘Heard about it? Chen Xu's new game is another two-player co-op type.’</p>
<p>‘Not a <code>Dark Souls</code> sequel?’</p>
<p>‘It's probably a transitional mini-game, like <code>Overcooked</code> last year, right?’</p>
<p>‘I wonder if Chen Xu's game, still nameless this year, can break new ground?’</p>
<p>‘What are you thinking? Two-player co-op, it's just <code>Overcooked</code> from last year with a different theme and mode. What new tricks could it possibly play?’</p>
<p>Discussions about Chen Xu's new game were ongoing both within the industry and among players, but the main impression still revolved around last year's <code>Overcooked</code>.</p>
<p>After all, with the timing and the rhetoric, it was hard not to think that way.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu remained unaffected. Once the game officially launched, all the ‘grievances’ would be cleared, and players would ultimately understand his true intentions, knowing why he was called: the <code>Warrior of Love</code>!</p>
<hr />
<p>Amidst the players' eager discussions, time quickly arrived at February 14th, Valentine's Day.</p>
<p>At noon that day, Chen Xu and Nebula Games' official Weibo accounts simultaneously released a post.</p>
<p>The message was very simple: <code>Trailer</code>.</p>
<p>Three words, followed by a video.</p>
<p>After clicking, a brief black screen was followed by a wooden door appearing in the frame.</p>
<p>As the wooden door opened, a book with facial features appeared before the camera.</p>
<p>At its top, it read ‘book of love’.</p>
<p>‘This is a story about a magical kingdom.’</p>
<p>The Book of Love extended its hands, seemingly welcoming the players watching the video, and at the same time, the camera quickly pulled back.</p>
<p>Lighthouses, bell towers, and a cartoon art style made the entire scene appear dreamlike.</p>
<p>‘Among them are many wizards and warriors.’</p>
<p>The camera moved into a room where two doll figures, one of clay and one of wood, each dressed in wizard robes and armor, held burning greatswords and battled a cartoon monster in what looked like a gladiatorial arena.</p>
<p>‘This epic legend takes place on the high seas.’</p>
<p>Small sailboats, shaped like building blocks, sailed on the ocean, dodging wide-mouthed sharks and colossal, tentacled octopus monsters.</p>
<p>‘And it's also a time-traveling journey.’</p>
<p>Roads made of countless gears seemed to be inside a grandfather clock.</p>
<p>‘Biubiubiu! It even includes a winter dream, like going on a sled ride.’</p>
<p>On an icy and snowy racetrack, a sled moved forward at high speed.</p>
<p>The next moment, countless fragmented scenes flashed by: railway tracks through a tunnel, dodging spiders in a forest, facing bats on platforms.</p>
<p>‘Wait... did I mention there would also be a big explosion?’</p>
<p>A platform seemingly built from brass pipes, with a rumble, saw massive flames erupt, pushing two doll figures away with a powerful shockwave.</p>
<p>‘Hold on, look at these dolls... I almost forgot they used to be human.’</p>
<p>The camera froze on the two blown-away dolls, and at the same time, a photograph appeared.</p>
<p>A man and a woman, dressed in a wedding dress and suit, stood smiling in front of a cake.</p>
<p>But the photograph was split in half, separating them.</p>
<p>‘Alright, alright... do you want to know what the theme of this story truly is?’</p>
<p>‘This is Cody and Xiaomei's story.’</p>
<p>The camera showed the two panicking dolls.</p>
<p>‘Want to change back? Then you'll first have to fix your relationship...’</p>
<p>‘This is a story about passion...’</p>
<p>‘This is a story about attraction...’</p>
<p>‘This is a story about cooperation...’</p>
<p>Following a series of game screens flashing by, Nebula Games' LOGO finally appeared.</p>
<p>The game title was revealed: <code>It Takes Two</code>.</p>
<p>20,000+ words, no broken promises~ Releasing a massive update upon launch doesn't count as a burst update; daily burst updates are the real deal~ Striving to continue tomorrow, please turn your short into long!</p>
