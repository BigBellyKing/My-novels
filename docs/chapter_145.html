                <p>Chapter 244: Entering the Game (Sixth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>As overwhelming advertisements filled the air, time slowly advanced.</p>
<p>On August 1st, <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> officially opened for beta version downloads on the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>Not just players, but many Game Designers in the gaming industry immediately chose to download the game.</p>
<p>Because many Game Designers in the industry also wanted to see what kind of game <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> truly was.</p>
<p>After all, the hunting genre of games had been a very niche market before this, and this particular game held a very different significance.</p>
<p>Because the success or failure of this game, while not determining the life or death of the Nebula Games Platform, wouldn't cause any major damage either.</p>
<p>However, it could definitely make the Channel Alliance, which had been repeatedly frustrated, cheer with applause.</p>
<p>And whether they were Game Designers who had decided to invest in the Nebula Games Platform, or those still with the Channel Alliance, NetDragon, and TengHua, none of them really wanted to see this happen.</p>
<p>After all, at this stage, Game Designers and some independent game studios and small game companies had largely benefited from the sudden rise of the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>However, for ordinary players, this was obviously less of a concern.</p>
<p>After all, as players, they simply wanted to play good games.</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter: World</em> was clearly a game they had been eagerly anticipating during this period.</p>
<p>By around 11 AM, many players had already pre-downloaded <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> from the Nebula Games Platform, just waiting for the demo content to unlock at 12 PM.</p>
<p>In a certain community in the Imperial Capital, Wang Han and Zhang Yi, who had officially become a family, were each sitting in front of their computers. At the same time, Song Ren, Wang Yifan, and Joey were also in the voice chat.</p>
<p>The five offline friends chatted while waiting for the game to open.</p>
<p>“This game is good everywhere, except it only supports up to four players for online multiplayer,” Old Song grumbled a bit in the voice chat.</p>
<p>“Yeah!” Zhang Yi agreed.</p>
<p>“It’s fine, we’ll see about the time. Plus, the company has a big project recently, so I’ve been quite busy,” Wang Yifan said in the voice chat.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s not dwell on it. Even though this game is only for four players and there are five of us, Old Zhang and I can share one computer, taking turns,” Wang Han said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>“Alright, alright, consider the feelings of us single people, Sister Han, stop showing off!” Joey interjected.</p>
<p>“But I wonder if this game is difficult. Huge monsters combined with small hunters, it just feels like there’s something to it!” Zhang Yi said.</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t be too hard, and didn’t Mr. Chen say this game isn’t a Souls-like game? Plus, the previous trailer felt very relaxed; there was even time to barbecue while hunting,” Song Ren offered his opinion.</p>
<p>“Why worry so much? Just go for it! The five of us are all high-level players who have cleared Dark Souls! And doesn’t this game have a team-up feature? If we can’t beat it, we’ll just team up to defeat the BOSS. All problems will be solved easily,” Wang Han said nonchalantly.</p>
<p>“It’s open, it’s open! We can enter the game now, stop chatting!” Joey, noticing the game was accessible, said in the voice chat.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Zhang Yi and the others immediately clicked to start the game.</p>
<p>After clicking to start, it didn’t enter immediately; instead, a notification pop-up appeared.</p>
<p>‘Due to the current version being a beta, only limited areas are open, and multiplayer is not supported. (In-game saves will only retain character customization data)’</p>
<p>Seeing the notification pop up, Zhang Yi and the others weren’t too surprised.</p>
<p>After all, they were all veteran players and naturally understood what a beta version entailed.</p>
<p>Opening limited content, basically things like the game’s prologue, was to let players understand the game's overall vibe.</p>
<p>Naturally, many things couldn’t be experienced.</p>
<p>In the voice chat, everyone conferred briefly and then each turned off their microphones.</p>
<p>After all, if they couldn’t team up, there wasn't much need for voice chat; it was better to immerse themselves in the game experience.</p>
<p>As the Nebula Games Logo skipped, the sound of waves crashing against the shore reached their ears.</p>
<p>The next moment, a booming voice shouted loudly:</p>
<p>“Alright then… fellow members of the Fifth Research Fleet!”</p>
<p>“Time is almost up, so let's skip the goodbyes!”</p>
<p>“Once you board this ship, there’s no turning back. If you’ve lost your resolve, I advise you to turn back here.”</p>
<p>“So, now we set sail for the New World!”</p>
<p>“May the Azure Star, guide of the way, shine upon you!”</p>
<p>As the narration ended, the tightly shut gates opened.</p>
<p>Blinding light appeared. After their eyes adjusted slightly, countless people carrying luggage began boarding the ship.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was among them, clearly one of those heading to the New World.</p>
<p>After boarding the large ship and arriving on the deck.</p>
<p>A crew member on board guided him into the ship’s cabin.</p>
<p>Upon entering the cabin, it was an entirely different world.</p>
<p>From the cabin ceiling hung chandeliers with burning candles. Countless armored crew members moved back and forth. At wide tables, three or five hunters were raising their cups and drinking, and nearby, some crew members were poring over a stack of books, researching something.</p>
<p>But what surprised Zhang Yi the most was that around these hunters were small cats, wearing armor, jumping around, and raising their cups to drink.</p>
<p>In addition, many small cats walked upright and roamed around, acting as waiters, delivering plates full of food to the tables.</p>
<p>Watching a small cat place a plate full of food on a table, then widen its big eyes and wave cheerfully at a female hunter, was utterly adorable.</p>
<p>“These cats are so cute!” Zhang Yi couldn’t help but exclaim.</p>
<p>Is this really a hunting game? Or is it a game about selling cuteness?</p>
<p>Full of curiosity, Zhang Yi observed everything in the cabin.</p>
<p>Every hunter was busy with their own affairs: either drinking, consulting materials, or organizing their equipment.</p>
<p>Are these the companions he would hunt with in the future? Are these the partners he would fight alongside?</p>
<p>Now Zhang Yi fully understood why Chen Xu had said that <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> was completely different from <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>Not even mentioning the art style or gameplay.</p>
<p>Just look at the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Look, how friendly and harmonious are these Hunter's Guild members? They’ll all be great helpers in the future.</p>
<p>In single-player mode, without the ability to team up, he probably would be accompanied by these NPC teammates.</p>
<p>Unlike <em>Dark Souls</em>, where the Firelink Shrine, even with the Fire Keeper, only had a handful of people.</p>
<p>And there was the ever-present, unwavering Crestfallen Warrior, constantly spreading all sorts of negative energy, making the entire game’s atmosphere very oppressive.</p>
<p>Of course, fortunately, in any installment, you could summon helpers.</p>
<p>As for <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, it was clearly a completely different style.</p>
<p>Unity, friendliness, full of positive energy!</p>
<p>“Hey, we’re almost at the New World, are you ready?”</p>
<p>“Nervous?”</p>
<p>While Zhang Yi was deep in thought, a male hunter with a Mohawk hairstyle walked over. The hunter, holding a wine cup, casually sat down across the table and struck up a conversation.</p>
<p>After discussing their current situation and other matters.</p>
<p>The next moment, the game entered the character creation screen. It was similar to <em>Dark Souls</em>’ character customization interface, but compared to the Western fantasy style of Dark Souls, <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> clearly leaned more towards an Eastern aesthetic.</p>
<p>Character creation!?</p>
<p>I’m good at this! And it seems the character creation save data can be preserved, right?</p>
<p>Looking at the rich character creation interface before him, Zhang Yi became interested.</p>
<p>This was his favorite part!</p>
<p>Gender was obvious: still a male character. As for skin tone, it would be yellow skin.</p>
<p>Next, for the face shape, it needed to be a bit more imposing—a middle-aged hunter, whose combat prowess was at its peak.</p>
<p>A proverb says, 'A mouth without hair cannot do things reliably,' so a little beard on the chin.</p>
<p>But the mindset should be a bit younger, and when facing hunting targets, it shouldn't always be about fighting and killing; sometimes, love can be used to influence them.</p>
<p>So, the hair color needed a touch of playfulness.</p>
<p>“Done!” After about fifteen minutes, Zhang Yi looked at the character in front of him and nodded with satisfaction.</p>
<p>The only thing he was slightly dissatisfied with was that, compared to <em>Dark Souls</em>' character customization system, <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> was a bit more conservative, preventing him from fully expressing himself, but he settled for it.</p>
<p>Also, as usual, later...</p>
