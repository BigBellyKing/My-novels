                <h2>Chapter 209: A Barrage of Sandbox Games (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</h2>
<p>The current game content definitely cannot be officially launched.</p>
<p>Some features in the game have not yet been implemented, and the development of the MOD tools is still undergoing internal debugging.</p>
<p>Additionally, there's the review process for the Workshop.</p>
<p>Before this, the main MOD content in the Workshop consisted of <em>Overcooked</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em>. The MODs for these two games, developed by players, were essentially components based on the games' existing assets.</p>
<p>So, there wouldn't be any major issues. But now it's different, especially with the previous release of <em>Don't Starve</em>. For this game, Chen Xu has granted more permissions to players regarding MODs.</p>
<p>In fact, if players wish, they can not only modify some text descriptions in the game but also make higher-level changes to the game's content rules.</p>
<p>Of course, whether these changes are good or bad, interesting or not, will depend on the individual ability of the MOD creators.</p>
<p>But this has also made <em>Don't Starve</em>'s MOD content more complex.</p>
<p>As for <em>Minecraft</em>, its nature is even more prominent compared to <em>Don't Starve</em>.</p>
<p>Therefore, constant vigilance is required for the Workshop and the player community.</p>
<p>The sheer volume of content in this area is quite large, so a dedicated review team is also needed here.</p>
<p>According to Chen Xu's plan, <em>Minecraft</em> will be launched in early February, which is around the New Year.</p>
<p>At the same time, a small-scale beta test will be released after New Year's Day, specifically to gather player feedback on the game content and their experiences with various details.</p>
<p>For example, facing a completely free game mode like <em>Minecraft</em>, can players understand how to play it? Do they need any beginner tutorials to help them grasp the basic operations of the game in the early stages?</p>
<p>Also, what aspects of the game might have problems, and whether the controls or content make players feel uncomfortable—all of this information needs to be collected during the test.</p>
<p>After the testing is complete, based on the feedback received regarding these issues, Chen Xu and the team can decide whether or not to modify the game content.</p>
<p>The period between the end of testing and the game's launch will be the allocated time.</p>
<p>Of course, even if modifications are needed, they will mostly be limited to controls and tutorials.</p>
<p>This is because the overall gameplay and framework of the game have already been decided and will not change.</p>
<p>…………………</p>
<p>As <em>Minecraft</em>'s content gradually solidified,</p>
<p>The market also saw the arrival of many sandbox games.</p>
<p>Various developers were scrambling to promote their titles, hoping to capitalize on the sandbox game craze before it faded.</p>
<p>Amidst the overwhelming promotions, the games from major developers NetDragon and TengHua garnered the most attention.</p>
<p>Although not yet launched, they were highly anticipated by many players.</p>
<p>As for the reason?</p>
<p>It's very simple: as major game developers, TengHua and NetDragon allocated sufficient budgets for the entirely new genre of sandbox games.</p>
<p>While such a budget was merely a trial run for TengHua and NetDragon, given their extensive resources, even a trial run budget far surpassed what ordinary companies could afford.</p>
<p>This led to considerable anticipation from players for TengHua and NetDragon's new titles, <em>Voyage</em> and <em>Wasteland</em>.</p>
<p>The former takes a seafaring adventure as its entry point, while the latter features a post-apocalyptic worldview.</p>
<p>TengHua's <em>Voyage</em> primarily focuses on adventure content, marketed as the first seafaring sandbox game, while NetDragon's entry emphasizes post-apocalyptic survival.</p>
<p>The specific gameplay content remains unclear, as not much has been revealed beyond their respective themes.</p>
<p>But it must be said, they are indeed very appealing to players.</p>
<p>While there are many wasteland-themed games, few focus purely on survival. Seafaring themes are even rarer. Adding sandbox elements immediately made these two games stand out.</p>
<p>The producer of NetDragon's <em>Wasteland</em> was an old acquaintance of Chen Xu, the warm-hearted Mr. Meng.</p>
<p>Among games released concurrently, these two titles definitely captured players' attention.</p>
<p>After all, with good graphics, major developer backing, and compelling selling points, it was naturally hard for them not to attract players.</p>
<p>During this period, following <em>Don't Starve</em>, several second and third-tier game developers also released their new titles.</p>
<p>However, most of these were simply jumping on the bandwagon, or even reskinning old games and labeling them as sandbox games.</p>
<p>They were heavily criticized by players, with the highest rating only reaching 7 points.</p>
<p>Yet, precisely because of this, the industry became even more optimistic about the future of sandbox games.</p>
<p>The intense criticism indicated that players were actually quite eager for this genre of games.</p>
<p>As for the games that received backlash, it could only be said that they were simply trying to make a quick buck. In terms of gameplay and settings, they wouldn't have been much different even without the </p>
