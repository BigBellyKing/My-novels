                <p>Chapter 110: Online Press Conference</p>
<p>On the official Weibo account, many players @-mentioned Chen Xu every day.</p>
<p>As for the main content, besides loyal players still engaging with Sanguosha and Fall Guys, there were more players expressing anticipation for Dark Souls.</p>
<p>Currently, the official news primarily consisted of a promotional trailer from the exhibition, followed by various weapons and scene concept art.</p>
<p>The only things players could gather about the game were that the protagonist seemed to be tasked with linking a fire of hope, and the game's worldview would be quite dark, likely being a bit heart-wrenching, similar to Valiant Hearts: The Great War.</p>
<p>However, many players expressed that they could already accept this.</p>
<p>It was merely that the game's plot was a bit more brutal.</p>
<p>Having just experienced the tear-jerker that was Valiant Hearts: The Great War, they could still endure it.</p>
<p>All that remained was when the game would finally be released.</p>
<p>As for the players' enthusiasm, Chen Xu didn't make them wait long.</p>
<p>Advertisements for Dark Souls began appearing on various game media and video websites.</p>
<p>And this made many people excited, as these advertisements mentioned numerous things.</p>
<p>For example, its unique freedom and distinctive combat system, all of which made players highly anticipate the game.</p>
<p>At the same time, the physical edition of Dark Souls was already in production.</p>
<p>Unlike his previous life, in this Parallel World, the primary medium for games was still digital.</p>
<p>The physical edition was more for collection purposes, such as buying the corresponding deluxe edition, which would include collectible figures, official art books, and similar items.</p>
<p>However, the most exciting news for players was that for this Dark Souls release, Nebula Games would hold an online live press conference to present the latest actual gameplay demonstration and announce the release and launch date.</p>
<p>These announcements, combined with the ongoing promotions, immediately ignited the buzz around Dark Souls.</p>
<p>The gaming industry was also surprised by this.</p>
<p>"Chen Xu seems to be taking Dark Souls quite seriously!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, judging by the current promotional scale, it can't compare to the top-tier projects from TengHua and NetDragon, but for a PC platform game, it's quite a major investment, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"After all, it's Chen Xu's first big-budget production, and honestly, Nebula Games' risk resistance capability is pretty high now!"</p>
<p>"Exactly. Not to mention Sanguosha, which has been in long-term operation, just Fall Guys after the New Year already made Nebula Games a fortune."</p>
<p>"But I'm more interested in Dark Souls, this ARPG. From Nebula Games' external promotion, it seems to be a bit different from traditional ARPGs!"</p>
<p>"What could be different? Can an ARPG really break new ground? It's either story-driven, action-oriented, or focused on numerical balancing. Aren't these the mainstream types of ARPGs?"</p>
<p>"I don't think it'll be that simple. After all, every one of Chen Xu's works since his debut has been quite unexpected."</p>
<p>"That's true, but his previous games weren't large-scale productions. This is Chen Xu's first time tackling a major project, so it's not guaranteed he'll perform well."</p>
<p>As Nebula Games began its promotional warm-up for Dark Souls, many designers in the gaming industry started discussing it.</p>
<p>However, ordinary players completely disregarded these elements, focusing only on wishing time would pass quickly so they could attend Nebula Games' online press conference sooner and get news of Dark Souls' official launch.</p>
<p>Time advanced, and soon it was the day.</p>
<p>The live broadcast took place in Nebula Games' office, which had been specially decorated. On the table were custom-made Fire Keeper collectible figures from Dark Souls, and a bonfire with a Coiled Sword stuck in it.</p>
<p>Behind them hung art concept posters for Dark Souls.</p>
<p>On major live streaming platforms, Nebula Games' live stream room was featured on the homepage.</p>
<p>Nebula Games had long since finalized this arrangement with the major live streaming platforms.</p>
<p>It was considered a win-win business cooperation.</p>
<p>During this online press conference, there would also be bullet comment lottery events, giving away limited edition Dark Souls collectible figures and deluxe edition games, while also randomly selecting some ordinary players to receive standard edition game CD keys.</p>
<p>The live broadcast hadn't started yet; only the background was visible in the live stream room.</p>
<p>However, many players had already arrived upon hearing the news, flooding the live stream room with bullet comments. Even with a setting allowing comments only once every thirty seconds, the bullet comments still fell like snowflakes.</p>
<p>Clearly, thanks to its many previous quality independent games, Nebula Games still garnered a considerable player following.</p>
<p>Of course, most of them were probably just there to watch the excitement.</p>
<p>After confirming all segments, including the video stream and screen transitions, were in order, Chen Xu appeared on camera precisely on time.</p>
<p>"Hello, player friends watching the live broadcast. I am Chen Xu, the lead producer of Dark Souls. I believe everyone watching this stream today has only one thing they're interested in, so I won't waste any more time with pleasantries. Let's get straight to the point. First, let's take a look at what Dark Souls' actual in-game performance looks like!"</p>
<p>Without any unnecessary opening remarks or pleasantries, Chen Xu got straight to the point.</p>
<p>After all, for an online game press conference, people are there to see the game. Why bother with so many irrelevant things?</p>
<p>As Chen Xu finished speaking, the live stream room instantly switched to another screen.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous promotional animation.</p>
<p>This time, it was a purely actual gameplay demonstration animation.</p>
<p>The UI display interface could be clearly seen in the video.</p>
<p>The video lasted about one minute, primarily showcasing a BOSS battle and a regular mob battle.</p>
<p>What first caught the eye was Gundyr the Ash from Firelink Shrine.</p>
<p>His massive body looked stunning, and the glaive-like weapon in his hand was particularly terrifying.</p>
<p>After the BOSS chopped down its weapon, the video clearly showed the ground cracking.</p>
<p>The character in the video was later re-recorded by Chen Xu.</p>
<p>It was primarily used to demonstrate some basic game operations such as blocking, rolling, parrying, executions, and backstabs on mobs.</p>
<p>Of course, to give players sufficient surprise, Gundyr the Ash's second phase was directly skipped in the video.</p>
<p>Additionally, elements like jumping while running and in-game messages serving as hints were also showcased in the video.</p>
<p>In response, countless players watching the live broadcast, as well as concerned media and industry designers, discussed animatedly, each with their own opinions.</p>
