                <p>Chapter 267: Warcraft (Seventh Update, Requesting Subscriptions)</p>
<p>Chen Xu emerged from the office.</p>
<p>At this moment, Qin Yi, Yang Xin, and Ruan Ningxue were all sitting in front of computers in the lounge area, teaming up to hunt in <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>.</p>
<p>“These Tempered monsters are buffed in every way! I seriously doubt if players will be abused into unconsciousness.” Yang Xin said with a sigh.</p>
<p>Compared to regular players, their save files were undoubtedly far ahead, having played since the development and testing phase.</p>
<p>Of course, relevant data wasn't included; it was all separate.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure if players will be abused into unconsciousness, but you definitely have been.” Chen Xu, who had just arrived, saw the four large characters [Exhausted and Collapsed] appear on Yang Xin's screen, followed by a mission failed notification.</p>
<p>The target was the Lavasioth. This dragon wasn't exactly hard, but it wasn't easy either; mainly, it was annoying.</p>
<p>It loved swimming in magma and, combined with its hardened skin, it was practically a bane for melee attackers.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, don't talk nonsense, we've only carted seven or eight times!” Yang Xin retorted.</p>
<p>“Exactly!” Ruan Ningxue echoed.</p>
<p>“Alright, there’s a meeting this afternoon about a new project and the subsequent update and operational arrangements for <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>.” Chen Xu interrupted them, revealing a hint.</p>
<p>“A new project!?” Yang Xin looked surprised.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, so soon!?” Qin Yi was also astonished.</p>
<p>“What's the theme and genre of our new project?” Ruan Ningxue, on the other hand, was more curious.</p>
<p>“You'll find out later.” Chen Xu didn't say directly, just smiled.</p>
<p>“Alright, you guys keep carting. I'll go prepare.” After staying in the lounge for a while, Chen Xu sent a message in the work group and turned to leave.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, in the conference room.</p>
<p>A group of people sat there, all with varied expressions.</p>
<p>Clearly, they hadn't expected the new project to arrive so suddenly.</p>
<p>“First, regarding the subsequent update schedule for <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, the overall content is largely complete. Future content will primarily involve adding new monsters to the base game; as for new map DLC content like Iceborne, we're not rushing it for now.” Chen Xu said, looking at everyone.</p>
<p>“For new monster additions, we can maintain a rhythm of one new monster every twenty days or so, to sustain the relevant popularity of <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>.”</p>
<p>“However, pay attention to the development timeline, because in between, I need to arrange a crossover between <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> and the new game, including cosmetic transmogs for character equipment and weapons, and entirely new hunting quests.”</p>
<p>As Chen Xu finished speaking, two gigantic monsters appeared on the projector screen.</p>
<p>One was a massive dragon, reduced to a skeleton covered in ice and snow. The other was a two-headed beast with a lion's head, a goat's body, and a snake's tail. Alongside them were relevant background introductions:</p>
<p>[In ancient times, dragons would fly to the cold Northrend continent to await death when their lives were drawing to a close. Over time, it became a graveyard for dragons, with countless dragon skeletons scattered across the continent, until evil powers awakened and resurrected them. These dragons, imbued with icy power, dedicated themselves wholeheartedly to their dark master.]</p>
<p>[Chimeras from Ashenvale are mysterious beasts that coexist harmoniously with the Night Elves. These terrifying two-headed monsters soar above the dark forests, using their deadly breath to confront any enemies who infringe upon the sacred continent of Kalimdor. Many enemies retreat immediately just upon seeing these dark, colossal beasts.]</p>
<p>Since they were all proprietary IPs, Chen Xu didn't mind a crossover. After all, it was free popularity to leverage.</p>
<p>At the same time, it wasn't impossible to introduce the Black Dragon and Seath the Scaleless from <em>Dark Souls</em> into <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> later on.</p>
<p>However, everyone in the conference room was astonished.</p>
<p>From these two monsters and their descriptions, some clues were already discernible.</p>
<p>“Northrend, Night Elves... is the new project a fantasy theme? Something similar to <em>Dark Souls</em>?” Yang Xin, as Nebula Games' resident plot specialist, began to guess.</p>
<p>“Definitely! You can tell from the design of these two monsters,” Ruan Ningxue said, rolling her eyes.</p>
<p>“But Mr. Chen, we've just finished developing <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>. Won't players' blood pressure be driven too high!?” Qin Yi expressed concern.</p>
<p>In his opinion, this new project was probably another high-difficulty hardcore game like <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>“Hmm… though in some ways, it really is hardcore.”</p>
<p>“Stop guessing.” Chen Xu shook his head and brought up the design concept draft for <em>Warcraft</em>.</p>
<p>“<em>Warcraft</em>, RTS genre?!” Qin Yi's eyes widened in confusion.</p>
<p>The rest of the people in the conference room were equally surprised.</p>
<p>They had absolutely not expected their new project to be an RTS game.</p>
<p>If one were to talk about niche genres, RTS wasn't actually that niche in this Parallel World.</p>
<p>Many mainstream esports events featured RTS games, and both viewership and player numbers were considerable.</p>
<p>However, RTS was not an easy genre to make.</p>
<p>Basically, only a few veteran game developers produced RTS games that sold well and became popular each year. For instance, <em>Human War</em> from the domestic channel alliance was a relatively popular RTS in recent years.</p>
<p>Its content and gameplay were mainly divided into several different eras:</p>
<p>Stone Age, Feudal Age, then modern times, and finally contemporary and future settings.</p>
<p>Each period had different unit types, categorized by cultural region.</p>
<p>It was somewhat like a 'Civilization' RTS version from his previous life, but without the internal affairs management.</p>
<p>With surprise, everyone seriously read the design concept draft before them.</p>
<p>“It feels so complicated and vast!” Yang Xin murmured.</p>
<p>“It seems quite different from the RTS games currently on the market!” Qin Yi also nodded.</p>
<p>The entire game concept draft didn't delve into detailed game content, mainly because it was too massive. The current preliminary design concept primarily introduced some core systems and gameplay, and Chen Xu hadn't even mentioned the game editor settings yet.</p>
<p>But even so, the few people had a general understanding of the game.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, according to the design concept draft, the game seems to have a massive world view and story!” Yang Xin was the first to speak.</p>
<p>“That's right, the game's story is a crucial part, and this will be a great series. Unlike the fragmented lore of <em>Dark Souls</em>, we want to make the story much more detailed,” Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Chen Xu had immense confidence in <em>Warcraft</em>.</p>
<p>In his previous life, Aomei distributed <em>Warcraft III</em> domestically in 2002. Even in an era rife with piracy, it sold 1.6 million copies in China. Although Aomei had many questionable business practices, this achievement was still astonishing, and even 20 years later, such sales wouldn't be considered low.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Chen Xu’s words, a few people smacked their lips. Whether it would be great remained to be seen.</p>
<p>However, judging by the situation, this RTS game called <em>Warcraft</em> clearly wouldn't be a small production.</p>
<p>“Next, I'll brief you on your respective responsibilities.” Chen Xu looked at everyone.</p>
<p>“Qin Yi, you will be specifically responsible for the game's levels, maps, and related numerical design. Of course, I will also be involved in overseeing it.” Chen Xu said to Qin Yi.</p>
<p>As an RTS game, <em>Warcraft</em>'s numerical framework was incredibly complex.</p>
<p>From the campaign scenarios to the design of the four races' units, all related attribute values were extremely important.</p>
<p>And a simple numerical adjustment could lead to the emergence of a new strategy.</p>
<p>In his previous life, after the release of <em>Warcraft III: Reforged</em>, setting aside its abysmal quality, just some of the numerical changes allowed this game, with nearly twenty years of history, to still generate new tactics and strategies.</p>
<p>This aspect couldn't possibly be completed by Qin Yi alone, so Chen Xu would work with him on the subsequent numerical model.</p>
<p>Chen Xu would also take primary responsibility for the game's story content.</p>
<p>“For art, Ruan Ningxue, it's still up to you. For the game's art style and characters, I'll provide line drafts as before, and then we'll discuss outsourcing the models.” Chen Xu turned to Ruan Ningxue.</p>
<p>“Additionally, unlike before, for <em>Warcraft</em>, we need to produce quite a few CG animations to showcase the in-game story,” Chen Xu stated.</p>
<p>This was quite expensive. For example, in the <em>Warcraft</em> from his previous life, most of the story was told through in-game dialogue and the game's own models.</p>
<p>As for CG cutscenes, only a few were produced.</p>
<p>For instance, Arthas's dutiful return to care for his aging father, or Medivh's Riddler-like warnings.</p>
<p>Chen Xu planned to enrich this area, and frankly, in terms of money, it was a minor expense for Nebula Games at this point.</p>
<p>Especially with the Nebula Games Platform getting on track, despite the small commission rate, the sheer volume made up for it.</p>
<p>“Yang Xin, you need to pay more attention to system interaction and plot background,” Chen Xu said, looking at Yang Xin.</p>
<p>For example, <em>Warcraft</em>'s original creation was actually because Blizzard couldn't get the rights to Warhammer Fantasy. So, the team simply decided to make their own game.</p>
<p>Therefore, some proprietary terms in the game corresponded to terms in Warhammer Fantasy.</p>
<p>Besides that, there were many easter egg memes, such as the most iconic peasant voice lines that many players remember, like 'Yes, milord?' and 'Off I go, then!' (which in the game sounded like: 'Aba dou dei!'), because they were so memorable.</p>
<p>However, there were later many movie quote easter eggs, such as 'Are you the king? Well, I didn't vote for you,' which came from the classic 1975 comedy film <em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</em> from his previous life.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Acolyte voice lines also contained references to StarCraft and Star Wars, which would need some adjustments.</p>
