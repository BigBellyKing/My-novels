                <p>Chapter 663: The Shepherd (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Chapter 663: The Shepherd (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>The guard immediately grabbed Zhang Yi's wrist.</p>
<p>The cutscene camera shifted Zhang Yi's view to the back of his hand, where the letters A and D were written.</p>
<p>"Alright, where did you get that mark? Boy, do you know that makes you a backstabbing, lurking false shepherd?"</p>
<p>"We won't let false shepherds infiltrate, haha!"</p>
<p>"Give him a lesson, boys!"</p>
<p>Zhang Yi instantly understood.</p>
<p>In Columbia, the Sky City, there had always been rumors that a false shepherd would lead the lambs away.</p>
<p>And wasn't Booker's purpose in coming to Columbia, the Sky City, to take Elizabeth away?</p>
<p>If that was the case, didn't it all make sense?</p>
<p>So Elizabeth, the daughter of the Prophet Comstock, was hailed as a lamb. And Booker was the false shepherd who came to take Elizabeth away.</p>
<p>But how did the Prophet know about this?</p>
<p>Could the Prophet truly foresee the future?</p>
<p>And what about that warning card the newsboy gave him earlier?</p>
<p>And who were that mysterious brother and sister who made Booker flip a coin before the gashapon?</p>
<p>A string of question marks appeared in Zhang Yi's mind.</p>
<p>However, he didn't have much time to ponder these questions now.</p>
<p>Because the scene before him presented an even greater impact.</p>
<p>Columbia, the Sky City, had initially been as dreamy as paradise.</p>
<p>But now, Columbia was still Columbia, yet it was a Columbia filled with blood and violence.</p>
<p>With a chainsaw weapon like a windmill, he split open the head of a guard trying to apprehend Booker.</p>
<p>Blood splattered, making the entire game screen intensely bizarre.</p>
<p>However, it was clear to Zhang Yi at this point that BioShock was not a purely FPS game.</p>
<p>Similar to the storyline of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, the story accounted for a large proportion.</p>
<p>But compared to the former, the story of BioShock seemed very complex.</p>
<p>After all, in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, it was clear from the beginning what the story was about.</p>
<p>It was nothing more than Price and his team thwarting the conspiracies of various ambitious individuals, and later avenging their fallen comrades.</p>
<p>But BioShock Infinite, up until now, had filled Zhang Yi's mind with confusion, just like playing Souls-like games, with countless mysteries clouding his thoughts.</p>
<p>Aside from knowing that Booker was going to take Elizabeth to pay off a debt, everything else was a mystery.</p>
<p>Could the Prophet truly foresee the future? Who built Columbia, the Sky City? Why did Booker's employer want to take Elizabeth away?</p>
<p>However, apart from the bewildering plot, the game's combat made Zhang Yi feel quite novel.</p>
<p>Unlike Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's pure "bang bang bang" shooting, BioShock was like an RPG-type game.</p>
<p>Moreover, the game also allowed the use of unique Vigors (powers) to assist in combat.</p>
<p>A Vigor in the left hand and a firearm in the right – it was incredibly cool.</p>
<p>The only thing that left Zhang Yi feeling a little flustered was that the game didn't use the "breathing to recover health" method found in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.</p>
<p>Instead, it adopted a fixed health bar, like most games, meaning players had to search for health packs in the game.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi chose the Normal difficulty, and occasionally, when he got too reckless, his health felt a bit insufficient.</p>
<p>What Zhang Yi didn't know was that this design was intentional on Chen Xu's part.</p>
<p>Compared to a fixed health bar, the biggest advantage of the "breathing to recover health" method was allowing players to immerse themselves in the game's story, providing a silky-smooth experience.</p>
<p>However, a fixed health bar creates a sense of detachment because players, when low on health, actively seek out health packs, which can interrupt immersion.</p>
<p>But in BioShock Infinite, there was a very important point: Elizabeth.</p>
<p>In the game, once Booker meets Elizabeth, she joins his team and provides various forms of assistance.</p>
<p>Health packs were one of the things Elizabeth provided, thereby building the player's bond with her.</p>
<p>There was no perfect solution; it often required making trade-offs, and in BioShock Infinite, the emotional connection between Elizabeth and the player was clearly more important.</p>
<p>His identity exposed, Booker no longer hid and fought his way towards Monument Island where Elizabeth was held.</p>
<p>As the game's story progressed, arriving at the Customs House and having his first conversation with Comstock's projection, Zhang Yi's confusion deepened further.</p>
<p>Comstock, heralded as a Prophet, truly seemed capable of foreseeing the future, accurately stating Booker's identity and background.</p>
<p>Even the conversation between the employer and Booker.</p>
<p>'I know why you've come, false shepherd.'</p>
<p>'I see the original sins that defile your soul – Wounded Knee, private detective, alcoholism, gambling, and of course, Anna.'</p>
<p>'Now, to pay off your debts, you also want my lamb? But Booker, not all debts can be repaid.'</p>
<p>He managed to hijack Comstock's airship, but then Comstock himself appeared, making the people in the airship commit suicide and turn into flames, causing the airship to crash.</p>
<p>So Booker had no choice but to take a Leap of Faith.</p>
<p>This was also where Zhang Yi felt the thrill, using his sky-hook to glide along the sky-rails.</p>
<p>Suffering from acrophobia, even if he didn't look down, just seeing the surrounding white clouds made his legs tremble slightly.</p>
<p>If he fell, he'd probably turn into Zhang Yi puree.</p>
<p>The various mysteries filled Zhang Yi with curiosity – Comstock's origins, and for some unknown reason, Booker kept getting nosebleeds throughout the process.</p>
<p>Was Booker suffering from a terminal illness? But that wouldn't be so cliché, would it?</p>
<p>Zhang Yi's accumulated mysteries grew ever larger.</p>
<p>Of course, besides these mysteries, BioShock Infinite's presentation also left Zhang Yi amazed.</p>
<p>Although he only had about an hour of gameplay, Zhang Yi clearly felt the unique aspects of Columbia, the Sky City.</p>
<p>Religion, race, and steampunk.</p>
<p>In the game, Columbia, the Sky City, could be described as a standard dystopian city.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Prophet Comstock, people seemingly lived in peace and prosperity, just like the vibrant colors of the Sky City.</p>
<p>But in reality, this Sky City was filled with severe racism and exploitation.</p>
<p>Franklin, Washington, and Jefferson were treated as gods in the game, worshipped by the people of Columbia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lincoln was referred to as the Satan of Hell, a Demon, an heretical existence in Columbia.</p>
<p>It could be said that Columbia, the Sky City, harbored extreme racism.</p>
<p>These elements were showcased through various details in the game, rather than just serving as a mere background.</p>
<p>This made Zhang Yi even more excited to see how the game would continue to present these aspects in the later content.</p>
