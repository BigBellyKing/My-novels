<p>Chapter 347: My Brother 4500 (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>The acquisition of game studios is basically impossible to achieve in a short period.</p>
<p>After all, this isn't like buying meat at a wet market, where you just chat about the price and pick a cut. There's still a fairly long negotiation process, including the studio's positioning after the acquisition—whether it will be integrated into Nebula Games' system or operate independently with its own profits and losses. These all need to be discussed step by step.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu didn't need to worry too much about this. He would just be responsible for approving or rejecting the final terms.</p>
<p>At this stage, Chen Xu was confirming the preparations for the Battle Royale mode in <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> with his team.</p>
<p>It wouldn't take much effort, as most of the art assets were already available. The team primarily needed to build the Battle Royale gameplay mode.</p>
<p>Inside the meeting room, the routine meeting was underway.</p>
<p>On the projection screen, the concept draft was displayed: <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>.</p>
<p>Initially, everyone was very excited, but after seeing some of the detailed content that followed, they were a little taken aback.</p>
<p>At this point, Qin Yi timidly asked, "Mr. Chen, is this a new mode for <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>?"</p>
<p>Everyone else also looked at Chen Xu.</p>
<p>It was no wonder they were surprised. After all, Chen Xu had called all the core developers together, and seeing the main title <em>Call of Duty</em>, everyone subconsciously assumed it would be a sequel.</p>
<p>But looking closely now, this was just a brand new mode! Was it really necessary to make such a big fuss?</p>
<p>Chen Xu smiled. "That's right, this is a brand new mode in <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, but this new mode is quite special."</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu, everyone was baffled, then looked at the basic game concepts below.</p>
<p>Isn't it just 150 people dropping into a city, where only the last person or squad alive wins, similar to a relatively novel large-scale battlefield mode?</p>
<p>Just by looking at the concept draft, many people couldn't quite grasp what was so interesting about this so-called Battle Royale setting.</p>
<p>Chen Xu wasn't surprised by this. After all, the embryonic form of Battle Royale already existed in his previous life.</p>
<p>As early as 1999 in his previous life, Battle Royale novels had appeared, and in 2000, they were adapted into film and television. Later, the Battle Royale gameplay was made into a MOD in Arma, and even when Battle Royale elements emerged in H1Z1, they didn't cause a sensation in the gaming industry or among players.</p>
<p>Many people, when first exposed to the concept of Battle Royale games, would somewhat underestimate it. The reason was simple: the gameplay didn't seem particularly special; wasn't it just raising venomous insects to fight?</p>
<p>But in reality, the Battle Royale element is a game that maximizes all aspects of the player experience.</p>
<p>Leaving aside other content, just the three essential elements of Battle Royale can be said to fully encompass the core enjoyment of the game:</p>
<p>Collecting, killing and looting, winning.</p>
<p>These three elements are indispensable in any game.</p>
<p>Collecting: This corresponds to the sense of growth players get from leveling up and learning new skills in ARPG games. In Battle Royale, this corresponds to the process of landing with a small pistol or just fists, and then becoming fully equipped.</p>
<p>Killing and looting: In traditional ARPG games, this corresponds to defeating a BOSS and obtaining better equipment. In Battle Royale games, it also adds a competitive attribute. When you kill an opponent, the greatest pleasure is to examine the items they dropped. Why do some people who play Battle Royale games stop dead in their tracks when they see a box and repeatedly savor its contents? It's for that feeling of joy and reward from looting, even if they don't lack anything.</p>
<p>Winning: This goes without saying. Even if you didn't kill anyone throughout the entire game, or even didn't see anyone, the achievement of coming in first among so many combatants is enough to excite you for a whole day.</p>
<p>Of course, winning might be difficult for many players.</p>
<p>But collecting and killing/looting are not so difficult.</p>
<p>At the same time, the large map and random drop locations can effectively prevent players from feeling a sense of déjà vu or boredom.</p>
<p>Why do players of traditional FPS games often switch maps after playing for a while?</p>
<p>It's because constantly playing on the same map can lead to boredom.</p>
<p>And this is precisely a major killer feature of Battle Royale games. Because the map is large, the drop points, safe zone locations, number of people flying to a certain area, and items picked up are all different, players can always get different gaming experiences.</p>
<p>It can be said that these are the core points that allow Battle Royale games to stand out.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Inside the meeting room, Chen Xu explained some of the core points of <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em> to everyone.</p>
<p>However, unlike Activision's Warzone in his previous life, Chen Xu would improve many of the specific details.</p>
<p>First, when players kill enemies, their equipment will not directly scatter everywhere.</p>
<p>Instead, a Relic Crate will appear.</p>
<p>This will give players a sense of a lucky draw, as you don't know how much money the opponent had, what color their weapon was, or what attachments it possessed.</p>
<p>It can also increase a wave of profitability in this area. After all, I might not be able to beat you in a gunfight, but my crate after death can crush you.</p>
<p>Do you have a tombstone and crate with special effects?</p>
<p>As for attachments, Chen Xu did not intend to use the original model. All attachments, including scopes, magazines, bullets, grips, and muzzles, could be DIY-ed freely, without needing to be upgraded or unlocked.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Weapon Rarity system would be retained from the original, with different rarities spawning. According to different rarities, there would be a different number of attachment slots, but these would not be fixed, but rather random.</p>
<p>For example, a White-tier Weapon would be a bare gun with nothing, while a Green-tier Weapon would unlock one attachment, but its position would be random—it could be the muzzle, scope, grip, or magazine.</p>
<p>In addition, there was also an in-game mission system: hunting down targets, opening treasure chests, and earning a certain amount of money upon completion.</p>
<p>Related vehicles, and purchasing Killstreaks like Cluster Strike, Precision Airstrike, UAV drone, and Loadout Drops at Buy Stations.</p>
<p>Of course, there was also a most important element: the Gulag where Captain Price was imprisoned.</p>
<p>After dying, players could enter the Gulag to complete a 1V1 showdown. The winner would return to the map.</p>
<p>The loser would die, but if their teammates were willing, they could pay 4500 Yuan to bail them out of prison.</p>
<p>This was also a more interesting point compared to other Battle Royale games, because even if you lost a fistfight in the Gulag, you still had hope of survival.</p>
<p>Therefore, in his previous life, this game was also jokingly called by many players: <em>Prison on Fire: My Brother 4500</em>.</p>
<p>After finishing, Chen Xu looked at everyone. "How is it? Do you all understand?"</p>
<p>Everyone nodded, with no one raising questions, as Chen Xu had explained it very clearly.</p>
<p>The game's mechanics themselves were not difficult to understand at all.</p>
<p>The only question was whether players would accept this multiplayer gameplay.</p>
<p>"Develop this mode as quickly as possible. With the base game as a foundation, it shouldn't be too difficult," Chen Xu said to everyone.</p>
