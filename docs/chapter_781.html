                <p>Chapter 780: Stop Persecuting Nia! </p>
<p>The game had reached this point, and from a story perspective, many players knew that it was nearing the end. </p>
<p>Although there was still a lot of content to explore in the game, such as different Titans, each representing a vast map, and many powerful monsters that players hadn't encountered yet. </p>
<p>Not to mention anything else, just the level 80+ Gorilla and level 90 Ancient Tyrannosaurus in Gormott Province alone, setting aside story power and focusing on in-game strength, a single monster could easily defeat the entire Torna party. </p>
<p>Furthermore, many players, even by this point, had only managed to collect a little over ten different Blades. </p>
<p>There were also the characters' Ability Charts, the Blades' Affinity Charts, and various regional side quests. It's safe to say that in terms of game content, Xenoblade Chronicles was definitely a game that could keep players busy for a long time. </p>
<p>But the story was another matter entirely. Under the battle between Malos and the fully awakened Pneuma, Rex and his companions fell from the ruins and arrived at the legendary land of doom: Morytha. </p>
<p>This completely new scene stunned every player who reached it. </p>
<p>God, the World Tree, Elysium, Alrest, Blades, Titans, and the Cloud Sea – the grand worldview led many players to initially believe this would be a fantasy world, similar to sword and magic. </p>
<p>Because a lot of the content seemed to tell players that was the case. </p>
<p>But as the story progressed, especially with the appearance of Siren and Artifice Ophion, and Pyra and Mythra fully opening their hearts to Rex, revealing the gigantic armor: Aion. </p>
<p>All these told players one thing: the game's worldview was not what they imagined. Sword and magic? Who's seen a sword and magic setting with mechs in it? </p>
<p>And now, having arrived in Morytha, this new map made many people realize that the world background of Xenoblade Chronicles might be completely different from what they had imagined. </p>
<p>Twisters and thunder, Morytha, located in the deepest part of the Cloud Sea, was shrouded in darkness. </p>
<p>The most crucial point was that Morytha was actually a ruined modern city, incredibly familiar to players. </p>
<p>Collapsed office buildings, shattered highways, buildings and metal melted by thermal warheads – it was clear this had once been a technologically advanced world. </p>
