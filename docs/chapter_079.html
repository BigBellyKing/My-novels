                <p>Chapter 79: The Positioning of Two Games</p>
<p>Very stress-relieving, unparalleled joy, harmonious and loving.</p>
<p>From the perspective of normal vocabulary, there was nothing wrong with these descriptions.</p>
<p>But coming from Chen Xu's mouth, it always made people feel a little uneasy.</p>
<p>After all, <em>Outlast</em> and <em>Overcooked</em> were both prior examples.</p>
<p>He had previously claimed that <em>Overcooked</em> was a very harmonious and loving cooperative game.</p>
<p>Yet, it led countless people to 'Friendship over'.</p>
<p>What's more, the official Weibo account even trotted out a seemingly very reasonable explanation.</p>
<p>Now, online, players were already calling Chen Xu a master trickster.</p>
<p>And now, it was this same familiar line.</p>
<p>This made it hard to believe!</p>
<p>"Don't let the recent online commotion influence you. Everyone here is an adult and should understand that you need to have your own judgment," Chen Xu said with a smile, looking at their expressions.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, everyone nodded outwardly, but grumbled inwardly.</p>
<p>It was precisely by having their own judgment that they understood the players were absolutely right!</p>
<p>However, everyone was quickly captivated by the design concept drafts that were then displayed.</p>
<p>"A variety show obstacle course? Like 'Rush Forward, Boys and Girls,' that kind of show that various local satellite TV stations launch every summer?"</p>
<p>Seeing the main gameplay rules for <em>Fall Guys</em>, Ruan Ningxue, who frequently watched variety shows, was the first to speak.</p>
<p>"But there's one difference: those variety shows feature one person at a time, and the winner is decided by calculating their completion time. This gameplay, however, has everyone participating together."</p>
<p>"Reality and games are definitely different. In reality, with various tracks, if there are too many people, stampedes could happen, especially in programs that demand high physical endurance from contestants. But games are different."</p>
<p>"But wouldn't 60 people feel too chaotic?"</p>
<p>Looking at the game's design concept drafts, everyone whispered, engaging in discussion.</p>
<p>Clearly, the game design concept drafts for <em>Fall Guys</em> had taken them by surprise.</p>
<p>"Alright, everyone quiet down first. Listen as I explain the main core points this game revolves around," Chen Xu said, tapping the table with his hand as he looked at everyone.</p>
<p>"First is the game's positioning: this is a collection of casual and relaxing mini-games in the style of a variety show obstacle course. Art-wise, it needs exaggerated characters, comical actions, and bright, vivid color schemes. The background music, meanwhile, needs to be very cheerful, allowing players to immerse themselves in the game in an extremely relaxed state of mind."</p>
<p>"The game's physical effects should be even more over-the-top, even unrealistic, to enhance the game's entertainment value and promote its subsequent secondary dissemination."</p>
<p>Everyone listened intently as Chen Xu analyzed the various core elements of <em>Fall Guys</em>, and they were also very excited.</p>
<p>Qin Yi and other veteran employees, in particular, felt much more relaxed.</p>
<p>Because both <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em>, these two concept drafts, still maintained the characteristics seen in <em>Outlast</em> and <em>Overcooked</em>.</p>
<p>Namely, the level of completion was remarkably high; from art and Level Design to core gameplay elements, everything was comprehensive.</p>
<p>It was very concise and clear; just by looking and listening, everyone already had a corresponding image in their minds.</p>
<p>"As for operations, Zhang Yida and Zhao Mo, your marketing and operations team, please provide me with two proposals later. <em>Sanguosha</em> will be a long-term operational free-to-play plus in-app purchase game designed to increase user stickiness."</p>
<p>"<em>Fall Guys</em>, on the other hand, is a game primarily focused on short-term popularity. Prepare promotion and marketing plans for both for me to review."</p>
<p>Chen Xu said this to Zhang Yida and Zhao Mo, the newly joined leader of Nebula Games' operations team.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, Zhang Yida and Zhao Mo nodded.</p>
<p>From Chen Xu's description, they could basically distinguish the fundamental positioning of the two games.</p>
<p><em>Fall Guys</em> adopted a buy-to-play model, but in Chen Xu's positioning, it was a "fast-food" type of game meant to generate high popularity in the short term, attract enough users, and earn profits—simply put, like pursuing short-term gains in finance.</p>
<p><em>Sanguosha</em>, on the other hand, was for long-term operation, to increase Nebula Games' user stickiness. At the same time, the game's free-to-play plus in-app purchase strategy was meant to give the game a progression-based attribute, thereby increasing the cost of abandonment for players.</p>
<p>With different positioning and attributes, the marketing and promotion methods would naturally also differ.</p>
<p>"Lastly, this part isn't very important. This expo is more about making grand promises to players; it won't be launched in the short term." Since they were all his own people, Chen Xu spoke very directly without beating around the bush.</p>
<p>As for the third folder, Chen Xu had no intention of displaying it, because it really was just a folder.</p>
<p>"Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and Qin Yi, please stay. Everyone else, go take a good look at these two design concept drafts first. Compile any questions you have, and we'll discuss them in a meeting."</p>
<p>As Chen Xu's words fell, the remaining employees stood up and left the conference room to return to their posts.</p>
<p>Looking at Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and Qin Yi, Chen Xu said, "Besides these two games, there's also another relatively large production. For the CG animation part, I will provide the corresponding script and storyboards at that time. Ruan Ningxue, you'll be responsible for following up on that."</p>
<p>"As for Yang Xin, I will also write the subsequent world-view and background. Qin Yi, after you finish the action system for <em>Fall Guys</em>, you can start by testing the action DEMO first to familiarize yourself and accumulate some experience, so you won't have to start from scratch when the time comes."</p>
<p>Chen Xu distributed tasks to the few people present.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, everyone nodded.</p>
<p>Because for these three, <em>Sanguosha</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em> actually didn't involve much workload.</p>
<p>With the establishment of the <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Sanguosha</em> project teams, Nebula Games began operating efficiently.</p>
<p>And while these two games were being developed.</p>
<p>There were also quite a few interludes in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>First, in the independent game circle, after <em>Overcooked</em> became popular, many designers and third- and fourth-tier game developers also successively launched similar cooperative games.</p>
<p>But the result was, unsurprisingly, that they didn't make much of a splash.</p>
<p>Because for this type of game, without a very clear core point, it's very difficult to catch players' attention.</p>
<p>For example, the core point in <em>Overcooked</em> is actually a conflict in coordination.</p>
<p>Through media like videos and live streams, the 'breakup' meme was born, allowing the game's popularity to undergo secondary dissemination.</p>
<p>But this characteristic isn't something that any cooperative game can achieve.</p>
<p>It's meticulously integrated into the game's Level Design and Numerical Design.</p>
<p>If not handled well, making the game too simple, the so-called 'breakup' would naturally be nonsense.</p>
<p>But if it's too much, players wouldn't 'break up'; instead, they'd unite to curse your game as a terrible game.</p>
<p>Clearly, these games failed to grasp the key points.</p>
<p>Naturally, they couldn't make any waves.</p>
<p>(PS: Daily request for recommendation tickets and monthly passes; there will be another chapter later, it won't be too late)</p>
<p>Just discovered <em>Sanguosha</em> launched on the Steam interface... What a coincidence!</p>
