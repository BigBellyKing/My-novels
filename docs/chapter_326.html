<p>Chapter 325: The Inclusion of Operation Kingfish (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Following Chen Xu's release of relevant video materials for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Howard Warsaw, the person in charge of Storm Action at Atrai and one of Atrai's top designers, also closely followed the content of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.</p>
<p>After all, his developed Storm Action was launched on the Zeus Platform, while Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was launched on Huanyu.</p>
<p>Coupled with both being FPS games, this could be said to be a direct competitive relationship.</p>
<p>If this Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was of the same quality as Rainbow Six Siege, then Howard Warsaw would not have the slightest worry.</p>
<p>Because in that case, the opponent would have no competitiveness at all.</p>
<p>It's not that Rainbow Six Siege is bad; rather, in some aspects, Rainbow Six Siege is too good.</p>
<p>Its overly hardcore gameplay destined it to be a delicacy that only a few could savor.</p>
<p>And for FPS games, as long as they are linked to hardcore, they will inevitably not become mainstream games.</p>
<p>The reason why FPS can be said to be the largest game genre globally is precisely because most FPS games are actually fast-paced experience games.</p>
<p>"Fast-paced" might not sound very good, feeling particularly low-brow.</p>
<p>But isn't the main goal of most people playing games to relax?</p>
<p>After work, open a game, don't think too much, and have a happy round.</p>
<p>And on this basis, if a game can also bring players some emotional depth in its story, or some narrative depth.</p>
<p>Then, without a doubt, this game can absolutely be deified.</p>
<p>Some overly hardcore, overly deep games might gain players' recognition and positive reviews.</p>
<p>But they won't achieve the majority of sales.</p>
<p>Howard Warsaw saw this very clearly.</p>
<p>And for him, Storm Action was a game developed for sales, specifically to escort the Zeus Platform.</p>
<p>Otherwise, why would Atrai bother buying any IP rights?</p>
<p>But now, the promotional video for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare instinctively made Howard Warsaw wary.</p>
<p>Because he also had to admit that the various grand scenes were truly spectacular.</p>
<p>Coupled with Nebula Games' growing reputation overseas.</p>
<p>Howard Warsaw naturally dared not underestimate it.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Soon, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Storm Action were at loggerheads.</p>
<p>They each conducted a wave of promotions daily.</p>
<p>Today, you release news about the lead actor recording motion capture; tomorrow, I release some concept art.</p>
<p>Initially, both sides basically released some behind-the-scenes footage of game development.</p>
<p>For example, the lead actor recording motion capture, and concept art.</p>
<p>When they really ran out of things to promote, even as game designers, they personally stepped in for a wave of promotion.</p>
<p>And as time progressed, finally, with the development of game content, some actual in-game videos were also released.</p>
<p>Storm Action released a combat video of about fifteen seconds.</p>
<p>It was a segment from the previous escape from the building, which excited many players.</p>
<p>And immediately after, Chen Xu also released a video.</p>
<p>In a stormy night, on a cargo ship, a group of fully armed special forces infiltrated the deck and eliminated various enemies.</p>
<p>However, what attracted players was not the gameplay, because the time was too short.</p>
<p>From descending from the air to the deck, it was only about twenty seconds in total.</p>
<p>What truly shocked players was how exceptionally outstanding the graphics were.</p>
<p>Lighting, rain, super high-definition textures – it was practically like CGI.</p>
<p>Originally, many players, after watching Storm Action's demo, were amazed by the powerful capabilities of the new Zeus Platform.</p>
<p>But after watching this simple twenty-second demo of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.</p>
<p>All players were dumbfounded.</p>
<p>"Holy cow, these graphics completely blew Storm Action out of the water!"</p>
<p>"If I didn't know Chen Xu wouldn't pull a bait-and-switch with misleading trailers, I would definitely think this was CGI!"</p>
<p>"My goodness! This is too shocking, does this mean Huanyu's capabilities are so much stronger than Zeus's!?"</p>
<p>Many players exclaimed in surprise.</p>
<p>Including game industry designers who had been following it, they were equally startled by this scene.</p>
<p>After all, the difference was too obvious.</p>
<p>And for game designers like them, they had studied the performance of both Zeus and Huanyu.</p>
<p>The difference was basically not much.</p>
<p>So they clearly understood what the graphics of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare truly meant.</p>
<p>However, after a brief moment of surprise, Howard Warsaw and other industry game designers basically figured out how Nebula Games achieved this.</p>
<p>It was nothing more than concentrating the console's performance for the production of thread-based levels.</p>
<p>But then the problem arose: doing this would inevitably lead to loading screens.</p>
<p>Just like Storm Action actually requires loading, but it can be replaced by real-time rendered cutscenes. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, however, is different.</p>
<p>This level of concentrated performance, although the new VR's SSD model and specially optimized processing made the speed very impressive, a single map would still require at least 20-30 seconds of loading time. In such a situation, when switching between levels, the player's experience would be fragmented.</p>
<p>So, Nebula Games sacrificed player fluidity to enhance visual presentation?</p>
<p>Many industry designers suddenly realized.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>As for Chen Xu at this moment, he was conducting in-game content testing.</p>
<p>Chen Xu in the game was lying on the ground, frantically sweeping enemies from all directions.</p>
<p>Bullets struck the ground, shattering grass and kicking up splashing dirt.</p>
<p>Blood stained the dirt and green grass red.</p>
<p>A gun propped on the ground would leave a shallow indentation.</p>
<p>This was a level in the game, and Chen Xu was playing as Captain Price.</p>
<p>In the original game of his previous life, players could only play as Captain Price in two levels.</p>
<p>One was a flashback level, the very classic sniper mission: All Ghillied Up.</p>
<p>The other was the final level of the game's grand finale.</p>
<p>However, compared to the game, there was actually a plot hole.</p>
<p>In his previous life, Activision dug a hole but didn't fill it themselves.</p>
<p>However, fervent fan players filmed a micro-movie to complete this part of the story, and it received high official recognition, with the developers directly stating it was well-made and would be considered their official storyline.</p>
<p>Operation Croaker, or rather, Operation Kingfish.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the game, Chen Xu officially incorporated it.</p>
<p>As the final easter egg content of the first part.</p>
<p>As for why it was placed at the end of the first part.</p>
<p>Because chronologically, it perfectly aligns with the second part.</p>
<p>Secondly, the game adopted a trilogy model, where Shepherd in the second part and Makarov in the third part are actually linked, and their timelines are continuous.</p>
<p>Only the first part was separated; shouldn't they add some attraction anchors to hook players?</p>
