                <h2>Chapter 312: The Tactical Lineup is Fine, We'll Definitely Get Them Back This Round! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h2>
<p>Looking at the dark, dripping thing on the ground.</p>
<p>Before anyone could react.</p>
<p>'Boom!'</p>
<p>Accompanied by a deafening explosion, a fireball erupted in the center of the five individuals.</p>
<p>If they had faced it head-on, the large shield might have been able to withstand the Remote Charge's damage.</p>
<p>But at that moment, Wang Yifan had his back to the Remote Charge, while the others were practically face-planting it.</p>
<p>In reality, they would have been blown to smithereens.</p>
<p>However, this was a game, so no such graphic scenes would appear. The result was that the large shield remained standing in place.</p>
<p>Then, five bodies were directly flung away by the powerful blast.</p>
<p>In the top right corner of everyone's game interface, kill icons rapidly appeared.</p>
<p>One Remote Charge, a penta-kill!</p>
<p>"What the heck was that!?"</p>
<p>"That little black box was a bomb?"</p>
<p>"I'm completely numb!"</p>
<p>"What in the world was that? That bomb was so powerful!?"</p>
<p>Song Ren, Zhang Yi, and the others were all bewildered.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>They were directly blown away?</p>
<p>The opponents had thrown three or four grenades just now, which caused no damage or threat whatsoever.</p>
<p>What kind of thing was that, and why was its damage so high!?</p>
<p>Did it just completely vaporize all five of them?</p>
<p>On the other side, the defenders were also incredibly excited, clearly not expecting to pull off such a massive comeback.</p>
<p>Kapkan and Rook, who were downstairs, immediately rushed to the bomb defuser, disarming the bomb at the last second.</p>
<p>"It's over, we've been executed! We might even become online material!" Song Ren's face was bitter.</p>
<p>He had originally thought it would be a grand show.</p>
<p>The first half of the script had gone exactly according to his plan.</p>
<p>But he never expected the ending of this script to take an unexpected turn.</p>
<p>And things were exactly as he thought. In the internet cafe lobby on the first floor, many people who couldn't find a seat chose to sit in empty spots, watching and waiting.</p>
<p>This scene unfolded, instantly making countless players burst into laughter.</p>
<p>"I'm dying of laughter! This must be the first penta-kill in <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, right?"</p>
<p>"Haha, it's clearly BANDIT, the Electrocution Brother's penta-kill, but why is all my attention on this attacking squad?"</p>
<p>"+1! It's too funny!"</p>
<p>"But this train tactic isn't invincible!"</p>
<p>"Of course it's not invincible! And it's completely different from previous FPS games. In <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, gadgets, Operator skills, and environmental destruction all have a huge impact on combat!"</p>
<p>Many FPS players in the lobby started discussing. Although it was just a simple game, many FPS players already felt the unique enjoyment of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>. In traditional FPS games, it was all about marksmanship, but in <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, they saw more strategic depth.</p>
<p>In the game, the defending team, led by BANDIT, turned the tide and boosted their morale significantly. At the same time, they understood some basic game mechanics: the plaster walls in the garage that could be smashed open all needed to be reinforced. And because they had won the previous round by secretly throwing a Remote Charge from the second floor, they now had to pay a little attention to upstairs. Although the attackers didn't have Remote Charges, they did have Fuze and grenades.</p>
<p>"Let's adjust our lineup," BANDIT, as the veteran of the defending team, suggested. Since they were playing together and he had performed excellently before, everyone agreed to follow his command.</p>
<p>Soon, the defending team's lineup was confirmed:</p>
<p>Mute, an Operator who can place signal disruptors to disable electronic devices.</p>
<p>Pulse, the bald, sunglasses uncle who can scan heartbeats.</p>
<p>BANDIT, the Electrocution Brother, who had a great performance last round.</p>
<p>Valkyrie, who provides vision with her Black Eye cameras.</p>
<p>And a Recruit, automatically selected by the system when a player truly doesn't know which Operator to pick and time runs out.</p>
<p>Regarding lineup understanding, such as what kind of tactics attacking and defending teams need, players are currently completely unclear and have no established meta. However, not understanding the game mechanics or figuring out the meta doesn't mean players have no clever tactics or ideas.</p>
<p>As for Song Ren's attacking team, they still used the same old tactic.</p>
<p>"Listen to me, I think our tactics and lineup are fine, it's just our execution that's flawed. We'll get them back this round!" Song Ren, as a motivator, rallied his team.</p>
<p>Despite encountering a Remote Charge attack last round, Song Ren firmly believed it was just an accident. They were only slightly careless, which led to their inability to respond effectively.</p>
<p>This time, he believed that with more mature experience, they would be able to handle it well.</p>
<p>"They've reinforced the garage door this time!"</p>
<p>"Hey! Why is my drone broken? It can't move anymore?"</p>
<p>Even with prior attacking experience, the few of them were still a little confused about the House map. Either they got lost, their drones were destroyed, or they were disrupted by an Operator's gadget.</p>
<p>After the countdown, the game officially started. Just like before, they destroyed the outdoor cameras. The big shield and flash shield took the first two positions and continued to push forward.</p>
<p>However, entering the garage this time was not so easy. The plaster walls of both the large and small garages were completely reinforced with metal plates and electrified.</p>
<p>If they wanted to proceed, they could only go through the wooden door next to it.</p>
<p>While it suited the characteristics of their 'train tactic', Song Ren, scanning the doorway with IQ, found himself in a predicament. The scan revealed two traps at the entrance. If the big shield tried to tank them, he wasn't sure if it would lead to death, as they still didn't fully understand these game mechanics.</p>
<p>Shooting through the wooden boards to clear the traps wasn't impossible either, but the only person on their team equipped with a grenade was Joey with his Sledgehammer, and ironically, he had brought Concussion Grenades this round. The others simply had no grenades, so they could only break the wooden boards and clear with guns. However, the confined space made Song Ren a little nervous. He didn't know what the situation was inside, and when clearing the traps, the big shield couldn't raise his shield to protect those behind him, making it easy for one of them to be picked off.</p>
<p>"Joey, smash this wall open!" Looking at the white wall next to them, Song Ren's eyes lit up. He issued the command with an air of confidence.</p>
<p>Hearing Song Ren's words, Joey fell silent for a moment.</p>
<p>"Joey? Joey?" Song Ren called out twice, seeing Joey frozen there.</p>
<p>Without a word, Joey silently walked to the wall and swung his Sledgehammer, but the wall remained completely intact.</p>
<p>"Ahem... I haven't played Sledge, so I'm not familiar with the skills. This wall can't be breached, huh?" Song Ren coughed twice to alleviate the awkwardness.</p>
<p>"What do we do now?" Zhang Yi asked.</p>
<p>"No big deal, let's go around. There's still plenty of time, there must be other ways," Song Ren suggested.</p>
<p>The group, obeying, moved in stealth, still in their 'train tactic' formation, walking past the garage. After passing through a courtyard, they soon discovered a staircase leading to the basement.</p>
<p>The path through the staircase to the underground storage was blocked by a barricaded door.</p>
<p>Song Ren scanned it, confirmed there were no electronic traps inside, and discussed tactics with his team.</p>
<p>"Same old tactic: big shield and flash shield in positions one and two, the rest a step slower, then push straight in and take it!"</p>
<p>"But this time we need to spread out a bit and also watch out for what's above!"</p>
<p>At the entrance, everyone quietly set up their tactics, lowering their voices with a strong sense of immersion. However, Song Ren and his team didn't notice the pile of broken wooden boards beneath the barricade.</p>
<p>As for the Unmanned Reconnaissance Vehicle?</p>
<p>Just like in the first round, they played with it at the very beginning, but once the actual fight started, everyone forgot about it.</p>
