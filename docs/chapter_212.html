                <p>Chapter 211: Promotional Warm-up (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Days passed one by one, and Nebula Games also began its promotional warm-up for <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>
<p>While players and industry designers were discussing this wave of sandbox games.</p>
<p>A post from Chen Xu's official Weibo account instantly drew the attention of countless players and industry designers.</p>
<p>Chen Xu's official Weibo post was very simple, containing only three words: "New Game."</p>
<p>Following that, a video link was released.</p>
<p>But upon clicking it, the players, originally filled with anticipation and curiosity, were instantly stunned.</p>
<p>Because it was completely unexpected for them.</p>
<p>Accompanied by a gentle BGM, the game graphics appeared.</p>
<p>Blue skies and white clouds, oceans, trees, and a beach. From under the distant sunset, a little character rode a pink pig and came running.</p>
<p>'Let's go to a world made of blocks.'</p>
<p>As the narration's voice played, countless blocks formed a slide, allowing the block character and the pink piggy to move along it.</p>
<p>'The only limit is your imagination.'</p>
<p>The next moment, the slide collapsed in the middle, scattering blocks, but behind the block character, red, cape-like wings unfolded, carrying it through forests and over mountains.</p>
<p>'Let's go anywhere you want, climb the highest peaks, dig the deepest caves.'</p>
<p>On the beach, the block character was holding a cube and placing it.</p>
<p>'Build anything you want, whether it's day or night, rain or shine.'</p>
<p>Looking into the distance in the desert.</p>
<p>'This will be the most meaningful sandbox game you've ever set foot in.'</p>
<p>The next moment, the scene shifted to a massive castle.</p>
<p>'Build a grand castle.'</p>
<p>Inside a mine filled with torches, a winding railway track appeared.</p>
<p>'Research the most advanced machines, take a rollercoaster ride.'</p>
<p>In the forest, several block characters continuously chopped down trees with axes.</p>
<p>'You can play with your friends, build your own community, and craft the strongest armor to protect yourselves.'</p>
<p>In the darkness, facing monsters that appeared in the forest, the block characters donned their armor, grabbed their swords, and charged forward.</p>
<p>'Fight monsters at night, no one can limit your actions.'</p>
<p>Continuously digging caves, lava surged from underground.</p>
<p>Creating dark and mysterious portals, behind which lay an eerie world.</p>
<p>'There are no rules to follow, this adventure is yours to decide.'</p>
<p>As the narration continued, the camera slowly moved to the deep blue sea, where a whale made of blocks suddenly surfaced.</p>
<p>Countless blocks formed the game's LOGO and title: <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>
<p>[Testing begins January 3rd, officially launched online February 1st]</p>
<p>[Selling Price: 68 Yuan]</p>
<p>With the release of this promotional trailer video, many players, including game industry designers, were utterly bewildered.</p>
<p>Because no one had ever imagined that Chen Xu would actually create a pixel game.</p>
<p>"No way, it's a pixel game, and it looks a bit like building blocks?"</p>
<p>"What was Chen Xu thinking? Why would he suddenly make a pixel game, and with building block gameplay?"</p>
<p>"I'm a bit dumbfounded too, is this for kids?"</p>
<p>"I'm completely stunned. Forget <em>Dark Souls</em> or <em>It Takes Two</em>, at least <em>Don't Starve</em>! If not, <em>Silent Hill PT</em> would have been fine to send me away, but instead, it's a building block game?"</p>
<p>"Don't rush to complain. I feel like it looks pretty interesting, and very free? Especially with no rules at the end, don't you think that's exciting?"</p>
<p>"Honestly, even though it's a pixel game, it's not shoddily made. Haven't you noticed how good the pixels look? The materials are very detailed, and when destroyed, various textures show changes. And even though it's a pixel game, it actually has excellent lighting and shadow effects!"</p>
<p>"But that's exactly why I can't figure it out! The cost for these things definitely won't be low. This means Chen Xu isn't doing it to save money, so why make it pixelated!?"</p>
<p>It wasn't just the players; the gaming industry also had some questions about Chen Xu and the game <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>
<p>After all, it was truly baffling.</p>
<p>From this promotional trailer, only three characteristics could be summarized.</p>
<p>The first characteristic was its pixel art style.</p>
<p>The second characteristic was that the game had monster-fighting combat gameplay, and similar to collecting resources in <em>Don't Starve</em>, the gameplay mode in this game became building blocks.</p>
<p>The third characteristic was that, like <em>Don't Starve</em>, this game called <em>Minecraft</em> also supported multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>As for more detailed content, that remained unknown.</p>
<p>But the question was, what was the selling point of this game?</p>
<p>Survival?</p>
<p><em>Don't Starve</em> already had that.</p>
<p>Fighting monsters, collecting resources, and then building structures? <em>Don't Starve</em> also had that.</p>
<p>Multiplayer? <em>Don't Starve</em> had that too.</p>
<p>Plus, the graphics were still in pixel mode. Aside from the change in operating perspective, there didn't seem to be any major changes!</p>
<p>For a time, many game designers were filled with puzzlement.</p>
<p>Based on these characteristics, they wanted to directly dismiss <em>Minecraft</em>, but the one who made the game wasn't some unknown junior designer; it was Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Chen Xu, who had just developed <em>Don't Starve</em> and ignited a wave of sandbox game enthusiasm, how could he not know?</p>
<p>In NetDragon's <em>Wasteland</em> game studio, Meng Zuo also wore a baffled expression.</p>
<p>After <em>Star God</em> suffered a Game of the Year Waterloo last year, he had participated in many projects this year.</p>
<p>However, none of them were as a lead creator. He had also participated in the Game Department's VR testing project and summarized a lot.</p>
<p>And earlier, inspired by Chen Xu's <em>Don't Starve</em>, he decided to make a sandbox game.</p>
<p>Thus, the <em>Wasteland</em> project was approved.</p>
<p>But he never expected that at this critical moment, Chen Xu would approve another project, and it was a sandbox game that made him feel a bit confused.</p>
<p>Like most industry designers, he also felt that <em>Minecraft</em> seemed to have no appeal, but the other party was Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Considering Chen Xu's experiences over the past two years, and his private understanding of Chen Xu, he felt that this game called <em>Minecraft</em> definitely had something to it.</p>
<p>At this moment, his assistant knocked on the door and entered: "Teacher Meng, the promotional plan for <em>Wasteland</em> has been finalized, and the launch date has also been set."</p>
<p>Meng Zuo took the document from his assistant and glanced over it briefly, but upon seeing the date, he hesitated.</p>
<p>"Regarding the timing..." Meng Zuo frowned.</p>
<p>Because the promotion and launch dates for <em>Wasteland</em> seemed to clash with <em>Minecraft</em>, and by only a few days.</p>
<p>"Let's halt the promotion for now," Meng Zuo said to his assistant after some thought.</p>
<p>Hearing Meng Zuo's words, the assistant next to him paused, then quickly said, "Teacher Meng, if we delay now, the promotional resources available to us later won't be as abundant as they are now."</p>
<p>This time, the <em>Wasteland</em> project had so many resources mainly because it happened to coincide with TengHua's plans.</p>
<p>But if they avoided it this time, it wouldn't be a big deal, because the <em>Wasteland</em> project wasn't specifically targeting TengHua; the outside world made it sound so mysterious, but in reality, as a designer under NetDragon, Meng Zuo knew it was just a coincidence.</p>
<p>Moreover, for the company, ensuring game sales was paramount.</p>
<p>But now, Meng Zuo was unsure, not because he was worried about TengHua's new work, but because he couldn't gauge Chen Xu's <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>
<p>"No rush... there's still time. I'll go test the waters. Help me see if we can book a spot this week." Meng Zuo told his assistant a store name, then opened his phone and found Chen Xu in his contacts.</p>
<p>He was going to "PY" – no, rather, to have an exchange among game designers, and while he was at it, see if he could uncover the truth about <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>
