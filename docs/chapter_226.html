                <p>Chapter 225: Freedom is the Core (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Whether it was private servers, Single-Player Mode, or official servers, all were filled with incredibly excited players.</p>
<p>Without exception, all players who visited the structures Chen Xu placed in the display server immediately entered <em>Minecraft</em> with an excited heart, ready to flex their muscles and build the structures they envisioned in their minds.</p>
<p>At Nebula Games' office, despite it being the Spring Festival, the importance of <em>Minecraft</em> to the development of the Nebula Games Platform was considered.</p>
<p>Therefore, Chen Xu had previously discussed with his team about working overtime during the New Year, though not excessively. The main responsibility was to manage various tasks during the Spring Festival. Employees residing in Modu who were on duty during the holiday adopted an in-office work arrangement, while non-local employees could go home for the Spring Festival and work from home. Of course, corresponding welfare plans were comprehensive, and combined with the year-end bonus just distributed before the New Year, quite a few people were willing to stay and work overtime. In fact, because the number of willing individuals exceeded Chen Xu's expectations, they had to choose by lottery. This was primarily due to the generous overtime pay and various benefits provided.</p>
<p>Emerging from his office, Yang Xin excitedly greeted him, with Qin Yi, Lin Tao, and others standing nearby. They all lived in Modu, and everyone was visibly thrilled.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen! Sales have already surpassed 3 million! Based on today's trend, it's highly possible to break 4 million!" Yang Xin exclaimed excitedly.</p>
<p>The others, including Qin Yi, were equally enthusiastic.</p>
<p>"Alright, keep an eye on the servers, and the backup servers can also be activated," Chen Xu nodded, acknowledging the news and informing Qin Yi and the others.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, aren't you excited?" Yang Xin looked at Chen Xu, a little bewildered, and Qin Yi and the others next to him were also a bit puzzled.</p>
<p>First-day sales might reach 4 million!</p>
<p>This was an astonishing figure in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Although <em>Minecraft</em>'s selling price held a significant advantage compared to big titles, these sales were genuine. It might even challenge for ten million sales in the first week.</p>
<p>"Don't forget, <em>Minecraft</em> started pre-orders a month in advance, and this is just the beginning. There's no need to be overly excited yet, and the overseas version hasn't even launched," Chen Xu said calmly.</p>
