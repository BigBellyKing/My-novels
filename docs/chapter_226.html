                <p>Chapter 326: Launching Early, Gaining the Initiative (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>As more and more information about <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> and <em>Storm Action</em> was revealed, discussions about these two games online grew increasingly intense.</p>
<p>Eventually, Nebula Games didn't even have to do much pre-release hype, yet major gaming media both domestically and internationally reported on them frantically.</p>
<p>This was mainly because, for players and game designers alike, both <em>Storm Action</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> were among the first batch of games for the new era of VR.</p>
<p>Coupled with the fact that both Nebula Games and Atrai are well-known game developers in the industry, they naturally garnered a lot of attention.</p>
<p>However, regarding the actual game content, players were still relatively unclear.</p>
<p>On <em>Storm Action</em>'s side, Atrai had already released quite a bit of information.</p>
<p>It could basically be confirmed as a game that progresses simultaneously with both single-player and multiplayer modes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> had temporarily not released much news.</p>
<p>For this reason, many anxious players @-mentioned Chen Xu on the official Weibo account, hoping to get some answers.</p>
<p>Originally, this was just a method and channel to relieve stress.</p>
<p>But many players unexpectedly received a reply from Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Chen Xu's reply on the official Weibo account was very simple:</p>
<p>“Story + multiplayer, and in terms of story presentation, it will definitely leave a deep impression on players.”</p>
<p>Seeing Chen Xu's answer, many players were surprised.</p>
<p>Although he didn't provide too many explanations about the gameplay, Chen Xu had actually already revealed the game content.</p>
<p>Like <em>Storm Action</em>, <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> features both multiplayer and single-player story modes.</p>
<p>However, the only thing that concerned players were Chen Xu's subsequent words.</p>
<p>According to Chen Xu's meaning, did he feel very confident about the story? Otherwise, why would he emphasize it like that?</p>
<p>This kept many players expectant, though some were also bearish on its prospects.</p>
<p>After all, Nebula Games had grown to such a scale, with many loyal fans.</p>
<p>But Atrai also had many loyal fans, and <em>Storm Action</em> itself was a big IP, so there would still be many potential audiences.</p>
<p>“If you’re talking about gameplay, then I think <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> might actually put up a fight, but for the story, just forget about it.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. <em>Storm Action</em> is a blockbuster movie, and this time, the game's story also involved the original screenwriting team. <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> better take a break.”</p>
<p>“From what I've seen in those promotional videos, the graphics and grand scenes are indeed quite stunning, but the story of an FPS game isn't determined solely by graphics and grand scenes.”</p>
<p>“Heh, for those who think Chen Xu can’t do stories, ease up. Have you heard of <em>Warcraft</em>, <em>Dark Souls</em>? Or <em>Undertale</em> and <em>To the Moon</em>? Which one had a bad story?”</p>
<p>“Exactly!”</p>
<p>Players supporting Nebula Games and those doubting it argued intensely online.</p>
<p>But it was at this moment that Nebula Games released bombshell news.</p>
<p><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> would be divided into a trilogy, successively launched and released on June 1st, June 10th, and June 20th.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the multiplayer mode would be unlocked on June 25th.</p>
<p>Each part would be priced at 366 Yuan, and players could also choose to pre-order the collection for 999 Yuan.</p>
<p>Players who purchased any one part could experience the multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>This meant that the multiplayer mode in <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> was essentially an extra included with each part of the trilogy, with no difference in content.</p>
<p>The only difference was the single-player campaign; if players weren't interested in the single-player story, they only needed to purchase one part.</p>
<p>Such a sales strategy left many players taken aback.</p>
<p>In terms of pricing, the total cost of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> was actually the standard price for a VR blockbuster.</p>
<p>The price didn't surprise many players, who had already mentally prepared themselves.</p>
<p>The truly surprising part was that <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> was unexpectedly being sold in three parts?</p>
<p>In response, the official Nebula Games account and Chen Xu's official Weibo account provided a reply.</p>
<p>They stated that <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>'s overall length was too long, so this decision was ultimately made.</p>
<p>This was naturally not a lie, because compared to the previous life's <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>,</p>
<p>While Chen Xu didn't make many changes to the story itself, as the original plot from the previous life was already very classic, some scenes in the level design were enriched with more content.</p>
<p>The enemy soldiers, as well as friendly NPC ally soldiers, and some maps were modified more perfectly to give the story and player experience a more impactful feeling. For example, Soap and Roach's mission to a Russian military airfield in the Tian Shan Mountains of Kazakhstan to recover a lost ACS satellite module.</p>
<p>So, the game's length would be longer than in the previous life.</p>
<p>Of course, there was an even more important timing aspect.</p>
<p>That was to seize the initiative and make the first move.</p>
<p>The overall content was actually nearing its final stages and had undergone extensive testing.</p>
<p>However, there were still some subtle adjustments to the multiplayer content and the final Makarov level.</p>
<p>The twenty days set aside were for these tasks.</p>
<p>How important is it to make the first move?</p>
<p>In some game team battles, making the first move increases the win rate of that team battle by 30%, and perhaps even more.</p>
<p>And in games, a suitable release time also gains an advantage.</p>
<p>Here, one has to mention a game from the previous life that suffered a heavy blow due to its release time: <em>Titanfall 2</em>.</p>
<p>Although its failure wasn't purely due to timing—it was also related to poor multiplayer balance and the numerous frustrating aspects of the </p>
