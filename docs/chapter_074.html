                <p>Chapter 74: Workshop Update and Multiplayer Games</p>
<p>Over the course of a week, Chen Xu had several contacts with NetDragon and TengHua Games.</p>
<p>Essentially, it was one word: stalling.</p>
<p>The other party expressed an interest in acquiring Nebula Games.</p>
<p>He met with their representative to discuss the acquisition.</p>
<p>Judging from their offer and various conditions,</p>
<p>Chen Xu pretty much had an idea.</p>
<p>They were interested, but not overly serious.</p>
<p>After a few discussions, the other party didn't contact Chen Xu again, clearly having dropped the idea.</p>
<p>Thus, the acquisition matter temporarily came to an end.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a new version of Overcooked was officially launched.</p>
<p>This update came exactly two and a half weeks after the game's initial launch.</p>
<p>The main update content was the opening of the Workshop.</p>
<p>Of course, there were also several new official game maps, themes, and dish combinations.</p>
<p>With the launch of the new Overcooked version, players quickly discovered an update package for the game.</p>
<p>They all rushed to update and download it.</p>
<p>“Huh? Overcooked actually got an update?!”</p>
<p>“It's free? New maps and levels, and this 'Workshop' thing, isn't this usually DLC? So generous!”</p>
<p>“Checked the update description, players can apparently create their own levels!”</p>
<p>“Holy cow, that's awesome! Let me check it out!”</p>
<p>Many players updated immediately.</p>
<p>At the same time, discussions erupted in the relevant Overcooked player communities.</p>
<p>After all, this update was a bit unexpected for everyone.</p>
<p>Generally, this kind of content update belongs to DLC, meaning it's paid.</p>
<p>But this time, all of Overcooked's updates were free.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Overcooked had only been launched for a little over half a month.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous period, although the various 'Breakup Kitchen' and 'Friendship Over Kitchen' memes had seen a slight dip in popularity, the game was still quite hot.</p>
<p>There were still many new players flocking in, which could be seen from the sales volume and online numbers.</p>
<p>This game still had a relatively long lifespan, and updating the version now clearly surprised many players.</p>
<p>After the version update, some players interested in level design began trying out Overcooked's Workshop.</p>
<p>During the game's design, Chen Xu specifically considered the aspect of players creating their own levels later on.</p>
<p>Therefore, the entire creation mode was very simple and easy to understand.</p>
<p>In fact, Chen Xu could have fully integrated these functions into the game itself.</p>
<p>Just like a game called Super Mario Maker in his previous life.</p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, this was not an issue.</p>
<p>But in the end, Chen Xu didn't choose that path.</p>
<p>The main goal was that Chen Xu hoped to use this to build a community for Nebula Games.</p>
<p>How could player stickiness be maintained outside the game?</p>
<p>A stable gaming community could be said to be quite important.</p>
<p>And after the new version of Overcooked was updated, players continuously joined the community.</p>
<p>During this time, quite a few players had already released some self-made levels.</p>
<p>However, they were still relatively crude, basically just involving some simple terrain changes.</p>
<p>Moreover, there wasn't anything particularly outstanding, clearly lacking highlights.</p>
<p>Chen Xu wasn't too worried about this, because as long as enough people created, excellent maps would eventually emerge.</p>
<p>In fact, the Workshop feature quickly indeed stirred up a wave among players.</p>
<p>And the ways players 'broke up' became more diverse.</p>
<p>For example, by personally creating a hellishly difficult map for another person to experience.</p>
<p>In Nebula Games' Workshop community, countless players were discussing this update.</p>
<p>‘Awesome! This update!’</p>
<p>‘Yeah! It feels like there's more content to experience after this update!’</p>
<p>‘I don't know if you've noticed, but some creators have even made levels that can be played smoothly solo!’</p>
<p>‘That's right, it's great! I can finally cook by myself!’</p>
<p>‘Overcooked, playing alone? My heart goes out to you, buddy!’</p>
<p>‘To be honest, before playing alone, I actually had a partner!’</p>
<p>Following Overcooked's Workshop update, Chen Xu checked the online player reviews.</p>
<p>They were uniformly positive reviews.</p>
<p>However, aside from players, it didn't cause much of a stir.</p>
<p>After all, it was just a version update.</p>
<p>But Chen Xu knew very well that the Workshop's design could completely extend Overcooked's lifespan for quite a while longer.</p>
<p>As for how long that would be, it depended on the market and the players; that was beyond his control.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the period that followed, there wasn't much going on, the main focus was the company's expansion.</p>
<p>The entire upper floor had been negotiated with the relevant owners.</p>
<p>It had all been rented, and all that remained was the renovation.</p>
<p>On the personnel side, quite a few resumes had been received.</p>
<p>Chen Xu was also almost ready to start considering the next phase.</p>
<p>Users and profits, these were the two directions Chen Xu would consider next.</p>
<p>However, the main focus was still on users.</p>
<p>Overcooked had started things off well.</p>
<p>Currently, Nebula Games' platform had approximately 500,000 daily active users.</p>
<p>All of them were brought in by Overcooked.</p>
<p>Thanks to the opening of the Workshop, at least in the short term, these users wouldn't be lost for too long.</p>
<p>But if Nebula Games didn't do anything, they would inevitably be lost.</p>
<p>“Multiplayer games, but not suitable for multiplayer games with long development cycles. Also, work on real AAA titles almost has to begin; we can't have zero experience.”</p>
<p>Sitting in front of his computer, Chen Xu already had a sound plan for Nebula Games' future development.</p>
<p>In the short term, he planned to develop multiplayer games with relatively short development cycles to promote rapid platform growth and user acquisition.</p>
<p>Secondly, the entire team also needed to start accumulating experience for true AAA blockbusters.</p>
<p>After all, if he wanted to develop the platform, he would at least need a presentable AAA game as a cornerstone title.</p>
<p>Winning first prize in the Game Design Competition last year and subsequently releasing Outlast and Overcooked had greatly enhanced Chen Xu's resume.</p>
<p>In terms of the official game designer rating, although there was no formal notification letter, the backend resources had increased by half compared to before.</p>
<p>Developing large-scale VR games would strain resources and funds.</p>
<p>However, for PC, funds and resources were actually not bad, and risks were entirely within an acceptable range.</p>
<p>The main issue at this stage was the team's technical capabilities, which had been a consideration for the previous Outlast.</p>
<p>Including this round of new employee recruitment, the personnel requirements were much stricter than before.</p>
<p>Basically, all applicants needed to have over four years of industry-related experience.</p>
<p>The goal was to enable them to meet qualified requirements under his guidance, using the official game engine.</p>
<p>And just as Chen Xu was contemplating Nebula Games' development path,</p>
<p>there was a knock on his office door.</p>
