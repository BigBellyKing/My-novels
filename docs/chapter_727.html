                <p>Chapter 726: I Need to Prove Shadow Fiend Isn't Suited for This Version (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>With the launch of the new version, <em>DOTA</em>'s concurrent online players reached a new high.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, Song Ren, and Wang Han teamed up and clicked 'match.' A 'match successful' prompt immediately appeared.</p>
<p>"This AI is pretty convincing! Just like a pro player?" As they entered the hero selection interface, Zhang Yi couldn't help but exclaim.</p>
<p>Opposite them appeared a team named WINGS GAMING.</p>
<p>"What's there to be afraid of? Look at my Shadow Fiend Nevermore carry you all," Song Ren said with confidence.</p>
<p>However, before he could make his choice, he saw an ID named [跳刀跳刀丶Blink] on the opposing AI team immediately pre-pick his Shadow Fiend.</p>
<p>At the same time, the other four AI bots instantly snatched their respective heroes: Faceless Void as the core and Silencer as support, Skywrath Mage and Axe for the bottom lane. It was a very aggressive lineup.</p>
<p>"Holy cow, these bots are cheating! They picked five heroes first!" Song Ren was dumbfounded, seeing his desired hero taken.</p>
<p>Regular matchmaking involved rounds of hero selection, so why were these bots snatching heroes in a bot match?</p>
<p>"So, Old Song, what are you playing? Shadow Fiend is really strong in lane," Zhang Yi and Wang Han asked, having chosen their own heroes.</p>
<p>Wang Han had initially wanted to play Techies, forming a combination with Undying (冥魂大帝) and Ogre Magi (食人魔魔法师). However, another random player immediately snatched it. But that player was clearly with friends, as they instantly locked in the top lane without a word and chose a seemingly imaginative combination: Pudge paired with Techies.</p>
<p>Though the game hadn't started, combining Techies' skills immediately brought to mind the purpose of this combo: hooking enemies onto Techies' bombs and blowing them up.</p>
<p>"What's there to fear? As someone who plays Shadow Fiend every day, I've been crushed so many times that I've gained some insights. This hero will definitely crush him!" Song Ren confidently chose a hero: Sacred Warrior.</p>
<p>"Can this hero even work? Its attribute growth is so low!" Zhang Yi questioned.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, it'll definitely work. See my second and third skills? That's the core point. For the second skill, I manually cast Burning Spear according to guides, so it won't draw creep aggro. This means I can attack him, but he can't attack me back."</p>
<p>"And this third skill, the less HP I have, the faster my HP regeneration and attack speed become. This means as long as I don't get instantly killed, I can become a perpetual motion machine. It's a shame this skill doesn't add magic resistance, but then again, if it did, it would be too overpowered."</p>
<p>"Anyway, just watch. Today, I'm going to prove one thing: Shadow Fiend is not suited for the current version. My low win rate with Shadow Fiend isn't my fault; it's the hero's fault."</p>
<p>Starting with a Bracer and a set of Tangos, Song Ren's expression was full of confidence.</p>
<p>The current version of Sacred Warrior, Chen Xu had designed according to its reworked version in his previous life. The first skill was Inner Fire, which reduced healing and disarmed, not Berserker's Blood. Of course, Sacred Warrior's armor and initial attack were slightly nerfed.</p>
<p>As for the third skill, Chen Xu did not adopt the version that added magic resistance at low HP, because in that version, Sacred Warrior was truly too strong. Compared to Anti-Mage, that version of Sacred Warrior was more deserving of the title. This was because a Sacred Warrior at 100 HP, if equipped with a Magic Resistance Cloak, wouldn't even die from Lina's Laguna Blade or Lion's Finger of Death.</p>
<p>So now, Chen Xu still followed the later version of Sacred Warrior, removing the magic resistance buff.</p>
<p>As for Shadow Fiend Nevermore, he adopted the version where his ultimate had a fear effect, and his Shadowrazes could stack a damage amplification debuff.</p>
<p>Upon entering the game, Song Ren didn't check the side lanes. Instead, he meticulously blocked his creeps.</p>
<p>However, his basic last-hitting skills were clearly a bit rusty. He quickly missed a creep, and when the creep waves finally met, they were perfectly positioned on the Dire's high ground.</p>
<p>But Song Ren didn't care, because his Sacred Warrior had learned Burning Spear as his second skill.</p>
<p>Manually casting it wouldn't draw creep aggro at all.</p>
<p>Seeing the enemy Nevermore, Song Ren didn't flinch at all and immediately started trading auto-attacks with him.</p>
<p>One Burning Spear after another pierced the enemy, causing a burning effect.</p>
<p>However, the enemy Nevermore wasn't panicked at all. He just traded auto-attacks back. But because he was near the Dire's tower and had trees nearby, Nevermore immediately consumed a Tango.</p>
<p>At the same time, he used the gaps between auto-attacks to distance himself from the melee creeps. Although he couldn't dodge the ranged creeps' projectiles, his positioning allowed Nevermore to avoid several melee creep attacks.</p>
<p>Next, because he had drawn creep aggro, the Dire creeps were constantly attacking the Radiant creeps. When the nearest creep was at low HP, Nevermore's hands suddenly lifted, and a fiery red shadow bloomed beneath Sacred Warrior's feet.</p>
<p>Shadow Fiend's first skill, a mid-range Shadowraze.</p>
<p>"This Shadow Fiend didn't learn Necromastery, he learned Shadowraze!?" Song Ren was utterly shocked.</p>
<p>Among ordinary players, most Nevermore players still primarily focused on the second skill, Necromastery.</p>
<p>This was because the skill increased attack damage upon successful last-hits, and a level one Shadowraze didn't feel like it did much damage. In most cases, having two levels of Shadowraze at level three was considered the kill threshold.</p>
<p>But now, things were a bit different. Sacred Warrior's Burning Spear had a characteristic: it was a thousand damage to the enemy, eight hundred self-damage. Although he was happily attacking, he was losing a good amount of his own health.</p>
<p>More importantly, he had initially planned to trade health, and then at level two, he would learn his third skill, and slowly recover. </p>
<p>But now it was different. Although Shadow Fiend's HP was still continuously dropping, he still had a little over a third of his health left, and only 5 stacks of Burning Spear debuff. Meanwhile, Song Ren's HP had already entered the kill threshold.</p>
<p>No sooner had this thought appeared than Song Ren saw the Shadow Fiend in front of him cast another close-range Shadowraze. His health was instantly depleted.</p>
<p>He subconsciously tried to control his hero to retreat, but the next second he regretted it. Shadow Fiend raised his hands again, unleashing the third Shadowraze.</p>
