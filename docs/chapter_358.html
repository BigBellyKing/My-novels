<p>Chapter 367: Big Brother Dutch with Many Plans (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Carrying his curiosity, Old Dai continued to play the game.</p>
<p>Inside a makeshift base.</p>
<p>A woman named Abigail asked Arthur to go find her husband, John Marston.</p>
<p>Finding someone in the icy wilderness was no easy task.</p>
<p>But Abigail and John Marston were the only couple in the gang, and they also had a child: Little Jack.</p>
<p>So, facing Abigail's request, Arthur was very resistant at first, completely unwilling to go save John Marston, who was also a gang member. This made Old Dai a bit curious: did Arthur have a grudge against John Marston?</p>
<p>However, Arthur eventually agreed to Abigail's request, and a man named Javier from the gang accompanied him.</p>
<p>On the way, Arthur and Javier searched for John Marston, chatting about everything that had happened in Blackwater Town.</p>
<p>Through their conversation, Arthur also learned about some past events.</p>
<p>In the original plan, Dutch and his crew would have made an astronomical sum after this job, but it clearly failed in the end.</p>
<p>And during their escape, in order to get away smoothly, Dutch even cruelly murdered an innocent woman.</p>
<p>Now, not only had they failed, but they had also lost several gang members and were being pursued by Pinkerton Agents, forced to hide in these snow-covered deep mountains and old forests to lay low for a while.</p>
<p>There were no explosions or gunfights, but the magnificent snowy mountain scenery, combined with the cinematic shots of finding John Marston,</p>
<p>and the wolf chase on the way back to the base, still left Old Dai deeply shocked.</p>
<p>Especially the cinematic camera in the game, slowly pulling back into the distance, revealing the vast expanse of white snowy mountains,</p>
<p>made Old Dai feel as if he were watching a movie.</p>
<p>After defeating the wolf pack on the snowy mountain, he rode his horse back to camp.</p>
<p>In the blizzard, the distant scenery was faintly visible.</p>
<p>After rescuing John Marston, players could move freely around the camp.</p>
<p>However, they couldn't stray too far, because if they did, the cold weather would continuously deplete the player's health over time.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if they didn't return to camp to warm up, they would freeze to death in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Playing up to this point, Old Dai already had a faint guess.</p>
<p>That is, the current content was clearly still the prologue of the game; the stage for true free exploration had not yet arrived.</p>
<p>The story continued to advance. After rescuing John Marston, Dutch, the gang's leader, and the team members had to prepare for something.</p>
<p>That was the information they had received earlier in the stable of the woman they rescued, named Sadie.</p>
<p>They planned to use dynamite to rob a train next.</p>
<p>They were currently trapped in the mountains, but that didn't mean they would stay trapped there forever.</p>
<p>Once they left this place, they would need money.</p>
<p>Currently, the gang members were all in a state of panic.</p>
<p>The harsh environment, coupled with being pursued by Pinkerton Agents.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all their money was left in Blackwater Town, and everyone was very uncertain about the gang's future.</p>
<p>So, at this moment, facing Arthur and the gang members, Dutch stepped forward.</p>
<p>'Hosea... everyone... don't worry, we'll get through this crisis, just like before.'</p>
<p>'Arthur, do you trust me?'</p>
<p>'Good, because you know me, son... my plan has only just begun.'</p>
<p>'But we need money.'</p>
<p>'Those Pinkerton Agents, they won't find us.'</p>
<p>'Thank you, Arthur, thank you for your support, it means a lot to me.'</p>
<p>'We'll be fine.'</p>
<p>Watching Dutch encourage everyone in the gang with his highly infectious tone,</p>
<p>even though the current environment was extremely harsh, and their situation was not optimistic,</p>
<p>with Dutch, this wise 'Big Brother' who could always come up with seemingly reliable ideas, leading them, what was there to be confused about?</p>
<p>So everyone followed Dutch's orders, preparing to raid the O'Driscoll gang's outpost to find dynamite and rob a train.</p>
<p>He seemed like a very trustworthy 'Big Brother'.</p>
<p>He also had the demeanor of a chivalrous outlaw, recalling how Dutch had stopped Micah earlier and taken in the woman named Sadie.</p>
<p>No matter how critical the situation, there was no need to panic, because Dutch, as the 'Big Brother,' had many good plans to lead everyone to victory and prosperity.</p>
<p>Was this the leader of the Van der Linde gang?</p>
<p>Old Dai couldn't help but sigh with emotion at this moment.</p>
<p>As the story progressed, Arthur and his companions soon arrived at the O'Driscolls' camp they were attacking.</p>
<p>This was the first large-scale battle in the game.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous battles at the farm and against the wolf pack on the snowy mountain, this battle was more intense.</p>
<p>Most of the Van der Linde gang members were deployed.</p>
<p>What amazed Old Dai during the battle was that if he didn't actively attack, the enemies would almost be wiped out by his gang teammates.</p>
<p>Besides that, Old Dai learned to use a new skill here.</p>
<p>The Dead Eye system, when activated by the player, allowed them to enter bullet time.</p>
<p>After aiming, Arthur would immediately fire at different targets.</p>
<p>In the time-stop mode, Old Dai aimed at four people's heads. After deactivating it, watching Arthur instantly kill all four, Old Dai couldn't help but praise it inwardly.</p>
<p>This was absolutely explosive in its coolness!</p>
<p>The operation was a resounding success. Old Dai searched the O'Driscoll gang's corpses on the ground for valuables.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous life's Red Dead Redemption, Chen Xu made a slight change here.</p>
<p>That was the option for players to choose whether to skip the looting and skinning animations, which was a point of contention for players in the previous life.</p>
<p>Although it was meant to enhance immersion, players might initially find it novel. However, later on, having to watch a few seconds of animation every time they looted a corpse or skinned an animal became a rather torturous design for players.</p>
<p>Many players even found themselves in a dilemma: after enemies died, their corpses were marked with countless small black 'x's on the mini-map.</p>
<p>If you didn't loot them, players with OCD found it incredibly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>But if you did loot them, the time spent watching the animation for looting corpses was longer than the time you spent fighting.</p>
<p>So here, Chen Xu also gave the choice to the players.</p>
<p>In this operation, they not only found the tools for robbing the train but also brought back an unlucky fellow named Kieran from the O'Driscoll gang.</p>
<p>He was one of the O'Driscoll gang members, but the O'Driscoll gang was different from the Van der Linde gang.</p>
<p>Like traditional Western outlaw gangs, the O'Driscoll gang would take in any man with combat prowess, regardless of who they were or their background, leading to a motley crew of members.</p>
<p>Kieran, on the other hand, belonged to the lowest rung of the O'Driscoll gang; simply put, he was the stable boy.</p>
<p>Deep in the blizzard-stricken mountains, despite acquiring the tools for robbing the train,</p>
<p>the gang also needed some supplies.</p>
<p>For example, food.</p>
<p>Next, Old Dai followed a teammate named Charles, who had Native American ancestry, to hunt in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Tracking prey, then hunting with a bow and arrow.</p>
<p>All of this gave Old Dai a very peculiar feeling.</p>
<p>It wasn't like some Western movies where it immediately started with grudges and vendettas.</p>
<p>Up until now, Red Dead Redemption had only featured three battles in total.</p>
<p>One was at the farm, another was on the snowy mountain rescuing John Marston and fighting wolves, and the third was the previous raid on the hostile gang.</p>
<p>Yet, it gave Old Dai a very unique feeling, a sense of everyday life.</p>
<p>Completely different from Beautiful World, which he had played before, Red Dead Redemption had a very slow pace.</p>
<p>Yet, it didn't make Old Dai feel impatient; moreover, this slow-paced experience was quite flavorful.</p>
<p>Because he could clearly feel that the game wasn't deliberately dragging its pace.</p>
<p>Rather, it was because the game's content itself was designed that way.</p>
<p>Accompanying companions could engage in dialogue, allowing players to learn more about them.</p>
<p>It felt as if this was a story that had truly happened in Western history.</p>
