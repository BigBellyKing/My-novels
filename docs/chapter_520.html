                <p>Chapter 519: The Counterattack from The Witcher: Wild Hunt? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>The development of The Witcher: Wild Hunt was proceeding smoothly, but it still required a considerable amount of time for the finishing touches.</p>
<p>During this period, discussions about The Witcher: Wild Hunt never truly ceased.</p>
<p>Because, in addition to Monster Hunter: World and other games, Chen Xu also specifically created some easter egg-like quests.</p>
<p>For example, in Dark Souls, this despairing world, players on the Firelinking path could encounter Ciri, the Lion Cub of Cintra, who had inexplicably crossed over.</p>
<p>In the Western world of Red Dead Redemption, players could find many clues through newspapers and other programs.</p>
<p>And on the islands of the Nebula World, besides the players' housekeeper Chloe, Ciri also briefly visited various player islands as a guest.</p>
<p>Of course, these crossovers were not presented to players all at once, but gradually unfolded over time.</p>
<p>Moreover, the introduction of these elements also achieved excellent promotional results.</p>
<p>Geralt, Ciri, Elder Blood, Wild Hunt, Witchers – keywords related to The Witcher: Wild Hunt were slowly revealed as time progressed.</p>
<p>For game designers in the industry, they had also been paying close attention.</p>
<p>After all, from Nebula Games' various crossover activities, it was clear that they had high hopes for The Witcher: Wild Hunt.</p>
<p>No one wanted to clash with Nebula Games' new title.</p>
<p>Besides The Witcher: Wild Hunt, the most eye-catching title during this period belonged to FOW's new game.</p>
<p>Although domestic Tencent (informal name: Goose Factory) and several overseas developers, such as the Swiss developer LS, who had previously released the highly acclaimed Undercover, also successively launched promotions for their new games during the same period.</p>
<p>But they were all overshadowed by FOW's wasteland game.</p>
<p>Previously, many players, including industry designers, focused more on LS's Undercover sequel.</p>
<p>However, unexpectedly, FOW was truly outstanding this time. It took a different approach, combining exhilarating gameplay with grinding elements, making it highly replayable and directly achieving the highest sales for any of their games.</p>
<p>Furthermore, besides the sales explosion, FOW also maintained a good reputation this time. The rich details and plot skillfully portrayed human nature in the wasteland world, earning it high scores from many game media outlets.</p>
<p>A global media score of 9.3 certainly dropped many game developers' jaws.</p>
<p>After all, before FOW was acquired by Zeus, it wasn't a small studio, but it was still some distance from being a top-tier industry giant.</p>
<p>And while Medieval: Deliverance, which competed with Nebula Games before, was also excellent, it couldn't be called a masterpiece.</p>
<p>But this time, Wasteland 1978 could truly be called a masterpiece.</p>
<p>The high score of 9.3 certainly outshone other game developers.</p>
<p>Such an outstanding achievement was unexpected by both FOW and Zeus.</p>
<p>On various major media platforms, Zeus and FOW certainly made their presence felt.</p>
<p>Alex, the lead designer of Wasteland 1978, also had a triumphant look.</p>
<p>In an interview, he stated that this year's Game of the Year would very likely go to Wasteland 1978.</p>
<p>During the interview, Alex spoke eloquently and confidently.</p>
<p>“It might be too early to talk about Game of the Year, but I am quite confident about Wasteland 1978; it is definitely one of the most outstanding games in recent years.”</p>
<p>“Of course, I have that confidence!”</p>
<p>In the interview, the reporter also asked Alex for his opinion on Nebula Games' unreleased The Witcher: Wild Hunt, but Alex seemed quite nonchalant.</p>
<p>“As for Nebula Games' The Witcher: Wild Hunt, I must admit that some of the content released so far is indeed very extensive, but the quality of a game isn't determined by having a vast background alone, and we haven't seen the actual performance of this game yet.”</p>
<p>“And Wasteland 1978's global media score of 9.3, I believe, already speaks for itself. Of course, if Nebula Games can once again create masterpieces like Red Dead Redemption and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, then I think I would graciously concede defeat.”</p>
<p>This exclusive interview also sparked heated discussions among players on major domestic and international forums.</p>
<p>On one hand, many players supported Alex, as the quality of Wasteland 1978 was indeed excellent.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it provoked dissatisfaction from many players who supported Nebula Games.</p>
<p>“What does this mean? The Witcher: Wild Hunt isn't even out yet, and it's already predetermined to be inferior to Wasteland 1978?”</p>
<p>“Damn, this is way too arrogant!”</p>
<p>Of course, many players also retorted.</p>
<p>“While arrogant, Wasteland 1978's quality is top-notch, and up until now, Mr. Chen's The Witcher: Wild Hunt is still just making grand promises!”</p>
<p>Players with different viewpoints engaged in a small online spat for a while.</p>
<p>In the end, neither side gained an advantage. Chen Xu's fans, both domestic and international, held him in immense regard.</p>
<p>But Wasteland 1978 had already delivered its report card, and its supporting fans felt much more confident.</p>
<p>After all, a global media score of 9.3 was truly exaggerated.</p>
<p>Can't argue with that?</p>
<p>Just throw out a media review score chart, what can you do?</p>
<p>The Witcher: Wild Hunt was still just making promises!</p>
<p>Just then, Chen Xu quietly posted an official Weibo update.</p>
<p>The text content of the Weibo post was very simple:</p>
<p>‘The Witcher: Wild Hunt Promotional Trailer’</p>
<p>Many players became excited after seeing Chen Xu's promotional trailer.</p>
<p>Clearly, this was the counterattack from The Witcher: Wild Hunt!</p>
<p>Claiming Game of the Year? Did you ask me first?</p>
<p>Not engaging in a war of words, but letting the work speak for itself – this truly aligned with Chen Xu's style!</p>
<p>However, players were clearly mistaken.</p>
<p>Chen Xu was indeed aware of the situation with FOW, but this trailer was definitely not a counterattack.</p>
<p>After all, who uses a promotional trailer for a counterattack?</p>
<p>It was purely a planned promotional warm-up.</p>
<p>As for now?</p>
<p>One could only say it was a coincidence. Nevertheless, Chen Xu had no intention of explaining.</p>
<p>On one hand, he had enough confidence in The Witcher: Wild Hunt, and on the other, it was a good promotional opportunity.</p>
<p>Although Nebula Games currently didn't lack promotional resources.</p>
<p>But why not use existing ones if they're free?</p>
<p>As for players, whatever they think, let them think it. It wouldn't have a big impact on Nebula Games anyway.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Upon seeing Chen Xu's official Weibo post, many players, whose appetites had been sufficiently whetted and who were brimming with excitement, immediately clicked on it.</p>
<p>Accompanied by a melodious orchestral piece.</p>
<p>On a wilderness path, a group of cavalry rode forward, but among them was an anomaly.</p>
<p>A white-haired Witcher, with a steel sword and a silver sword on his back.</p>
<p>As hooves clattered, a narration began.</p>
<p>‘Once numerous, Witchers are now few.’</p>
<p>‘To hunt, to pursue the filth of this world, that is the purpose of a Witcher.’</p>
<p>In a gloomy underground ruin, a Witcher whose face was obscured was strenuously slaying ghouls.</p>
<p>By a lakeside forest, the Witcher beheaded a drowners.</p>
<p>In the dark wilderness, the Witcher held a sword in one hand and cast a special Igni Sign with the other.</p>
<p>A majestic royal city on a cliff, the long-dead corpses of monsters, human skeletal remains, burning flames, and terrifying beasts.</p>
<p>‘Among Witchers, there is a legend.’</p>
<p>‘Known as Geralt of Rivia!’</p>
<p>Under the gaze of countless soldiers, Geralt walked into the grand hall of the royal palace.</p>
<p>‘We meet again, Witcher.’</p>
<p>‘Your Imperial Majesty.’</p>
<p>The next moment, the scene abruptly switched. In a world of ice and snow, Ciri was frantically running, with something terrifying seemingly chasing her through the blizzard behind her.</p>
<p>‘She's back… Geralt, after all these years!’</p>
<p>In the imperial palace, the Emperor of Nilfgaard gazed at a childhood portrait of Ciri inside the room.</p>
<p>‘Are you certain it is her?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, she is in danger. Witnesses claim the Wild Hunt knights are pursuing her… You must find her.’</p>
<p>The camera shifted to what appeared to be an abandoned ruin. Ciri in the frame suddenly turned her head.</p>
<p>But the next moment, the screen plunged into darkness, filled only with the clang of weapons, cries of battle, and then silence.</p>
<p>The scene on the screen reappeared, but it showed a village engulfed in flames, and countless Wild Hunt soldiers clad in heavy armor, hidden in the darkness.</p>
<p>‘And after I find her?’</p>
<p>‘I will give her what she deserves.’</p>
<p>As the words fell, fragmented scenes flashed by.</p>
<p>Dreamlike fields of flowers, surging seas, prosperous cities, eerie underground ruins…</p>
<p>At the same time, the narration echoed:</p>
<p>‘The Sword of Destiny has two edges…’</p>
<p>‘One of them is you…’</p>
<p>A dazzling longsword flashed across the screen.</p>
<p>At dusk, a Wild Hunt knight, fully encased in armor, appeared before Geralt.</p>
<p>‘Every decision you make will determine where this world ultimately goes.’</p>
<p>‘To destruction, or to evil?’</p>
<p>Burning villages, tragic battlefields, hideous monsters.</p>
<p>‘But no matter what, you must choose…’</p>
<p>Then the screen gradually faded to black.</p>
<p>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</p>
<p>The game's title officially appeared in the center.</p>
<p>(End of Chapter)
