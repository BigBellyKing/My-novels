                <h3>Chapter 306: Diarrhea-Style Promotion (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h3>
<p>After watching the entire promotional video, many players were quite excited.</p>
<p>"This anti-terrorist game is completely different from the previous ones!"</p>
<p>"Yeah! The items are so rich! Riot shields, Concussion Grenades, explosive charges, and that big hammer is really awesome!"</p>
<p>"And it's so cool! I thought it would still be the same old FPS game gameplay!"</p>
<p>"So you can choose different Operators in it? And I found that each Operator has unique abilities!"</p>
<p>"Ying and Ash, I'm already in!"</p>
<p>"You're already in for that?"</p>
<p>"Forget everything else, this feels too exciting!"</p>
<p>"But seriously, although most of the special ops personnel look incredibly cool, it seems there's one handsome guy who only made a brief appearance from beginning to end and then disappeared!"</p>
<p>"Now that you mention it, I think I do remember there was a sniper."</p>
<p>"How is he not doing anything? Isn't he just looking through his sniper scope over there?"</p>
<p>"Speaking of which, this game feels a bit hardcore. Will we be like that in the game? Feeding instantly, then just watching from the sidelines?"</p>
<p>"Not necessarily. Besides, in an FPS game, you can at least kill someone."</p>
<p>"Exactly. And looking at <em>Warcraft</em>'s Matchmaking system, isn't it pretty good? When strategists like Fledgling Phoenix and Crouching Dragon meet their match, you can always find opponents and teammates at your same level."</p>
<p>"Don't brag, the game isn't even online yet! For this video, are there any experts who can analyze the specific gameplay?"</p>
<p>As soon as this promotional CGI video came out, it instantly ignited the players' passion.</p>
<p>The most crucial point was: coolness!</p>
<p>Most previous FPS games, even those themed around counter-terrorism, mostly focused on the background story. As for the game content itself, there wasn't much change.</p>
<p>It was basically still about gunfights, with throwable items as support.</p>
<p>However, the <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> before them presented players with completely different characteristics.</p>
<p>The game featured Unmanned Reconnaissance Vehicles, riot shields, Flash Shields, Breaching Rams, and a series of dazzling high-tech gadgets.</p>
<p>Coupled with explosive shooting scenes, surgical assaults, and various demolition scenarios, each Operator was portrayed as incredibly cool. Players were already imagining themselves entering a VR pod, transforming into one of these Operators, completing assault missions, and quietly achieving fame.</p>
<p>It fully demonstrated to players what modern counter-terrorism was like.</p>
<p>Of course, most ordinary players didn't actually know what modern counter-terrorism entailed. Moreover, real-world counter-terrorism operations are definitely completely different from what's shown in games and promotional videos.</p>
<p>Genuine modern counter-terrorism operations would inevitably be more cautious and careful than depicted in games. Furthermore, powerful weapons like explosives and demolitions are rarely used.</p>
<p>The main methods are usually riot shields, Concussion Grenades, standard firearms, and some specific auxiliary tools.</p>
<p>However, this is a game, and players aren't actually looking to experience real-world counter-terrorism operations.</p>
<p>For players, they want to experience what they <em>believe</em> counter-terrorism operations should be.</p>
<p>Cool Operators, along with necessary tactics, cooperation, and flashy gadgets.</p>
<p>That was already enough.</p>
<hr />
<p>Players were incredibly excited, harboring immense enthusiasm for this game.</p>
<p>If it were just NetDragon, considering their recent works, players would still be skeptical.</p>
<p>But now it was different; with Nebula Games' name attached, many players felt reassured. All at once, FPS game enthusiasts' expectations for this game soared.</p>
<p>Facing this situation, Chen Xu had been quietly updating the game content. He was differentiating the content for the specialized military version and the regular player version, pushing forward the game's development little by little.</p>
<p>But NetDragon was different.</p>
<p>Based on Meng Zuo's feedback, coupled with some game-related materials currently provided by Nebula Games, NetDragon was overflowing with confidence.</p>
<p>In addition, in recent times, TengHua Games and the Channel Alliance had also released some news about new FPS titles, making many players feel that a major FPS craze was on its way.</p>
<p>So, in terms of promotion, NetDragon pulled out all the stops.</p>
<p>How to describe it?</p>
<p>If Nebula Games' previous external promotions were like making grand promises, followed by an intermittent output, squeezing out a tiny bit of non-critical content for players every now and then...</p>
<p>Then NetDragon's promotion could be described as the explosive promotion one gets after eating Wallace.</p>
<p>Every five days, a new Operator's CGI story video was released.</p>
<p>At the same time, they also showcased potential in-game maps: villas, cafes, banks, consulates, planes, farms...</p>
<p>Elite team members from various countries were introduced one by one, along with their background stories.</p>
<p>They also briefly revealed the game's background story, letting players know why it was a 5V5 battle.</p>
<p>The PVP mode was not real counter-terrorism; it was merely daily counter-terrorism training for Rainbow Team members.</p>
<p>And the PVE content, which involved teaming up against AI, was the true Terrorist Hunt operation.</p>
<p>However, players also clearly understood that despite this explanation, what truly captivated them was the so-called training exercises.</p>
<p>After all, both the attacking and defending sides had unique skills, information gathering, tactical planning and deployment, combined with breaching and defense. Clearly, fighting against real players would be more interesting.</p>
<hr />
<p>While players were filled with various expectations, Chen Xu's development progress was faster than ever.</p>
<p>Although it was his first time developing an FPS game, and also his first major VR project, NetDragon's development team was indeed more professional and mature in this area than Nebula Games' team.</p>
<p>However, during the development process, Qin Yi and others were actually learning all aspects of this content.</p>
<p>This included gun feel and corresponding design.</p>
<p>For example, regarding the sounds of explosions and firearms, many uninformed players might simply assume that recording real-life explosions and gunshots would make it more realistic.</p>
<p>But in reality, this is a completely mistaken idea.</p>
<p>Because if true real-life gun sounds were used, it would be an absolute torture for players' ears. And the kind of unbearable torture at that. Gun sounds in games are very rhythmic, almost musical.</p>
<p>But real-life gun sounds?</p>
<p>Those are purely noise.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the game, because it's a VR game, Chen Xu also added some new detailed content for both the military and regular versions.</p>
<p>For example, for rappelling in the game: in the original game, you first needed to damage the wooden barricade before rappelling and kicking it open to enter.</p>
<p>Here, Chen Xu added a new setting: players can directly kick open the wooden barricade to enter. However, unlike the original, they cannot aim and shoot simultaneously with the kick. Instead, there will be approximately a one-second delay in action. During this time, they can only hip fire, and accuracy will be further spread.</p>
<p>But there is also a more elaborate action, such as first attaching a Breaching Charge to a wall, then rappelling down and entering as it detonates.</p>
<p>This design is, on one hand, true to reality, and on the other hand, it's meant to enhance the player's cool factor in VR mode.</p>
<p>Of course, to maintain balance, there are also restrictions.</p>
<p>A perfect entry involves a perfect explosion phase.</p>
<p>Because the explosion happens first, followed by rappelling and aiming into the room, it gives players inside approximately 0.3 seconds to react.</p>
<p>For a normal entry, the delay would be about 0.6 seconds.</p>
<p>While this move is cool, it requires players to time it perfectly, otherwise, some rather comical scenarios might occur.</p>
<p>As time gradually progressed, amidst NetDragon's explosive promotion, Nebula Games and NetDragon officially announced the experience test for <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>.</p>
