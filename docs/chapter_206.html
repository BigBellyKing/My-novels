                <p>Chapter 205: Doubts About the Design Concept Document (Fourth Update, Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>The people present in the conference room were somewhat stunned. They had known beforehand that Chen Xu would lead them in a new project, which was largely confirmed to be a sandbox game. They had considered many themes and related gameplay styles. But now, looking at the building block toys Chen Xu placed on the table to better illustrate his point, Qin Yi and Ruan Ningxue alike were a little bewildered.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, is our new project a building block game?” Yang Xin asked curiously, looking at the building block toys in front of her and the simple Concept Drafts on the projection screen. Although Chen Xu hadn't fully explained the detailed content of the Concept Drafts, Qin Yi and the others had already identified some characteristics of this game, titled <em>Minecraft</em>. Firstly, in terms of Art, the game adopted a pixel style. Everything in the game was essentially composed of pixels and could be destroyed. For example, if the basic pixel block in the game was 1x1, then a huge stone might be composed of four 1x1 blocks. Other elements were the same.</p>
<p>“Moreover, Mr. Chen, it's likely that a large number of sandbox games will be launched next,” Zhang Yida said. This was the point he, as head of operations, was most concerned about. It was also a very critical core issue. Other Game developers all wanted a slice of the sandbox game trend brought by <em>Don't Starve</em>. Some might be poor, but some quality titles might also emerge, which would all impact <em>Minecraft</em>. Furthermore, there was another crucial factor: the launch time of <em>Minecraft</em>, also a sandbox game, was too close to <em>Don't Starve</em>. If its quality was inferior to <em>Don't Starve</em>, it would have a certain impact on Nebula Games' reputation.</p>
<p>“And regarding game Art, Mr. Chen, why are we using a pixel style? It feels a bit odd,” Ruan Ningxue, who was in charge of Art, also voiced her confusion. Pixel-style games are actually quite rare nowadays. After all, pixels often represent retro, and in the past, pixel game graphics were used due to limitations in display devices and console memory. Moreover, it's genuinely not easy to make a pixel game well, because pixels, in essence, are bitmaps, composed of individual square pixels. To truly execute pixel art well, the Art team needs to place each pixel one by one, which is more troublesome than normal Art. So, unless a game is marketed on nostalgia and sentimentality, pixel style is generally not chosen anymore. But <em>Minecraft</em> opted for a pixel style, which Ruan Ningxue found somewhat strange. After all, from any angle of the Design concept document, <em>Minecraft</em> did not appear to be a retro game or one flaunting nostalgia.</p>
<p>Everyone spoke up, voicing their doubts. Clearly, developing such a sandbox game, and a pixel-style sandbox game at that, at this time left everyone perplexed. After listening to everyone, Chen Xu smiled. He didn't mind their skepticism.</p>
<p>He even thought it was a good thing, as everyone was thinking. “First, recall what I told you earlier about the core content of <em>Don't Starve</em>: survival is a strong objective for players, but it's not the core of the game. Creation is the core of sandbox games.” “Everything in <em>Minecraft</em> revolves around ‘creation,’ its most central gameplay mechanic.” “This creation isn't simply building with building blocks; it's about using <em>Minecraft</em> as a vehicle to create gameplay.” “In fact, if other concurrent sandbox games all use <em>Don't Starve</em>'s survival as their reference point, they've already gone completely astray. They might become excellent survival games or cooperative games, but they won't be excellent sandbox games,” Chen Xu said to Qin Yi and the others.</p>
<p>Qin Yi pondered, “So, for a sandbox game, creation and freedom are the prerequisites, and everything else can be discarded?” “Exactly, that’s the meaning. Of course, I didn't know before whether players would accept this unique sandbox gameplay, so <em>Don't Starve</em> was a trial run, and based on player feedback and results, it seems quite good.” “And in terms of Art, first, I need to correct a misconception: it’s not that <em>Minecraft</em> must adopt a pixel art style, but rather that <em>Minecraft</em> needs to be pixelated! Pixels are a sacrifice for freedom and creation, because <em>Minecraft</em>'s gameplay dictates that this world must be composed of countless blocks, just like building blocks.” Hearing Chen Xu's words, Ruan Ningxue suddenly understood.</p>
<p>These were two entirely different concepts. A pixel-style game simply means the game was made with that art style, but <em>Minecraft</em> was different. It needed to pixelate the game world, which meant dividing the game world into individual cubes, essentially the pixels in normal pixelation. The underlying concepts were completely different. To put it simply, a sandbox game like <em>Don't Starve</em> was a partially assembled toy. Players would buy this toy and need to piece it together, then change outfits or colors according to the assembled base, but the foundation itself remained unchanged. <em>Minecraft</em>, on the other hand, was like play-doh and sand; it seemed unremarkable on its own, but what it could be molded into, whether beautiful or ugly, depended on the player's creativity. <em>Don't Starve</em> was played within predefined world rules, while <em>Minecraft</em>, just like its name suggests, was about creating your own world.</p>
<p>The conference room was very quiet; clearly, everyone was still summarizing and contemplating Chen Xu's words. “So that’s it,” Qin Yi nodded deeply. Judging solely from the Design concept document, Qin Yi felt there was nothing particularly special about <em>Minecraft</em>. But after Chen Xu's in-depth explanation, he understood completely. While he couldn't be sure if such a game would gain recognition from players and the market, there was one thing not to worry about: Chen Xu had clearly given <em>Minecraft</em> a lot of thought.</p>
<p>“And pixels aren't necessarily crude; they can also be made beautiful,” Chen Xu said, looking at Ruan Ningxue. Pixel style indeed symbolized retro. But it didn't necessarily mean it <em>had</em> to be retro. Couldn't modern Art technology be applied to pixel style? Of course it could. In his previous life, there was a very famous pixel game that perfectly integrated its technology into pixels: <em>Octopath Traveler</em>, produced by SE, which players also called "50 Per Square" due to SE's pricing. Its traditional epic storyline and fragmented ensemble narrative weren't perfect, but its most commendable aspects were the Music and the pixel art style combined with modern technology. Furthermore, in his previous life, <em>Minecraft</em>, with various HD texture packs and lighting and shadows, could also give players a visual experience comparable to AAA-tier game graphics. This showed that pixels didn't necessarily equate to outdated graphics.
