<p>Chapter 436: It's Kinda Fun! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Although Song Ren knew it was a game, the incredibly immersive mode of the Huanyu VR gaming pod still made him feel a little nervous.</p>
<p>As Sam continuously fired back, the boat pressed forward through the stormy seas.</p>
<p>At the same time, the enemy's firepower grew fiercer, even employing grenade launchers and sea mines—weapons with greater lethality.</p>
<p>Clearly, they had no intention of letting them leave alive.</p>
<p>“Did we just stir up a hornet's nest? What kind of treasure did Nathan Drake and his companions find to make the enemies pursue them like this?”</p>
<p>Controlling the boat as it navigated the ocean, Song Ren felt a surge of excitement, for the experience was truly thrilling and intense.</p>
<p>The boat rocked precariously amidst the huge waves and enemy attacks. Then, a gigantic wave coupled with an enemy sea mine struck, causing the boat to capsize instantly.</p>
<p>Sam clung firmly to the boat, but Nathan wasn't as lucky; he was thrown directly off the capsizing vessel, plunging into the sea with a 'thump.'</p>
<p>Song Ren, in a flurry, surfaced from the water as prompted, but seeing an enemy boat approaching with a searchlight in the distance, he quickly dived back into the seawater as instructed, triggering a cutscene.</p>
<p>Nathan Drake narrowly avoided the boat's propeller.</p>
<p>Watching the propeller graze past him from a first-person perspective, combined with the immersion of the Huanyu VR gaming pod, even with Awakening Mode on, Song Ren felt a layer of cold sweat break out on his back.</p>
<p>Once the enemy boat passed, Nathan finally emerged from the water and climbed back onto the deck.</p>
<p>However, the boat's engine had completely stalled due to the enemy's sea mine attack.</p>
<p>So, Sam handed his pistol to Nathan to deal with the enemies, while he went to perform emergency repairs on the engine.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, repairing vehicles in games only requires a wrench.</p>
<p>Things flying in the sky, running on the ground, or even in space—as long as you have a wrench, they'll fix anything for you!</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, Song Ren would have indulged in his true nature for complaining and launched into a rant.</p>
<p>But now, Song Ren had no such inclination; he just focused on controlling Nathan to continuously shoot down enemies amidst the tempestuous waves.</p>
<p>There are five difficulty levels in the game, from top to bottom: Explorer, Easy, Normal, Hard, and Crushing.</p>
<p>As a battle-hardened veteran who once eliminated Zakhaev with Captain Price, thwarted Shepherd's conspiracy, and ultimately dealt with Makarov.</p>
<p>Such an excellent elite player naturally chose the highest difficulty.</p>
<p>Er... the 'Explorer' difficulty, which was at the very top of the list.</p>
<p>He also enabled the auto-aim function in the game.</p>
<p>Don't call him a coward, but this was truly satisfying to play!</p>
<p>One aim, and it automatically locked onto the enemy's chest; a slight lift, and it was a headshot.</p>
<p>“This is kinda fun!”</p>
<p>Song Ren couldn't help but exclaim.</p>
<p>He quite enjoyed playing FPS games.</p>
<p>He had invested thousands of hours into games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Rainbow Six Siege.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, thousands of hours of effort didn't make him stronger; he was still a noob.</p>
<p>Now he finally knew what it felt like to be a sharpshooter.</p>
<p>And another thing: the firearms in Uncharted had virtually no recoil. Coupled with the auto-aim function, blasting away with shots was absolutely exhilarating.</p>
<p>“Invincible!” Song Ren beamed.</p>
<p>Although he was shot a few times by the enemy midway, it was no big deal.</p>
<p>Because, just like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Nathan Drake was also proficient in the art of regenerating health through breathing.</p>
<p>This part of the story wasn't very long. After killing a soldier who tried to use a grenade launcher, causing the enemy boat to be hit by a stray bullet and sink to the bottom of the sea, the gunfight ended.</p>
<p>They had to drive the boat again and continue their escape.</p>
<p>But this time, their luck wasn't as good. While dodging the pursuers behind them, a burning boat, on the verge of sinking, crashed straight into Nathan and Sam's boat.</p>
<p>'Nathan!'</p>
<p>Accompanied by Sam's shout, Nathan Drake was flung off the boat by the immense inertia, falling into the ocean, and the capsized boat plunged straight towards Nathan's head.</p>
<p>From a first-person perspective, even with Awakening Mode on, Song Ren shivered.</p>
<p>The next moment, the game screen went dark.</p>
<p>When the darkness receded and the game screen reappeared, the game scene had also changed.</p>
<p>The timeline abruptly jumped many years back to young Nathan in an orphanage, listening to a nun's lecture.</p>
<p>Song Ren hadn't yet recovered from the hail of bullets he'd just experienced.</p>
<p>It wasn't until the nun left the room and the in-game Nathan noticed Sam signaling with a flashlight outside the window, triggering a plot event where he could control the character, that Song Ren snapped back to reality.</p>
<p>Instead of immediately following the system's guidance, Song Ren controlled Nathan to wander around the room.</p>
<p>During the previous escape sequence at sea, Song Ren had already been impressed by the stunning visuals of Uncharted: A Thief's End.</p>
<p>But at that time, his attention was mostly diverted by the escape and combat.</p>
<p>Only now could he properly observe the game's graphics. As for the previous VR theme, it was too monotonous with just a beach scene.</p>
<p>The faint light from the street lamps outside and the moonlight streamed into the room from the left window.</p>
<p>Maps hung on the wall, and the walls themselves were old, showing cracks and peeling white paint.</p>
<p>There were somewhat dirty bed sheets, a bedside lamp next to the nightstand, and a locked wooden door.</p>
<p>Although it wasn't a magnificent vista, the realistic textures left Song Ren completely awestruck.</p>
<p>“These graphics are incredible!”</p>
<p>Not just Song Ren, but all players experiencing Uncharted felt this amazement.</p>
<p>At this point, Song Ren shifted his attention from the visuals to the gameplay. After all, no matter how good the graphics, they were only one part; a game ultimately needed to be judged by how fun it was to play.</p>
<p>After controlling Nathan to climb out the window, Song Ren entered a much broader world.</p>
<p>Looking up at the pale full moon in the sky, he could also see some clouds and stars, with the surrounding streets and scattered lights, mixed with the moonlight, making the entire small town city appear incredibly serene and beautiful.</p>
<p>However, Song Ren could still discern the differences between the game and reality: the colors in the game's environment were more vibrant, and the moonlight and artificial lights were exceptionally pronounced, casting a dreamlike glow over the entire scene—a beauty that couldn't be found in reality.</p>
<p>“Only in a game can you witness such a sight!” Song Ren exclaimed.</p>
<p>Red brick walls, blue-green rooftops, slightly yellowed drain pipes, iron security bars, wall lamps...</p>
<p>Song Ren curiously observed his surroundings, but his attention was soon drawn back to the game's mechanics.</p>
<p>“So, I have to climb a wall now?”</p>
