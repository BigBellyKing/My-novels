                <p>Chapter 20: The Astonishing Breaking of the Fourth Wall</p>
<p>What did this mean?</p>
<p>It knew I reloaded a save?</p>
<p>It was talking to me, not to the character in the game?</p>
<p>Were all his actions accounted for?</p>
<p>Wu Tian suddenly felt a chill run down his spine, even instinctively glancing back at the empty office.</p>
<p>Evidently, Flowey in the game wasn't conversing with the game's protagonist.</p>
<p>Instead, it was speaking directly to him, the player sitting in front of the computer.</p>
<p>It knew what he had done; it even knew he had reloaded a save.</p>
<p>Although Wu Tian was well aware that this was just part of the game's design.</p>
<p>He was still profoundly shocked.</p>
<p>And what did Flowey's words mean?</p>
<p>Did it also possess this power?</p>
<p>What was “determination”?</p>
<p>While exploring the castle, he had encountered several star-shaped sparkling icons.</p>
<p>After interacting with them, he would almost always get the message: “It fills you with determination.”</p>
<p>In that instant, countless questions swirled in his mind.</p>
<p>But more than that, there was a sense of astonishment.</p>
<p>After all, he had initially thought this was just a completely ordinary RPG game.</p>
<p>Yet, with Flowey's appearance, it was as if the fourth wall had been broken.</p>
<p>What other content awaited him?</p>
<p>With this feeling, Wu Tian continued his progress.</p>
<p>One distinctive character after another appeared in the game.</p>
<p>Sans, who offered him a handshake with a whoopee cushion in hand, and Papyrus, who was keen on stopping him with puzzles—this pair of skeleton brothers left a deep impression on him.</p>
<p>Sans, seemingly very lazy, loved to tell skeleton-related puns to tease his brother Papyrus.</p>
<p>His brother, on the other hand, was extremely enthusiastic about blocking the protagonist with puzzle mechanisms.</p>
<p>The interesting part, however, was that if the protagonist got stuck on a puzzle, the skeleton would even voluntarily reveal the solution.</p>
<p>Undyne, a fish-person who seemed a bit chuunibyou, chased him relentlessly along the way. When they finally reached the lava map, she would collapse from dehydration, and conveniently, there was a water cooler nearby, offering the choice to save her or not.</p>
<p>In the laboratory, Dr. Alphys appeared somewhat dull and shy, a perfect representation of an otaku girl.</p>
<p>Later, during a quiz battle with a robot she created, the doctor would even use her hands to signal the correct answers to the player.</p>
<p>And based on the answer to the robot's final question, it became clear that she also harbored feelings for Undyne, the fish-person who chased the protagonist.</p>
<p>The performance before the duel between Alphys and the robot under the moonlight was utterly jaw-dropping.</p>
<p>However, what truly astonished Wu Tian was the conversation he had with Sans in the magnificent golden corridor, just before facing the final BOSS of the game.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, Wu Tian had simply assumed that <em>Undertale</em>'s setting followed the conventions of a typical RPG.</p>
<p>Although Flowey's earlier appearance had shocked and amazed him for the first time.</p>
<p>He had still played the entire game according to RPG mechanics.</p>
<p>Isn't it normal in an RPG to fight monsters and level up?</p>
<p>Miss Muffet, some of the agreeable monsters he encountered along the way he spared, but the more troublesome ones, or those he found particularly unappealing, were all struck down by his hand.</p>
<p>But now, Sans' words made Wu Tian realize he had completely misunderstood.</p>
<p>EXP was not “experience points,” but an abbreviation for “execution points.”</p>
<p>Similarly, what was called LOVE was not a “level,” but an abbreviation for “Level of Violence.”</p>
<p>Every time he killed a monster in the game, his execution points and violence level would increase.</p>
<p>And at this moment, his LV had reached level 11.</p>
<p>In that instant, Wu Tian also recalled Toriel's words about befriending monsters from the very beginning; clearly, the game had been dropping hints all along.</p>
<p>The final battle against the BOSS, Asgore, seemed not evil but rather friendly, repeatedly asking if he was ready before the fight.</p>
<p>If he said he wasn't ready, Asgore would kindly say that he wasn't ready either.</p>
<p>But after passing through the final door and confirming his readiness, everything changed.</p>
<p>Exhilarating BGM blared.</p>
<p>"Strange light fills the room."</p>
<p>"The barrier is about to be broken."</p>
<p>"Your journey is finally at its end."</p>
<p>"You are filled with 'DETERMINATION'."</p>
<p>The narration slowly disappeared. Asgore opened his eyes, uttering, "Goodbye, human."</p>
<p>In that instant, like a god of war descending, his crimson cape flared, and he wielded his trident to smash the "MERCY" button.</p>
<p>"Smash your mercy, and my mercy. There is no escape. This battle is to the death!"</p>
<p>The difficulty of the final stage was extremely high. Although Wu Tian had played similar bullet-hell dodge games, he still found himself in perilous situations.</p>
<p>After successfully defeating Asgore, he could choose to kill or spare him.</p>
<p>At this moment, Wu Tian remembered Toriel's and Sans's words, and he chose to spare him.</p>
<p>Facing the protagonist who had spared him, Asgore seemed very surprised, expressing his willingness to take care of him together with Toriel, forming a new family in the Underground. Everything seemed so warm and beautiful.</p>
<p>But the next moment, a flash of light, like a blade, swept across, and accompanied by Asgore's stunned face, Flowey appeared.</p>
<p>It killed Asgore.</p>
<p>"You idiot, you still haven't learned. In this world, it's kill or be killed."</p>
<p>Accompanied by Flowey's hideous and evil laughter, as Wu Tian stared, dumbfounded, the entire game suddenly crashed.</p>
<p>What was happening? A bug? Why was the game gone?</p>
<p>However, before Wu Tian could remain confused for long, the game automatically restarted the next moment.</p>
<p>And the game's opening animation had also become eerie.</p>
<p>Entering the save interface, what was even stranger was that this save wasn't his.</p>
<p>It read: "Flowey, LV: 9999."</p>
<p>This was Flowey's save.</p>
<p>Choosing to continue, his character appeared in the game against a dark background.</p>
<p>He arrived at a star-shaped save point, and his save information appeared on the game interface.</p>
<p>But the next moment, the screen suddenly trembled, and blood-red cracks spread from the middle of the save information.</p>
<p>Finally, five characters appeared: "SAVE FILE DELETED."</p>
<p>As the save file shattered, Flowey reappeared on the screen.</p>
<p>Flowey, having absorbed the souls of six human children, now proclaimed itself a god.</p>
<p>However, its in-game appearance was that of a grotesque and bizarre monster—this was the true final BOSS battle.</p>
<p>This battle was even more difficult than the previous fight with Asgore.</p>
<p>Upon death, a "Game Over" screen appeared in the game, along with a line of text.</p>
<p>"This was all just a bad dream... And you're NEVER waking up!"</p>
<p>In addition to the text, there was Flowey's chilling, maniacal laughter, and the game screen was filled with "hahahaha" fonts, after which the game crashed and automatically closed once more.</p>
<p>And upon reopening the game, Flowey would continue to utter despairing words to him in front of the computer.</p>
<p>For example, "Do you think I'd be satisfied just killing you once?"</p>
<p>"There is no perfect ending in this world."</p>
<p>The only way to defeat Flowey was to keep persevering until he awakened the other human souls Flowey had absorbed, ultimately causing Flowey to lose its ability to extract save data; only then could this terrifying boss be successfully defeated.</p>
<p>After successfully defeating Flowey, one could choose to kill or spare it, but regardless of killing or sparing, the outcome was the same.</p>
<p>The only difference was that sparing Flowey would reveal the method to unlock the Pacifist Route.</p>
<p>As the final credits rolled, the game officially ended.</p>
<p>However, Wu Tian, in front of his computer, had not yet fully recovered from the shock the game had delivered.</p>
<p>Astonishment—that was the only feeling he had right now.</p>
<p>Pure astonishment.</p>
<p>Breaking the fourth wall, deleting his save file, shutting down his game, and the design of Flowey's dialogue.</p>
<p>In that very moment, the game even made Wu Tian feel as if such an Underground world truly existed, and that characters like Flowey were truly real.</p>
<p>And after this astonishment, curiosity grew even stronger.</p>
<p>In the magnificent golden corridor, his conversation with Sans had revealed everything.</p>
<p>What was called LOVE was, in fact, the Level of Violence, and EXP was execution points.</p>
<p>So, what about the other two endings in the game?</p>
<p>(End of Chapter)</p>
