                <p>Chapter 264: You can even cheese it like this! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the Long Sword's performance was incredibly cool.</p>
<p>And in terms of hunting time, it only took about 6 minutes from aggroing the monster to successfully completing the hunt.</p>
<p>It was quite efficient, one might say.</p>
<p>However, many players were still not satisfied.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, you showed off for nothing!"</p>
<p>"Exactly, exactly! Mr. Chen, if that's normal Long Sword play, aren't we all disabled?"</p>
<p>"+1!"</p>
<p>The players in the live stream room sent bullet comments one after another.</p>
<p>It was the same old saying: cool to watch, but impossible to learn!</p>
<p>Chen Xu said, "Well... skills can be practiced, right? After all, not everyone is born a veteran player."</p>
<p>"Besides, look at this Long Sword weapon, isn't it especially cool? Especially elegant?"</p>
<p>"Such a cool weapon, in animation and manga, it's basically always the protagonist. And you've seen the monster-fighting efficiency; there's no low damage. You could say both its upper and lower limits are very high. You can't have it be cool, high damage, and easy all at once; that would be truly unbalanced, wouldn't it?" Chen Xu said earnestly.</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu's words, the Long Sword players watching the live stream were taken aback.</p>
<p>So reasonable!</p>
<p>They couldn't find a single angle to refute it!</p>
<p>"Of course, in the game, there are also weapons more suitable for struggling newcomers. And remember to make good use of items!" Chen Xu continued.</p>
<p>Returning to the workshop area, Chen Xu changed into Tao Chuang clothes, then put on a Healing Smoke Bomb, crafted a Gunlance, and ate a Felyne Canteen meal for defense. He once again set off for the Diablos's nest.</p>
<p>"If you're just trying to defeat the BOSS, I recommend new players choose the Gunlance, because it's very reliable. As long as your defense is sufficient, you'll be fine. Plus, shelling ignores Hitzone, and in the later stages, you only need to increase your artillery skill to deal damage."</p>
<p>Upon entering combat, to everyone's astonishment, Chen Xu didn't dodge or evade the Diablos's burrowing attacks. He simply stood still, raising his shield.</p>
<p>The Diablos then burst out from underground, crashing fiercely into his shield. But the hunter in the game only took a small step back, and his health bar in the upper left corner only dropped a small segment.</p>
<p>Facing a dragon roar, he raised his shield and fired.</p>
<p>Facing a Dragon Charge, he raised his shield and fired.</p>
<p>Facing two consecutive head thrusts, he raised his shield and fired.</p>
<p>He placed a Healing Smoke Bomb on the ground and just kept his shield up, blasting away. If his health got low, his Palico would send Vigorwasps. If that wasn't enough, he would disengage from combat, create distance, and drink healing potions to continue.</p>
<p>With the Gunlance's shelling, the Diablos's long horn soon broke.</p>
<p>The players watching the live stream were also astonished.</p>
<p>Why did this game suddenly feel so easy!?</p>
<p>Unlike the various flashy Foresight Slash Helm Breakers of the Long Sword, everyone felt the Gunlance required no technical skill at all.</p>
<p>When the opponent attacked, raise the shield, then fire.</p>
<p>It felt like playing an easier version of Dark Souls.</p>
<p>Raise a greatshield, then land a couple of hits after the opponent's attack ended.</p>
<p>He completely turned an action game into a turn-based game.</p>
<p>After about sixteen minutes of shelling, accompanied by the Diablos's wail, the words "Hunt Successful" appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>"See? It's that simple. Besides the Gunlance, the Lance can also do it. However, unlike the Gunlance's Wyvern's Fire which ignores Hitzone, the Lance requires accurate pokes and also has some damage requirements. Of course, if you're patient enough, you can still poke the monster to death." "These shielded weapons basically follow the same routine."</p>
<p>"In addition, for ranged weapons, everyone should pay attention to the Light Bowgun. You can accumulate Slicing Ammo."</p>
<p>"However, the downsides are that it's quite expensive and takes time to gather materials." As he spoke, Chen Xu demonstrated each method in turn.</p>
<p>Under the bewildered gaze of the players, Chen Xu switched to the Light Bowgun, brought a pile of Slicing Ammo Fruit and Slicing Ammo, and went in.</p>
<p>From a long distance, he fired three Slicing Ammo shots into the Diablos.</p>
<p>After a second or two, the Slicing Ammo exploded.</p>
<p>A string of numbers erupted on the Diablos's body.</p>
<p>The Diablos was startled awake and launched a Dragon Charge at the hunter.</p>
<p>But from long range, he simply dodged with two rolls.</p>
<p>Then it was back and forth.</p>
<p>Fire Slicing Ammo, and if the Diablos burrowed, immediately throw a Screamer Pod.</p>
<p>After about sixteen or seventeen minutes, with another wail from the Diablos, the hunt was successful.</p>
<p>The previous Long Sword demonstration fully showcased just how high the weapon's damage ceiling was.</p>
<p>Skilled players could achieve explosive damage output and incredibly elegant movements.</p>
<p>But all players understood that those were feats only veteran players could accomplish.</p>
<p>It was like how Dark Souls could theoretically be played as a Hack-and-Slash Game.</p>
<p>But for the majority of ordinary players, it was still a masochistic game.</p>
<p>However, the weapons demonstrated later were different!</p>
<p>Especially the Gunlance and Light Bowgun felt brainless, making many players think, "I can do it too!"</p>
<p>Compared to being constantly tormented by the Diablos before, this had opened a new world's door for all players.</p>
<p>Even without relying on skill, it turns out you can pass so easily by utilizing game mechanisms!</p>
<p>Instantly, countless hunters who were still suffering were stunned.</p>
<p>"My god, is this Diablos really the Diablos I know!?"</p>
<p>"I don't know why, but I suddenly feel a little sorry for this Diablos!"</p>
<p>"The Gunlance can be played like this! Coupled with that Healing Smoke Bomb, it's incredibly useful!"</p>
<p>"Haha, I did it, I passed! I used the Gunlance and passed! It's so incredibly effective!"</p>
<p>"I tried it too, but my equipment isn't good enough and my defense is too low. The Diablos still hits me pretty hard."</p>
<p>"That last Slicing Ammo was too strong!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, the cost for Slicing Ammo doesn't seem high, it's just a bit troublesome to get Slicing Ammo Fruit and the Light Bowgun."</p>
<p>"The damage isn't very high, but it feels especially mindless!"</p>
<p>Many players watching the live stream expressed surprise, and some impatient players even tried it themselves while watching. They followed the steps exactly, and although the process was a bit tedious, they actually passed!</p>
<p>In fact, in his previous life, there were many ways to cheese in Monster Hunter: World.</p>
<p>The most renowned among them was undoubtedly the Slicing Ammo cult.</p>
<p>With Rathalos and Corpse Dragon equipment, combined with the explosive damage of Slicing Ammo, it took simple mindlessness to the extreme.</p>
<p>Perhaps the pure damage wasn't the highest, but it was absolutely the easiest to pick up and the most brainless. You could easily get a bunch of Slicing Ammo, and if you ran out, you could always resupply at camp.</p>
<p>Coupled with a unique BUFF attribute, it directly rendered other bullet types completely disadvantageous compared to Slicing Ammo.</p>
<p>As a result of this equipment build being too powerful, it was directly nerfed.</p>
<p>Being too powerful, or being nerfed in one go.</p>
<p>In Chen Xu's view, both were too extreme.</p>
<p>And the biggest function of Slicing Ammo itself was actually for tail severing, to compensate for ranged weapons lacking a cutting attribute.</p>
<p>So Chen Xu still retained the Slicing Ammo playstyle.</p>
<p>It was just kept at a relatively low level; don't even think about using this pure routine for speedrunning BOSS fights. It's just a small trick for cheesing.</p>
<p>As for the weapons players use to cheese, it would actually be easy to modify them, but why modify them?</p>
<p>Moreover, these cheesing methods are basically only effective for solo play.</p>
<p>For team play, Slicing Ammo is a problematic element, and using it will lead to a worse outcome than even a Longsword Hero.</p>
<p>Similar to those who embrace the Dark Left-Right Spreadshot cult, if you use it, other players would rather team up with a Longsword Hero than you.</p>
<p>If you play Slicing Ammo cult or Spreadshot cult without truly dedicated teammates or fellow cult members, you are destined to be a lonely veteran hunter.</p>
<p>Of course, it's also possible that while you're fighting, your other three teammates are discussing barbecue tips from a distance.</p>
<p>As for Gunlance and Lance, when teaming up, you're holding your shield, waiting for the monster's Dragon Charge, and then a teammate 'accidentally' bumps you from the side.</p>
<p>Happy? Surprised?</p>
<p>As for whether these routines would allow players to keep cheesing and enjoying themselves, eventually losing the fun of the game, Chen Xu wasn't worried about that either.</p>
<p>In reality, for a grind-heavy game like Monster Hunter: World, clearing the game is just the beginning. The core gameplay lies in the various weapon builds and playstyles in the later stages. Constantly challenging hunting speeds and farming decorations can easily consume hundreds of hours without even realizing it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with the Game AI Performance Technology, the subsequent Tempered monsters will be completely different from those in his previous life.</p>
<p>In his previous life, the so-called Tempered monsters merely had increased attack power and attack frequency. It was just a change in numerical design, which significantly lowered the player's margin for error.</p>
<p>It was precisely because of this that the Slicing Ammo cult was so prevalent in his previous life; after all, it was simple: just mindlessly attack and be done with it.</p>
<p>But now? Players who enjoy cheesing, if they aren't the type to quit after clearing the game but rather keep playing, will sooner or later have to make up for those skipped lessons when facing Tempered monsters.</p>
<p>And what awaits them will be the harsh reality.
