                <h2>Chapter 296: The Inherent Flaws of RTS (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h2>
<p>In the days since Chen Xu demonstrated the balance of 'Warcraft'.</p>
<p>The various online gaming communities and Chen Xu's official Weibo account were filled with all sorts of messages.</p>
<p>And from these messages, countless players' grievances could be seen.</p>
<p>'This is too wicked! Mr. Chen is unbelievable!'</p>
<p>'Exactly! Exactly! He just left a message saying a new version would be launched soon, and then started playing dead!'</p>
<p>'This is torture!'</p>
<p>'But what do you think this new version will contain? A new race? It seemed like the Naga race was playable in the campaign mode before!'</p>
<p>'Yeah, and don't you think the Naga race is highly complete? Their building functions are comprehensive, and their units, from Peasants to Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 units, are all there. Plus, they have complete offensive and defensive tech, unit skill tech, and even their own shop and heroes. They could totally be launched as a new race.'</p>
<p>'I don't think so. That Naga unit type is just too strong. I feel like adding it to the game would disrupt the balance a bit.'</p>
<p>'Exactly, given their performance in the campaign, if the Naga race were added, it would probably turn into Naga Supremacy.'</p>
<p>'I, for one, feel it might be a new campaign storyline. Could it be the story after Arthas became the Lich King?'</p>
<p>'You really can't say for sure!'</p>
<p>Players were all discussing and guessing about the information and content of the new version that Chen Xu had previously revealed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Nebula Games office, Chen Xu was feeling quite comfortable and relaxed.</p>
<p>At this moment, he was reviewing the RPG maps that Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, and a few others had created.</p>
<p>Chen Xu could tell that the few of them had put a lot of effort into these maps.</p>
<p>Including their intricacy and numerical balance, they were better than in his previous life, as the available resources were different.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the heroes in some of the maps were also distinctive, and they had incorporated quite a few easter egg-type heroes from Nebula Games itself.</p>
<p>For example, the Undead from 'Dark Souls' and the Azure Star from 'Monster Hunter'.</p>
<p>Each of these maps also had its own unique characteristics.</p>
<p>'Defend the Sword Pass': Players choose heroes from the Shu Kingdom of the Three Kingdoms period to defend against the Wei Kingdom's attacks. During this, there are elements similar to dungeons, quests, and farming equipment, just like typical RPG gameplay.</p>
<p>'Calamity of the Western World': Players can choose various heroes and gradually advance through the plot, just like a regular RPG, and the entire game's duration can even last four or five hours.</p>
<p>'Demon Hunter Chronicles' is divided into different stages: grinding monsters for equipment and progression, then entering a defense stage, and finally an offense stage.</p>
<p>As for 'Monopoly of the World' and 'Pyramid Escape': the former is a board game similar to Monopoly, while the latter combines numerous casual mini-games where survival is achieved by skillful movement to avoid traps.</p>
<p>Of course, Chen Xu also made some changes in this area.</p>
<p>In his previous life, the RPG maps, mini-games, and tower defense maps in 'Warcraft' were fine, generally having a duration of about an hour and a half.</p>
<p>However, some defense maps and RPG maps often had durations of two to three hours, or even four to five hours.</p>
<p>This could lead to players quitting halfway, and once a player quit, especially on a high difficulty setting, it would be almost impossible to clear the game.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the game, Chen Xu also added a save mechanism.</p>
<p>Players could save their progress if they quit midway and then continue their unfinished game. Of course, considering server issues, this would have a time limit.</p>
