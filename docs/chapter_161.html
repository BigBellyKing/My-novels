                <p>Chapter 260: Widespread Wailing (Seventh Update, Requesting Subscriptions)</p>
<p>But despite saying so, Zhang Yi was also extremely careful at this moment.</p>
<p>After all, a Solitary Longsword Hero had already carted once.</p>
<p>Two more carts and the mission would fail.</p>
<p>So, Zhang Yi and his team played extra cautiously.</p>
<p>They basically maintained half health and then healed.</p>
<p>And at this stage, Zhang Yi finally experienced the burrowing attack Old Song had mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>It was simply impossible to guard against!</p>
<p>Emerging from underground was equivalent to being hit by a Dragon Charge.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it was a team effort now. As soon as one person's health dropped to half, the other two teammates would circle around.</p>
<p>No greedy attacks, put away weapons and run in circles.</p>
<p>"I feel the dawn of victory is upon us!" Song Ren, who had run all the way back to Diablos's nest, also joined the battle.</p>
<p>This time, he had learned his lesson, mostly avoiding wide-range attacks like Reaching Slash and Side Slash, and just focused on right-clicking to poke its behind.</p>
<p>Though the damage was low, it wouldn't accidentally hit teammates.</p>
<p>"Exactly, we're all professional Hunters after all!" Zhang Yi also chuckled.</p>
<p>Joking aside, Zhang Yi had to admit they were quite skilled.</p>
<p>And their coordination was quite tacit. No matter how strong the Diablos was, it was only one monster!</p>
<p>It wasn't like a BOSS from Dark Souls; as long as you couldn't instantly kill me, I'd just drink some blood and be a good man again.</p>
<p>As for not having enough potions?</p>
<p>Worst case, just run back to the tent in the camp to get more!</p>
<p>"Yeah! It's just a mere Diablos!" Wang Han also smiled happily.</p>
<p>But the next moment, four large characters appeared in the middle of their screen.</p>
<p><strong>[Mission Failed]</strong></p>
<p>"What's happening? Mission failed? We only carted once!" Zhang Yi was stunned, looking at the suddenly appearing mission prompt.</p>
<p>"Time! Our time ran out!" Joey suddenly remembered something and said.</p>
<p>"What?! We scraped by for fifty minutes!?" Zhang Yi was also shocked.</p>
<p>Everyone knew that in multiplayer, the monster's health would increase proportionally. For four players, the ratio was 2.6 times the original.</p>
<p>But the crucial thing was that they had never run out of time when fighting monsters before.</p>
<p>They even had time for roasting meat and catching rabbits.</p>
<p>But now, for the first time, their time was up!</p>
<p>"If you think about it carefully, it's not impossible, is it?" Wang Han said to a disbelieving Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>"Indeed, we spent a lot of time running, and also had to be wary of hitting teammates. Plus, this Diablos is different from the Odogaron. While the Odogaron was fierce, almost anywhere was a weak point. But this Diablos, with its armor coverage and big horns on its head, causes weapon bounce when hit. On top of that, its damage is very high and it's constantly doing Dragon Charges, which wasted a lot of our output time," Song Ren summarized.</p>
<p>"This Diablos is quite tough!" Zhang Yi also sighed.</p>
<p>Soloing is prone to carting.</p>
<p>With multiple players, carting isn't as easy.</p>
<p>After all, if you're low on health, you can just run, and there are three teammates to draw aggro, allowing you to heal.</p>
<p>But the key is that with the increased monster health, fighting often ends up hitting teammates. Even without friendly fire, there's still stagger.</p>
<p>Carelessly unleashing damage can easily lead to three carts, but being overly cautious means running out of time.</p>
<p>Tough!</p>
<hr />
<p>In fact, Song Ren and his team were considered lucky.</p>
<p>Because although they boasted a lot, their skills were above average.</p>
<p>But for most ordinary players who reached this point, and some solo players, their consciousness was almost blurred from being massacred by the Diablos!</p>
<p>When facing previous monsters, many players who couldn't defeat them alone could team up.</p>
<p>And most of those monsters' flesh could be cut.</p>
<p>At the same time, their damage wasn't as exaggerated as the Diablos.</p>
<p>But facing the Diablos now was completely different.</p>
<p>Its head, tail, and most parts were covered in hard armor, causing weapon bounce when hit.</p>
<p>And the flanks were easily exposed to Diablos's attacks, so the truly accessible area to attack was its belly.</p>
<p>Many players previously complained about the annoyance of teammate stagger, but they didn't realize how dangerous it could be.</p>
<p>However, when facing Diablos and Rathalos, the so-called stagger damage was fully evident.</p>
<p>Facing Diablos's Dragon Charge or Rathalos's huge fireballs, nearby teammates would 'grinningly' stagger you, and then you'd be pushed home by two little Palicos.</p>
<p>Demon Dance Dual Blades wildly attacked teammates.</p>
<p>Light Bowguns blew up teammates' crotches, Heavy Bowguns shot through companions' defenses.</p>
<p>The charging Lance pierced enemies while also taking out teammates.</p>
<p>The unrestrained Wyvern's Fire gave teammates the joy of flying.</p>
<p>Long Sword's Spirit Roundslash made all trash weapons kneel.</p>
<p>These phenomena frequently appeared in team hunts.</p>
<p>Countless Hunters discovered that after teaming up, their biggest threat wasn't from the enemy, but from their teammates.</p>
<p>And even if the Hunters in a team were very cautious and rarely hit teammates.</p>
<p>But because of this hesitation and the characteristic of aggro shifting in multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>The damage simply couldn't be dealt.</p>
<p>Especially for charge-based weapons, such as Great Sword and Charge Blade.</p>
<p>Great Sword players' three-charge attacks often ended up hitting the floor.</p>
<p>Charge Blade players' Super Amped Element Discharge, whether it hit or missed, was considered their output as long as they unleashed it.</p>
<p>The Hammer that aimed for the head could only scrape feet. Stunning was a blessing, foot-scraping was destiny.</p>
<p>The stationary Bow would charge whenever possible, and if they died, they'd just come back.</p>
<p>The "Dream-Chasing" Hunting Horn never supported, only dealt damage.</p>
<p>The flashy Sword &amp; Shield only jumped around.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in related game communities and forums.</p>
<p>Players were all up in arms.</p>
<p>Players universally declared, "What's going on? This isn't what we agreed upon!"</p>
<p>"How could the game's difficulty be so simple at first, but now it's so hard?"</p>
<p>"This Diablos and Rathalos are too difficult to beat!"</p>
<p>"So, all the Great Jagras and Kulu-Ya-Ku from before were just an illusion?"</p>
<p>Initially, quite a few players wondered if they were playing incorrectly.</p>
<p>Perhaps there was a special way to clear it, or their equipment hadn't been upgraded enough, which made it so difficult?</p>
<p>But when these players experienced another round of Diablos's charge service and Rathalos's BBQ service, and then checked the forums.</p>
<p>Good heavens, it turned out everyone was in the same boat, all stuck at these two monsters, Diablos and Rathalos!</p>
<p>"Damn it! So that's how it is, I thought Chen Xu had improved, but he was waiting for us here!"</p>
<p>"Indeed, the Warrior of Love lives up to his name. This 'love' is practically overflowing!"</p>
<p>"Damn, I'm speechless. At first, I thought it was a hack-and-slash game, but then in the mid-game, it turns out I'm the one being hacked and slashed?"</p>
<p>"Haha, didn't some folks say earlier they hoped the dragons would be stronger and not so easily defeated? Satisfied now?"</p>
<p>"This 'boiling a frog in warm water' trick, I'm thoroughly impressed!"</p>
<p>"F*** this, refund!"</p>
<p>"My friend, you're thinking too much. To have reached Diablos, not to mention grinding other monsters and gameplay, just the main story alone has been ten hours! A refund is impossible, you can only endure the abuse!"</p>
<p>"Forgive me, I originally thought soloing was already difficult, but after reaching Diablos, I realized that teaming up is an even bigger nightmare!"</p>
<p>"Haha, exactly, teaming up is the nightmare! Before, fighting weaker monsters didn't feel like much, but against strong, aggressive monsters like Diablos, being staggered by a teammate is pure despair!"</p>
<p>Instantly, online players were wailing universally.</p>
<p>After all, these players weren't like those from the previous life, many veteran Hunters who had played since the original Monster Hunter series. All these players were brand-new rookie Hunters.</p>
<p>Of course, there were also quite a few Firelinkers who had been put through Dark Souls' tortures.</p>
<p>But even so, they were still getting abused in the game to the point of numbness, because the BOSS fight style of Monster Hunter: World was completely different from Dark Souls!</p>
<p>What about the gradual progression? What about the slowly rising difficulty curve? Why did it suddenly shoot up to ninety degrees?</p>
