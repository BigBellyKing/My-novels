                <p>Chapter 278: Arthas (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Song Ren, who had just finished watching this CG and was brimming with excitement with nowhere to vent it, heard Zhang Yi's voice in the voice channel. He had just switched out to unmute his microphone, ready for a hearty chat to release his inner excitement, when he heard a 'ding-dong' sound in the voice channel.</p>
<p>This was the sound of a user leaving the channel. He looked at the voice channel, now with only himself remaining.</p>
<p>Thinking about the game's CG he had just witnessed, Song Ren felt completely numb.</p>
<p>"What kind of person is this!"</p>
<p>"This is just too much!"</p>
<p>"You just unmuted your mic to say something to me, and then you left!?"</p>
<p>Looking at the game screen, Song Ren felt genuinely uncomfortable holding it all in, so he decided to take a photo and post it on his Moments.</p>
<p>'This RTS is absolutely phenomenal!'</p>
<p>After sending it, Song Ren felt a little better, then turned back to the game in front of him.</p>
<p>In reality, it wasn't just Song Ren and Zhang Yi who were incredibly excited.</p>
<p>Countless players following <code>Warcraft</code> were equally thrilled.</p>
<p>Because <code>Warcraft</code> was launched with a free trial version, players, regardless of their opinions, essentially downloaded it immediately, ready to give it a try.</p>
<p>And with this trial, both RTS enthusiasts and those who didn't usually play RTS games were instantly captivated by the game.</p>
<p>For RTS fans, the various settings and innovations in <code>Warcraft</code> felt like a hook pulling at their hearts.</p>
<p>Attack types, defense types, as well as the buildings, various unit types, technology, and hero settings in the story campaign.</p>
<p>It could be said that it completely overturned previous RTS gameplay. Many passionate RTS players could already feel that these unique settings would offer an incredibly novel experience for multiplayer combat.</p>
<p>As for ordinary players, they didn't really care much about the RTS gameplay itself.</p>
<p>They didn't fully understand hero settings or unit attribute settings.</p>
<p>But the game's story and its meticulously produced CGs completely won them over.</p>
<p>It's a commonly acknowledged fact in the industry that RTS games are difficult to make story-driven.</p>
<p>This is due to a lack of immersion, and because RTS game models are generally quite rough, it's hard to create a sense of immersion for players through story performances.</p>
<p>But <code>Warcraft</code> was completely different.</p>
<p>Not only was the storyline tight and captivating, but the key was how extravagant it was!</p>
<p>Every two levels, there was a CG animation to introduce the game's story and background to players.</p>
<p>As an RTS game, it managed to create such exquisite models, coupled with dialogue and close-ups. Although it couldn't compare to RPGs in this regard, there wasn't a single RTS game that could rival it.</p>
<p>This immediately made even some players who disliked RTS games fall in love with <code>Warcraft</code>'s story.</p>
<p>What surprised many players even more was how incredibly rich the content of this trial version was.</p>
<p>The previous <code>Monster Hunter: World</code> trial content, from small Jagras to Great Jagras, was only about two hours long.</p>
<p>But <code>Warcraft</code>'s trial content made many players forget that they were just playing a demo.</p>
<p>The trial version alone showcased the tip of the iceberg of the game's vast background world view.</p>
<p>The conflict between the Orcs and Humans, and the eerie plague, with the first chapter's story content in the trial version completely immersing players.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>"Prince Arthas has really changed," Zhang Yi couldn't help but exclaim.</p>
<p>The plague swept through all of Stratholme, and everyone was about to be converted into Scourge soldiers. In response, Arthas made a decision: to personally kill these common people to prevent them from becoming minions of the Scourge.</p>
<p>But Uther refused this order, and Jaina, shocked and disappointed, abandoned Arthas and left.</p>
<p>What left the deepest impression on Zhang Yi was the scene where Arthas quietly tried to make Jaina stay in the rain.</p>
<p>Faced with Arthas's plea, Jaina merely uttered, "I'm sorry, Arthas... I can't watch you do this."</p>
<p>This was the content Zhang Yi had experienced so far, and it also made him feel that Arthas, once a proud prince, had become incredibly paranoid.</p>
<p>Later, an edict arrived from the capital stating that Arthas's mentor, Uther, had convinced the King upon his return to Lordaeron, ordering Arthas to bring his expeditionary force back home.</p>
<p>But hatred consumed Arthas's heart. He swore to make the Dreadlord and the dark hand that spread the plague pay in blood, even committing acts that violated the Paladin's code of ethics.</p>
<p>Arthas pursued the Dreadlord all the way to Northrend, hiring local indigenous mercenaries to secretly damage and destroy the expeditionary force's ships, severing their only path home, enacting a Warcraft-style "burning bridges."</p>
<p>It was here that Zhang Yi finally realized that Prince Arthas had slowly been losing his sanity amidst the hatred.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Northrend, on this glacier-covered continent, Arthas and his expeditionary force had no room for retreat.</p>
<p>Snowflakes continuously fell from the sky, and the game's BGM suddenly became somewhat oppressive.</p>
<p>At this time, Arthas still held his Paladin's warhammer.</p>
<p>But in his eyes, there was only the fire of hatred.</p>
<p>Even though his companion Muradin already felt that Arthas had changed and loudly questioned him.</p>
<p>Yet, as a friend, he still decided to follow Arthas to search for the legendary artifact, <code>Frostmourne</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, deep within Northrend's glaciers, they found the location where <code>Frostmourne</code> was sealed in ice.</p>
<p>After entering the cave, Muradin also discovered that <code>Frostmourne</code> was imbued with a powerful evil curse, but Arthas, blinded by the fire of vengeance, ignored his old friend's warnings and picked up <code>Frostmourne</code>.</p>
<p>As the ice seal shattered, Muradin was stunned by magical shards of ice, while Arthas, gripping <code>Frostmourne</code> tightly with both hands, ignored his old friend's fate.</p>
<p>Expressionless, he left the cave carrying <code>Frostmourne</code>. Deep within the frozen wastes of Northrend, Arthas's last shred of humanity was crushed here.</p>
<p>With the successful slaying of the Dreadlord Mal'Ganis.</p>
<p>The next moment, the screen went black briefly, followed by another CG animation, which made Zhang Yi eagerly anticipate what was next.</p>
<p>First, distant bells tolled.</p>
<p>Amidst the sacred melody, the camera swept over the Lordaeron City-state, looking down upon the returning Arthas.</p>
<p>Countless citizens of Lordaeron erupted in cheers and celebration.</p>
<p>Pink petals, falling from the sky, danced everywhere, enveloping the royal city, welcoming Arthas's heroic return to Lordaeron.</p>
<p>However, the moment Arthas entered the city, the black-robed Arthas extended his right hand and caught a petal from the air. The previously grand and celebratory music instantly changed its tune, filling the background with a mournful and desolate sound.</p>
<p>Catching a fallen petal from the sky, Arthas's thumb gently rubbed it, then he indifferently discarded the petal and looked up at the sky and the cheering populace on the city walls.</p>
<p>No one noticed that Arthas's golden hair, once vibrant, had now turned a deathly pale.</p>
<p>The warhammer in his hand, once a symbol of the Knights of the Silver Hand, had also transformed into <code>Frostmourne</code>.</p>
<p>His Paladin's silver-blue armor was now a skeletal Undead war-armor, inlaid with skulls.</p>
<p>In the resplendent throne room, King Terenas sat on his throne, awaiting his son.</p>
<p>The next moment, the grand doors were violently pushed open, and Arthas entered the hall, followed by his retinue.</p>
<p>Drawing his sword and kneeling, Arthas saluted his father, the King.</p>
<p>With surprise and a hint of confusion, King Terenas rose to greet his son.</p>
<p>"Oh, my son!"</p>
<p>However, Arthas, kneeling there, showed no response.</p>
<p>Because at this very moment, in Arthas's consciousness, only one voice remained.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, <code>Frostmourne</code> in front of him glowed with an eerie, faint blue light.</p>
<p>'You no longer need to sacrifice yourself for your people.'</p>
<p>'You no longer need to bear the heavy burden of the crown.'</p>
<p>'I have arranged everything.'</p>
<p>As this voice echoed in his mind, Arthas suddenly rose and walked directly towards his bewildered father, sword in hand.</p>
<p>The camera shifted to the reflection on the wall behind the throne, where Arthas had already reached King Terenas.</p>
<p>'What is this? My son, what are you doing?'</p>
<p>In the reflection, Arthas raised <code>Frostmourne</code> high and said without emotion, "Inheriting your throne, my father..."</p>
<p>Accompanied by a tragic cry, <code>Frostmourne</code> pierced the king's chest.</p>
<p>In the reflection, the elderly king's body slumped in his seat, and his blood-stained crown rolled down the steps onto the floor.</p>
<p>The bells still echoed, but so did Arthas's cold and ruthless words.</p>
<p>'This kingdom shall fall...'</p>
<p>'From its ashes, a new order will arise...'</p>
<p>'It will shake the very foundations of this world...'</p>
<p>The CG ended, and Zhang Yi had not yet recovered from the shock.</p>
<p>But the next moment, a pop-up window on the screen gave Zhang Yi a headache.</p>
<p>【The trial experience has ended. The official version will be launched on November 15th】</p>
<p>Looking at the pop-up, Zhang Yi was completely speechless.</p>
<p>"It cut off again!"</p>
<p>He was just getting into it, and he was curious about what kind of story awaited Arthas next.</p>
<p>"How the hell did it just end!?"</p>
<p>(End of Chapter)</p>
