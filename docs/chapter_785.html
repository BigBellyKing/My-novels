                <p>Chapter 784: The Comprehensive Open-World Game</p>
<p>“What is the most important aspect of an open-world game? Freedom? Gameplay? Neither. The most crucial point is the world itself.”</p>
<p>Chen Xu slowly began to speak, looking at the assembled team. He had actually mentioned the core aspects of open-world design many times in previous Nebula Games internal meetings.</p>
<p>“No matter the direction, the most important core of an open-world game is the creation of its world. For example, in <code>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</code>, the world is shaped by its gameplay: wind makes fire burn brighter, water and iron conduct electricity, and wooden weapons burn when exposed to high temperatures. These elements make players feel the world's realism.”</p>
<p>“This is how the world is created in Zelda. In <code>Red Dead Redemption</code>, the open world is shaped by details, and <code>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</code> relies on a strong background. All of these elements serve to create a world that feels real to the players. So, besides these, what else can make players truly experience the world within an open-world game?”</p>
<p>Chen Xu paused, looking at the contemplative faces of the team before him, then smiled and said, “It is life.”</p>
<p>“Just like the shrines and towers in <code>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</code>, players start with very little map coverage. As they explore and discover more cities, they learn about quests through conversations with NPCs in the street or by reading a book. This is the essence of exploration.”</p>
<p>“Similar to Link waking up with amnesia, players and the protagonist learn about the entire world and grow together. This is about gameplay and the game's emphasis on a sense of immersion.”</p>
<p>“Finally, the most important point is to enrich the side quests beyond the main quest. Just like <code>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</code>, the main story is deemphasized to enhance the world's immersion.”</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu, general directions quickly formed in everyone's minds.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, it would be like <code>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</code>, where players and new characters grow together through exploration. In terms of content and world-building, it would have a strong background and setting like <code>Red Dead Redemption</code> and <code>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</code>.</p>
<p>A comprehensive open-world game that blends the core elements of both types of open worlds?</p>
<p>Thinking about this, everyone felt a surge of excitement.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, what's the name of this new game? And what's its theme?” Qin Yi finally couldn't help but ask.</p>
<p>Chen Xu smiled, clicked on his laptop, and connected it to the projector. A new folder appeared on the large screen:</p>
<p><code>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</code></p>
<p><code>The Elder Scrolls</code> was an IP game from Chen Xu’s previous life that spanned over two decades, a game with endless charm.</p>
<p>In his previous life, this series needed only a single image, a piece of music, and a title to drive countless players wild.</p>
<p>It was renowned for its vast and epic fantasy worldview and extreme freedom, allowing players to become completely immersed in a world called Tamriel.</p>
<p>The world-building was immense, and the world itself was incredibly free. It felt as if everyone had their own story, filled with details that made you feel it was a real place.</p>
<p>Especially the <code>Skyrim</code> installment, it was an absolute classic.</p>
<p>Although, due to the technology of its time, it didn't achieve perfection in every aspect, its core development philosophy was impeccable. Later open-world games often showed its influence.</p>
<p>Even a decade later, it remained one of the benchmarks for open-world games that countless developers studied.</p>
<p>However, as time progressed, the game's shortcomings gradually became apparent.</p>
<p>The AI interaction was not high, the graphics couldn't keep up with the times, and the combat system was terrible, feeling like you were swinging at air.</p>
<p>But none of this could obscure its brilliance.</p>
<p>As for the notion that <code>The Elder Scrolls</code> relied on MODs, that was naturally baseless. It's true that the nickname 'Waifu Scrolls' became more popular than <code>The Elder Scrolls</code> to some extent, and some games did achieve greater success due to MODs, but <code>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</code> was definitely not one of them. For Old Scrolls, MODs were merely the icing on the cake, not a determining factor in its fate.</p>
<p>From a humble prisoner about to be beheaded, step by step climbing to the Throat of the World, meeting the Greybeards and learning of his destiny, to ultimately confronting Alduin, the World-Eater.</p>
<p>One could say it was a traditional fantasy story.</p>
<p>From a lowly and weak individual, he grew to become the Dragonborn, saving the world.</p>
<p>The entire Province of Skyrim felt like a real world, inviting players to embark on adventures within it.</p>
<p>Along the way, if you killed a bandit, you might find a letter to his wife on his body.</p>
<p>Following the address in the letter, you could even find his wife's home and uncover clues about him there.</p>
<p>Every character, even a common NPC, had their own story.</p>
<p>In <code>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</code>, players could, like in <code>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</code>, ignore the main quest and do whatever they wished.</p>
<p>Alternatively, they could, like in <code>Red Dead Redemption</code> and <code>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</code>, participate in a grand and epic storyline.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>In the meeting room, the core development personnel sat in their respective seats, listening to Chen Xu's explanation.</p>
<p>The basic game settings didn't particularly surprise them, as they were quite conventional.</p>
<p>For instance, the Class and Race settings: the game featured basic classes like Warrior, Mage, Assassin, and Archer.</p>
<p>These were all very traditional.</p>
<p>The only distinct feature was the freedom in <code>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</code>.</p>
<p>If players wished, a Warrior could cast powerful magic; an Assassin could wield two axes and charge into a crowd for a kill with no witnesses.</p>
<p>A Mage could wear armor and a greatsword to go toe-to-toe with enemies, and an Archer could sneak behind enemies to perform a perfect assassination with a dagger.</p>
<p>Whether it was effective was another matter, but if you wanted to play that way, you could.</p>
<p>The game also featured an extensive skill tree with skills like Lockpicking, Enchanting, and Smithing.</p>
<p>The only surprising point was that, aside from the main quest, the side quests Chen Xu described were even more elaborate than the main quest itself.</p>
<p>For example, players could participate in the war between the Stormcloaks and the Empire, join the Companions, eradicate the Dark Brotherhood, travel to Winterhold to become the Arch-Mage, or complete quests related to the Daedric Princes.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>For Chen Xu, the core storyline and gameplay of <code>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</code> were already very clear. The remaining task was mainly optimization, as <code>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</code> was not without its flaws.</p>
<p>Firstly, there was the issue of map transitions. Compared to the previous life's <code>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</code>, where opening a door often triggered a loading screen, with more powerful technical capabilities, Chen Xu could make the game much smoother, avoiding such a fragmented experience.</p>
<p>Secondly, the combat feel.</p>
<p><code>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</code> was an ARPG masterpiece, a landmark title, there was no doubt about that. But its combat performance was simply too poor.</p>
<p>Combat effects in the game, especially melee, felt like swinging at air.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the characters in the game were incredibly ugly.</p>
<p>From royalty and nobles, mages and princesses, down to peasants and soldiers, not only were they unattractive, but the appearances of most NPCs could even be described as horrifying.</p>
<p>From beginning to end, perhaps only Serana, the beautiful vampire, was easy on the eyes.</p>
<p>Of course, Chen Xu wasn't aiming for extreme beauty, as the setting of <code>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</code> was somewhat similar to the Medieval era. But at the very least, most ordinary people should have human-like appearances.</p>
