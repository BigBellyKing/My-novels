                <p>Chapter 262: Mr. Chen's Bluffing Session (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>For two consecutive days, many players online were strongly demanding nerfs for Diablos and Rathalos, and boosts for the Long Sword's stats.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, don't you feel heartbroken seeing the tragic fates of so many Longsword Heroes!?”</p>
<p>Then, something that surprised everyone occurred.</p>
<p>Nebula Games and Chen Xu actually released a notification on their official Weibo account.</p>
<p>Live streaming platforms like Shark TV also issued an event notice.</p>
<p>“On the evening of August 11th, at 7:30 PM, Chen Xu, the designer of Monster Hunter: World, will conduct a live stream of the game to answer everyone's questions.”</p>

<p>Some veteran players, however, remembered the so-called strategy guide videos for Dark Souls.</p>
<p>Regardless, it attracted countless players.</p>
<p>At 7:20 PM that evening, a large number of viewers gathered in Nebula Games' live streaming room, engaging in discussions.</p>
<p>This was considered prime-time for evening live streaming, but many popular streamers in the gaming section weren't broadcasting themselves; instead, they directly clicked into Nebula Games' live streaming room from their own channels.</p>
<p>They were all very curious to take a look, as the trend of Monster Hunter: World had swept across major live streaming websites since its launch.</p>
