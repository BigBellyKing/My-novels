                <p>Chapter 265: System Fully Upgraded (Fifth Update, Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>In the Wildspire Waste's Diablos's Den.</p>
<p>Accompanied by a mournful wail, the Diablos collapsed and died.</p>
<p>Song Ren couldn't help but burst into laughter: "Awesome!! Just a puny Diablos! A mere weakling!"</p>
<p>Looking at the Diablos's corpse on the ground, Song Ren couldn't resist taking a photo and posting it on his Moments.</p>
<p>Two minutes later, Zhang Yi sent a message: "Holy crap, Old Song, why did you switch to Gunlance? Weren't you determined to be a Longsword Azure Star?"</p>
<p>"What Long Sword? I don't understand what you're talking about? Besides, I'm doing this for the team. Didn't you guys say Long Swords easily cause friendly fire? So I switched, didn't I?" Song Ren engaged in a wave of selective amnesia.</p>
<p>Although the Long Sword was indeed cool, facing the rampage of the Diablos, he still chose to abandon his conviction.</p>
<p>It wasn't just Song Ren; many other players who were stuck on levels did the same.</p>
<p>They all adopted these "skipping class" methods, thoroughly enjoying the pleasure of bypassing challenges.</p>
<p>And after these players defeated the Diablos and Rathalos using these "skipping class" methods,</p>
<p>they didn't feel bored. On the contrary, they were filled with self-confidence.</p>
<p>They couldn't wait to challenge even stronger monsters later on.</p>
<p>Even some of the original comments re-emerged.</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter: World</em>'s difficulty is underperforming!</p>
<p>The Gunlance and Light Bowgun aren't just skipping class; they're dropping out of school entirely!</p>
<p>Facing these inflated players, Chen Xu chuckled.</p>
<p>"Healed the scar, forgotten the pain. I hope you can still smile when you face BOSSes like Deviljho, Nergigante, Kirin, and Lunastra."</p>
<hr />
<p>While players happily roamed and hunted in the New World, Chen Xu also opened his system, something he hadn't done in a long time.</p>
<p>He hadn't drawn a lottery in ages, and this time, Chen Xu was genuinely excited.</p>
<p>After all, since <em>Minecraft</em> launched, his points hadn't moved.</p>
<p>The points generated by <em>Minecraft</em>'s success must be enormous.</p>
<p>With a hint of excitement, Chen Xu opened the system.</p>
<p>Units, tens, hundreds, thousands... nine digits, converted into lottery draws.</p>
<p>Goodness, he had accumulated over two thousand draws.</p>
<p>He had never been this wealthy!</p>
<p>Chen Xu was now very familiar with the matter of drawing lots.</p>
<p>He started drawing directly, beginning with 500 pulls.</p>
<p>Chen Xu was too lazy to even look at the golden flashes. After 500 pulls were done, he swept his gaze across the results.</p>
<p>There were no golden items, but he did spot a purple item.</p>
<p>'Keyboard Milk Spout Card (Self-only): After use, allows you to perform incredible actions in the game, accompanied by a commentator's predictions, bringing a large amount of positive attention to the game. (Sometimes milk spurting from the keyboard isn't necessarily a bad thing.)'</p>
<p>What the heck?!</p>
<p>Keyboard Milk Spout? Is this letting others "poison milk" him (jinx him)?</p>
<p>And the effect doesn't seem very powerful!</p>
<p>Bringing a large amount of positive attention? He wasn't short on money for promotion now.</p>
<p>Chen Xu glanced at it cursorily and then tossed it aside.</p>
<p>After that, he saw an item that caught his attention.</p>
<p>'Self-Service Shop Key *1: Can open the shop to purchase specified items.'</p>
<p>Able to open a shop to actively purchase items?</p>
<p>Could those golden AI visual enhancement technology cards he saw before be directly purchased then?</p>
<p>Looking at the key item in front of him, Chen Xu noticed a preview button next to it.</p>
<p>Trying to click it, a large pile of items popped up in front of Chen Xu.</p>
<p>However, after scanning through them from beginning to end, Chen Xu felt a little disappointed.</p>
<p>Because there were no items of gold quality or higher. Items like the 'Fear Converter' he obtained while making <em>Outlast</em>, and the 'Keyboard Milk Spout Card' he just got, were quite numerous, all purple quality. However, their prices were uniformly steep, starting with eight-digit points.</p>
<p>Clearly, this stuff was definitely overpriced. After all, the Fear Converter only earned a few million points in total, but it was being sold for eight digits?</p>
<p>Even unscrupulous merchants aren't this outrageous!</p>
<p>Besides those, there were also Memory Capsules and common skill trees, but each was priced at six digits.</p>
<p>"Too dark!" Chen Xu couldn't help but exclaim.</p>
<p>Then Chen Xu turned his attention to the other skill books.</p>
<p>Some new ones appeared, but most were those he had drawn before.</p>
<p>Item Design, Plot: 83 books.</p>
<p>Camera Work, Directing Expertise, Psychological Expertise: 120 books.</p>
<p>Architecture, Art Concept Art, Action Special Effects: 171 books.</p>
<p>Music, Sound Effects: 79 books.</p>
<p>Aside from those, the rest were all Memory Capsules.</p>
<p>"Consume a batch first, then save the remaining points for a while."</p>
<p>As Chen Xu used the skill books, he also pondered.</p>
<p>But the next moment, a prompt appeared on the screen: "Current skill value meets promotion conditions, enabling Stage Two."</p>
<p>It upgrades?!</p>
<p>Chen Xu froze for a moment, seeing the system in front of him burst into colorful light, revealing a new UI interface.</p>
<p>The Gashapon machine itself wasn't much different from before.</p>
<p>But why did the points for drawing increase to 1,000,000 per pull?</p>
<p>'Entering Stage Two, previously acquired points remain valid.'</p>
<p>'Stage Two: Corresponding points obtained, in addition to Emotion Points, will be comprehensively calculated based on Industry Influence.'</p>
<p>What does this mean?!</p>
<p>Looking at the brand new system, Chen Xu was stunned for a long time, only understanding the situation after a bit of research.</p>
<p>First, points still originated from players' emotions, just like before.</p>
<p>But the difference was the addition of an upper limit threshold: Industry Influence.</p>
<p>And what was called Industry Influence referred to the positive changes brought to the gaming industry.</p>
<p>For example, new game genres, and changes to the industry's existing rules.</p>
<p>Of course, they had to be positive. A classic negative example was <em>Atari ET</em> in his previous life, which led to the Video Game Crash.</p>
<p>At the same time, the item shop also entered Stage Two.</p>
<p>Looking at his points, he attempted a five-pull.</p>
<p>Chen Xu found that the items he drew were also different.</p>
<p>Directing Expertise *1</p>
<p>Psychological Expertise *2</p>
<p>World Ancient Civilizations (Ancient Greece) *1</p>
<p>World Ancient Civilizations (Norse Era) *1</p>
<p>It was no longer limited to just art and music; it was a comprehensive improvement.</p>
<p>But this influence!</p>
<p>If only he had known, he would have drawn earlier!</p>
<p>He was a step too late!</p>
<p>The establishment of the Nebula Games Platform was definitely a decision that garnered a huge amount of influence.</p>
<p>After all, the era of "channels are king" in the gaming industry had been directly shattered.</p>
<p>Although the Channel Alliance, along with TengHua and NetDragon, were still biding their time to counterattack, Chen Xu honestly wasn't afraid at all.</p>
<p>But now?</p>
<p>All gone!</p>
<p>Of course, it was still unknown if it was limited to game-related influence, but even if it was, <em>Monster Hunter</em> could still earn a good amount of influence.</p>
<p>And games like the previous <em>Undertale</em>, among others, had all brought significant Industry Influence.</p>
<p>Even <em>Mirror (Game)</em> was similar, profoundly changing the previous situation of "old lecherous men's adult games" having low quality.</p>
<p>Making adult games bigger and stronger, creating new glory – that too was a kind of Industry Influence!</p>
<p>However, despite all this, the system's update gave Chen Xu a new plan for the future development of the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>Isn't it all about bringing positive influence to the industry?!</p>
<p>He would start with one game to test the waters.</p>
<p>Looking at the brand new system interface, Chen Xu thought about it and decided to temporarily save his points.</p>
<p>After all, with the system upgrade, although the items had improved,</p>
<p>inflation had set in. His once wealthy life suddenly became meager.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with Chen Xu's current abilities, they were temporarily sufficient.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be too late to draw again when there was a need. And the key he obtained, he checked, could still be used, and the items in the shop had also changed to Stage Two system items.</p>
<p>Of course, the prices made his heart tremble a bit.</p>
<p>"I'll save up a bit more."</p>
