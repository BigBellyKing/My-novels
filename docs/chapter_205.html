                <p>Chapter 305: Negotiations Break Down, Prepare for Assault! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Under the setting sun, in a cemetery filled with gravestones, a middle-aged man rose from an unmarked grave.</p>
<p>'I never expected it. Everything happened too fast. A gunman, a single bullet, straight to the head.'</p>
<p>He stood up and walked forward.</p>
<p>'This one, I planted a Thermite charge, and a life was just extinguished.'</p>
<p>'It was I... who made a mistake only a rookie would make.'</p>
<p>The camera zoomed in, and only then did players realize that the photo on the tombstone was actually of the man himself.</p>
<p>'They hid a trap by the window. Remember to double-check before entering!'</p>
<p>The camera zoomed in again; the person on the tombstone was still him.</p>
<p>'Make good use of your ropes. Don't think you're a superman. Falling from the second floor... sometimes it's just that sudden!'</p>
<p>'Foolish, still foolish... always foolish.'</p>
<p>The middle-aged man took a deep breath and continued to walk forward.</p>
<p>All the gravestones along the way bore his photo.</p>
<p>At this moment, players watching the video understood.</p>
<p>Clearly, this wasn't some convoluted story about reincarnation.</p>
<p>Instead, it symbolized the man's actions as a player within the game.</p>
<p>'A gunman was ambushed there. By the time I noticed him... it was too late!'</p>
<p>'Knifed from behind, vertical explosive... This one, I ran out of the building and stepped directly on a Claymore. Being bold is good, but don't be greedy.'</p>
<p>'I remember every cause of my death, every foolish mistake I made, and every wrong judgment of the situation!'</p>
<p>'But I guarantee, it won't be me who falls in battle today!'</p>
<p>As his words fell, the camera zoomed in on the man's face, and the screen immediately went dark.</p>
<p>Only his narration remained.</p>
<p>'Are you ready? To initiate a meticulously planned assault.'</p>
<p>The next moment, the screen switched to the interior of a bank. In the center of the lobby, a group of hostages had their hands bound and mouths gagged, their faces filled with terror. Simultaneously, on the first floor, a group of terrorist personnel were planting bombs in an office.</p>
<p>Nearby, countless white-masked terrorist personnel were using roll-down wooden boards to seal off various critical passages.</p>
<p>Some white-masked terrorist personnel stood guard at various key points, shields in hand.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the camera moved outside.</p>
<p>Elite special forces personnel from various countries stood ready for battle – the Rainbow Team.</p>
<p>"Yes, it's them again."</p>
<p>"We can't let the bomb detonate!"</p>
<p>"But they refused to negotiate!"</p>
<p>"The safety of all hostages can only be entrusted to you!"</p>
<p>A middle-aged officer looked at the fully armed Rainbow Team, took a deep breath, closed his eyes, then opened them and said in a firm tone: "Now..."</p>
<p>"Negotiations break down, prepare for assault!"</p>
<p>As his voice fell.</p>
<p>The assault officially began.</p>
<p>All squad members had been ready for battle in their respective areas.</p>
<p>In the distance, Glaz was already in position, his sniper rifle set up, calmly locking down all possible terrorist locations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, operators like Ying, Blitz, Montagne, Thermite, Ash, and Pulse split into two groups and assembled into position.</p>
<p>One group prepared to attack from the first floor, while the other ascended to the bank's rooftop via ropes, ready to launch a coordinated assault with the first floor team.</p>
<p>At this point, the screen switched back to the initial location. Two unmanned reconnaissance drones slipped through the gap in the door into the bank, transmitting internal information.</p>
<p>A notification sound came through all squad members' voice comms.</p>
<p>"One terrorist in front of the bank's main entrance counter, two terrorists to the left of the entrance, hostages have been moved to the second floor."</p>
<p>Facing the tightly shut bank main door, everyone exchanged glances. The next moment, Thermite stepped forward.</p>
<p>Then, the scene shifted indoors.</p>
<p>On the steel bank door, a crimson spark appeared, moving in a highly regular pattern.</p>
<p>It was as if someone were cutting open the door with a cutting torch, only much faster.</p>
<p>Before the white-masked terrorist personnel could figure it out, an astonishingly loud bang erupted the next moment.</p>
<p>'Boom!'</p>
<p>A puff of black smoke rose. The next moment, fragments resembling a flash grenade pierced through the smoke and landed in the center of the lobby, emitting a powerful burst of light.</p>
<p>Instantly, everyone was temporarily deafened and blinded. At this moment, all white-masked terrorist personnel frantically fired towards where they remembered the bank entrance to be.</p>
<p>'Clang, clang, clang, clang...' A series of metallic impacts. As the smoke cleared, Montagne was seen leading the way with his large shield, all bullets striking its surface, completely failing to cause any effective damage.</p>
<p>Ying, Thermite, and Ash, who entered behind him, seized the opportunity to eliminate the white-masked figures in the lobby one by one.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the scene instantly switched to the second floor.</p>
<p>Rappelling down, Blackbeard, with his sunglasses and beard, grimly mounted a ballistic shield onto his gun and slowly descended to a boarded-up window on the second floor.</p>
<p>On the rooftop, Pulse looked at the Heartbeat Sensor in his hand; it showed two red dots.</p>
<p>He took out a Remote Charge and placed it above, then retreated to the side.</p>
<p>The next moment, the bomb detonated with a boom, blowing a hole in the roof. In the instant the explosion occurred, Blackbeard burst through the window, his MK17 CQB, equipped with a ballistic shield, swiftly eliminating the two distracted white-masked figures.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Pulse and Blitz, who jumped down from the rooftop, quickly secured the second floor.</p>
<p>Both the first and second floors were cleared, and the bomb had been defused. Only the hostage room remained.</p>
<p>The two teams converged. Facing the boarded-up wooden door to the hostage room, Ash pulled out her grenade launcher and fired a Breaching Round at the boards.</p>
<p>After a delay of about one second, there was a boom.</p>
<p>The Breaching Round detonated, and smoke filled the air.</p>
<p>At this moment, Blitz, shield in hand, was the first to charge in, pressing the charge button on his shield with a slight force.</p>
<p>Zzzzt... Snap!</p>
<p>A white flash exploded from the shield, illuminating the entire room as if it were daylight.</p>
<p>The sudden blinding flash caused the white-masked figures guarding the hostages to shriek, momentarily blinded, their guns instinctively firing wildly in the direction of the squad.</p>
<p>But countless bullets were all blocked by the shield. However, as bullets struck Blitz's shield.</p>
<p>Visible cracks appeared on the bulletproof glass lens.</p>
<p>However, Blitz remained unfazed, seizing the moment to raise his right hand.</p>
<p>Every bullet fired from the precisely engineered German P12 Pistol accurately pierced the heads of the white-masked terrorist personnel.</p>
<p>Seeing the still-frightened hostages, Ash and Ying stepped forward to untie them.</p>
<p>The next moment, the camera swept across the face of each squad member.</p>
<p>Finally, the screen gradually faded to black.</p>
<p>Ying's voice echoed in the comms channel.</p>
<p>'Assault complete.'</p>
<p>The game title appeared in the center.</p>
