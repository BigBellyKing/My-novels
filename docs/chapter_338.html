                <p>Chapter 337: Remember, No Russian (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>However, this thought didn't last long, as Zhang Yi was quickly captivated by the level before him.</p>
<p>He found himself standing with Soap on a cliff face, barely two meters wide. Thick snow lay beneath his feet, and one more step forward led to a bottomless abyss. The path ahead was even more treacherous: a narrow trail barely wide enough for one person to squeeze through sideways.</p>
<p>"Holy crap!"</p>
<p>Zhang Yi exclaimed, his legs instantly going weak. As a player with a slight fear of heights, this scene was genuinely overwhelming. Although previous parts of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> had high-altitude perspectives, they were mostly in planes or similar settings, and he could constantly shoot, which greatly distracted him. But now? He truly felt weak in the knees. Especially with the ultra-high VR immersion of the new era, he felt utterly shaken. The ice axes hammered into the ice, the cracks appearing during this section of ice climbing, all sent shivers down his spine.</p>
<p>They continued to ascend slowly towards the clifftop.</p>
<p>In the raging wind, Soap and Roach reached a broken-off ledge. To continue climbing, they had to leap across the chasm. Soap, as the seasoned captain, took a leap, and with a 'crunch,' his ice axe firmly dug into the ice, allowing him to climb onto the next section.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath and watching Soap wave him over, Zhang Yi controlled Roach to jump as well. However, compared to Soap's effortless move, Roach was clearly much unluckier. The ice axe, plunged into the ice, immediately formed a terrifying crack, and the ice couldn't support Roach's weight, shattering beneath him.</p>
<p>"Damn it! I'm going to die! I'm going to die!"</p>
<p>The sudden turn of events made Zhang Yi's heart pound. Especially when he glanced down, the bottomless cliff made his legs turn to jelly. But just then, as snow cascaded from above, a man, gripping an ice axe with one hand, grabbed Roach.</p>
<p>'Gotcha!'</p>
<p>The familiar words came from Soap. Then he tilted his head, and Roach in the game quickly plunged his ice axe into the ice and climbed up. At this moment, Zhang Yi felt a prickle on his scalp. The familiar words! Price had saved Soap the same way in the first game! Coupled with the fact that he had controlled Soap as the protagonist in the first game, the emotional connection between character and player was instantly forged. It was an incredibly profound feeling.</p>
<p>As Soap and Roach ventured deeper into enemy territory, the familiar sensation thrilled Zhang Yi even more. During combat, teammates on the comms provided directions. During escapes, they helped clear obstacles. When falling into a trap, a teammate was your last line of defense.</p>
<p>What made Zhang Yi even more excited was the combat, which he felt offered more choices compared to the previous game. Silenced assault rifles, heartbeat sensors, and thermal scopes were essential for stealth. In the blizzard, Roach and Soap were like ghosts in the snow, striking deep into enemy territory.</p>
<p>Deep inside the military base, Roach successfully found their target for this mission.</p>
<p>However, in the end, Soap was still discovered by enemies in the warehouse. But Soap remained unfazed, because there was a Plan B. As Roach pressed the detonator, the bombs already deployed outside exploded. While the enemies were distracted by the blast, Roach and Soap began their counterattack.</p>
<p>The two rendezvoused and retreated under the cover of the blizzard. But due to the blizzard and the excessive number of air defense systems at the enemy base, the rescue helicopter could only land on another hilltop.</p>
<p>Here, a desperate chase unfolded. Roach and Soap hijacked a snowmobile and embarked on a life-or-death escape. Especially at the end, controlling Roach's snowmobile, he sped downhill, twisting the throttle to the max, wildly charging towards a raised cliff, soaring through the air like a bird with wings. This sent Zhang Yi's adrenaline surging.</p>
<p>Ten days of waiting! This thrilling sensation was exactly what he desired!</p>
<p>However, after this exhilarating experience, the next level once again left him in shock. It was an even greater shock than the nuclear explosion scene in the previous installment.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Zakhaev International Airport. This time, Zhang Yi's perspective shifted to Joseph Allen. But now, he was called Alexei Borodin, his undercover name.</p>
<p>[Note: The content of this level may cause discomfort. Do you wish to skip it, or play it as a CG video?]</p>
<p>Below were three options: Skip, Use Video, and No.</p>
<p>What's going on? Is this level particularly special? Isn't it already an adult-rated game? Zhang Yi was puzzled, but still chose No.</p>
<p>For this groundbreaking game, he himself was unwilling to miss any detail.</p>
<p>The scene appeared, inside an elevator. Beside him was a group of teammates, one of whom Zhang Yi recognized: Makarov! He had seen his photo in the previous game, Operation Kingfish.</p>
<p>Now, everyone held a machine gun and wore bulletproof vests. They seemed to be preparing for some operation.</p>
<p>'Remember, no Russian,' Makarov turned his head to look at everyone.</p>
<p>At that moment, the elevator doors opened. Outside was the departure hall, a spacious hall filled with countless ordinary civilians, their voices a bit noisy but otherwise orderly. But with the appearance of Makarov and his men, order was shattered.</p>
<p>To Zhang Yi's dumbfounded disbelief, and amidst the terrified screams of the civilians in the game, Makarov and his subordinates raised their guns and began to fire into the crowd.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi had absolutely no idea there would be such a plot sequence in the game. Watching Makarov and his men slaughtering civilians, Zhang Yi instinctively raised his gun and aimed at them. If he had shot at teammates before, the game would instantly enter a 'mission failed' screen, accompanied by a famous quote: "Friendly fire is not tolerated."</p>
<p>But in this level, if the player did that, they would only be gunned down by Makarov and his men. Similarly, standing in front of them would also result in death.</p>
<p>Throughout, Zhang Yi simply followed numbly behind Makarov and his men, not firing a single shot. Chen Xu had also made many changes here compared to the previous life. For example, in the original, on the second floor of the airport, in front of a flowerbed, players had to kill two security guards, which was a necessary part of the level.</p>
<p>Now, players could choose to not fire a single shot throughout. At the same time, Zhang Yi finally understood why there was a prompt at the beginning. Before this, Zhang Yi had never really thought anything of so-called terrorist organizations. For Zakhaev in the previous game, his greater hatred was simply because he had killed Gaz and Griggs, comrades with whom he had shared life and death.</p>
<p>But now it was different. This inhumane act was simply too shocking, even if it was just a game.</p>
<p>Following numbly behind Makarov, an ambulance was already waiting to pick them up. "Well done, you succeeded! Get in! Makarov, we've sent a loud signal with this attack!" The waiting member said happily, patting Makarov's shoulder.</p>
<p>"That's not a signal yet." Makarov said expressionlessly, extending his right hand to Allen, who was the last to get in the vehicle. As an undercover agent, Allen, who believed his infiltration was successful, suspected nothing.</p>
<p>But the next moment, Makarov pulled out a pistol and shot Allen straight in the heart.</p>
<p>"This is the signal!"</p>
<p>Bang! The screen instantly turned crimson, and Makarov coolly kicked Allen in the chest. His body went limp, collapsing heavily to the ground.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was stunned. What was happening?</p>
<p>The scene before him grew increasingly blurry, with only Makarov's faint voice audible in his ear. "The Americans thought they could outsmart us, but when they find this body, all of Russia will roar for vengeance."</p>
<p>The truth? That wasn't important. A mere pretext for war was enough.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi instantly understood. This was a conspiracy! It was a ploy to use Allen's American identity as an excuse to start a war. Just like there were two factions, those who wanted war with the US and those who desired peace. But now? With the Zakhaev International Airport incident, whether it was a conspiracy or not no longer mattered.
