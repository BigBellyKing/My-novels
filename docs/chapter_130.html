                <p>Chapter 229: Episode One: Major Historical Events in MC (Seventh Update, Please Subscribe and Give Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Online, it wasn't just the designers in the gaming industry who felt shocked by the sales of Minecraft.</p>
<p>Players were equally surprised.</p>
<p>Before they knew it, tens of millions of people worldwide were playing Minecraft?</p>
<p>However, this was quickly replaced by a sense of pride.</p>
<p>How great is it that a game they loved had so many players!</p>
<p>Of course, this feeling only lasted for a moment.</p>
<p>After all, for players, it's just a game, so what if many people play it? A brief moment of excitement and pride is enough; what else would you want from them?</p>
<p>Compared to how many copies the game sold, players were obviously more concerned with the content within the game.</p>
<p>Initially, the videos with particularly high like rates online were mostly awe-inspiring structures built by Master Builders.</p>
<p>While initially shocking, with exclamations of 'others' worlds' constantly heard, players eventually got used to being amazed after seeing so many.</p>
<p>Anyway, they would just watch these, then perhaps download one from the Workshop to experience the fun for themselves.</p>
<p>But soon, the works of some Redstone Masters left many players bewildered.</p>
<p>All sorts of Redstone music, and Redstone mechanisms.</p>
<p>Some masters even used sticky pistons and other mechanism components to directly build a moving mech.</p>
<p>Many players were instantly stunned.</p>
<p>At least the previous constructions were somewhat understandable, but these Redstone contraptions were utterly incomprehensible!</p>
<p>But the point was precisely that they couldn't understand them; if they could, they wouldn't seem so incredible anymore!</p>
<p>And so, on this day, as many players were preparing to browse the official Weibo or check video websites for new content.</p>
<p>An official Weibo post quickly gained traction with frantic reposts, and simultaneously, a video was directly pushed to the top of the click rankings on major video websites.</p>
<p>The video's title was also very simple: 'Episode One: Major Historical Events in MC'.</p>
<p>Many players paused for a moment upon seeing this video, but as soon as they realized the publisher was Nebula Games' official Weibo account, they instantly became excited.</p>
<p>Clicking on the video, the progress bar showed it was nearly an hour long.</p>
<p>The visuals weren't particularly special; it was essentially raw in-game footage from Minecraft, unrendered at that.</p>
<p>But what truly captured players' interest was the content revealed within the game.</p>
<p>“On January 3rd, Minecraft launched its early access, with 969,231 players entering this peculiar block world on that day.”</p>
<p>“Among them, player with ID [ewwqr] was the first to destroy a block!”</p>
<p>“Night fell, and dangerous creatures like Zombies and Skeletons appeared one after another. How would the defenseless Steve resolve the immediate crisis? Player with ID [Master Builder] became the first player to 'dig-three-fill-one'.”</p>
<p>“Spending a difficult night in a warm bed, player with ID [Nǐ Shuō Má Ne] became the first player to spend the night in a bed instead of a cave.”</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>“On February 1st, Minecraft officially launched. On that day, the number of players surpassed 3 million, and as of now, over 37 million players have entered Minecraft.”</p>
<p>“The average number of blocks destroyed per player is 418,941, and the average number of blocks built per player is 231,236. Among them, the player ID who destroyed the most blocks is [Explosion Is Art] with a total of 2,820,910 blocks, and the player ID who built the most blocks is [Sandwich Candy] with a total of 892,031 blocks.”</p>
<p>“Redstone technology, a unique system in Minecraft, possesses a magical power. Player with ID [Dad, I Want To Be A Scientist] became the first player to complete a minecart with rails using Redstone technology, and also the first to compose Redstone music using a music box.”</p>
<p>“On February 5th, the first player-made MOD, [Duplex Villa], appeared on the Workshop. The player ID who created it was [Construction Master].”</p>
<p>“On February 19th, the first player-made mini-game MOD, [Tank Battle Against Evil Monsters], appeared on the Workshop and achieved 2 million downloads on that day. The player ID who created it was [Do You Believe In Light?].”</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>“Next are the memorable moments from various servers.”</p>
<p>“War has never ceased from ancient to modern times; wherever there are people, there is conflict. The server that first ignited PVP war was Server No. 17.”</p>
<p>“As of now, over 6 million players have participated in battles, and buildings in the game have been destroyed a staggering 31 million times.”</p>
<p>“Among them, players on Server No. 1611 are the most fanatical warmongers. As of now, the average death count for players on this server is 121, currently the highest, and the player factions on this server are in a three-way standoff.”</p>
<p>“Players on Server No. 1211 are also a group of warmongers; countless players have been engaged in chaotic battles since the server launched. However, unlike Server No. 1611, Server No. 1211 is currently in a Warring States period, with various guilds fighting independently.”</p>
<p>“Within Server No. 2147, war also exists, but a portion of players remained outside the conflict. They established the [Merchant Alliance] to farm and raise livestock, and construct houses and buildings for major factions, trading resources such as gold, Redstone, diamonds, and coal.”</p>
<p>“Also on Server No. 2147, while the major guilds were completely unaware during their chaotic battles, the technology of the [Merchant Alliance] rapidly advanced with their resource supply. While the warring guilds were still fighting with iron swords, iron armor, and bows and arrows, the Merchant Alliance had successfully developed the game's first firearm weapon. Still amidst the chaos of the major guilds, the [Merchant Alliance] fired the first shot in online mode, simultaneously declaring to the other factions on Server No. 2147: My lords, times have changed!”</p>
<p>“Players on Server No. 111, although not a peaceful server, deeply love peace. They are also the server with the lowest average player deaths, with each player dying only 7 times on average. It is reported that they aim to build the first city in the sky on this server, and we sincerely wish them success in accomplishing this feat.”</p>
<p>“Players on Server No. 3511 are also a group of peace-loving players. The largest guild on this server is [Cave Dwellers]. Unlike players on Server No. 111, they seem intent on building an underground city deep beneath the surface, and over 3,000 players on this server have already become victims of being burned to death by lava.”</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>The hour-long video specifically introduced various pioneering feats in Minecraft, and also made countless players fully understand one truth: you never know how players will truly play a game.</p>
<p>Just like seeing a female character, many people might think about whether she's pretty or not.</p>
<p>But who would have thought that many players would specifically adjust the camera angle when seeing a female character, just to see if they could spot something 'special'?</p>
<p>It was the same for Minecraft.</p>
<p>Even though there were already quite a few videos demonstrating Minecraft's unique gameplay.</p>
<p>Yet, with the release of Chen Xu's video, countless players were still left dumbfounded.</p>
