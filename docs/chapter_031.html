                <p>Chapter 31: First Experience with To the Moon</p>
<p>Days passed, and the deadline for the Sci-Fi Game Design Competition was approaching.</p>
<p>Major Game Producers and game companies all uploaded their participating games to the Official Game Platform.</p>
<p>Both mobile games and PC games were included, the vast majority were Single-player games, though there were also some online games.</p>
<p>Clearly, some were aiming for awards, but others were just there to join the fun.</p>
<p>After all, there were already corresponding projects, so if they could conveniently enter a competition, they did.</p>
<p>What if they won an award?</p>
<p>After these works were uploaded, the next step was a preliminary review.</p>
<p>Eliminating works with problematic content and shoddy productions.</p>
<p>Of course, this part of the process was not open to the public, but the eliminated games would still be launched on the game platform.</p>
<p>Although such a rule existed, very few games were actually eliminated each year.</p>
<p>After all, the condition for participation was being a qualified Game Designer.</p>
<p>They generally had some foundation.</p>
<p>This time, however, it attracted a lot of attention from the industry and players.</p>
<p>Specifically, whether Chen Xu, who developed a game for the competition in just over ten days, had his work eliminated.</p>
<p>‘Here it comes, here it comes! I scanned the main list, not a single game was eliminated!’</p>
<p>‘Holy cow! So the Game Department recognized Chen Xu’s game as eligible?’</p>
<p>‘If that’s the case, at least it’s definitely a playable game, right?’</p>
<p>‘Found it, found it! Chen Xu’s new work is called To the Moon!’</p>
<p>‘Judging by the name, it looks legitimate, does it involve the universe?’</p>
<p>‘The price is so cheap! Only 15 Yuan?’</p>
<p>‘It seems to be dual-platform, two different versions.’</p>
<p>‘What, two different versions? Even Undertale didn’t get that treatment!’</p>
<p>‘I’m going to see for myself what kind of game Chen Xu developed in just over ten days!’</p>
<p>With the release of the participating works, countless interested players quickly found their favorite games and downloaded them to experience.</p>
<p>Among them, To the Moon, developed by Chen Xu, was naturally the first to be targeted.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>The game section of the Shark TV live streaming platform.</p>
<p>Many streamers also started testing games for this Sci-Fi Game Design Competition.</p>
<p>This was considered Shark TV’s official cooperation in organizing publicity; after all, this Sci-Fi Game Design Competition was initiated and hosted by the Game Department, so it had a certain official nature, even though Shark TV wasn't directly approached.</p>
<p>But when it was time to curry favor, as a platform, they would definitely not be stingy with their efforts.</p>
<p>Whether they were approached or not, those with high awareness were always proactive.</p>
<p>As a streamer on Shark TV, Dong Zhen also knew about this platform event.</p>
<p>So he started streaming early in the morning, the title of his room was: “Experiencing Sci-Fi Game Design Competition Entries.”</p>
<p>‘Meowning!’</p>
<p>‘What’s up, bro? You’re actually streaming this early today?’</p>
<p>‘Good heavens, which zoo’s monkey escaped?’</p>
<p>‘Little Dong’s here so early?’</p>
<p>As soon as Dong Zhen started streaming, he saw the screen full of various teasing bullet comments.</p>
<p>Looking at these bullet comments, Dong Zhen chuckled.</p>
<p>“Ahem!!!”</p>
<p>“Alright, alright, good morning everyone, today we’re going to play some of the entries from this Sci-Fi Game Design Competition, it’s a heavy task!”</p>
<p>Dong Zhen said, while adjusting his streaming equipment and entering his account password to log into the Official Game Platform.</p>
<p>“For the first game, let’s play the new game from the author of Undertale first.”</p>
<p>“To be honest, I’ve been looking forward to it for a long time.”</p>
<p>“Why the anticipation? Don’t I have to mention the previous Undertale? It was really well-made.”</p>
<p>“But this To the Moon, I heard it was made in just over ten days, and the crucial thing is it wasn't eliminated by the Game Department. I'm really curious what kind of game this is!”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Dong Zhen opened the Official Game Platform and searched for To the Moon.</p>
<p>“Changing memories, an old man’s dying wish is to go to the moon. Good heavens, this is playing pretty wild!”</p>
<p>“Today, I, a respectable seven-foot man, will see what mystery this game holds.”</p>
<p>The game wasn’t very large, and his broadband network downloaded it quickly.</p>
<p>Seeing the screen flooded with various question marks in the live stream, Dong Zhen decisively ignored them and chose to open the game.</p>
<p>One meter sixty is impossible, he’s always been a tall guy at one meter ninety-two!</p>
<p>The game was installed quickly.</p>
<p>The game icon was simple: two children sitting on a log, looking at the distant moon.</p>
<p>Opening the game, the Nebula Games company logo was skipped.</p>
<p>A full moon and a lighthouse appeared on the screen, the sky was dotted with stars, and a few dark clouds slowly drifted by.</p>
<p>The game’s title, To the Moon, was carved onto the moon.</p>
<p>At the same time, the camera slowly moved downwards.</p>
<p>A warm piano concerto began playing as the background music.</p>
<p>As serene as moonlight.</p>
<p>A lighthouse, a grassy field, and a large mansion situated on the cliff edge by the lighthouse.</p>
<p>The camera slowly moved into the mansion’s interior; a girl was sitting at a piano playing, with a little boy beside her.</p>
<p>At this point, the background music changed; a simple piano piece began to play. Listening with closed eyes, it was as if one was in a forest, with a flowing stream in front.</p>
<p>‘Setting aside other things for now, this music is really nice!’</p>
<p>‘That’s right, Chen Xu’s works, without saying much else, the music truly feels top-notch!’</p>
<p>‘Yes, indeed, these two piano pieces are really beautiful.’</p>
<p>‘And Undertale, the music also added a lot to its score!’</p>
<p>‘Not just Undertale, the music in Mirror (Game) was also excellent!’</p>
<p>‘Catch a Gentleman’s Gamer!’</p>
<p>Looking at the bullet comments in the live stream, Dong Zhen secretly nodded.</p>
<p>The game hadn’t even started yet, he didn’t know if it was fun or not, but the music alone was truly excellent.</p>
<p>As everyone was immersed in the beautiful piano music, suddenly, the sound of a car engine was heard, followed by a crash.</p>
<p>With the sound of the crash, the game screen also appropriately shook.</p>
<p>The camera moved outside the house; a black sedan had crashed into a tree.</p>
<p>‘Where were you looking when you were driving, Neil!’</p>
<p>‘Uh, sorry, I was bravely trying to avoid that squirrel that suddenly darted out.’</p>
<p>‘…But either way, you still ran over it and crashed into the tree.’</p>
<p>‘See, there’s nothing to worry about, it’s the company car.’</p>
<p>‘Are you kidding? The boss will kill us!’</p>
<p>‘Hmm… Let’s just say I saved a puppy, he likes dogs, right?’</p>
<p>‘He likes cats more.’</p>
<p>‘Why does the world have to be so complicated? Oh well, whatever he likes, crisis averted!’</p>
<p>Thank you ‘Qianqiu VV’ for the 100 tip</p>
