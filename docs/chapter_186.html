                <h3>Chapter 286: Chen Xu Just Makes Games, What the Heck Does He Know About Warcraft! (5th update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)</h3>
<p>Online, the topic of <em>Warcraft</em>'s balance was attracting significant attention from many RTS game enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Especially players drawn to <em>Warcraft</em>, despite verbally complaining about the imbalance turning into Orc Supremacy, fundamentally hoped the official team would react quickly, for example, by balancing the current version.</p>
<p>Finally, these players received a response, though it was a little different from what they expected.</p>
<p>“There are no balance issues in <em>Warcraft</em>. There's no such thing as Orcs being too strong. Each race has its unique tactics and gameplay. There are only the strongest players, not the strongest race. This Sunday, I will livestream <em>Warcraft</em> on the Shark TV platform, engaging in friendly exchanges with the professional players participating in this Golden Tournament, to demonstrate the game's balance.”</p>
<p>Once Chen Xu's message was posted, players quickly noticed the official Weibo account's update.</p>
<p>Not just players, but some industry insiders as well, including in Hero Entertainment's studio.</p>
<p>Zhou Qi, grinning like a sunflower, also noticed Chen Xu's official Weibo post and was instantly bewildered.</p>
<p>Regarding the <em>Warcraft</em> balance issue, it wasn't him who instigated it. Although <em>Human Wars</em> and Nebula Games' <em>Warcraft</em> had a direct conflict of interest, the various channels of the Nebula Games Platform had long been waiting for Nebula Games to make a mistake.</p>
<p>He hadn't even thought of making a move, and this wave of news about balance had already started.</p>
<p>Initially, what he wanted to see was how Chen Xu would respond to this balance incident.</p>
<p>Having a balance problem, this matter, in fact, is both serious and not serious depending on how you look at it.</p>
<p>The key still lay in how the game developers would respond.</p>
<p>Facing a situation where balance was an issue, generally speaking, game designers would publicly apologize to players, then quickly react by making numerical adjustments, and the matter would then pass.</p>
<p>As for whether it would be balanced afterward, that would require another period of testing.</p>
<p>After all, balance is something that always requires continuous adjustment.</p>
<p>Every adjustment inevitably brings strong and weak points, and many game designers, even some hardcore players, are aware of this.</p>
<p>At this point, Zhou Qi felt it was a good opportunity for <em>Human Wars</em> to catch its breath.</p>
<p>He, along with most players and designers, believed Chen Xu would immediately respond by strengthening the Undead, Night Elves, or weakening the Orcs.</p>
<p>However, they never expected Chen Xu to pull such a move.</p>
<p>Live streaming <em>Warcraft</em> to prove that <em>Warcraft</em>'s balance isn't a problem?</p>
<p>What kind of move is this!</p>
<p>Many players were also shocked.</p>
<p>“Holy moly, if I understand correctly, Chen Xu wants to live stream <em>Warcraft</em> to prove that the game balance is fine?”</p>
<p>“No way, no way, Chen Xu wouldn't actually think he's better than those professional players, would he?”</p>
<p>“I think Chen Xu must be confident in doing this, and as a game designer, he must have unique insights, right?”</p>
<p>“That's not necessarily true. My mind thinks I'm a gaming master, but my hands disagree.”</p>
<p>“The live stream hasn't even started, how can you be so sure Chen Xu won't succeed? I, on the other hand, think that since Chen Xu said this, he must be confident. Think about the previous <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>.”</p>
<p>“What confidence? Before it was playing against AI, now it's against real players, and pro gamers at that. Can Chen Xu understand balance better than pro players?”</p>
<p>“Why can't he? Chen Xu is a game designer!”</p>
<p>“You're talking nonsense. Chen Xu is just a game developer, what the heck does he know about <em>Warcraft</em>!”</p>
<p>“Seriously speaking, when the time comes, if Chen Xu uses all four races and loses to the pro gamers with each race, wouldn't that prove the game is balanced?”</p>
<p>“?????? Although your statement makes me want to laugh, Chen Xu isn't an idiot; could he do such a thing?”</p>
<p>Online players argued incessantly.</p>
<p>They were mainly divided into three factions.</p>
<p>The Spectator Faction was just waiting for Chen Xu's live stream that day to get a definitive answer.</p>
<p>In addition, there was a group of players who relatively trusted Chen Xu, thinking that since Chen Xu dared to say so, he wouldn't speak aimlessly. Perhaps he really had some genuine skills?</p>
<p>After all, he was a game designer.</p>
<p>The remaining players, however, believed Chen Xu probably just didn't want to admit that there was a problem with game balance.</p>
<p>After all, such things had happened before, where the official side stubbornly denied, claiming the game had no problems, and it was the players who had problems.</p>
<hr />
<p>At Nebula Games, in the lounge during lunch break, a group of people were chatting with each other.</p>
<p>They were mainly focused on the current news online.</p>
<p>“Many people online are questioning, Brother Qin, do you think Mr. Chen is really good at <em>Warcraft</em>?” a colleague asked Qin Yi.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Qin Yi.</p>
<p>“I don't know about that, but easily defeating a few of us is no problem,” Qin Yi said, scratching his head.</p>
<p>After all, Chen Xu hadn't really played games much in front of them. It was only during an internal test in the previous development phase that he easily defeated the three of them.</p>
<p>“Then, Brother Qin, how's your skill level?” someone asked.</p>
<p>“So-so, combined, maybe a little over 2000 points,” Qin Yi lightly coughed.</p>
<p>2000 points? Sounds quite high!</p>
<p>Hearing Qin Yi's words, everyone showed surprised expressions, ignoring the three words 'combined'.</p>
<p>At this moment, Lin Rou interjected: “Brother Qin said 'combined'.”</p>
<p>Combined?</p>
<p>So, you're all noobs combined?</p>
<p>“Cough cough, enough of that. Look at this, Mr. Chen now has another meme!” Facing a few strange glances, Qin Yi quickly changed the subject.</p>
<p>He then showed the information on his phone.</p>
<p>It was a trending search term that had just surged up.</p>
<p>'Chen Xu just makes games, what the heck does he know about Warcraft!'</p>
<p>Seeing this term, everyone instantly burst into laughter.</p>
<p>“Haha, what's going on with this? Where did this come from?”</p>
<p>“If Mr. Chen knew about this, how upset he'd be.”</p>
<p>“I think Mr. Chen should be used to it by now.”</p>
<p>Everyone looked at the trending search term, unable to stop laughing.</p>
<p>At this moment, Chen Xu, who had just finished confirming with Shark TV, walked out of his office. Seeing everyone laughing uncontrollably, Chen Xu was a bit curious: “What are you all laughing about?”</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue, stifling a laugh, handed her phone to Chen Xu: “Mr. Chen, you must be strong!”</p>
<p>“What the heck is this,” Chen Xu was also a bit speechless looking at the trending search term, but his mindset hadn't changed much.</p>
<p>After all, he was already used to it; players always misunderstood him.</p>
<p>“But Mr. Chen, can you really beat those professional players?” Yang Xin and others nearby also asked curiously.</p>
<p>In their spare time, they had also watched Chen Xu play <em>Warcraft</em>, but it wasn't against real people, but against the company's AI.</p>
<p>As for whether he was truly skilled or not, they weren't sure. Anyway, none of them could beat him.</p>
<p>“I can hold my own against average players, but against someone like Guadi, I'd have to rely on tactics and improvisation,” Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Deciding this, he still had some confidence. If these professional players truly understood all sorts of tactical gameplay, and had already grasped many playstyles of this game and knew how to counter them, then he could easily be hard-countered by some players' mechanics.</p>
<p>But his approach was a dimension-reducing strike, and he also had a special item, which was his confidence.</p>
<p>Moreover, for him, it was actually also an opportunity; he had similar considerations for <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> before.</p>
<p>It allowed players to understand that besides being a game designer, he also had the identity of a player.</p>
<p>Once such a persona was established, it would also be very helpful for the subsequent progression of game content.</p>
<p>After all, a designer who was also a pretty skilled player actually provided a greater sense of identification for players.</p>
<p>At least when players were confused about the game content, their first reaction wouldn't be that the game's numbers or level design were wrong, or that the designer is acting up again.</p>
