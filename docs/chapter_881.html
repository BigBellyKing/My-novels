                <p>Chapter 880: Dark! So Dark!</p>
<p>This was just the prologue, not even a complete tutorial level. The Minotaur in front of Joker was easily dealt with.</p>
<p>Next was the introduction to stealth for escaping the casino.</p>
<p>Similar to Joker's running and jumping movements earlier on the casino's ceiling.</p>
<p>This stealth segment also didn't require the player's own input; simply approaching a selectable cover would trigger a corresponding interaction option.</p>
<p>After confirming her choice, Yang Xin saw Joker in the game move behind cover with superhuman speed.</p>
<p>The entire action could only be described as incredibly cool.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chen Xu had also made some slight changes to this part compared to the original version.</p>
<p>For an RPG game, having enemies that are 'blind and deaf' (i.e., having poor AI detection) is a very basic setting, but it would significantly detract from the player's sense of immersion.</p>
<p>In the original, as long as the player controlled Joker to hide behind cover, even if a monster stood right next to Joker, face-to-face, it wouldn't notice.</p>
<p>On a regular gaming platform, it might not be a big deal with a large screen, but VR games are different; the sense of immersion from being in the environment is much stronger.</p>
<p>Imagine in the game, the player's Joker is face-to-face with a monster, almost touching.</p>
<p>Then the monster would frown and strangely ask: "Where did they go?"</p>
<p>That would instantly break the atmosphere and deal a huge blow to the player's immersion.</p>
<p>Therefore, Chen Xu redesigned the corresponding actions and adjusted the monster patrol paths to avoid such awkward situations.</p>
<p>Moreover, depending on the scene, Joker's infiltration movements in the game were also redesigned.</p>
<p>It could be said that apart from not allowing players direct control, this aspect of the game was on par with action games like <em>Uncharted</em>.</p>
<p>With the help of a mysterious red-haired female phantom thief, Yang Xin, controlling Joker in the game, easily evaded the pursuers who had spotted her.</p>
<p>"Over there...!"</p>
<p>Joker, seemingly at a dead end, looked at the huge glass pane in front of the casino, and behind him, the voices of approaching security guards echoed.</p>
<p>"You have nowhere left to run!"</p>
<p>A group of security guards, clutching pistols, cautiously approached Joker.</p>
<p>Without a word, Joker stood before the balcony with a confident smile, then propped one hand on the railing. Using that support, Joker flipped onto the railing and ran along the balcony's corridor towards the glass exit.</p>
<p>By the time the armed security guards came to their senses and gave chase, Joker had already reached his destination.</p>
<p>Still with that confident smile, lips slightly curled, Joker knelt on one knee, looking back at the security guards.</p>
<p>"See you next time!"</p>
<p>As Joker's words fell, he shielded his head with both hands, leaped up, and crashed through the thick glass.</p>
<p>Accompanied by the glittering lights of the casino and shards of glass, Joker even performed a 360-degree aerial maneuver.</p>
<p>A full moon, glass shards, and Joker overlapped.</p>
<p>"Always so dramatic!"</p>
<p>"That's just reckless!"</p>
<p>His comrades' chuckles came through the wireless headset.</p>
<p>Yang Xin, immersed in the game, was utterly thrilled.</p>
<p>She was practically beside herself, because this guy called Joker was just too cool!</p>
<p>If it came to showing off, Yang Xin felt that among Nebula Games' many IPs, Joker, based on his current performance, could easily contend for the top spot.</p>
<p>As long as he didn't end up like Sephiroth from <em>Final Fantasy</em>, always dying to his own named theme music.</p>
<p>However, her excitement didn't last ten seconds; the subsequent events completely stunned Yang Xin.</p>
<p>Countless searchlights shone on Joker. Hundreds of police officers, armed with riot shields and pistols, had completely surrounded the casino entrance.</p>
<p>Even Joker, who had just finished his cool display, was stunned. Not only that, but every escape route, including nearby ladders, was fully occupied by enemies.</p>
<p>Caught in this inescapable net, Joker was immediately knocked to the ground by a rifle butt and pinned down by two officers.</p>
<p>The leading police captain walked up, grabbed Joker by the hair, and looked at him.</p>
<p>"Just a kid... If you want to hate someone, hate your companions!"</p>
<p>"...You were sold out!"</p>
<p>??????????</p>
<p>There's a traitor in the team!</p>
<p>To Yang Xin's astonishment, Joker in the game was immediately incarcerated. However, this also allowed her to see Joker's true appearance.</p>
<p>His messy, dark black hair and deep gray pupils made him appear somewhat gentle, a complete contrast to the phantom thief Joker with his white bird mask.</p>
<p>After the incarceration registration was complete, Yang Xin's vision plunged into darkness.</p>
<p>At the same time, faint whispers of conversation reached her ears.</p>
<p>"Too much sedative?"</p>
<p>"Wake him up."</p>
<p>After the words fell, there was a splash of water, and then Yang Xin's vision gradually returned.</p>
<p>At this moment, Ren Amamiya was covered in wounds, strapped to an interrogation chair, with a discarded syringe on the floor beside him.</p>
<p>"Don't sleep. Don't you understand? Stop wasting your energy!"</p>
<p>Ren Amamiya, who had just woken up and instinctively struggled, was immediately beaten by the interrogating officer.</p>
<p>"Behave yourself... or do you want another shot?"</p>
<p>"Hmm... you're very concerned about the surveillance cameras? Do you perhaps have some expectations for the Visualization Act?"</p>
<p>"Thanks to you, kid, we get to... work our butts off!"</p>
<p>Stomping on his head, grabbing his head, kicking his abdomen.</p>
<p>A series of combos like that completely bewildered Yang Xin in the game.</p>
<p>They said he could compete with Sephiroth for Nebula Games' top King of Bragging?</p>
<p>And now he's been betrayed by a traitor and caught?</p>
<p>And being tortured like this?</p>
<p>"Obstruction of business, intimidation, defamation, conspiracy to carry weapons... and murder, right? You've got the whole package!"</p>
<p>"The mastermind behind so many crimes is just this kid..."</p>
<p>"And you seem to be enjoying it... aren't you?"</p>
<p>"Sign your name here!"</p>
<p>In the game, the officer, who had his subordinates remove Joker's handcuffs, brought a confession document to Joker.</p>
<p>"This is a confession written in your name."</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>A confession written in my name!?</p>
<p>"I'm innocent!" Yang Xin instinctively chose to refuse.</p>
<p>At this point, Ren Amamiya in the game also made a corresponding action, sweeping away the so-called confession.</p>
<p>"Is that so... Although the signature must be done by hand... it shouldn't matter if you're missing a leg, right?"</p>
<p>A very strong vibration feedback came from her right leg in the gaming pod, but Yang Xin didn't pay attention to it then.</p>
<p>Only one thought filled her mind: Coerced confession!</p>
<p>"Dark! Dark! It's too dark! The surveillance is just for show! And now they're coercing a confession!" Yang Xin, who had almost forgotten she was experiencing a next-gen game, shouted with great immersion.</p>
<p>How is this any different from ancient times, where criminals were brutally beaten, then their hands forced onto a confession decree? It's too dark!</p>
<p>"But... this is for naming my character?"</p>
<p>"You should have said so earlier! I took a beating for nothing!"</p>
<p>Looking at the appearing UI interface, Yang Xin was speechless.</p>
<p>She didn't rename the character, instead sticking with the game's initial name, Ren Amamiya.</p>
<p>But as Yang Xin confirmed her choice, she froze.</p>
<p>Because the game screen showed no reaction at all, as if time had frozen.</p>
<p>Yang Xin was a bit bewildered: "What's going on? Is it stuck? A bug?"</p>
<p>Just then, Chen Xu's voice came from outside: "Alright, come on out. This is as far as the playable content goes for now."</p>
<p>"What the heck?! Mr. Chen, are you doing this on purpose!?" Emerging from the gaming pod, Yang Xin's eyes were wide.</p>
<p>It wasn't that she hadn't had enough fun.</p>
<p>It was the experience!</p>
<p>Failed showing off, incarcerated, brutally beaten, and dark oppression.</p>
<p>Although she wasn't involved in this project, following a 'build-up and eventual triumph' narrative, Joker should have risen to power later to give players a satisfying experience.</p>
<p>But what the heck was this? This internal playtest ended after she got a beating and named the character?</p>
