                <p>Chapter 327: CQB? I'm a Veteran! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>June 1st, Children's Day.</p>
<p><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> officially launched on Nebula Games' VR platform. Although Children's Day isn't a public holiday, every player is still a child at heart, right?</p>
<p>This time, <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> was still released in two versions.</p>
<p>One was the Huanyu VR version, and the other was the standard VR version.</p>
<p>After all, installation base had to be considered.</p>
<p>However, there were significant differences between the two versions.</p>
<p>Firstly, the visual content: the Huanyu VR version would be superior to the standard VR version. This was an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Secondly, the sense of immersion. The reason gaming pods offered a stronger sense of immersion was primarily due to their force feedback system, which, combined with stereo sound, could provide players with a more perfect experience. In this regard, the new generation Huanyu VR would clearly be even better.</p>
<p>Promotional efforts were also in full swing, with the Nebula Games Platform already featuring the largest recommendation slot. As for the official platform, as Huanyu's first escorting masterpiece, it also displayed the most prominent recommendation spot.</p>
<p>After so many days of promotion and warm-up, countless players were already well aware of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>. Many interested players had already pre-ordered and pre-downloaded the game, just waiting for the release time to jump in and experience it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Inside a residential complex in the Imperial Capital, Zhang Yi lay expectantly in his new generation Huanyu VR gaming pod, excitedly waiting for <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> to unlock.</p>
<p>At the same time, he chatted with Wang Han and Song Ren in the voice channel.</p>
<p>"I wonder what kind of game <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> will be!" Zhang Yi was incredibly excited about the upcoming game.</p>
<p>"An FPS game!" Song Ren immediately chimed in.</p>
<p>"Can you stop stating the obvious?" Wang Han, in the same voice channel, said somewhat speechlessly.</p>
<p>"Ahem... time's up! Get ready to enter the game!" Seeing the game icon suddenly light up, Zhang Yi quickly changed the subject.</p>
<p>Hearing Zhang Yi's words, Wang Han and Song Ren also fell silent, immediately clicking to enter the game.</p>
<p>First, the Nebula Games LOGO appeared. This was standard for almost every game.</p>
<p>Then came a dynamic interface, similar to the VR version of <em>Minecraft</em>. Options like 'Options', 'Producer List', and 'Exit Game' floated in the sky.</p>
<p>On this dynamic interface, there were two paths: one for the campaign story mode, and one for multiplayer mode. However, the multiplayer mode was currently guarded by two soldiers, clearly indicating it wouldn't officially open until the 25th.</p>
<p>"The graphics are indeed quite outstanding!" Even though it was just a dynamic interface.</p>
<p>Based on his understanding of Nebula Games, this was very likely the actual in-game graphics. He had played many VR games, but the visual presentation of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> right now could definitely be ranked at the top of the pyramid.</p>
<p>The scene before him was incredibly realistic, especially when he approached the two soldiers guarding the entrance. Zhang Yi felt as if he was observing a living, real soldier up close. The equipment and firearms on their bodies, including their texture details, were all exceptionally well-rendered.</p>
<p>"Holy cow! This is awesome! Old Zhang, are you in the game yet? The atmosphere creation! It feels like it could rival Chen Xu's <em>Silent Hill PT</em>!" At this moment, Song Ren's boisterous voice came through the voice channel.</p>
<p>Wang Han had clearly already muted her voice channel.</p>
<p>Listening to Song Ren, Zhang Yi was speechless: "Not yet, I'm still on the game interface looking at the graphics. And what do you know about atmosphere creation? You talk as if you've played <em>Silent Hill PT</em>. You even turn off the sound and turn on bullet comments when watching a video, don't think I don't know!"</p>
<p>He knew perfectly well what kind of person his good brother was. Always bringing up <em>Silent Hill PT</em> or atmosphere creation.</p>
<p>What the heck do you know?! You haven't even cleared it yourself, you just watch videos!</p>
<p>"Ahem, the problem isn't important, you'll know when you play it yourself. I'm not going to babble with you anymore, I'm playing the game!" Song Ren, directly hit where it hurt, hung up the voice call.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi watched Song Ren hang up the voice channel and couldn't help but curl his lips.</p>
<p>But his anticipation grew even stronger.</p>
<p>He directly selected the campaign story mode.</p>
<p>Immediately, the game screen gradually faded to black.</p>
<p>An electronic satellite map appeared in Zhang Yi's vision.</p>
<p>Along with the map, a dialogue began.</p>
<p>'First, I have good news: this world is still safe and sound.'</p>
<p>'Civil war has erupted in the Russian Federation, with military and political forces clashing with extremist democratic forces. Additionally, 15,000 atomic warheads are on standby.'</p>
<p>As the soldier narrated, the satellite map on the screen began to shift perspective.</p>
<p>At the same time, a series of video clips appeared in the center of the screen.</p>
<p>'Just another normal day.'</p>
<p>'Khaled Al-Asad, currently the second most powerful man in the Middle East. Rumor has it his local forces are capable of dominating the region. Our intelligence department is keeping an eye on him.'</p>
<p>As the words fell, a photo appeared in the center of the screen.</p>
<p>A middle-aged man wearing a red beret and sunglasses appeared in the photo, looking very fierce.</p>
<p>'Good news is over, what about the bad news?'</p>
<p>'Today, a rookie, fresh from recruit selection, will be joining us. His name is Soap.'</p>
<p>The moment the voice fell, the previous electronic satellite map quickly zoomed in on a specific location on the map.</p>
<p>Inside a military base, Zhang Yi's character exited a jeep.</p>
<p>At the same time, some relevant information appeared in the bottom left corner.</p>
<p>'Prologue: Recruit Reporting'</p>
<p>Day 1 - AM: 6:30</p>
<p>Credenhill, England, Sergeant MacTavish, codename Soap.</p>
<p>22nd Special Air Service Regiment.</p>
<p>"Those two voices just now, weren't they the officer and soldier from the interrogation scene in the previous promotional trailer?"</p>
<p>Zhang Yi recalled the dialogue, feeling a little familiar. He had watched the <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> promotional trailer over a dozen times.</p>
<p>Soon, a soldier walking towards him confirmed his suspicion.</p>
<p>"Gaz, good to see you, little brother. Go pick a rifle from the table." A soldier holding a gun walked over, briefly introduced himself, and then spoke.</p>
<p>His voice was identical to before, and his appearance was that of the soldier who conducted the interrogation in the previous promotional CG.</p>
<p>At the same time, a prompt appeared in front of Zhang Yi: Pick up a gun from the table.</p>
<p>The following section was basically a new player tutorial.</p>
<p>Detonating sticky bombs, throwing grenades, attaching grenade launchers to firearms...</p>
<p>It wasn't very difficult, and Zhang Yi, not being an FPS game novice, quickly mastered these tasks.</p>
<p>Then, he followed Gaz into another warehouse.</p>
<p>"This is the new recruit, sir. Don't be too hard on him, it's his first day." Entering the warehouse, Gaz stepped forward to report the situation.</p>
<p>The middle-aged officer standing in front of the squad turned his head, and a character introduction appeared: Captain Price.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi immediately recognized that this officer was the NPC who interrogated the enemy in the previous promotional trailer.</p>
<p>With his arms crossed, Price looked at Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>"Alright, what kind of name is Soap? How did a rookie like you pass recruit selection?"</p>
<p>"Go on, it's your turn for the CQB test. Everyone else, head to the observation room."</p>
<p>"Briefly, the mission for the test: you need to complete the cargo ship mission alone within 60 seconds."</p>
<p>"Currently, the highest record in the team is held by Gaz, at 19 seconds."</p>
<p>"Climb the stairs nearby and go take the test."</p>
<p>Price spoke to Soap in a very flat tone.</p>
<p>At the same time, a dialogue box appeared in front of Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>[CQB test results will affect your subsequent game difficulty selection. CQB scores can also be uploaded to the cloud.]</p>
<p>At this point, Zhang Yi also noticed a small leaderboard nearby.</p>
<p>The top spot was held by a name called RPG, with a time of 17.1 seconds.</p>
<p>Clearly, this wasn't an NPC but a player.</p>
<p>The rest were uniformly players.</p>
<p>As for Gaz, whom Price mentioned as holding the best record, Zhang Yi didn't even see a shadow of him.</p>
<p>"Looking down on me, are we? It's just CQB! I'm a veteran!" Zhang Yi snorted.</p>
<p>CQB, wasn't <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> a game all about CQB content?</p>
<p>Hundreds of hours of experience!</p>
<p>He might not win against real players in combat, but this was just a simple training exercise.</p>
<p>He'd show them what an excellent Special Forces Operator looked like!</p>
