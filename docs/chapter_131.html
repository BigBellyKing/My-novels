                <h1>Chapter 230: A Pure Stream of Minecraft Players (Eighth Update, Please Subscribe and Vote Monthly)</h1>
<p>Soon after Chen Xu's unique video was released.</p>
<p>It quickly became a hot topic among Minecraft players, and also attracted the attention of many who had heard of the game but hadn't played it yet.</p>
<p>Moreover, compared to the previous impressive display of skill videos that had stunned players.</p>
<p>This time, the video made players feel very relatable.</p>
<p>After all, those impressive-looking videos were indeed awesome.</p>
<p>But for most players, it was more about watching the spectacle, waiting for those big shots to upload these creations to the Workshop, and then downloading them to play around with.</p>
<p>But if they were to actually make them themselves.</p>
<p>Then sorry, but no thanks!</p>
<p>And this time, the video Chen Xu released about the history of Minecraft's major events featured many things players had actually done.</p>
<p>For instance, unable to build a house, they'd simply dig a hole, pull out some torches and a bed, and make do for the night.</p>
<p>And on the first night, when chased by all sorts of monsters, many players resorted to the unique skill of 'Dig Three Fill One'.</p>
<p>Of course, there were also some unlucky souls who, having no idea where they were digging, would dig three blocks down and fall straight into a large mine, needlessly losing their first life.</p>
<p>And players who had personally participated in various major events across different servers felt even more energized.</p>
<p>"Haha, I'm from Sector 111. We've already started rebuilding the City in the Sky, planning to use glass for the entire city's floor! But many unlucky souls fell through because they didn't see the transparent glass clearly while building."</p>
<p>"What's that? Our Sector 3511 is truly awesome! While digging, lava appeared and set me on fire! Plus, we have a new plan: to artificially create a lava river! Our underground city will be called Lava City!"</p>
<p>"Haha, I'm a player from server 2147. Everyone was fighting with iron weapons, but then the farmers and pig breeders pulled out guns and declared that times had changed, haha! It was hilarious!"</p>
<p>"Brother upstairs, that's amazing! Who came up with the idea for your [Merchant Alliance]?"</p>
<p>"How should I know? I wasn't there when the Merchant Alliance was formed; I was the one who got shot!"</p>
<p>"Actually, that's nothing. To get into the next major event video, the brothers from our server 188 have signed a truce agreement and unanimously decided to complete city construction in the game, and select a respected leader to guide us in growing stronger and creating glory together!"</p>
<p>"Holy cow, awesome! Mark it down, brother, remember to say something if there's a new development, I'm curious!"</p>
<p>"Hey, what's there to mark!? Everyone wants to be the boss, and people's hearts have scattered! Originally, we were going for a presidential system with separation of powers, but now it has split into tribal mode."</p>
<p>Beyond the diverse world trajectories evolving on various servers in online mode, which players found extremely engaging.</p>
<p>Likewise, many players in the game also started experimenting with all sorts of gameplay styles.</p>
<p>Some were still in single-player creative mode, immersed in their own worlds, building what they considered beautiful and good houses.</p>
<p>Similarly, other players made plans to experience server gameplay in online mode.</p>
<p>The appearance of the video also spurred players' deep exploration of the game.</p>
<p>For example, the game's technology content, the Redstone system, and some players had even discovered the existence of the Nether.</p>
<p>Some big shots began researching the game's complex Redstone system, seeing if they could create even more incredible things.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some even more impressive players began creating all sorts of MODs.</p>
<p>Not just MODs for previous Redstone contraptions and building complexes.</p>
<p>But MODs with unique gameplay.</p>
<p>Many other players, although they hadn't created MODs, set up custom servers to establish specific rules for players, engaging in various interesting mini-games.</p>
<p>For instance, they would download the themed scene of 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival,' create corresponding ancient costume skins for players, and hide player IDs within the game.</p>
<p>In one match, 20 ordinary players would be in the themed scene of 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival,' with a designated area, and two players would act as killers, possessing weapons capable of attacking.</p>
<p>The remaining players would blend in with NPCs or hide in a corner, enduring until the time limit.</p>
<p>Each time a killer made a wrong attack, they would lose one health point.</p>
<p>Custom mini-game rooms like these began to proliferate.</p>
<p>There were also puzzles, where a complete building would be disassembled and then divided into two groups to see which side could reassemble it faster.</p>
<p>Although there weren't yet formal rules for these, players relied on their own tacit agreements and the rules set up within the servers.</p>
<p>One after another, unique gameplays were born within Minecraft.</p>
<p>And this also aligned perfectly with Minecraft's title.</p>
<p>Everyone has a world of their own.</p>
<p>Everyone has their own way of playing.</p>
<p>By now, Minecraft's charm could be said to have been fully displayed.</p>
<p>Although due to the large player base, it was inevitable that some unlikable entitled new players and some old players who enjoyed bullying newcomers would appear.</p>
<p>However, compared to the overall environment, thanks to Minecraft's game rules, its slightly cartoonish art style, and Nebula Games' excellent community management for this game.</p>
<p>All of these factors set Minecraft apart from other games, making it a pure stream in an internet era often filled with hostility.</p>
<p>At the same time, this positive environment continuously solidified Minecraft's popularity, attracting more players to dive in.</p>
<p>And the sales miracle created by Minecraft left the entire gaming industry dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Many game designers felt they had already held Minecraft in very high regard.</p>
<p>But as days passed, facts proved that they had still underestimated this game.</p>
<p>Time entered mid-March. A full month and a half had passed since Minecraft launched, and many other games had also been released during this period.</p>
<p>Yet, they were still affected by Minecraft, and not a single game could overshadow Minecraft in terms of popularity.</p>
<p>The designers who launched their respective games during this period were almost universally lamenting their fate.</p>
<p>Chen Xu clearly wasn't too concerned about the struggles of his counterparts.</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games' office, Chen Xu emerged from the gaming pod and took the phone handed to him by Qin Yi.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, all mainstream mobile platforms have been tested, and the optimization is pretty much at its limit," Qin Yi explained to Chen Xu.</p>
<p>The porting for the mobile and VR versions was basically complete.</p>
<p>It didn't require much effort, especially the mobile version, which just needed good optimization and some content trimming.</p>
<p>For the VR version, the main work focused on modeling and textures, as well as the related VR operational experience.</p>
<p>However, it wasn't Chen Xu's first time developing for VR. He had already gained an understanding of VR actions and related adaptations when he worked on Silent Hill PT for the Game Department, so it wasn't too difficult.</p>
<p>"That's pretty much it. Inform the Marketing and Operations Department to prepare for release," Chen Xu said with a slight nod after briefly playing with it.</p>
