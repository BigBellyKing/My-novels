                <p>Chapter 747: Absolutely a Hole-Digging Maniac!</p>
<p>Listening to Kratos's words to Atreus, Zhang Yi couldn't help but take a deep breath, and at the same time, his heart was filled with emotion.</p>
<p>Having played the previous Greek trilogy, Zhang Yi clearly understood what Kratos's words meant. For Kratos, his life was a tragedy. From birth, his fate seemed to be predetermined.</p>
<p>Prophecies, serving as a pawn for the gods, and then being used by Gaia and Athena. One could say Kratos had always played the role of a Tool-man. But Atreus was different from him. As a new god, Atreus had Kratos protecting him from behind. He didn't have to walk Kratos's old path; what kind of god he would become was entirely up to Atreus himself.</p>
<p>The adventure along the way was not only Atreus's growth but also Kratos's. There was no epic, blood-pumping storyline like in the Greek trilogy, but this father and son's journey to the highest peak of the Nine Realms was incredibly memorable.</p>
<p>Of course, besides this, what made Zhang Yi a little sad and reflective was the character of Freya. He actually really liked Freya's character, not just because the character modeling was attractive and flavorful. The main reason was that Freya wasn't annoying in the game; while her pathological maternal love was hard to agree with, she helped Atreus and Kratos a lot during the game, with the Black Breath, Atreus's illness, and resurrecting Mimir's head.</p>
<p>One could even say that without Freya, Kratos and Atreus would never have been able to complete this adventurous journey. But now it seemed Freya would become corrupted and turn into an enemy?</p>
<p>Thinking of Freya, who had just left holding Baldur's body, Zhang Yi, in the game, speculated about the future developments. After all, Freya was not a simple character; although she was currently just watering flowers and raising pigs in the forest, her divine power, which stopped Kratos and Baldur's great battle, proved she was incredibly powerful. It was just that Odin's curse prevented her from exerting her full strength. Moreover, through previous dialogues, it was known that Freya was the former leader of the Valkyrie corps.</p>
<p>After bidding farewell to Freya, the rest of the journey was smooth sailing. Forget about BOSS battles; there weren't even any elite monster fights. Through the World Tree's Realm Travel Gateway, and then using Mimir's head to open the gate to Jötunheim, Kratos and Atreus ascended the Light-Ladder to Jötunheim.</p>
<p>There were no ripples, not even minor monsters. Through the Realm Travel Gateway, they used Mimir’s head to open the gate to Jötunheim and arrived there via the Light-Ladder.</p>
<p>Located on the mountainside of the Giant's Finger, Kratos looked at the distant sun and slowly unwrapped the bandages from his arm. Below was the indelible mark left by the Blades of Chaos. He had once not wanted Atreus to know, but now he had nothing left to hide.</p>
<p>Kratos looked at Atreus beside him, carefully took Laufey's ashes from his waist, and handed them to Atreus. He had now fully acknowledged Atreus's abilities.</p>
<p>They journeyed upwards, passing through a temple filled with giant statues or petrified giants. But just as Kratos and Atreus were about to reach the summit, Atreus accidentally touched a wall, and then a shocking scene unfolded.</p>
<p>Sand and gravel fell from the wall, revealing a mural hidden behind them. The content of the mural depicted Kratos and Atreus's adventure up to this point. It was all there—a prophecy! Or rather, a prophecy specifically for Atreus.</p>
<p>Everything matched up. Baldur wasn't looking for Kratos in the first place, but for Laufey. It was just that Laufey had already turned to ashes at the time. Coupled with Kratos's unclear dark past and his status as an outsider, Kratos immediately assumed Baldur was after him. Kratos wasn't the only one hiding secrets; Laufey was too.</p>
<p>What made Zhang Yi even more uneasy was the last mural that Atreus didn't see. On it, Kratos's body lay in Atreus's arms, and a grieving Atreus spat out a giant serpent from his mouth.</p>
<p>Is Kratos going to die again!?</p>
<p>Zhang Yi's mind was filled with questions. But Kratos in the game just gazed silently, then turned and left.</p>
<p>On the highest peak of the Nine Realms, Atreus took out his mother's ashes and handed them to Kratos. Father and son together scattered the ashes from the bag into the air.</p>
<p>Complex emotions were etched on their faces. Atreus's eyes welled up with tears, and a subtle reflection could be seen in Kratos's eyes. Indeed, they had gone through so much to reach this point. Along the way, Kratos had strived to teach his son how to be a god, while Atreus, in turn, taught Kratos how to be human.</p>
<p>‘Goodbye, Faye.’</p>
<p>Accompanying Kratos's farewell and the subsequent credits, it was clear that this adventure of Atreus and Kratos had come to an end. From a narrative perspective, after this concluding act of scattering the mother's ashes, he knew it was over.</p>
<p>But for Zhang Yi, his focus was not on the conclusion itself, but more on the plot holes dug in the game.</p>
<p>Besides the previous murals prophesying Atreus and Kratos's potential death, the father and son revealed another incredibly significant piece of news as they left. That is, the name Atreus was given by Kratos in memory of a former Spartan comrade. Atreus's mother also gave him another name: Loki.</p>
<p>Although he wasn't very familiar with Norse mythology, he understood some basic concepts. For example, the World Serpent and Fenris Wolf were both Loki's sons. Combining this with the previous scene of Kratos falling into Atreus's arms and Atreus spitting out a serpent, it truly led to boundless speculation.</p>
<p>In addition, the great serpent that appeared in the Lake of the Nine earlier, and Týr, all seemed to hint at something, such as the possibility that the great serpent came from the future. This would also explain why the World Serpent was so friendly to Kratos and Atreus in the game.</p>
<p>Full of confusion, Zhang Yi exited the game, his mind still on the plot, as there were simply too many plot holes.</p>
<p>First, there was Kratos's wife: Laufey. Was this character, who never appeared, good or bad? Why did she know the prophecy but not tell Kratos directly, nor reveal her identity as a giantess to them? Why did she want Kratos and Atreus to scatter her ashes from the highest peak of the Nine Realms after her death?</p>
<p>And combining the initial scene of Kratos chopping trees and Baldur showing up, everything now linked together. The golden handprints on the trees Kratos chopped, Baldur's appearance right after he finished chopping them—before that, Atreus and Kratos had been living in peace. Was all of this part of a calculation?</p>
<p>Odin dispatched Baldur to hunt down the giants, originally to avert Ragnarök, but Kratos and Atreus inadvertently brought about the conditions for Ragnarök's early arrival by killing Baldur with mistletoe.</p>
<p>Coupled with the murals at the final ascent to the highest peak of the Nine Realms, all of this was a known prophecy. One mural even depicted Laufey arguing with other giants. If all of this had been planned, from Laufey marrying Kratos to giving birth to Atreus, it's possible everything was calculated from the start.</p>
<p>Prophecy, fate, the destruction of the gods—all of this seemed exactly like Kratos's experiences in Greek mythology, except this time the subject of the prophecy was Atreus. In an instant, Zhang Yi felt his brain almost overload. This was truly a Hole-Digging Maniac!</p>
<p>And the kind that only digs holes without filling them!</p>
<p>Although the game's story still continued, the credits had already appeared. For players who had played the game, this was familiar: it meant the main storyline was over. While they could still explore the Nine Realms, Kratos's adventure was clearly on a temporary hiatus.</p>
