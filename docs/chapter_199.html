                <p>Chapter 299: VR Game Design Competition Announcement (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Many people thought of another game under Nebula Games: Minecraft.
The reason Minecraft became so popular, besides its unique gameplay, was primarily its extremely well-developed game community.
And now, Warcraft's map editor is clearly no different.</p>
<p>Paired with the Nebula Games Platform's Workshop, it creates a player community.
Many industry designers were full of admiration.
Especially when considering the early situation of the Nebula Games Platform.
Clearly, ever since Overcooked was launched, Nebula Games has consciously been maintaining this aspect of community.</p>
<p>Of course, not all game designers were moved to such emotion.
For instance, Zhou Qi from Hero Entertainment.
He felt he should probably go to the hospital for a check-up.
Life's drastic ups and downs were simply too thrilling.
Originally, he thought Warcraft would divide the RTS player base, and Human Wars might take a share of the casual player base.
But now, he clearly understood one thing.
That is, Warcraft wants it all.
He had been happy for nothing these past few days.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Compared to the designers who showed various emotional shifts because of the Warcraft editor, Chen Xu's mood, on the other hand, was quite good.
For Chen Xu, the overall strategic layout for Warcraft was mostly complete by now.
On the current ladder rankings, various other types of tactics had also been developed by players.
For example, some relatively simple, all-purpose tactics from his previous life, 'Heaven and Earth Dual Ghosts', and even some tactics Chen Xu had never seen before, unfamiliar yet refreshing, had been developed.
As for whether they were effective, they hadn't been showcased on the professional stage yet, so no one could say for sure.
Additionally, various international and domestic competitions were already emerging.
All of which could keep Warcraft active for a period to come.
In terms of Warcraft's content itself, for these core RTS players, it could be said that they probably wouldn't get bored even after playing for ten years.
Beyond that, a large number of players who weren't particularly interested in RTS gameplay had started playing RPG maps.
In fact, this segment of the player base was even larger.
According to current backend data from the Nebula Games Platform, the number of people playing RPG maps daily was gradually catching up to regular RTS matches.
This was somewhat expected.
After all, not everyone possessed enough hand speed to experience the pure charm of RTS.
Including Warcraft in his previous life, even without the impact of MOBA games later on, players would still be gradually siphoned off by RPG, FPS, and other types of games; this was unchangeable.
Unless the RTS gameplay was simplified.
But without troop deployment and strategic decision-making, could an RTS still be called an RTS?
Currently, Minecraft and Warcraft, along with the earlier Sanguosha and Fall Guys, still had a considerable number of stable players.
Coupled with the openness of the Nebula Games Platform, there were actually many third-party multiplayer games as well.
It could be said that for the current platform, this area was essentially stable.
However, Chen Xu hadn't quite figured out the next steps.
Nevertheless, after more than half a year of high-load operation for the company's internal teams, Chen Xu made a decision.
That was to organize a vacation activity for all employees.
Of course, it would be in batches, as the company still needed staff on duty.
As for the vacation destination, it wouldn't be abroad.
After all, things abroad were quite chaotic, and weren't the magnificent landscapes of their own country worth seeing?</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>The ride back to the company from the airport was quite smooth.
Sitting in the car, Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, Qin Yi, and the others were still discussing their various experiences from the trip, organizing the corresponding photos.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chen Xu received a call from his old acquaintance, the enthusiastic Teacher Meng.</p>
<p>“Hello?” Chen Xu was a little curious why Meng Zuo was calling him at this moment.
On the other end of the line, Meng Zuo spoke up: “Mr. Chen, have you seen the announcement from the Game Department?”</p>
<p>Pausing for a moment, Chen Xu was a little confused: “Announcement? What announcement?”
“The Game Department's Game Design Competition! Mr. Chen, you don't know?” Meng Zuo was also taken aback.</p>
<p>“Game Design Competition? I don't really pay attention to that. After all, if I were to participate in any Game Design Competition now, it wouldn't look too good.” Chen Xu was puzzled.
He had participated in Game Design Competitions in the previous two years.
But starting last year, he basically ignored them.
After all, with Nebula Games' current scale, participating in such a Game Design Competition would simply be bullying, wouldn't it?</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, Meng Zuo on the other end understood what was happening: “No, Mr. Chen, log into the Game Department's official website with your account. This time it's a VR Game Design Competition.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Teacher Meng, wait a moment.” Chen Xu paused, then pulled out his laptop from his backpack and logged onto the Game Department's official website.
At this point, Ruan Ningxue, Qin Yi, and the others beside him also quieted down, curiously watching Chen Xu.
And upon entering the Game Department's official website, Chen Xu understood what Meng Zuo meant.
There was a long text announcement, but Chen Xu summarized it and understood the gist.
Simply put, VR games have always been used across various industries, including the military.
Both domestically and internationally, there are VR games specifically for the military.
However, this area is currently relatively underdeveloped domestically, so this time there's a wave of reform.
Of course, when it comes to actual training, live-fire exercises are definitely the main focus. The so-called VR training mainly provides conditions that cannot be created in real-life exercises.
Simply put, it's to better cultivate skills like crisis response.
After all, it's impossible to truly put soldiers in danger during live-fire exercises.
This time, it's considered a political mission, though participation is voluntary.
After all, the R&amp;D funding for a VR game often runs into hundreds of millions, and the Game Department clearly couldn't afford that.
There would be corresponding subsidies, but certainly not enough to cover the cost of a game.
And while ensuring the game is profitable, the goal is to develop it to the Game Department's satisfaction as much as possible.
Of course, there would definitely be two different versions later: one for the military and one for players.
As for the benefits, there certainly were some.
Various cutting-edge technologies developed by the Game Department would be made available to these designers and companies for use.
And for this VR Game Design Competition, the most cutting-edge VR technology available would also be opened up for designers to use.
On one hand, it was to provide specialized training games for the military; on the other, it was to pave the way for new VR devices.
After reading the entire announcement, Chen Xu had a clear understanding of the situation.</p>
<p>“Teacher Meng, you didn't just call me to tell me about this, did you?” Chen Xu asked.</p>
<p>“<em>Cough, cough</em>, I can't hide anything from you, Mr. Chen! This time, I'm acting as a communication bridge. I'm representing NetDragon and approaching you, Mr. Chen, hoping we can collaborate to create a VR game.” Meng Zuo said to Chen Xu.</p>
<p>“Hmm?” Chen Xu wondered.</p>
<p>“After all, a large-scale VR game, especially one of this specific nature with a political mission, is quite unique. There's a high chance of losing all investment, so sharing the risk is a very normal thing.”
“Furthermore, Mr. Chen, NetDragon here also wants to establish a strategic partnership with the Nebula Games Platform. If you have any interest in this, Mr. Chen, we can pick a time to sit down and discuss it.” Meng Zuo said from the other end of the line.</p>
<p>“Alright, how about the day after tomorrow at 2 PM, Teacher Meng?” Chen Xu suggested a time, chatted for a couple more sentences, and then hung up the phone.</p>
<p>At the same time, Chen Xu himself was quite surprised.
After all, hadn't NetDragon, like TengHua, launched its works on the Channel Alliance before?
Now they were turning around and wanting to cooperate with him.
Despite his surprise, Chen Xu still decided to meet with them.
To see what the situation was with NetDragon.
What remained was this VR game.
For this Game Department VR Game Design Competition, Chen Xu actually had a few ideas.</p>
