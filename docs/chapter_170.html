                <p>Chapter 269: No Such Thing as a Protagonist (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games' studio.</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and Qin Yi were discussing game-related matters.</p>
<p>"Although it's an RTS, this time the workload feels exceptionally large! It's not any smaller than the previous <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>!" Ruan Ningxue exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Yes, and from the world view and plot settings, it's also quite massive. Dwarves, Elves, Orcs, and Undead, as well as Goblins and Elemental Creatures—so many different races!" Yang Xin also nodded.</p>
<p>"But with so much content involved, I wonder what the story will be like. And it seems most RTS games on the market don't have much of a plot," Ruan Ningxue wondered aloud.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure either. I haven't received any plot-related materials yet," Yang Xin said, shaking her head.</p>
<p>"I think, regardless of the plot, this RTS can definitely succeed based on its gameplay alone!" Qin Yi, who had just finished inputting data, said excitedly, sporting two dark circles under his eyes, indicative of intense effort.</p>
<p>"That exaggerated?" The two were a little surprised by Qin Yi's words.</p>
<p>Although they had confidence in the game they were developing, the finished product wasn't out yet, so no one could say for sure what it would be like.</p>
<p>"Of course! It's incredibly rich, and various types can perfectly form multiple variables, which is absolutely crucial for an RTS," Qin Yi said with excitement.</p>
<p>During this period of inputting and structuring the numerical data, he had been extremely excited.</p>
<p>Although what Chen Xu gave him were mostly spreadsheets, as a Gaming Industry Professional, Qin Yi could still get a glimpse of its potential.</p>
<p>Compared to other RTS games on the market, at least in terms of numerical design, it was absolutely top-notch.</p>
<p>"Alright, you should get some good rest during this time, and arrange your work schedule reasonably, no need to be so stressed!" Chen Xu said, walking out of his office, hearing Qin Yi's words and then looking at his dark circles.</p>
<p>Although Chen Xu had given all the work content to Qin Yi at once, he hadn't set strict deadlines, allowing Qin Yi to arrange his own time. However, it was clear now that Qin Yi had completely transformed into a workaholic, intending to finish all the workload in the early stages.</p>
<p>After a couple of caring words, Chen Xu went to Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue, showing them the organized line art.</p>
<p>"The line art for several main characters in the game has been completed, and I've written detailed corresponding requirements. You can meticulously add some more details. I've also simply outlined the relevant introductions for the plot section. Here, you two will be responsible for the initial review from the outsourcing company," Chen Xu said to them.</p>
<p>Taking the thick stack of line art from Chen Xu, Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin gasped in admiration as they looked at the drawing on the first sheet of manuscript paper.</p>
<p>"So cool!"</p>
<p>Most of the drafts were still preliminary, but Chen Xu had already colored the first few pages.</p>
<p>On the first drawing, there was a handsome young man with golden hair, wearing silver-blue knight armor and a cape, with a lion-headed belt tied around his waist.</p>
<p>Behind him was a huge hammer, and his expression was incredibly firm, with a pursuit of justice in his eyes. Coupled with the warm-toned background, the young man in the drawing appeared exceptionally righteous.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the blurred background, golden light enveloped this young Paladin.</p>
<p>Beside it, the character's identity was written: Arthas Menethil, Prince of Lordaeron, a valiant and selfless Paladin of the Knights of the Silver Hand.</p>
<p>This must be the protagonist!</p>
<p>So handsome!</p>
<p>Looking at the first drawing, everyone couldn't help but exclaim in wonder.</p>
<p>But when they turned to the second drawing, their expressions instantly froze.</p>
<p>The protagonist of the second drawing was also Arthas, but the entire style had completely changed.</p>
<p>His original silver-blue knight armor had now become dim and gray, and his golden hair had turned a lifeless gray-white.</p>
<p>His expression was still as resolute, but what his eyes conveyed was not justice but evil.</p>
<p>The great hammer, which once represented a Paladin, was now replaced by a demonic sword emitting blue light and engraved with magic runes.</p>
<p>Beside the drawing was an introduction to the character.</p>
<p>The protagonist was still Arthas, but at this moment, his identity had changed from the Prince of Lordaeron and Paladin of the Knights of the Silver Hand to a Death Knight of the Scourge.</p>
<p>"How extreme!"</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, is Arthas the protagonist of the game? Did he turn from righteous to villainous? Or is it a case of a prodigal son returning, worth more than gold?"</p>
<p>Everyone looked at the two pieces of line art in front of them, unable to contain their inner excitement, and began discussing.</p>
<p>The main focal point of their concern was the meaning represented by these two pieces of line art.</p>
<p>As for the plot, no one was clear about it yet, because Chen Xu hadn't said anything at all.</p>
<p>But everyone still knew some basic settings.</p>
<p>For example, the game was divided into Humans, Orcs, Elves, and Undead, which were the four races controlled by players.</p>
<p>And now, a drawing of Arthas, from righteous to evil, from prince to Death Knight, represented an extreme transformation in identity and allegiance.</p>
<p>This already made everyone's imaginations run wild: would the righteous prince be corrupted into an evil Death Knight, or would the evil Death Knight transform back into a righteous Paladin?</p>
<p>"Protagonist? In a certain event and period, Arthas is indeed a protagonist, but in the entire Warcraft story, Arthas is merely a brilliant chapter in the grand era," Chen Xu explained, shaking his head upon hearing their words.</p>
<p>"Eh!"</p>
<p>Hearing this, everyone didn't quite understand.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, do you mean multiple protagonists?" Qin Yi asked, making a guess.</p>
<p>"No, there's no such thing as a protagonist, or rather, each period has its own protagonist," Chen Xu replied, shaking his head.</p>
<p>"Just like the history of civilization, each period and each race has its own glorious stories, its own outstanding individuals and heroes, whether evil or righteous. Characters like Arthas, Illidan, or the Humans, Orcs, and Elves, they might be the so-called protagonists in a certain period, but they are not eternal," Chen Xu simply explained.</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu's words, everyone more or less understood what he meant.</p>
<p>It wasn't about describing the game's story from an individual's perspective, but from a broader one.</p>
<p>Thinking about it that way, it indeed seemed to perfectly fit the RTS genre!</p>
<p>And the scope was also larger.</p>
<p>"Alright, <em>Warcraft</em> will continue to be developed according to the current model. However, the crossover with <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> and the building complexes for <em>Minecraft</em> can now begin."</p>
<p>"Consider it a pre-release warm-up for the game," Chen Xu said, looking at everyone.</p>
