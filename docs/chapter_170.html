                <p>Chapter 169: Players Might Get a Little Too Excited (Fourth update, please subscribe for monthly passes)</p>
<p>Modu. At the fifth exhibition hall of the gameplay Expo, many staff members were busily working.</p>
<p>Unlike last year's participation, Nebula Games' exhibition area had moved to the third exhibition hall this year. After all, with <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>It Takes Two</em>, Nebula Games' reputation and scale could no longer be considered that of an independent game developer. As for TengHua and NetDragon, they still occupied one exhibition hall each, just like last year. The third exhibition hall was primarily home to early-stage second and third-tier game companies. The distribution of booth sizes was relatively even, and Nebula Games' exhibition space was similar to last year's.</p>
<p>“I feel like all the surrounding game developers are really paying attention to us!” Ruan Ningxue, who was setting up their booth, remarked with emotion.</p>
<p>As soon as she finished speaking, Yang Xin chimed in, “Yeah, it feels like they’re eyeing us covetously, and some designers even came over earlier to gather intel and pump for information!”</p>
<p>“Mainly because Mr. Chen stole all the thunder last year,” Lin Tao added with a chuckle from the side.</p>
<p>“But I feel like this year we’re just here to make up the numbers. The only thing we can really bring out is a promotional trailer for the <em>Dark Souls Prequel</em>,” Ruan Ningxue said with a hint of regret.</p>
<p>“There’s no helping it, we’re running out of time. And Mr. Chen already released <em>Silent Hill PT</em> in advance. Otherwise, imagine how surprised players would be if it were showcased here!” Yang Xin exclaimed.</p>
<p>Some cosers around them, who were rehearsing their upcoming performances, stumbled, getting their dance steps wrong after hearing that. Most of these cosers were also gamers, so naturally, they knew the name of <em>Silent Hill PT</em>, dubbed the 'scariest DEMO' online these past two days. Even if some hadn't downloaded and played it themselves, they had learned about it through game media, videos, or live streams. If that thing were brought to the expo, players would indeed be 'too surprised'.</p>
<p>As the group continued setting up, they soon saw Chen Xu and Qin Yi leading a team of staff members, pushing a small cart towards the entrance of the booth.</p>
<p>“Hey! Mr. Chen, are these new COS props? Why are they so strange?”</p>
<p>“Yeah! Why do they feel so weird? Inflatable hammers, water tank sofas, what are these?!”</p>
<p>Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue, among others, were quite curious when they saw the props Chen Xu and Qin Yi brought over.</p>
<p>The props delivered on the small cart looked custom-made. There were four dark and dingy sofas resembling large water tanks, each about 80 centimeters high, reaching just above Qin Yi’s thigh. Inside each water tank-shaped sofa, there was also a large hammer of the kind used for smashing walls on construction sites, though these were, of course, inflatable. Witnessing this peculiar sight, everyone was filled with curiosity.</p>
<p>“I took some time these past two days to make a mini-game with Qin Yi. It’s just going to be released at the expo these two days to make up the numbers. These are props for the mini-game, to enhance players’ sense of immersion,” Chen Xu explained with a smile.</p>
<p>“Oh, I see!” Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin suddenly understood.</p>
<p>However, they were also curious about what kind of game Chen Xu had actually made. In response to Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin’s questions, Chen Xu merely shrugged and smiled without speaking. Qin Yi, on the other hand, looked at the four large water tank sofas and the four hammers, appearing hesitant to speak.</p>
<p>After some thought, Qin Yi quietly approached the exhibition hall staff to communicate: “Tomorrow, could we get some more security guards to maintain order at our booth? Because players’ emotions might be a little… agitated then.”</p>
<p>The security guard uncle opposite him was clearly a <em>Dark Souls</em> fan. Hearing Qin Yi’s words and seeing the game brand on his chest, he immediately chuckled, “No problem! I totally get it! It’s the <em>Dark Souls Prequel</em> trial, right? Of course, players will be excited, it’s been so long!”</p>
<p>Watching the security guard uncle, who was smiling and even showed some anticipation, Qin Yi’s expression grew even more complex.</p>
<p>A trial? Is there such a thing?</p>
<p>Moreover, what you consider 'player excitement' is entirely different from what I’m talking about!</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>On the day of the expo, just like last year, the gameplay Expo was still packed with people. Many local Modu players came, and others traveled from out of town specifically to try out new games at the exhibition.</p>
<p>This year, NetDragon and TengHua, these two game developers, basically didn’t have any major highlights. Besides some of their third-party studios, there were no truly impactful blockbusters. However, they were still the preferred choice for most players, as they simply had more games. As for Nebula Games, many players also headed straight there, especially since Chen Xu had already announced on the official Weibo account that the latest news about a sequel would be revealed at the gameplay Expo. Additionally, the popularity generated by <em>Silent Hill PT</em> online in the past two days also brought Nebula Games a significant amount of attention. And, of course, there were also Nebula Games’ loyal fan players.</p>
<p>“I wonder what Chen Xu will bring to the expo this year!” Zhang Yi said with some anticipation.</p>
<p>“Hopefully a game like <em>Silent Hill PT</em>!” Wang Han said from beside him.</p>
<p>“Anything new is fine, just as long as it’s not a horror game,” said the tall and strong Song Ren.</p>
<p>“By the way, are Wang Yifan and Joey not here this year?” Wang Han asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Joey can’t come, she broke her leg. As for Wang Yifan, he’s on a business trip this month and couldn’t get leave,” Song Ren explained.</p>
<p>However, as soon as Zhang Yi and Song Ren arrived at the Nebula Games exhibition area, they were a little bewildered. Because there were simply too many people. The entire exhibition hall was packed, and although security guards maintained order, everyone was queuing up conscientiously. But there was no denying the sheer number of people!</p>
<p>From afar, it looked like there was practically nothing on the stage except for showgirls and cosers performing. But Zhang Yi and the others soon found out why. Because after the opening coser performance concluded, a familiar figure walked onto the stage. “Hello, everyone!” Chen Xu took the microphone and greeted the players present with a smile. The many players in attendance also waved back.</p>
<p>‘Finally, we see Chen Xu!’</p>
<p>‘When will they announce news about the <em>Dark Souls Prequel</em>?!’</p>
<p>‘Is <em>Silent Hill PT</em> just a DEMO?’</p>
<p>Players present were all speaking at once, with all sorts of comments.</p>
<p>Chen Xu gestured for everyone to quiet down, then continued, “I believe the reason you all rushed here first thing is for this!”</p>
<p>As Chen Xu’s words fell, the players in the venue erupted in excited shouts. Because on the large screen behind him, an icon appeared.</p>
<p>The bonfire with the Coiled Sword from <em>Dark Souls</em>!</p>
<p>An Undead, clad in armor and kneeling before the bonfire, was gradually outlined.</p>
<p>As the scene played on the large screen, the voices of the players in the hall gradually quieted down, leaving only the background music emanating from the loudspeakers in the exhibition area. The video didn't end there; the bonfire continued to burn. And as the flames scorched, the image began to distort and blur. The Undead kneeling on the ground slowly vanished, eventually turning into a white mist.</p>
<p>The flames burned hotter and hotter, and the white mist gradually covered the entire screen. The next moment, amidst the players’ irrepressible cheers, an aged narration appeared.</p>
