                <p>Chapter 560: Features of Platformer Games (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>It wasn't just Xiaojie; many players quickly discovered its unique characteristics after playing for a while.</p>
<p>If one were to form a first impression of Super Mario Maker, the vast majority of players would likely have the same feeling: that it’s a very friendly and wholesome all-ages game. And indeed, it is. Although it had just launched, according to Nebula Games' internal data, Super Mario Maker's underage player count was second only to Minecraft, making it an undeniable 'low-age' game.</p>
<p>However, due to the game's versus mode and the characteristic that only the first-place player earns points, many players didn't initially grasp it. But as their understanding of the game deepened, they discovered many opportunities for griefing.</p>
<p>In a previous life, there was a joke to describe Super Mario Maker multiplayer players:</p>
<p>“Any player who still has a shred of humanity won't reach S+ rank or become a red-named player.”</p>
<p>“If all S-rank players and above were to be executed, not a single S+ player would be innocent. As for red-named players, you'd need to fire four shots, because for the first three shots, they'd lift up the other three players to shield themselves.”</p>
<p>Although Super Mario Maker hadn't been online for long and there were no red-named players yet, the opportunities for griefing were certainly not few.</p>
<p>Some levels required obtaining a key and defeating a BOSS to successfully meet the clear conditions. It was at this point that some players, with mischief in their hearts, began to tread the path of capitalists. They would specifically guard the entrance, snatching the fruits of other hard-working players' labor, a scene truly heartbreaking to witness. And this was just the lowest form of griefing.</p>
<p>In some maps, after entering through a door, if players had items like springs, P-Switches/Super P-Balloons, or Bob-ombs, they would block the doors and pipes. In such situations, unless these items were reset, other players couldn't proceed, effectively stripping them of their qualification to compete.</p>
<p>All sorts of griefing tactics were displayed to players through videos and live streaming platforms, and of course, players also experienced them firsthand as victims, which utterly stunned everyone.</p>
<p>Online, more and more people discussed Super Mario Maker. While playing the versus mode deeply revealed the griefing side of many players, the game's cooperative mode and map-making mode also provided a very casual, relaxing, and enjoyable experience for many.</p>
<p>Both ordinary players and master players could find fun in it. A simple platformer game offered a rich variety of gameplay. Moreover, thanks to Super Mario Maker, platformer games, which had been somewhat in decline, rekindled some of their sparkle.</p>
<p>Platformer games actually have significant limitations because they are difficult to scale into large-volume games. This is a limitation of game content. Regardless of the genre, every game needs an essential element: a complete progression system.</p>
<p>This progression system isn't about numerical stats like in an RPG; it's about the player's sense of feedback. In traditional FPS games, killing opponents, winning rounds, and accumulating economy are all part of the progression feedback system.</p>
<p>Or, in games without an economy system, simply killing enemies and accumulating kills is also a progression system.</p>
<p>In RTS games, producing units, peasants mining resources, or in galgames, the affection point system for攻略 characters—these systems are all essentially elements of progression.</p>
<p>This system isn't always explicitly presented numerically; some games use implicit methods to provide players with gameplay feedback. Even purely story-driven games like Uncharted, which lack skills, continuously pushing the plot forward, is a form of progression.</p>
<p>Platformer games, naturally, also possess this characteristic.</p>
<p>Limited by the inherent gameplay of platformers, if one doesn't consider incorporating action or numerical elements, the best way for platformers to provide player feedback is through increasingly difficult map designs as the game progresses. It's like the common saying: “Why climb Mount Everest? Because it's there.” Challenging difficulties and surpassing oneself to become stronger is a human instinct. The only difference is the individual's tolerance for pain.</p>
<p>Souls-like games are a typical example. For platformers, the gradual increase in level difficulty is a defining characteristic.</p>
<p>However, compared to traditional AAA-tier games, the scale of platformers is a significant issue. This is because they cannot rely on numerical balancing for level design. They can only achieve difficulty through changes in map design, which is why some platformer games include save points mid-level.</p>
<p>Without save points, a platformer game would devolve into a torturous experience like Getting Over It. Imagine if Super Mario didn't have a level-by-level structure, and instead, if you died, you had to restart from 1-1. Wouldn't that be utterly crushing?</p>
<p>Super Mario Maker, however, completely changed the shortcomings of platformer games through a different approach. Is it hard for platformers to be large-scale games? Then don't make large-scale games; win by quantity instead.</p>
<p>It utilizes various items to let players create their own maps, combined with a multiplayer mode, allowing these maps to form a perfect, self-sustaining loop. The fun of Super Mario Maker is complementary; without enough player-created maps, players wouldn't be able to maintain a sense of freshness, and the most terrifying thing for platformers is a lack of freshness.</p>
<p>Games like Rainbow Six Siege and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, despite players using the same guns and weapons in every match, can still provide a different sense of novelty based on opponents and in-game luck. But platformer games fundamentally revolve around levels. Even though it's multiplayer versus, setting aside all the griefing, the core is still about jumping.</p>
<p>If a map is memorized, even the worst player can play it a hundred or a thousand times and jump through it with their eyes closed. But Super Mario Maker's mode completely compensates for this flaw, ensuring that players encounter a fresh, never-before-seen map in every match.</p>
<p>Combining these two modes is like a perpetual motion machine, self-sufficient.
