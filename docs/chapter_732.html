                <h3>Chapter 731: Extreme Violent Aesthetic (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h3>
<p>As the bald muscle man Kratos plunged headfirst into the sea.</p>
<p>A gurgling sound reached Zhang Yi's ears, and at the same time, the screen before him went temporarily dark.</p>
<p>After about three or four seconds, a line of subtitles gradually appeared before him: Three weeks ago, the Aegean Sea.</p>
<p>A clap of thunder roared in his ears, followed by the sound of a storm, and the game screen appeared before Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>At this moment, he was on the deck of a large ship, and simultaneously, the narration from before continued in his ears.</p>
<p>'However, Kratos's past was not so.'</p>
<p>'He was once a warrior who aided the gods!'</p>
<p>Standing on the deck of a dilapidated ship, the muscular strongman named Kratos held two burning Blades of Chaos in his hands.</p>
<p>Despite the stormy weather, the rain falling on the Blades of Chaos could not extinguish their burning flames, and Kratos's bulging muscles looked even more astonishing.</p>
<p>At the same time, as the narration faded, countless longsword-wielding monsters continuously emerged opposite Kratos on the ship's deck.</p>
<p>“A bunch of rabble, let me send you back to the Underworld!” With Kratos's roar, the game officially began.</p>
<p>“It's starting already!?” Zhang Yi was a little caught off guard looking at the system prompt before him.</p>
<p>The corresponding control scheme wasn't very complex; it was basically typical action game gameplay.</p>
<p>However, it also integrated brainwave capture technology, making it more convenient and prominent compared to previous iterations.</p>
<p>Following the prompts, Zhang Yi controlled Kratos, swinging the Blades of Chaos in his hands, continuously harvesting the monsters on the ship.</p>
<p>Almost none of the monsters blocking Kratos's path were capable of putting up a fight.</p>
<p>One by one, they were all torn to shreds by the flaming Blades of Chaos.</p>
<p>Just like monsters in <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em> drop coin-like currency when they die, these monsters also dropped Red Souls-like substances, all absorbed by Kratos into his body, but without needing to be manually picked up like in Sekiro.</p>
<p>Light attacks, heavy attacks, stunning the monsters before him, then watching Kratos smash a monster's head with a punch, or tearing it directly into shreds, or cleaving it into pieces with the Blades of Chaos and tossing them into the sea.</p>
<p>All sorts of execution animations, coupled with the visceral impact of each strike, made Zhang Yi feel quite excited.</p>
<p>Because, it was just too satisfying!</p>
<p>The game was extremely violent, yet it possessed a certain aesthetic beauty.</p>
<p>As Kratos roared, slaughtering each monster, the feeling was simply exhilarating.</p>
<p>“This easy difficulty really is a Hack-and-Slash Game! It’s incredibly satisfying!” Zhang Yi exclaimed, his heart pounding with excitement.</p>
<p>Seeing the deck cleared, Zhang Yi even felt a lingering sense of wanting more.</p>
<p>It could be said that the combat system of <em>God of War</em> was completely different from that of <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>.</p>
<p>After all, while Sekiro leaned towards action, it was still fundamentally a Souls game.</p>
<p>But in <em>God of War</em>, the muscular Kratos fully demonstrated what violence truly meant.</p>
<p>Moreover, the game also had difficulty options; although Zhang Yi knew very well that if he chose the highest God of War difficulty, he would probably be the one being crushed by the minions right now.</p>
<p>But that was just a 'what if'; right now, he could choose the easiest mode.</p>
<p>At this difficulty, the experience was entirely different.</p>
<p>The monsters' health wasn't high, giving Zhang Yi a Hack-and-Slash Game feel.</p>
<p>Secondly, the action in <em>God of War</em> was styled around a violent aesthetic, allowing Kratos to cleanly execute a monster in just two or three hits.</p>
<p>This elevated the game's visual effects to the extreme, and simultaneously pushed the sense of exhilaration to its peak.</p>
<p>Earlier, Zhang Yi had been thinking that if this game was either a Souls game or a satisfying one, he would inform Old Song. After all, Old Song had lost five DOTA matches in a row today, and Zhang Yi guessed his blood pressure was indeed a bit high, so he didn't intend to mess with him like before.</p>
<p>But now, the sudden enjoyment of the Hack-and-Slash Game fun and the visual impact of the violent aesthetic made him completely forget about Old Song.</p>
<p>His mind was filled with anticipation for what would happen next.</p>
<p>As for choosing God of War difficulty?</p>
<p>What did that difficulty have to do with him?</p>
<p>Aren't difficulties there for players to choose from?</p>
<p>Those who liked Hack-and-Slash Games could pick the easiest, and those who wanted to be tormented could choose God of War difficulty.</p>
<p>Anyway, as far as he was concerned, the game <em>God of War</em> only had one difficulty: Easy.</p>
<p>He declared it; even the King of Heaven himself couldn't change it!</p>
<p>Watching Kratos brutally tear apart the enemies blocking his path in the game, Zhang Yi was filled with emotion.</p>
<p>Although Chen Xu had developed many games, he hadn't really made many Hack-and-Slash Games.</p>
<p>Well... it wasn't exactly 'none'; on the lowest difficulty of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, players were like ironmen, killing and blowing things up all the way. Of course, veteran difficulty was a different story.</p>
<p>Most of his other games, like Bloodborne, Monster Hunter, and the Dark Souls series, were games where monsters treated players like grass to be mowed down.</p>
<p>And games like <em>God of War</em>, which allowed for adjustable difficulty, Nebula Games hadn't really released in a long time. Even the recent DOTA had a high-level AI to torment players.</p>
<p>Now, this <em>God of War</em> was truly satisfying Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>The attack moves derived from the two Blades of Chaos — horizontal swings, vertical slashes, upward strikes, aerial attacks, heavy slams — mercilessly slaughtered monsters, along with extremely violent executions, all made Zhang Yi feel utterly exhilarated.</p>
<p>And these were indeed the most essential aspects of <em>God of War</em>. Since the birth of the <em>God of War</em> series, regardless of changes in gameplay elements, the superficial packaging of the entire game had never changed: the exhilarating feeling of Kratos utterly destroying monsters!</p>
<p>Wielding Blades of Chaos, axes, and various other weapons, and slaughtering minions and bosses in all sorts of ways – that was the characteristic of <em>God of War</em>.</p>
<p>In <em>God of War</em>, simply defeating minions was just the beginning.</p>
<p>The real satisfaction for players came with the progression of the game's story, unlocking more combos, and then using various combos to stylishly brutalize monsters.</p>
<p>Additionally, there was how to effectively use the terrain to eliminate minions. For instance, on the highest God of War difficulty, one of the most effective methods for players was 'wall-pinning' – using the terrain to kill minions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, just like the Dark Souls series, the BOSS battles in <em>God of War</em> were also one of its most classic core elements.</p>
<p>When facing massive monsters, Kratos's minuscule size created a stark contrast with the BOSS.</p>
<p>Then, soaring and slamming, he slaughtered them with weapons like the Blades of Chaos, showcasing the ultimate violent aesthetic. The visual impact was incredible; truly, <em>God of War</em> was an absolute feast for Kaiju enthusiasts.</p>
