                <p>Chapter 304: Promotional CG Trailer Goes Live (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>At the center of the meeting room, Chen Xu explained some related conceptual settings.</p>
<p>The settings for attackers and defenders, and the three different gameplay modes: Bomb, Hostage, and Secure Area.</p>
<p>There was also a PVE Terrorist Hunt Mode, including tutorial arrangements for new players.</p>
<p>After all, Rainbow Six Siege itself is a very hardcore game. Some basic content and game philosophy still need to be clearly understood by players.</p>
<p>Of course, considering that the tutorial content might be slightly duller than the normal game, and taking into account players' psychological feedback, the simplest method for tutorials is reward-based onboarding.</p>
<p>Operator cosmetics and weapon skins will serve as the enticing goals for players.</p>
<p>As for the monetization model, compared to RTS games which are more difficult to set up payment systems for, FPS games are much easier to design in this regard.</p>
<p>In addition, concerning the Operators, players will need to unlock them using Renown after entering the game, just like in the previous life. However, for starter Operators, players can freely choose six from the ten available.</p>
<p>Of course, the unlock conditions for Operators are more lenient than in the previous life, avoiding situations where Grind Masters had to spend tens of thousands of Renown to unlock one early on. The initial 10 Operators can be unlocked for 1500 Renown each, while subsequent new Operators will cost 5000 Renown.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this is to help players better understand the game's settings and familiarize themselves with each Operator's skills and abilities. This prevents situations like your Fuze teammate 'thump-thump-thumping' a room, and you, as a teammate, rushing in without a second thought.</p>
<p>The core fun of the game, map mechanics, weapon system attachments, and so on.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>After the Rainbow Six Siege meeting concluded, the team began their respective tasks.</p>
<p>Qin Yi and NetDragon's technical team worked on tuning the feel of firearms and actions for the VR aspect.</p>
<p>They also experimented with subsequent physical effects, as physical feedback is extremely important in Rainbow Six Siege. This is because most of the scenes and walls within rooms can be destroyed.</p>
<p>Demolition... no, fortification and breaching walls and wooden panels to open up an attack route is a core gameplay mechanic of the game itself.</p>
<p>As for the maps, the focus was on various routes and planning destructible environments. Chen Xu would sketch out simple designs, and Ruan Ningxue's team would produce the art assets. Yang Xin was in charge of the game's background story.</p>
<p>After the game meeting, the entire team entered a highly efficient mode of operation.</p>
<p>Meng Zuo, who had just attended the meeting, was still a bit bewildered. He looked at Lin Rou, Chen Xu's assistant, still somewhat disoriented as they left the meeting room.</p>
<p>He paused, then finally spoke to Lin Rou: “So... this is how you Nebula Games develop games!?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Teacher Meng, is something wrong? Isn't this just how game development is?” Lin Rou asked, a little puzzled.</p>
<p>“Nothing, you go on,” Meng Zuo was momentarily speechless. Is that how game development is? What's wrong with it?</p>
<p>That's what's so damn wrong!</p>
<p>There was no confusion, no arguments, and the gameplay was incredibly complete; it seemed only the subsequent data content needed to be finalized. While data isn't simple, it's not impossibly hard either, because the game's mechanism and architecture are sound, and Numerical Design just needs continuous adjustment.</p>
<p>He could only say it was indeed Chen Xu. At this moment, Meng Zuo couldn't help but sigh with emotion. He had been developing games for so long, but this was truly the first time he had seen such a situation.</p>
<p>As he was sighing, Chen Xu, who had just finished explaining some matters to Qin Yi and the others, turned around and found him.</p>
<p>“Teacher Meng, I may have some things to trouble NetDragon with next,” Chen Xu said with a smile, looking at Meng Zuo.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Meng Zuo asked, snapping back to attention.</p>
<p>“The version for regular players won't be much of an issue, but for the military version, we'll need a specialized consultant to make the game's presentation even more realistic,” Chen Xu told Meng Zuo.</p>
<p>Nebula Games' current capabilities could naturally find such a consultant. But with NetDragon having ready-made labor, it would be a waste not to use them.</p>
<p>“That's not a problem, NetDragon has specialized consultants for this,” Meng Zuo nodded in agreement. It wasn't just NetDragon; major FPS game developers both domestically and internationally generally hire professional consultants.</p>
<p>Upon receiving Chen Xu's request, NetDragon's actions were very swift. There was no need for face-to-face discussions; video communication sufficed. Based on discussions with the relevant consultants, Chen Xu also made some modifications and weakenings to the in-game skills to achieve a more realistic presentation in the military version.</p>
<p>Aside from Fuze's 'thump-thump-thump', take Ash's breaching round as an example: in reality, such weapons rarely see use, as they can easily cause accidental injury to attacking personnel and hostages, making the situation even more chaotic. There's also Pulse's heartbeat sensor; it exists in reality but cannot pinpoint exact locations. So, Chen Xu also made some modifications to these elements to make them more closely align with reality.</p>
<p>As for making it completely identical to reality, that's quite difficult to achieve. After all, at its core, it's still a game. So, it still needs to revolve around the original Rainbow Six Siege format. However, on details and perspectives, the consultants provided a great many suggestions, which saved Chen Xu a lot of effort.</p>
<p>Thus, under Chen Xu's leadership, the development progress of Rainbow Six Siege was smooth sailing.</p>
<p>Of course, facing countless players filled with eager anticipation for the game, Chen Xu and NetDragon felt they couldn't leave these players waiting anxiously, knowing nothing but a codename: R6.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, a Rainbow Six Siege promotional CG trailer, jointly created by Nebula Games and NetDragon, was officially released. This sent countless players into cheers.</p>
<p>“Finally, new news!”</p>
<p>“'Rainbow Six Siege' is such a strange game name!”</p>
<p>“It’s an anti-terrorism game!?”</p>
<p>“Holy crap, it feels a bit different. The style seems completely unlike previous anti-terrorism games!”</p>
<p>“This seems to be Nebula Games' first VR game!”</p>
<p>“Nonsense! Aren't the Bow and Heavy Bowgun in Monster Hunter: World shooting games? Have you forgotten Mirror (Game)? Who was with you shooting through those countless dark nights?”</p>
<p>“Damn! You guys are really taking this down a raunchy road, huh?!”</p>
<p>“The jokes are practically hitting me in the face!”</p>
<p>“Enough nonsense, I'm more curious about what Chen Xu can do with an anti-terrorism themed game, as this theme has been done quite a bit!”</p>
<p>Filled with questions, countless players clicked on the CG video.</p>
