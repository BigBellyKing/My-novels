<p>Chapter 289: Bewildering Players and Competitors (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>On Shark TV, the bullet comments in Chen Xu's live streaming room had completely exploded. Even with a restricted posting time, they were so dense it was impossible to see clearly.</p>
<p>All the players looked bewildered. They had imagined many scenarios before, but this one truly had not crossed their minds. It felt like Chen Xu was toying with the professional players!</p>
<p>Especially players who had watched SooB's matches before, they simply couldn't believe that the one playing against Chen Xu was SooB. If it weren't for the Wolf Rider's still flashy positioning, they would have definitely thought this was a 500-point Warcraft player; otherwise, how could Chen Xu have dominated him like this?</p>
<p>'This can't be match-fixing, right!? It feels like SooB just kept playing and then lost!?'</p>
<p>'Bro, anyone with a bit of intelligence wouldn't say things like match-fixing. Let's skip the conspiracy theories for now, Mr. Chen's play was actually quite masterful.'</p>
<p>'Seriously, I still don't understand how SooB lost! It felt like he was just harassed by the Beastmaster in the early game, and then it was over.'</p>
<p>'Yeah, Mr. Chen had too much money. On the main stage just now, I wasn't paying attention to the minimap. I saw SooB wipe out the first wave of Huntresses, then he directly tore apart the main base, and I thought he was going to win.'</p>
<p>'Superpower tactics! Damn it, Mr. Chen secretly opened a recharge channel for himself! No wonder I went from an initial score of 500 to 100. It made me buy a new account, turns out I didn't have the recharge channel!'</p>
<p>'Honestly, this tactic feels like it has something. In the early game, he used the Night Elf's Ancient of War to quickly creep large neutral camps and then rapidly expand. And Mr. Chen only used a single hero from start to finish!'</p>
<p>'Huntresses are naturally unarmored units; only after upgrading tech for their units can they fight Wolf Riders and Orc Grunts head-on.'</p>
<p>'Can the Night Elf race fight the Orc race like this? So, is the balance really not an issue?'</p>
<p>'Logically speaking, shouldn't the Beastmaster be considered Orc? So, in the end, didn't the Orc race still win?'</p>
<p>'Damn it, I'm speechless!'</p>
<p>Not only were players having a heated discussion, but a group of professional players participating in the competition were also discussing it in an RTS group chat.</p>
