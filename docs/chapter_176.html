                <p>Chapter 275: Trial Version Experience Launched (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>After watching the CG animation released by Chen Xu, both players and designers in the gaming industry were bewildered.</p>
<p>Ordinary players didn't feel much beyond being amazed that an RTS game's CG promotional video could be made so well!</p>
<p>It was significantly better than previous games like <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> and <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>A visible improvement!</p>
<p>But for the knowledgeable industry insiders, what was this minute-long video in their eyes?</p>
<p>These were all stacks of red banknotes!</p>
<p>"I'm uncultured, 'holy crap' is all I need to say; this CG is absolutely incredible!"</p>
<p>"Yeah! If Chen Xu hadn't said before that <em>WarCraft</em> is an RTS game, I totally wouldn't have believed it!"</p>
<p>"Are they seriously going to make <em>WarCraft</em>'s entire story with CGs of this quality?"</p>
<p>"They couldn't, right? How much would that cost?"</p>
<p>"Didn't Chen Xu say?"</p>
<p>"Holy crap, if that's really the case, does that mean all that massive amount of money was invested purely into CG animation?"</p>
<p>"No way? Nebula Games is a game company, not an animation studio. Is an RTS game really worth such a huge investment?"</p>
<p>"For other companies, I'd say it's impossible, but this is Nebula Games we're talking about! Look at the Nebula Games Platform; could you have imagined someone doing this before?"</p>
<p>"Then that's truly incredible!"</p>
<p>"Now I'm quite curious about the expressions on the designers at Hero Entertainment. Before, <em>Human Wars</em> had a graphical remaster and a major new version update, clearly targeting <em>WarCraft</em>. Now, at the very least, this CG must have utterly surpassed <em>Human Wars</em>."</p>
<p>Many designers and players in the industry discussed the CG promotion released by Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, inside Hero Entertainment, Zhou Qi also looked utterly flabbergasted.</p>
<p>Because the presentation of this CG was simply too exceptional.</p>
<p>This was clearly just brute-forcing it with money!</p>
<p>Could their Hero Entertainment do it?</p>
<p>Absolutely!</p>
<p>After all, this kind of thing relies on money.</p>
<p>But he was certain that a proposal for a graphical remaster could pass.</p>
<p>However, wanting to create CGs of this caliber was basically an impossible task.</p>
<p>Was Chen Xu really pouring seven hundred million into an RTS game?</p>
<p>And most of it was invested in CG production?</p>
<p>Originally, he hadn't believed Nebula Games' boasts about 'redefining RTS' and 'costing 700 million'.</p>
<p>After all, who couldn't boast in promotion?</p>
<p>Like when <em>Human Wars</em> launched previously, he almost claimed it was the strongest RTS game in the galaxy, bar none.</p>
<p>Just like those movies that claimed a production cost of two hundred million, but did they really spend that much?</p>
<p>Not really!</p>
<p>But it had to be said, having money was truly great.</p>
<p>Watching the video on Chen Xu's official Weibo account, Zhou Qi felt a little envious.</p>
<p>Of course, these thoughts were fleeting, and Zhou Qi quickly calmed down.</p>
<p>After all, what good was a CG, no matter how well made?</p>
<p>This was a game, not a movie or an animation.</p>
<p>As an RTS game, it still had to be judged by its gameplay!</p>
<p>So what if your CG was amazing, your graphics were amazing? Were these useful for an RTS game?</p>
<p>Moreover, Chen Xu had never been involved in the RTS genre before. He simply didn't believe that <em>WarCraft</em> could completely blow him away!</p>
<p>Many designers and players shared Zhou Qi's opinion.</p>
<p>Many people were immediately stunned by <em>WarCraft</em>'s CG.</p>
<p>However, they soon shifted their attention to the game's content.</p>
<p>In various RTS communities and forums, many players who enjoyed this genre were also discussing it.</p>
<p>"Did you guys follow the news about <em>WarCraft</em>?"</p>
<p>"Of course! That CG was absolutely incredible, I just wonder what the actual game quality will be like."</p>
<p>"I'm sure it won't be bad. After all, Chen Xu made <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, <em>Minecraft</em>, and <em>Dark Souls</em> before."</p>
<p>"But RTS is different!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, RTS games are different from other genres. Graphics and CGs are just icing on the cake; the core is still gameplay and balance."</p>
<p>"Who cares, isn't there a free trial experience available anyway? Just try it out for ourselves and we'll know, right?"</p>
<p>"That's true."</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>Along with various discussions among players and industry designers, time slowly arrived at November 11th.</p>
<p>The trial version of <em>WarCraft</em> had already opened its download channels in advance, allowing players to download it early and then enter the game to play as soon as it unlocked.</p>
<p>As for the content of the trial version, it was similar to the previous <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>.</p>
<p>This was because Chen Xu had directly combined the <em>Reign of Chaos</em> and <em>The Frozen Throne</em> from his previous life into a single version.</p>
<p>So, in terms of story, players could fully experience the content of the first chapter, in addition to the prologue.</p>
<p>Which was the story of the disaster that befell the Kingdom of Lordaeron.</p>
<p>However, the online multiplayer battle mode was temporarily in an locked state.</p>
<p>Besides this, during this period, Chen Xu also successively announced some new information about <em>WarCraft</em>.</p>
<p>First was the official launch date, which this time was different compared to <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>.</p>
<p>It was much earlier, with the official version launching on November 15th.</p>
<p>As for the price, the domestic price was 198 Yuan, while the overseas price was 39.9 dollars.</p>
<p>Like before, there was a Steelbook Collector's Edition, priced at 899 Yuan domestically and 159.9 dollars overseas. Compared to the standard digital version, the Collector's Edition included a Blu-ray DVD containing all CGs, a Collector's Edition Frostmourne figure, an art book album, and explanations of relevant races, characters, and worldview background, so it could be said to contain quite a lot of content.</p>
<p>However, simply speaking about the pricing of the digital version, it was relatively low compared to some traditional action, RPG, and FPS blockbusters, but in the RTS genre, it was considered a relatively high standard.</p>
<p>"This price is a bit expensive!"</p>
<p>"Not expensive at all. Look at Chen Xu's previous games; their pricing usually caters to domestic players, and the quality is undeniable. This time, <em>WarCraft</em>'s price is considerably higher than similar RTS games, which actually makes me more excited!"</p>
<p>"Exactly, exactly. Before, Chen Xu's games were cheaper than similar types, and their quality was excellent. This time, Nebula Games surprisingly set such a high price, so I think it must be worth the money!"</p>
<p>"One digital version, one collector's edition, no explanation needed!"</p>
<p>"You're awesome, bro, but I'll still download the free trial first to see what the quality is like before I decide."</p>
<p>"Exactly. Anyway, there are still 4 days between the official launch and the trial period. If it's to my taste, I'll just buy it directly then."</p>
<p>Because the strategy of launching a free trial version first was adopted, many players had no concerns whatsoever and eagerly downloaded it, curious to see what the game, with its incredibly impressive CG, was actually like.</p>
