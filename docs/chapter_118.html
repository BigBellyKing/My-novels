                <p>Chapter 217: Quite Grim (Please subscribe, monthly votes)</p>
<p>Just as Wang Han was looking at her own construction, feeling a little bewildered by life.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, who was beside her, finally spoke.</p>
<p>"Don't be discouraged, at least it resembles a house. If I'm not mistaken, you must have referenced the design of the ancient Roman Pantheon when you built it."</p>
<p>"With its eight massive columns on the portico and its gilded dome, great artists and emperors like Raphael and Victor Emmanuel II are buried there. It's also rumored that gods and heroes such as the God of War and Julius Caesar are interred within."</p>
<p>Zhang Yi remarked with emotion, looking at the building in the game.</p>
<p>"You could tell?" Wang Han was a bit confused hearing Zhang Yi's words.</p>
<p>Was she referencing the Pantheon? She didn't even know it herself!</p>
<p>And what the Pantheon looked like, she'd never seen.</p>
<p>"I didn't 'tell,' I guessed. After all, your building aligns perfectly with the concept of the Pantheon," Zhang Yi said.</p>
<p>"Are you saying I have a talent for this?" Wang Han still didn't quite grasp Zhang Yi's meaning.</p>
<p>"No, I'm saying your house, like the Pantheon, is quite grim. After all, a house is only a temporary abode; a small box is one's eternal home. Whether it's the Pantheon or a black box, they both lead to the same destination."</p>
<p>"And it's 'uncanny workmanship.' While the 'god' part isn't visible yet, the 'uncanny/ghostly' part is perfectly fitting. Keep it up, you still have room for improvement." A wide smile filled Zhang Yi's face.</p>
<p>Hearing Zhang Yi's words, if reality were a manga, a row of black lines would surely appear above Wang Han's head, and a crow with six dots would fly past.</p>
<p>She glanced at the nondescript house she'd built on the screen, then looked at Zhang Yi, who was smiling like a sunflower in front of her. Finally, Wang Han uttered the classic line: "If you can do it, you go do it!"</p>
<p>He had watched for quite a while and clearly felt that building a house was indeed not a simple task, but having been challenged to this extent, Zhang Yi naturally accepted.</p>
<p>So, ten minutes later, Wang Han's joyful laughter echoed from inside the room.</p>
<p>"Haha, I thought you could build something amazing! We're both six of one, half a dozen of the other; the pot calling the kettle black!"</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhang Yi's building methods were exactly like her own, Wang Han finally couldn't help but burst into cheerful laughter.</p>
<p>She thought he was so awesome! But in the end, it was just this?</p>
<p>"Ahem, building houses is just one way to play 'Minecraft.' Enough of that, I'll start a new world seed, and we can play Survival Mode together. We should call Old Song and the others too." Looking at the house, which resembled a giant refrigerator, Zhang Yi lightly coughed twice and changed the subject.</p>
<p>In fact, this is a common experience for many players who are new to 'Minecraft.'</p>
<p>Before buying it, they might not have known exactly how 'Minecraft' was played.</p>
<p>But one thing everyone knew was that in this game, you could build houses just like with building blocks.</p>
<p>So, after most players entered the game, whether in Survival Mode or Creative Mode, they didn't go exploring the outside world.</p>
<p>Instead, they fully immersed themselves in their grand architectural endeavors.</p>
<p>But soon these players discovered a very important problem.</p>
<p>What they built looked nothing like what they imagined.</p>
<p>Simply put, it was: Brain: "I understand! So that's how it works!"</p>
<p>Hands: "Brain, what did you just say?"</p>
<p>The houses they actually built always had a difference of about a billion tiny bits compared to what they imagined.</p>
<p>Although the game had just launched, related community forums were already filled with all sorts of pictures—all players' complaints about their constructions.</p>
<p>Before building, they had grand ambitions, but after finishing, each one realized, "Holy moly, this is just a dark room matchbox!"</p>
<p>Initially, some players thought it might be due to insufficient materials in Survival Mode. But then they switched to Creative Mode and found that the houses they built were still just as ugly as ever.</p>
<p>While waiting for Song Ren, Wang Yifan, and Joey, Wang Han and Zhang Yi were also browsing the forum on their phones.</p>
<p>Seeing those pictures, both of them chuckled with relief.</p>
<p>Because among these house-building players, most were like the two of them, constructing perfectly square, boxy houses.</p>
<p>At the same time, many players ran out of materials halfway through their builds. So they just used whatever was locally available, regardless of whether dirt and wood matched, simply digging and filling.</p>
<p>Of course, there were also some players whose methods were very familiar to Wang Han: home is wherever you are.</p>
<p>During the day, they would chop trees, mine, and gather various materials. When night fell, they would simply lower their heads, take out their pickaxe, and start digging.</p>
<p>They'd dig a hole, then seal off the top.</p>
<p>However, Wang Han noticed that these people were a bit more professional than her.</p>
<p>Because they would make a bed and a torch.</p>
<p>This way, they could quickly get through the night, and it wouldn't be so dark that they couldn't see.</p>
<p>"Building houses in this game is so hard!"</p>
<p>"Right! That trailer before wasn't a deceptive trailer, was it?!"</p>
<p>Zhang Yi and Wang Han chatted, looking at other players' similar painful experiences online.</p>
<p>"No, it's not. Building houses is actually quite simple; you just need a concept." Just as Zhang Yi and Wang Han were chatting, Song Ren entered the voice channel.</p>
<p>As he spoke, he also shared a game screenshot in the voice channel.</p>
<p>A very beautiful small wooden two-story house appeared before everyone.</p>
<p>The entire second floor was suspended in the air, which, by real-world theories, would definitely be a high-risk structure.</p>
<p>It was only supported by a few pillars, but in the game, that clearly wasn't an issue.</p>
<p>Besides the main house on the first floor, surrounding the central pillar was a spiral staircase made of various blocks leading to the second floor, along with a fenced yard. </p>
<p>Looking at it from afar, it was simply gorgeous.</p>
<p>"Holy crap! Old Song, this isn't an image you found online, is it?"</p>
<p>Seeing this house, Zhang Yi and Wang Han's eyes widened.</p>
<p>If it was just a first impression, it wouldn't be much, just "it's alright."</p>
<p>But the key was that they had both experienced their own "dark room matchboxes" earlier. Compared to that, this was the difference between a bright moon and a firefly!</p>
<p>"Old Song is amazing!"</p>
<p>"My goodness, Old Song, how did you build this house?"</p>
<p>At this moment, Joey and Wang Yifan also joined the call. Seeing the screenshot Song Ren had shared, they too were astonished.</p>
<p>Clearly, they had all played 'Minecraft' before and knew the difficulty of building houses.</p>
<p>"It's very simple! Isn't building just placing materials on the ground? How else would you build?" Song Ren, on the other end of the computer, listened to their praises, a wide smile on his face, speaking rather arrogantly.</p>
<p>Of course, he had his own special trick: building houses in 'Minecraft' was like building with block models.</p>
<p>So, he had previously found some suitable house designs, sketched them out, and then, according to their features, divided them into block-like forms.</p>
<p>He didn't need to consider whether the area could truly be divided into perfect blocks; it just needed to roughly resemble the design.</p>
<p>After all, this was for a game, not reality.</p>
<p>Then, for each section, he just needed to know how many blocks were needed, whether to place them horizontally or vertically, and assemble them like a puzzle according to the template. That was it.</p>
<p>It was just a bit troublesome. To smoothly pull off this show-off, he had specifically prepared for it the day before the game launched.</p>
<p>However, the next moment, his smile froze.</p>
<p>"Old Song, since you're so amazing at building houses, it seems the heavy responsibility of building the base can only be entrusted to you!" Zhang Yi's voice came through the voice channel.</p>
<p>"Exactly!"</p>
<p>"Old Song is amazing!"</p>
<p>"Chief Architect: Old Song!"</p>
<p>The other three echoed in agreement.</p>
<p>Hearing their words, Song Ren hesitated to speak.</p>
