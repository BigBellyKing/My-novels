                <p>Chapter 776: Do Unlucky Players Not Deserve a Game Experience?!</p>
<p>As the story continuously progressed, Zhang Yi was also filled with emotion.</p>
<p>Although the story didn't have any unexpected high-energy moments, the game's cinematography and presentation effects were quite remarkable. More importantly, Zhang Yi was completely amazed by the maps in the game.</p>
<p>When he first arrived at Gormott Province, he felt it wasn't a traditional RPG at all, because the map was simply too vast. Just the Gormott Province area alone, he even felt it was more expansive than a typical open-world game.</p>
<p>Even more importantly, in the game "Xenoblade Chronicles," it wasn't just about the wide maps; he also discovered numerous outstanding details. Even powerful carnivorous monsters could be seen hunting and eating weaker animals. Although the various characters in the game didn't have their own self-scheduled routines like in open-world games, the corresponding side quests and dialogue lines effectively showcased the local customs and traditions to players.</p>
<p>Of course, even more crucial was that the entire map was three-dimensional. Taking the Titan Battleship where he went to rescue Nia as an example, the enormous battleship had roads extending in all directions, with various connecting paths. As he progressed, he could unlock various shortcuts, and through these shortcuts, he could quickly travel between two locations. This reminded Zhang Yi of Souls series games like "Dark Souls" and "Bloodborne."</p>
<p>If there had to be a difference, it was probably that Mr. Chen in "Xenoblade Chronicles" was simply too benevolent. Because in the game, different areas could be directly teleported to. Even if shortcuts weren't unlocked, once a location was reached, players didn't actually have to run much. However, Gormott Province was different; many areas were vertically interconnected, and finding small paths could save a lot of time.</p>
<p>It was these shortcuts, along with some treasure chests, that sparked Zhang Yi's idea to open Core Crystals. Because in the game, each Blade has its own inherent Talent Skills. These are divided into two parts: Combat and Field. Combat, as the name suggests, refers to Talent Skills used in battle, while Field Skills are used to solve puzzles and meet prerequisites on the map. For example, to open a chest, you need to possess 'Level 1 Fire Element' and 'Level 1 Earth Element.' In this case, Rex, with only Pyra as a Blade, couldn't open it until Tora joined and his initial Poppi α had the Earth element, allowing the treasure chest to be opened.</p>
<p>When different Blades are equipped, their Field Skills can also stack. Therefore, to unlock some shortcuts or collection points on the map, you need a sufficient variety of Blades. And with only a few Blades, Zhang Yi found that his damage output was a bit "scratchy." Although Tora had already joined, he had pretty much figured out the roles of each character in the game. The specific playstyle mainly depended on the Blades each character carried, but from the current story's arrangement, it was clearly the standard Warrior, Mage, and Priest setup. Rex was the damage dealer, Nia was the healer, and Tora was the tank.</p>
<p>“Might as well open them sooner or later, and there are two empty slots anyway,” Zhang Yi thought, controlling Rex to enter the Blade Bonding interface. Looking at the Core Crystals in his inventory, Zhang Yi felt a subtle sensation at that moment. It reminded him of the feeling of opening Immortals when playing "DOTA," and the joy of looting corpses in "World of Warcraft."</p>
<p>“Got one?! One-shot success?!” Listening to the stirring music, the Core Crystal in Rex’s hand burst into dazzling light, and Zhang Yi’s heart instantly swelled with excitement. However, in the next second, his brow furrowed.</p>
<p>Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding! </p>
<p>Accompanied by a pleasant tune, a 'Black Uncle' holding a battle axe appeared before him. However, Zhang Yi’s furrowed brow soon relaxed a little. Gacha pulls and loot boxes, where's the logic in getting an SSR right from the start? Thinking about it, it was quite normal.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi chuckled and continued tapping the Core Crystals. A flash of light, and a 'Black Sister' appeared. Then he kept opening them. A 'Black Doggy,' a tall 'Black Uncle,' a 'Black Uncle' wearing a hat, a 'Black Sister' wearing a hat, and a 'Black Doggy' wearing a hat. Looking at the last Rare Core that was opened, Zhang Yi fell into a silence. So many black Blades, what was this implying? What about all the cool and beautiful Blades that were promised? Why hadn't he seen a single one?! Was this false advertising?!</p>
<p>While Zhang Yi was silent, a voice came through the voice channel. “Xiao Zhang, Old Song, what Blades did you guys get from your Core Crystals? I drew a mecha girl Blade called KOS-MOS Re, she’s so cool! And her damage is super high too!” Wang Han’s voice in the voice channel was extremely joyful.</p>
<p>Listening to Wang Han, Zhang Yi frowned, glanced at the ‘Black Uncles’ in his inventory, remained silent for a moment, then spoke: “I just got to the town in Gormott Province. I’ve been exploring until now, and I have to say, 'Xenoblade Chronicles' is absolutely amazing! The art and map design are incredible!!” As he spoke, Zhang Yi silently clicked back to the main menu screen and chose to restart the game. Although it was a single-player game, and gacha was just a game feature, there was no such thing as a "ruined account." But as the saying goes, some things are only bad when compared. On his side, he got a bunch of 'Black Uncles' early in the first playthrough, while others got various SRs and SSRs. The game experience and fun from this first playthrough were totally unequal, wasn’t it?!</p>
<p>Less than ten seconds after Zhang Yi finished speaking, Song Ren's voice also came through: “Old Zhang, great minds think alike! I was also captivated by the scenery of Gormott Province, it's just that gorilla at the entrance is a bit annoying.”</p>
<p>Hearing Old Song's voice, Zhang Yi's stiff expression softened, and a smile appeared at the corner of his mouth, because he realized something: he wasn't the only one with bad luck. “Yeah! That gorilla killed me too! I'm definitely going to brutally kill him later!” Zhang Yi continued Song Ren’s thought, then silently sent Song Ren a text message: 'This game is a bit malicious towards unlucky players!'</p>
<p>Just one second later, Old Song’s message came through, very concise and clear: +1!</p>
<p>There were many players like Zhang Yi and Old Song, and while the game did have a pity system, it required players to open a certain number of Core Crystals to trigger the guaranteed pull mechanism, and the guaranteed Blades were all from a set template. Powerful Blades like KOS-MOS Re and Poppi VIII, which Chen Xu added to the pool, were clearly not among them. Thus, for countless unlucky players, opening Core Crystals in the early game truly felt like an endless torrent of malice.</p>
<p>Looking at the forum communities and Tieba, other players happily showed off their SSR Blades, while they themselves looked at the group of 'Black Uncles,' 'Black Sisters,' and 'Black Doggies' in their inventory, besides Pyra, and each shed sad tears. Do unlucky players not deserve a game experience?!</p>
