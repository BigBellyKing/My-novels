                <p>Chapter 22: Both Reputation and Sales Flourish</p>
<p>As more and more players got their hands on <em>Undertale</em>, the game's overall data soared.</p>
<p>Moreover, <em>Undertale</em> had already landed on several recommendation lists on various third-party game platforms.</p>
<p>Although Chen Xu disliked the channels in this Parallel World as much as he did in his previous life, for now, releasing <em>Undertale</em> on these game platforms was beneficial and harmless. Only a fool would refuse to make money.</p>
<p>Even with a mind to change the landscape of the gaming industry, one point was unavoidable: capital.</p>
<p>Thus, Chen Xu chose a few third-party game platforms that were willing to compromise.</p>
<p>Although Chen Xu was a newcomer in the gaming industry, he was different from ordinary Game Designers.</p>
<p>Firstly, <em>Mirror (Game)</em> provided a baseline sales performance. Secondly, Zhong Mei's hype generated organic traffic for <em>Undertale</em>. Therefore, some third-party channels were willing to make concessions on the revenue-sharing ratio. This was one of the reasons Chen Xu agreed to release the game on their platforms.</p>
<p>And from the current results, <em>Undertale</em>'s sales growth was quite impressive.</p>
<p>While Chen Xu was monitoring <em>Undertale</em>'s sales, many Game Designers in the independent game circle were also shaken by <em>Undertale</em>.</p>
<p>In a small group chat for independent Game Designers.</p>
<p>"Holy crap, holy crap, holy crap! I can only use three 'holy craps' to describe <em>Undertale</em>! Before, I thought Zhong Mei was right, what good game could this Chen Xu make? But now, all I can say is, it's amazing!"</p>
<p>"What's going on? Is it that exaggerated? Isn't this rating bought?"</p>
<p>"What are you thinking? How could it be bought? Forget about third parties, try buying one on the official platform and see."</p>
<p>"Exactly, stop talking nonsense. Boosted? Try boosting sales on the official platform, let's see! Aren't you afraid of getting your Game Designer title revoked and being blacklisted?"</p>
<p>"I suggest anyone who hasn't played it to go play it. I was truly blown away; 'incredible' is the only word to describe it!"</p>
<p>"To be honest, my new game was originally planned for release next week, but now I'll probably have to polish it for a while longer."</p>
<p>"Is it really that exaggerated?"</p>
<p>"How do I put it? On the surface, it looks like an ordinary game, but there are several different endings. The first playthrough is shocking, the second (Pacifist Ending) is heartwarming, and the third (Genocide Ending) brought me to tears."</p>
<p>"Before, when they said <em>Mirror (Game)</em> changed the gentleman's game industry, I just smiled. But <em>Undertale</em>, I think it might just start a wave of enthusiasm for this kind of game mode!"</p>
<p>"Isn't that an overstatement? Isn't this establishing a new school of thought?"</p>
<p>"Establishing a new school of thought might be too much, but promoting it greatly? Absolutely. And I believe that in the future, when this type of game is mentioned, <em>Undertale</em> will definitely be an undeniable name."</p>
<p>Amidst everyone's discussion, someone suddenly sent a public account article push in the group.</p>
<p>"Stop talking, check Chen Xu's official Weibo account!"</p>
<p>"Holy crap! Is this seriously a human being?"</p>
<p>"Both sales and reputation flourishing!?"</p>
<p>"It's only been 3 days and sales have already surpassed 100,000? That's too exaggerated!"</p>
<p>Everyone clicked in to see, and it was indeed Chen Xu's official Weibo account.</p>
<p>It was a very simple thank you message on his official Weibo account, still related to <em>Undertale</em>.</p>
<p>"Thank you to all players for your support. <em>Undertale</em> sales have exceeded 100,000, but we believe this is not the end!"</p>
<p>Chen Xu didn't hide these figures.</p>
<p>On one hand, it wasn't a big secret; third-party research agencies would likely announce it in a few days, and while there might be discrepancies with the actual figures, they wouldn't be far off. Secondly, it was for publicity. With such good word-of-mouth, it was the perfect time to add fuel to the fire.</p>
<p>Disclosing the data was clearly an excellent way to spark discussion.</p>
<p>As Chen Xu revealed the sales figures, it wasn't just Game Designers who were shocked. Various major media outlets following the story were equally stunned.</p>
<p>An obscure small game, coupled with a designer who previously developed gentleman's games, and who had also had a public spat with another Game Designer before.</p>
<p>The topic itself had immense buzz.</p>
<p>Moreover, <em>Undertale</em>'s data performance was quite explosive.</p>
<p>Before this, some gaming media outlets thought <em>Undertale</em> was not worth mentioning, but now, it was as if their faces had been thoroughly slapped.</p>
<p>As for ordinary players who had played the game, there was only one feeling: <em>Undertale</em>'s ratings and achievements were truly well-deserved.</p>
<p>The memorable characters in the game, especially the final ending, were truly astounding.</p>
<p>Before playing this game, no player could have imagined that a game could be made this way!</p>
<p>All players had a feeling that they were witnessing history.</p>
<p>This <em>Undertale</em> might leave a brilliant mark in the history of independent games.</p>
<p>At the same time, other media outlets also rushed to publish news.</p>
<h3><em>Sales Exceed 100,000 in 3 Days! Rating as High as 9.9!</em></h3>
<h3><em>An Indie Game Masterpiece, a Must-Play for Gamers!</em></h3>
<h3><em>A Special RPG That Overturns Players' Perceptions of RPGs!</em></h3>
<h3><em>Player: 'I've Been Played by This Game!'</em></h3>
<h3><em>An Incredible Game! Incredible Achievements!</em></h3>
<h3><em>The First Playthrough Brings Shock, the Second Brings Warmth, the Third Brings Pain, and the Fourth Brings Reflection.</em></h3>
<p>Undoubtedly, <em>Undertale</em> was a hit, initially with positive reviews from media and players.</p>
<p>Then it spread within Game Designer circles because <em>Undertale</em>'s settings were completely different from other games before it.</p>
<p>Not only in terms of plot but also in its presentation.</p>
<p>For example, Flowey in the game seemed to be conversing with the player through the screen.</p>
<p>Such a design made all Game Designers feel as if a skylight had been opened.</p>
<p>To be honest, the <em>Undertale</em> of his previous life wasn't a game with a very strong META element.</p>
<p>Because apart from the beginning and end, the interruptions in between were essentially about various characters in the game, such as Sans, Papyrus, and Undyne.</p>
<p>Likewise, this also made <em>Undertale</em> more immersive than typical META games.</p>
<p>Players would only experience an extremely strong sense of shock when the secret of the game's ending was revealed.</p>
<p>And after each ending, there was also a hidden philosophical reflection and introspection.</p>
<p>This was also the biggest characteristic of META games.</p>
<p>Purely in terms of META elements, <em>Undertale</em> actually couldn't compare to <em>The Stanley Parable</em> or <em>Pony Island</em>.</p>
<p>However, in this Parallel World, the concept of META games hadn't even truly germinated.</p>
<p><em>Undertale</em>'s inherent META design, combined with its plot, brought an impact to players that was undoubtedly countless times stronger than in his previous life.</p>
<p>Especially as live streaming platforms and video platforms showcased some of <em>Undertale</em>'s content to players, it further fueled the fire, making it burn even brighter.</p>
