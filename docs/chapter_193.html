                <h3>Chapter 293: We Must Talk Science, Don't Believe in Superstition (5th update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h3>
<p>Jiedong in the group chat was feeling a bit helpless.</p>
<p>Actually, that Ice-Armored Spider from earlier, while quite disgusting, now that he thought back, if he had truly played well, he wasn't without a chance. It was just that at the time, for some unknown reason, seeing this completely new tactic stunned him a bit, directly making his controls feel slightly rustier than usual. In the end, he lost that crucial skirmish.</p>
<p>Jiedong: “But Chen Xu really has something. I’ve never seen such a strong designer.”</p>
<p>Satellite: “He’s indeed amazing, but I feel like it might have been better if he didn’t make Wolf Riders and Wind Riders.”</p>
<p>Jiedong: “Now it’s all hindsight. In your game, I even said it would have been better for you to go with a Far Seer!”</p>
<p>Shu Ben: “Honestly, the three of us weren’t too disgraced. We personally verified that Orcs are not the flavor of the month.”</p>
<p>The others in the group chat watched the three talking, all muttering to themselves.</p>
<p>How is this not the “flavor of the month”? From the three games just played, it felt like the Orcs were practically the “underpowered version”!</p>
<p>“Honestly, Guashen should be up for the last game tonight, right?” someone in the group chat said.</p>
<p>“That’s right, the glory of our Orcs cannot fall here!” Shu Ben fanned the flames.</p>
<p>“Guashen! Guashen! Guashen!” Satellite also sent messages in the group.</p>
<p>Mainly because this group of pro gamers had been beaten by a Game Designer, they genuinely felt a bit disgraced.</p>
<p>The key was that everyone felt quite frustrated, because during the games, they all felt their own micro-management was actually better than Chen Xu’s. But the crucial point was that they hadn't even reached the stage where pure micro-management was truly tested. Most of the time, they were just crushed directly in the early game.</p>
<p>And in that crushing stage, facing these novel tactics for the first time, none of them knew how to counter them. By the time they roughly had an idea, they had essentially missed a golden opportunity and entered a disadvantageous stage.</p>
<p>If they were to play against Chen Xu’s previous tactics again, they all felt they could win. But they didn’t have the face for that.</p>
<p>Now, everyone’s attention turned to Guadi.</p>
<p>Moreover, many people also wanted to see how Guadi would counter Chen Xu’s tactics, which would serve as a good reference.</p>
<p>“You guys!” Guadi in the group chat was speechless, but at the same time, he felt a little itching to play.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>As for the official live streaming room, it was even more lively.</p>
<p>Countless bullet comments filled the screen, lively as a festival.</p>
<p>And Sun Yixie at the commentary desk wanted to laugh but was holding it in; his expression was priceless.</p>
<p>“What the heck, this isn’t scientific!” Huang Donglai at this moment began to doubt himself. Was he really cursed?</p>
<p>Whoever he rooted for, died!? But he was clearly analyzing things very scientifically and rationally! Why was this happening!?</p>
<p>“Brother Huang, the bullet comments are all saying you’re such a jinx!” Sun Yixie said from the side.</p>
<p>“Damn it! Stop with the jinxing, alright? We must believe in science! Mr. Chen is indeed very strong, but he also made mistakes during the games, and to be honest, Mr. Chen’s fundamentals are indeed not as good as professional players’!” Huang Donglai defended himself, even getting a little emotional and blurting out a catchphrase or two.</p>
<p>“Brother Huang, you’re still rooting for the professional players!?” Sun Yixie quietly probed, egging him on.</p>
<p>“I’ve already received the news, alright? The last player to go on stage is Guadi! He’s currently the strongest Orc player, and Mr. Chen’s previous tactics have all been used. What reason do I have to believe Mr. Chen can win?” Although there were already three victims, Huang Donglai never changed his opinion, because he was a professional commentator.</p>
<p>Others could question him, but he couldn’t question himself; he trusted his own judgment.</p>
<p>“Brother Huang, it’s not that I don’t believe your judgment. I just think Mr. Chen’s performance today has impressed me, the professional players, and the audience alike,” Sun Yixie said with a very sincere tone.</p>
<p>“Regarding the balance of Warcraft, I don’t think anyone has any doubts anymore, because Mr. Chen’s skill level is right here. If Mr. Chen were a noob, you could certainly say he doesn’t understand, but now it’s obvious that Mr. Chen himself is a powerful player who clearly understands the balance of each race in the game.”</p>
<p>“As the saying goes, even a good horse may stumble, and a wise man may err. Guadi is strong, that’s true, but to be honest, Mr. Chen is really not weak. Brother Huang, won’t you reconsider?” Sun Yixie revealed his true colors.</p>
<p>“No need to reconsider. I still firmly believe in my opinion. Guadi is invincible, alright? Don’t you think highly of Guadi?” Huang Donglai turned the tables.</p>
<p>“To be honest, compared to Mr. Chen, I do indeed favor Guadi more. After all, Mr. Chen has basically played all three races today, and Guadi has probably been watching the whole time, so I think Mr. Chen might be in for some trouble in the last game.” Sun Yixie, at this moment, still stood by his good brother’s side.</p>
<p>“Yes, we commentators have to talk science! Don’t always believe in superstitious beliefs. I refuse to believe Mr. Chen can still hide tactics and then beat Guadi. That’s impossible!” Huang Donglai said.</p>
<p>“Oh, stop talking, everyone! If Mr. Chen can beat Guadi, Brother Huang and I will shave our heads bald to celebrate,” Sun Yixie said, looking at the various bullet comments in the live stream.</p>
<p>“Exactly! If Mr. Chen wins, we’ll shave our heads bald, but that’s impossible!” Huang Donglai said.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Completely unaware that someone had already set a “shaved head” flag based on his victory or defeat, Chen Xu now felt his condition was better than ever before.</p>
<p>At the same time, he felt a wave of surprise. “The commentators are still not optimistic about me?”</p>
<p>Originally, he thought that after taking down one or two pro gamers, the commentators might start leaning towards him. He clearly felt that in the third game, which was why he won quite narrowly.</p>
<p>Moreover, the opponent in the third game was weaker than those in the first and second games. Fortunately, at the critical moment, he once again felt that mysterious power, otherwise, he should have actually lost that game.</p>
<p>They’re still not optimistic about him? Even though this opponent named Guadian was indeed very formidable.</p>
<p>On the live streaming website’s bullet comments, the spectators were also excited.</p>
<p>“Here we go, here we go! Wonder if Mr. Chen can beat Guadian!”</p>
<p>“It’s not impossible!”</p>
<p>“Anyway, I hope Mr. Chen wins. That would be absolutely awesome!”</p>
<p>“I’d rather see those two shave their heads bald!”</p>
<p>“Huh, on this map, CH (Hidden Valley), why did Mr. Chen pick Night Elf? Is he going for that expanding playstyle? But this map is too small, isn’t it? Won’t he be immediately found before his Tier 2 tech is fully developed?”</p>
<p>Many knowledgeable players in the live stream were a bit bewildered.</p>
<p>One characteristic of this map was that the terrain was relatively narrow, which wasn’t friendly for late-game large-scale battles with high-population armies. But the key was that the Orcs’ power spike didn’t come very late. After reaching Tier 2, with the high mobility and Ensnare of Wolf Riders, whether it was the AOE-burst Tauren or the control and healing Shaman as the second hero, both were very effective against squishy Night Elves.</p>
<p>And the most crucial point was that Chen Xu’s previous expanding playstyle was basically very difficult to implement effectively on this map.</p>
<p>Huang Donglai and Sun Yixie were also introducing the current situation on the field, after all, this involved their hair.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen’s build, he made a straight line formation to block the entrance to prevent the opponent’s starting Blademaster from harassing. The Ancient of War is still placed next to the neutral camp; after leveling up, it can go back and block the entrance. But he only made one Archer, and he didn’t choose a neutral hero but a Demon Hunter as his starting hero?” Huang Donglai was a bit puzzled.</p>
<p>“This is a bit conventional, but also a bit unconventional!” Sun Yixie also said he didn’t quite understand.</p>
<p>“However, Guadian is still very confident, directly adopting the default opening of Altar of Storms, burrow, Barracks, and Shop,” Sun Yixie continued.</p>
<p>“Hey, he directly creeped a Fat Ogre nearby, and luckily it dropped a Ring of Nobility, All attributes +2. That’s a very good item, but he’s not continuing to creep? He’s just going straight to the Neutral Shop?”</p>
