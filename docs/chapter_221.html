                <p>Chapter 321: Ten Years Making Games, Nine Years Making CG (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>The development progress of <code>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</code> was exceptionally smooth. Although this was the team's second large-scale <code>VR game</code>, they had prior experience with <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code>, and <code>NetDragon</code> had provided significant <code>technical assistance</code> as part of their <code>strategic cooperation</code>. Consequently, they encountered virtually no major difficulties. The remaining task primarily involved <code>art assets</code>. Currently, <code>Nebula Games</code> had only developed <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code>, so their accumulated <code>art assets</code> were not extensive. Moreover, in terms of <code>game experience</code>, the two games were <code>poles apart</code>. All <code>action systems</code>, including the <code>shooting modes</code>, were completely incompatible. After all, <code>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</code> aimed to deliver a fiery, swift, and thrilling fast-paced experience to players. For the vast majority of <code>art assets</code>, excluding core designs, everything else could be entrusted to <code>outsourcing companies</code>. In <code>game development</code>, outsourcing content, especially <code>art assets</code>, was a common practice, as it saved the team a considerable amount of <code>time</code>.</p>
<p>While <code>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</code> was being quietly developed, <code>NetDragon</code> was also making significant moves. First, the <code>PC version</code> of <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code> was announced, along with plans to host related <code>esports events</code>. <code>Chen Xu</code> didn't intervene much in this aspect, as <code>NetDragon</code> had considerable experience organizing competitions and owned many <code>competitive games</code>. Furthermore, <code>Nebula Games</code> was largely responsible for <code>content operation</code> in the future. Simultaneously, information about <code>Atrai</code>'s <code>Storm Action</code> was continuously relayed to China through the <code>Channel Alliance</code>. After all, this was a <code>popular IP</code> and <code>Zeus</code>'s <code>escort title</code>. It was evident that <code>Atrai</code> had a <code>meticulous plan</code>. Alongside the announcement of the <code>Storm Action</code> game, the film's <code>producer</code> also revealed news about a <code>Storm Action</code> <code>sequel</code>. Clearly, this was a strategic <code>strong alliance</code> aimed at generating <code>hype</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Channel Alliance</code> in China also held <code>high hopes</code> for this game. After all, the <code>Nebula Games Platform</code>'s <code>market share</code> was continuously expanding. More and more <code>third-party game developers</code> were choosing to <code>launch exclusively</code> on the <code>Nebula Games Platform</code>. Although the <code>Channel Alliance</code> had progressively <code>lowered</code> their <code>revenue split ratio</code>, it was <code>to no avail</code>. Coupled with titles like <code>Warcraft</code>, <code>Minecraft</code>, and <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code> continually solidifying <code>Nebula Games</code>' <code>player base</code>, it could be said that they were slowly <code>eroding</code> the competition. Therefore, the <code>Channel Alliance</code> also placed <code>high hopes</code> on the <code>blockbuster</code> <code>Storm Action</code>. Besides <code>offline exhibitions</code> and <code>press conferences</code>, more and more news about <code>Storm Action</code> was revealed. Firstly, the <code>actors</code> playing the <code>male and female leads</code> would participate in the game's <code>motion capture</code> to ensure the <code>authenticity</code> of the <code>characters</code>. Subsequently, related <code>game content</code> and <code>information</code> were released, showcasing <code>scenes</code> from the movie and <code>easter eggs</code>. This greatly excited many <code>fan players</code>.</p>
<p>After all, several years had passed, and many <code>players</code> who had seen <code>Storm Action</code> still felt nostalgic for it. Now, with news of a new <code>movie</code>, <code>game adaptation</code>, and those familiar <code>scenes</code>, it immediately felt right to them.
'The <code>fidelity</code> is so high! And the <code>graphics</code> feel even better than in the <code>movie</code>!'
'Indeed, but I wonder what <code>timeline</code> and <code>plot</code> stage it's set in.'
'What I'm more interested in is the <code>gameplay</code>!'
'No need to doubt that, <code>Atrai</code> definitely has the <code>strength</code>!'
'I wonder if they can recreate the <code>grand scenes</code> from the <code>original work</code>'s movie, especially that moment when the <code>protagonist</code> escapes the <code>building</code>, and the entire <code>building</code> is <code>blown up</code>. That was simply too <code>spectacular</code>.'
'I think there should be even grander scenes, right?'</p>
<p><code>Players</code> expressed great <code>anticipation</code> upon seeing the <code>content news</code> released for <code>Storm Action</code>. After all, for an <code>adapted IP game</code>, the <code>first impression</code> for <code>players</code> was invariably about the <code>graphics</code> and the game's <code>fidelity</code> to the <code>original work</code>. <code>Atrai</code> was clearly <code>fully aware</code> of this; otherwise, there would have been no need to spend so much money acquiring the <code>copyright</code>. All <code>information</code> released to the public revolved around this point, instantly giving these <code>fan players</code> a <code>shot in the arm</code>. While the <code>gameplay</code> might still be unclear, the <code>graphics</code> and <code>fidelity</code> were already maximized. This could be considered a very conventional <code>IP warm-up</code>.</p>
<p>However, just as <code>Atrai</code> and the domestic <code>Channel Alliance</code> were continuously conducting their <code>promotional warm-up</code> for <code>Storm Action</code>, <code>Chen Xu</code>'s <code>official Weibo account</code> also updated with a long-awaited post. The <code>accompanying image</code> showed a <code>wasteland</code>. <code>Heavy machine guns</code>, <code>shoulder-fired rocket launchers</code>... various <code>weapons</code> were displayed. There was also a <code>group photo</code> of some <code>staff members</code>. The <code>accompanying text</code> was just a simple sentence:
'<code>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</code>, a game that defines what a <code>modern warfare theme</code> is, will <code>launch</code> on the <code>Cosmic VR Platform</code>!'</p>
<p>With the release of this <code>official Weibo account</code> post, all the <code>players</code> instantly <code>erupted</code>! Because this <code>official Weibo account</code> post had made it clear! <code>Mr. Chen</code> had been silent all this time, and he was making a <code>new game</code> again! And it was a <code>modern warfare theme</code> game. Looking at the <code>accompanying images</code>, <code>Mr. Chen</code>'s <code>scale</code> this time was simply <code>unprecedented</code>! <code>Heavy machine guns</code>, <code>shoulder-fired rocket launchers</code>, and so on – could it be that the game would feature all these <code>real combat weapons</code>? All the <code>players</code> immediately became <code>restless</code>.</p>
<p>'Alas, I'm uncultured; 'What the heck' suffices for all occasions!'
'As expected, <code>Mr. Chen</code>, the <code>Quick Shooter</code>, wouldn't endure solitude. He's about to do something big!'
'The surprise came too quickly, it caught me off guard!'
'So, is this going head-to-head with <code>Atrai</code>?'
'A game that defines modern warfare? <code>Mr. Chen</code>'s tone is so arrogant! But I like it!'
'Looking at this posture, is it almost <code>completed development</code>!?'</p>
<p>Countless <code>players</code> were incredibly <code>excited</code> and <code>thrilled</code>. Although they knew nothing about how the game would look, only its <code>theme</code> and <code>name</code> had been announced so far. However, over the past few years, <code>Nebula Games</code> had accumulated enough <code>popularity</code> and <code>reputation</code> to fuel their <code>anticipation</code>. While countless <code>players</code> cheered online, <code>Nebula Games</code> was discussing with <code>Qin Yi</code> how to better showcase the <code>action</code> and <code>gaming pod</code>'s <code>force feedback system</code> in <code>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</code>, when <code>Yang Chen</code> from the <code>Game Department</code> called.</p>
<p>'Mr. Chen? How's the <code>development progress</code> of your <code>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</code>? You absolutely must ensure the <code>game quality</code>, and don't worry about the <code>tight schedule</code>. <code>Zeus</code>'s progress overseas is similar to ours, perhaps even slower, so <code>Storm Action</code>, which is <code>escorting</code> for <code>Zeus</code>, isn't developing as fast as imagined.' <code>Minister Yang</code> was rather <code>nervous</code>. Although <code>Nebula Games</code> wasn't the only <code>game developer</code> creating <code>escort titles</code> for the <code>Cosmic VR Platform</code>, giving <code>players</code> a strong <code>first impression</code> was quite important. Therefore, <code>Minister Yang</code> was concerned that <code>Chen Xu</code> might want to <code>rush development</code>, making a <code>first move</code> before <code>Atrai</code> to <code>grab hype</code>, thereby compromising the <code>game content</code>.</p>
<p>Hearing <code>Minister Yang</code>'s words, <code>Chen Xu</code> smiled knowingly: 'Don't worry, <code>Minister Yang</code>, there's no way I'd <code>joke around</code> with <code>Nebula Games</code>' <code>reputation</code>. The <code>development progress</code> for <code>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</code> is very <code>smooth</code>, and its <code>quality</code> is absolutely <code>guaranteed</code>. As for <code>racing</code> against others? We haven't even considered it.'</p>
<p>After exchanging a few words with <code>Minister Yang</code> and chatting for a while longer, <code>Chen Xu</code> put down the phone and smiled. Naturally, <code>Chen Xu</code> wouldn't <code>rush development</code> at the expense of <code>game content</code>. After all, the <code>old saying</code> applies again: no one remembers a <code>garbage game</code> that was <code>released on time</code>. Whether it's <code>released on time</code> or <code>postponed</code>, as long as it delivers satisfactory <code>quality</code> to <code>players</code>, everything will be <code>worry-free</code>. Otherwise, regardless of whether you <code>release on time</code>, <code>postpone</code>, or even <code>early launch</code> through <code>reverse postponement</code>, <code>players</code> will tear you apart so badly <code>your own mother wouldn't recognize you</code>. As for now? All he could say was, 'It's being made, it's being made.'</p>
<p>For <code>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</code>, although the <code>game progress</code> was only about one-sixth completed overall. While there was still quite a long time until <code>completion</code>, the <code>progress</code> on the <code>CGI</code> front was <code>extremely fast</code>. After all, in <code>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</code>, to ensure sufficiently outstanding <code>visual effects</code>, <code>Chen Xu</code> chose to <code>mask</code> most <code>loading transitions</code> with <code>CGI</code>. Combined with the various <code>Operator CGI</code> from <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code> and <code>Warcraft</code>'s <code>CGI</code>, <code>Chen Xu</code> could only say that <code>Nebula Games</code> was absolutely <code>professional</code> in this area!</p>
<p>'<code>Ten Years Making Games, Nine Years Making CG</code>.' This was the online <code>evaluation</code> of <code>Nebula Games</code> previously, and <code>Chen Xu</code> stated it definitely had to be <code>implemented thoroughly</code>. Otherwise, how <code>disappointed</code> would <code>players</code> be? After all, he, <code>Chen Xu</code>, was a game designer who <code>never lied</code> and <code>never disappointed players</code>.
