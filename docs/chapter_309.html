                <p>Chapter 308: Tough Guy Parachutes In! (6th update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)</p>
<p>Song Ren had a bit of self-awareness regarding whether he could handle this Realistic difficulty.</p>
<p>He definitely couldn't.</p>
<p>After all, he had just started the game and didn't know much about it yet.</p>
<p>Moreover, he was alone.</p>
<p>So, he simply wanted to experience it and wait for Zhang Yi and the others.</p>
<p>"Locate and defuse the bomb."</p>
<p>Upon entering the game, the mission objective appeared in the center, with a countdown timer above it, and two "??" on the right that hadn't been revealed yet.</p>
<p>Clearly, this meant he needed to defuse two bombs.</p>
<p>The map was a cafe, so this wasn't an exercise. The White Masks had planted bombs inside the coffee shop, and now his task was to infiltrate the cafe and defuse them.</p>
<p>Respawning at the coast, Song Ren wasn't scared.</p>
<p>Although his name sounded like "coward," he wasn't cowardly at all, except when playing horror games.</p>
<p>Choosing Sledge, Song Ren charged forward with a shotgun.</p>
<p>While Sledge could also choose an assault rifle, considering that Rainbow Six Siege was different from regular FPS games, often involving close-quarters indoor firefights, Song Ren felt that the shotgun's lethality would be greater.</p>
<p>Arriving at the cafe's main entrance, the previously open door was now barricaded with wooden boards.</p>
<p>Looking at the boards in front of him, Song Ren chuckled.</p>
<p>Did these flimsy wooden boards think they could stop Sledge?</p>
<p>He pulled out the breaching hammer from his back and smashed it down directly.</p>
<p>Instantly, the wooden boards in front of him shattered into pieces.</p>
<p>The next moment, Song Ren's expression froze.</p>
<p>Because behind the shattered barricade, in front of the cafe's main hall,</p>
<p>He saw three enemies wearing balaclavas and white masks, aiming their guns at him with their dark muzzles.</p>
<p>And in front of them, two deployable shields were set up.</p>
<p>Clearly, they were prepared!</p>
<p>The scene was incredibly awkward.</p>
<p><em>I should be outside, not inside.</em></p>
<p>A line from a song inexplicably popped into Song Ren's mind. The next moment, firecracker-like gunshots rang out.</p>
<p>[Action Failed]</p>
<p>A prompt appeared in the center of the screen.</p>
<p>"What the heck?! Shouldn't these White Masks be silly, passively waiting in the spot? What's with this direct door-framing pre-aim?!"</p>
<p>Song Ren calmed himself down, completely stunned.</p>
<p>Compared to his previous life, Chen Xu had made many changes to the Terrorist Hunt mode.</p>
<p>Especially at the highest Realistic difficulty, a higher level of AI performance was adopted.</p>
<p>The White Masks in the game were no longer just silly, passively waiting in the spot, occasionally patrolling or attacking when they heard movement.</p>
<p>Instead, they would have more rigorous deployments. Of course, their marksmanship would still intentionally miss a couple of shots.</p>
<p>After all, in FPS games, if it came down to pure accuracy and reaction, even the most genius human couldn't beat a computer.</p>
<p>Of course, intentionally missing a couple of shots only lasted for a moment.</p>
<p>Basically, if you were exposed to the AI's gunfire for even a second, you were pretty much instantly killed.</p>
<p>Players needed to rely on their understanding of the map and skillful use of gadgets to succeed (there were resupply points for ammunition and gadgets in the map environment).</p>
<p>"Forget it, no more Realistic difficulty! I'll play on Normal difficulty, alright?!" Song Ren sighed, deciding to tactically retreat for now.</p>
<p>Despite being ambushed, and remembering that Rainbow Six Siege was a completely different game from ordinary FPS games,</p>
<p>Song Ren still didn't stubbornly choose to continue the challenge, because he knew he was still too green.</p>
<p>If he couldn't beat the Realistic White Masks, could he not even beat the Normal White Masks?</p>
<p>He re-entered the game, but this time the map changed to one called Mansion.</p>
<p>But it didn't matter to him; he didn't recognize any of them anyway.</p>
<p>The mission was to find and rescue the hostage.</p>
<p>For Operator selection, Song Ren didn't pick Sledge this time, but chose Ying.</p>
<p>After selecting the spawn point, Song Ren was smarter this time.</p>
<p>He stood still, pulled out his unmanned reconnaissance vehicle, and then controlled the drone to start scouting.</p>
<p>"This little drone is so fun!" Song Ren maneuvered the drone, making it jump left and right, completely venting his frustration about the Operator's inability to jump onto the drone.</p>
<p>Slipping through a door crack, Song Ren saw a large group of White Masks at the main entrance. He pressed the scan button to mark these White Masks, but the next moment, a burst of bullets swept over, and Song Ren, who was controlling the drone, saw the display in his hand immediately go blurry.</p>
<p>"What the heck?! The AI reacts to being scanned?!"</p>
<p>Song Ren felt a pang of frustration.</p>
<p>Fortunately, each Operator carried two drones.</p>
<p>Even though one was gone, he still had another.</p>
<p>But he couldn't use it so casually now, or he'd lose his source of information.</p>
<p>However, the swarm of enemies at the front still made Song Ren a bit nervous, so he bypassed them and went to the eastern lawn area.</p>
<p>At the base of the wall, Song Ren's attention turned to the second-floor window.</p>
<p>To rescue the hostage, if he were the kidnapper, where would the hostage be placed?</p>
<p>It must be a place that's easy to defend and hard to attack, so it was very likely the second-floor bedroom or another room.</p>
<p>The large number of troops at the main gate meant there probably weren't many AI on the second floor.</p>
<p>So, wouldn't it be better if he broke in from the second floor, used it as a base, and slowly eliminated the enemies on the first floor?</p>
<p>Thinking this, Song Ren couldn't help but admire his own intelligence.</p>
<p>Arriving at the base of the wall, a prompt appeared on the screen, and Song Ren also noticed a detail.</p>
<p>There was a grappling hook slot, and only then could the grappling hook be used; otherwise, it was unusable.</p>
<p>Following the prompt, he threw the grappling hook up, then stepped forward, pushing off the wall with his feet to climb up little by little. When he reached the window, Song Ren instinctively wanted to smash the barricade with his gunstock.</p>
<p>But at that moment, Song Ren remembered the window breach scene from the promotional video, and this time, the Operator he was playing was Ying, equipped with breaching charges.</p>
<p>This seemed like a flashy move to try, and the game apparently supported playing this way!</p>
<p>Trying a swing, Song Ren's eyes lit up, and the next scene already formed in his mind.</p>
<p>With the explosion, the wooden boards would shatter, he would rappel to the second floor, and open fire on the terrorist personnel.</p>
<p>How cool!</p>
<p>He placed the breaching charge, then watched the flashing light, calculating the timing. Song Ren pushed off with both feet.</p>
<p><em>Boom!</em></p>
<p>With a loud bang, the tough guy parachuted in!</p>
<p>Then, with a splat, the tough guy's corpse dropped onto the grass.</p>
<p>[Action Failed]</p>
<p>Looking at the post-failure exit screen, Song Ren fell silent until he heard Zhang Yi and the others' voices in the channel: "Old Song, are you done playing?"</p>
<p>"Done! Done! Just finished!" Song Ren decisively exited and responded.</p>
<p>"That fast? Is this Terrorist Hunt mode fun?" Joey asked at this moment.</p>
<p>"Yeah, what kind of gameplay is Terrorist Hunt mode?" Wang Han also asked with interest.</p>
<p>Is Terrorist Hunt mode fun? What kind of gameplay is it?</p>
<p>Thinking about his two rounds, Song Ren suddenly found himself unable to answer.</p>
<p>"I played Lone Wolf mode, but I didn't really play it; I was just testing Operator skills and some small tricks that might be possible in the game," Song Ren said after some thought.</p>
<p>"Small tricks? What tricks?" Zhang Yi pressed.</p>
<p>"Nothing, just a not-very-practical small trick. Oh, by the way, have you guys bought your Operators?! Hurry up and matchmake! I can't wait to counter-terrorize!" Song Ren quickly changed the subject.</p>
<p>"Of course we bought them!"</p>
<p>"Who's teaming up?"</p>
<p>"I am, invite people, invite people!"</p>
<p>Hearing Song Ren's words, everyone's attention was diverted, and they eagerly rubbed their fists and palms, anticipating their first match.</p>
