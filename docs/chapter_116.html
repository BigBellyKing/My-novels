                <p>Chapter 215: Time to Change That Embarrassing Name (Seventh update, please subscribe and vote for monthly passes)</p>
<p>"What's going on? How is it getting dark so fast?"</p>
<p>Wang Han, still diligently chopping wood and immersed in her building fantasies for later, had completely failed to notice that the sky in the game had already transitioned from day to dusk.</p>
<p>"I'm screwed, the house isn't built yet! Haven't found any sheep either!"</p>
<p>Looking at the sky, Wang Han was stunned for a moment. She hadn't chopped much, only about sixty pieces. Had ten minutes really passed so quickly?</p>
<p>The in-game time, just like in the <em>Don't Starve</em> she played before, was divided into day and night. A day lasted 20 minutes, with 10 minutes for day, 7 minutes for night, and the remaining three minutes for sunset.</p>
<p>If she were to build, she didn't really like this spot right now. Although it could be torn down after building, it was troublesome. But if she didn't build, who knew what would happen in the game at night?</p>
<p>As Wang Han hesitated, the sky in the game was visibly getting darker. Unlike <em>Don't Starve</em>, where visibility became very small after dark and there was a risk of instant death, <em>Minecraft</em> didn't have such a setting. Instead, small white skeletons with bows and small green zombies would appear. But in <em>Minecraft</em>, players used first-person and over-the-shoulder perspectives, and even though it was a pixel game, this perspective, combined with the darkness and the sounds of zombies and skeletons, created a truly terrifying atmosphere.</p>
<p>"So what should I do now!? What should I do! What should I do!" Wang Han screamed as she saw the monsters running towards her and took off running. As she ran, Wang Han realized there were more and more monsters behind her. She was like a locomotive pulling a train, with a large group of monsters trailing behind. And among them, a white archer skeleton kept shooting arrows. Although she had crafted a wooden sword earlier in her item inventory, her previous experience playing <em>Don't Starve</em> made her feel that she was completely no match for these monsters now, let alone so many of them.</p>
<p>However, the more she ran, the more monsters she encountered along the way. "I've got it!" Suddenly, Wang Han looked at the ground beneath her feet and had a flash of inspiration. She pulled out a hoe from her item inventory and started digging immediately. Three blocks were just enough for her to drop down, then Wang Han picked up a block of dirt and blocked the opening above. Instantly, the entire game screen plunged into darkness, with only the various roars of monsters coming through her headphones.</p>
<p>"Now I'm safe." Only hearing the monsters' roars but not seeing their movements, Wang Han couldn't help but smile. Next was waiting for daylight, until these monsters left.</p>
<p>Wang Han was about to take out her phone from her pocket to scroll through short videos or something. Just then, the sound of keys unlocking the door came from the living room, followed by footsteps. Wang Han instinctively turned her head and saw Zhang Yi entering the room with a plastic bag in hand. "Hey, didn't you say it would take over an hour earlier?"</p>
<p>"Good luck on the road today, all green lights, smooth sailing." Zhang Yi smiled and then shook the plastic bag in his hand. "I bought roasted duck rice for you. Eat it while it's hot, or the duck will taste fishy when it gets cold."</p>
<p>"Got it." Wang Han took the roasted duck rice from Zhang Yi's hand. "Hey, is the computer broken!?" Zhang Yi, who noticed the monitor was completely black, was stunned for a moment. "What's broken? I'm playing <em>Minecraft</em>!" Wang Han said while opening the plastic bag.</p>
<p>"Is it bugged then? Why is the screen completely black?" Zhang Yi was a bit confused. The screen is completely black, and you're telling him you're playing a game?</p>
<p>"It's night outside now, I'm being chased by monsters, so I'm temporarily hiding underground to avoid them," Wang Han explained.</p>
<p>"Isn't this game about building houses? How come you're also being chased by monsters?" Zhang Yi asked curiously.</p>
<p>"There are different modes, the one I'm playing is survival mode, it's similar to <em>Don't Starve</em>," Wang Han said.</p>
<p>"Oh, I see!" Zhang Yi understood. While saying this, Wang Han switched the game's audio to the speakers. The sounds of monsters outside seemed to have disappeared. But to be safe, Wang Han still dug forward for a while inside the dark hole.</p>
<p>"Couldn't you just make a hole and get out? What are you doing in the pitch black?" Zhang Yi, sitting next to her, watched Wang Han stuffing rice into her mouth while seemingly digging something on the pitch-black screen, a bit puzzled.</p>
<p>"You haven't played this game, you wouldn't understand! What if the monsters above are still there? It's safer for me to detour forward," Wang Han explained.</p>
<p>She dug about twenty blocks, accumulating 20 dirt blocks in her item inventory, then Wang Han finally broke through to the surface. And by this time, it was finally daytime.</p>
<p>"The graphics aren't bad!" Looking at the game screen, Zhang Yi, sitting next to her, commented.</p>
<p>"Alright, just watch me. I'll build a house first to have a place to live, and then I'll go find sheep to get wool for a bed," Wang Han said, looking at the large pile of wood and dirt on her person, full of confidence.</p>
<p>Even before this, she had not only mentally trained, she had even specifically taken out building block toys she bought from home before and conducted practical training. Now it was time to check the results.</p>
<p>Although the current materials were only dirt and wood, that was already enough. Wood could be crafted into wooden planks and wooden doors using a crafting table.</p>
<p>Although it was far from her imagined 'pink dream mansion,' lacking many materials, she could make a simple wooden country-style house, which she thought shouldn't be a big problem.</p>
<p>"A place with mountains and water, this spot is good," Wang Han specifically chose a spot near a lake.</p>
<p>First, she built a crafting table, and then crafted doors and wooden planks. Then Wang Han began her creation. Zhang Yi, sitting beside her, was also watching with his chin in his hand.</p>
<p>First was the foundation: she first dug up all the sand on the ground, then filled it with wood to delineate the area of the house. Because there wasn't much wood, the area shouldn't be too big; one bedroom and one living room would suffice. Next, she started building the walls. Wang Han specifically left a gap in the middle to install the door later. She didn't know how to make steps, so Wang Han simply placed two pieces of wood to represent the threshold.</p>
<p>While eating the roasted duck rice, savoring the deliciousness of the duck meat and the fragrance of the white rice, it was as if her Ren and Du meridians had been cleared. Wang Han felt a surge of inspiration, and the image of the house in her mind became incredibly clear.</p>
<p>Because in survival mode she couldn't fly like in creative mode, to cap the walls after they were quite high, Wang Han needed to stack blocks under her feet to climb up.</p>
<p>"Hmm, I'll leave a few holes here. I saw in the recipe list that glass can be made, so later I'll leave it for glass, and when I lie in bed at night, I can watch the stars," Wang Han muttered to herself, while carrying out her grand infrastructure project.</p>
<p>"As for the crafting table, I'll put it in this corner, and then I'll add some decorations to make my house beautiful."</p>
<p>As the last piece of wood was placed, Wang Han finally felt a sense of accomplishment. And by this time, the sky in the game had slowly transitioned from day to dusk.</p>
<p>"There's something I don't know if I should say, Comrade Xiao Wang, the architecture master, is your house going for a prison cell style?"</p>
<p>Looking at the house in front of her, Zhang Yi, sitting next to her, couldn't help but say. The wooden house was just a cube, with the crafting table in the corner looking like a toilet. And there was no bed in the room.</p>
<p>The spot originally left for the door, because two pieces of wood were placed below as a threshold, now looked just like a prison visiting window.</p>
<p>"It does seem a little different from what I imagined." Stepping out of the house and looking at this thing in front of her, Wang Han also fell into a moment of silence.</p>
<p>In her imagination, the house she built, although wooden, should be simple yet not simplistic, with artistic skill evident in the details. But the house in front of her resembled a giant chimney, and the spot left for the door was like a prison visiting window. And looking inside the house, apart from a crafting table, there was nothing else.</p>
<p>Even prisons at least have a bed! Coincidentally, at this moment, the in-game sky also turned dark, and it started raining. Drizzling rain fell from the reserved skylight.</p>
<p>Wang Han subconsciously shifted her view upwards and jumped to plug the hole with the few remaining pieces of wood on her. After plugging it, the rain indeed stopped leaking, but inside the house, only a little light came from the prison visiting window. The entire room was pitch black.</p>
<p>"Change the name, it's quite embarrassing."</p>
<p>Looking at Wang Han's name, 'Architecture Master,' Zhang Yi thought for a moment and said.
