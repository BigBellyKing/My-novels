                <p>Chapter 345: A Chorus of Praise (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Listening to the slightly melancholic BGM in his headphones, Zhang Yi let out a long breath.</p>
<p>He didn't choose to exit the game immediately as he usually would, because at this moment, Zhang Yi's emotions hadn't completely settled.</p>
<p>He had successfully killed Makarov, and the game's story was completed.</p>
<p>But this time, unlike before, he felt no joy from finishing a game.</p>
<p>Because one by one, the comrades who had fought alongside him in the game were gone forever.</p>
<p>Soap, Roach, Ghost...</p>
<p>Recalling his experiences in the game, Zhang Yi's heart felt a little complex at this moment.</p>
<p>This was the first time he had finished a game and felt such a strange sensation.</p>
<p>Looking at the end credits list, Zhang Yi knew that the story of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare had concluded.</p>
<p>Yet, the entire story still held too many points worth pondering.</p>
<p>Every character had their own ending.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, like a movie, had a single, linear ending.</p>
<p>It didn't offer multiple endings like Dark Souls.</p>
<p>It was just like a film.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare simply told a good story.</p>
<p>In this story, there was no absolute protagonist; Soap and Roach were not the protagonists of this war, and even Price, who survived to the end and witnessed its beginning and end, was not the protagonist either.</p>
<p>Yet, in this war, everyone was a protagonist: Soap, Roach, the Ranger Regiment, and all the fallen soldiers, regardless of their nationality.</p>
<p>There was too much he wanted to lament, but he didn't know where to begin.</p>
<p>The only thing Zhang Yi could be certain of was that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was, without a doubt, a true masterpiece.</p>
<p>The entire playthrough of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare lasted approximately 22 hours.</p>
<p>Most AAA games with a linear story have a similar playtime for their main campaign; of course, if one chooses the easiest difficulty, they can just rush through all the levels.</p>
<p>But for Zhang Yi, it felt like a very long time had passed.</p>
<p>The game's story spanned multiple countries across Eurasia, beginning in the Bering Strait and ending in Arabia.</p>
<p>The scenes during this journey were also diverse, featuring cities, tropical rainforests, small towns, and snow-capped mountains.</p>
<p>Recalling the comrades he met along the way filled Zhang Yi with endless emotion.</p>
<p>“In the end, only Captain Price survived.”</p>
<p>Exiting the game, Zhang Yi voiced his sentiment.</p>
<p>From SAS to Task Force 141.</p>
<p>Ultimately, only Captain Price remained.</p>
<p>It wasn't just Zhang Yi who was filled with emotion.</p>
<p>All players who experienced Call of Duty: Modern Warfare shared this feeling.</p>
<p>From the start, they were captivated by the breathtaking war scenes.</p>
<p>But as the story progressed, the complex international situation,</p>
<p>the conspiracies of various ambitious individuals,</p>
<p>and the sacrifices of Task Force 141 and other brave soldiers,</p>
<p>all brought countless players to tears.</p>
<p>All players, without exception, were moved by the game's story.</p>
<p>Even in the final scene, watching Captain Price light a cigar with a trembling hand,</p>
<p>countless players found their eyes welling up. This was an emotion only players who had experienced Call of Duty: Modern Warfare could truly feel.</p>
<p>And such an emotion could only be achieved by games, an art form distinct from books and films, which truly allows players to immerse themselves in the story and interact with characters.</p>
<p>While telling the story, players control the protagonist in the game, engaging in dialogue and interaction with surrounding characters.</p>
<p>This creates an even stronger sense of immersion.</p>
<p>This is also why many refer to video games as the ninth art.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>After all three parts of the game's trilogy were released, major media outlets participated in reviewing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.</p>
<p>It received uniformly high ratings, with some media even giving perfect scores.</p>
<p>Concurrently, on the Nebula Games Platform, player reviews for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare also reached a high score of 9.5.</p>
<p>As for some of the lower scores, they were mainly given by emotionally charged players.</p>
<p>After all, the sacrifices of Soap, Roach, Ghost, and others truly broke many players' hearts.</p>
<p>However, this precisely demonstrated Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's great success in storytelling; it successfully stirred the players' emotions.</p>
<p>Unlike other FPS games where a single character's journey from beginning to end is a solo act,</p>
<p>in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, players control not just one character, but multiple characters.</p>
<p>Initially, players thought Soap was the protagonist, but later there were also the Lighthouse Nation storyline and the Russian Federation storyline.</p>
<p>It can be said that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is not a solo act for any single character.</p>
<p>Just as the word 'war' is in the game's title, this is war.</p>
<p>A brutal war.</p>
<p>And sacrifice is inevitable.</p>
<p>While players discussed the game's story, game industry designers were amazed by Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's design for FPS games.</p>
<p>Both the level design and the narrative were eye-opening.</p>
<p>As for game media, they aimed to uncover deeper layers of content.</p>
<p>The original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare actually contained some content that glorified America, otherwise it wouldn't have later become a recruitment propaganda game for the US.</p>
<p>For example, Makarov's gas attack on Europe, followed by America's Delta Force saving the world.</p>
<p>However, in the Parallel World, Chen Xu made the game's portrayal more neutral regarding certain details and plot points.</p>
<p>At least it wasn't singing praises for anyone; it simply recounted the events involving SAS and Task Force 141, and what transpired during this catastrophe, nothing more.</p>
<p>GameSpot, a veteran media outlet in the industry, commented:</p>
<p>‘Modern FPS games are not uncommon. But few can compare to a game like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.’</p>
<p>‘The immense visual experience, after personally experiencing it, brings nothing but shock. Especially the meticulously designed levels, which fully demonstrate what modern warfare truly is.’</p>
<p>‘It's not just about having modern weapons like planes, tanks, and rocket launchers that defines modern warfare. Elite operations, information network warfare, and immediately crippling the enemy's information network can instantly turn the tide of war.’</p>
<p>‘Excitement and tension are the main themes of the game: battlefields with a hail of bullets and explosions, the fall of the White House, cities nuked, the collapse of the Eiffel Tower—various shocking scenes make players feel as if they've watched a blockbuster film.’</p>
<p>‘These are the interesting aspects of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, but what truly elevates it is its story.’</p>
<p>‘Within the game, Nebula Games makes us ponder about war.’</p>
<p>‘It doesn't tell us what to do or what not to do; it simply uses the game's most direct storyline to show us what war truly brings.’</p>
<p>‘The deaths of thirty thousand Marines, the countless innocent civilians in America, the Russian Federation, and many European countries, and only Price remaining from SAS to 141.’</p>
<p>‘War takes countless lives, but what does it bring? The answer is nothing.’</p>
<p>‘And players are not the omnipotent protagonists of movies; they don't have an invincibility halo and cannot always turn danger into safety. Soap, Roach, Ghost, and Yuri are all casualties of this war.’</p>
<p>With GameSpot's review released,</p>
<p>many other authoritative media outlets in the industry also published their respective review articles.</p>
<p>They primarily focused on one direction: anti-war sentiment.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether it was truly there or not, if everyone said it was, then it certainly was.</p>
