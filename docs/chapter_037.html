                <h2>Chapter 37: The Whole Truth</h2>
<p>It wasn't Johnny who got into the car accident, but his twin brother, Joey.</p>
<p>Similarly, Joey wasn't the name of some supposed grandfather at all; rather, Johnny's mother developed some mental issues after accidentally killing Joey in the accident, and began treating Johnny as Joey.</p>
<p>And the beta-blockers were administered to Johnny at this time.</p>
<p>Everything from before was now explained.</p>
<p>Why Johnny always slept in a double bed.</p>
<p>Why Johnny's mother called him Joey.</p>
<p>Including the comics Johnny liked to read and the pickled olives he ate, these were all things his brother Joey liked.</p>
<p>After the car accident, Johnny's mother, overwhelmed by grief, raised Johnny as Joey.</p>
<p>But there were still some doubts: what about Liva?</p>
<p>Did the wish to go to the moon have any connection to Liva at all?</p>
<p>As the game's timeline continued to advance, it reached a point before Joey's death.</p>
<p>As the elder brother, Joey was very protective of his younger brother Johnny.</p>
<p>Once again, the two participated in a competition at the amusement park.</p>
<p>Brother Joey won a small toy train, while younger brother Johnny only got a platypus toy.</p>
<p>Johnny expressed that he wanted one too, but was stopped by his mother.</p>
<p>Joey, however, said they could play with the toy train together.</p>
<p>From this, it was clear that their mother seemed to favor Joey more.</p>
<p>A somewhat downcast Johnny glumly headed towards the back hills of the amusement park, still holding the platypus he had won.</p>
<p>At this moment, Dong Zhen's spirits lifted.</p>
<p>Yes, that platypus!</p>
<p>The platypus that belonged to Liva was actually won by Johnny at the amusement park.</p>
<p>Did this mean...</p>
<p>The following scene confirmed his suspicions.</p>
<p>Johnny, having arrived at the back hills, looked up at the sky full of stars. His previously gloomy mood seemed to improve, and he found a good spot.</p>
<p>It was a tree stump, like a bench, where he could sit and perfectly view the distant twinkling stars.</p>
<p>And just then, a little girl appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>It was Liva in her childhood!</p>
<p>His scalp tingled. In that instant, Dong Zhen seemed to realize something profound.</p>
<p>This was Johnny's first meeting with Liva.</p>
<p>Not the supposed high school encounter!</p>
<p>After seeing Liva arrive, Johnny happily greeted her, but Liva instinctively wanted to leave.</p>
<p>At this point, Johnny called out to Liva.</p>
<p>And after a brief exchange, he asked if she would like to watch the stars with him.</p>
<p>Accompanied by soothing piano and violin background music.</p>
<p>Under a sky full of stars, Johnny and Liva sat on the tree stump, gazing at the distant heavens.</p>
<p>The scene switched to a close-up.</p>
<p>Lush green grass on the verdant lawn swayed gently with the passing breeze.</p>
<p>‘Look over there...’</p>
<p>‘You know, there are countless lights in the sky!’</p>
<p>Johnny actively tried to make conversation.</p>
<p>‘Mm-hmm.’</p>
<p>Liva's reaction was the same as it had been in high school.</p>
<p>‘Uh... yeah, me too.’ Johnny was a bit flustered but continued to make conversation.</p>
<p>‘You just said this was your spot? Right?’</p>
<p>‘I only come during the carnival.’</p>
<p>‘Don't you like crowded places? ...Hmm, I don't either.’ Johnny continued, “Look, you still haven't told me your name!”</p>
<p>‘I won't tell you. Everyone at school makes fun of me because of it.’</p>
<p>‘Why?’</p>
<p>‘They say my name makes them want to go to the toilet.’</p>
<p>‘Well, okay, but... let's just say it can't be worse than [Johnny], right? I mean, there's a Johnny almost anywhere in the world.’</p>
<p>‘So what?’</p>
<p>‘Huh?’</p>
<p>‘What's wrong with having a common name? I just hope, like the stars in the sky, they all look pretty similar from here, but that doesn't make them any less beautiful.’</p>
<p>‘Hmm, I think so too. So what do you think these stars are?’</p>
<p>‘My dad says the stars in the sky are giant burning spheres of gas.’</p>
<p>Johnny and Liva chatted for a bit, then Liva asked, ‘Have you ever tried making an Easter Bunny out of stars?’</p>
<p>‘Like finding constellations in the sky?’</p>
<p>‘Mm-hmm.’</p>
<p>‘I've looked for other things, but never a bunny before.’</p>
<p>‘Want to try?’</p>
<p>‘Yeah! We'll definitely find the best bunny constellation! Let's see who finds it first!’</p>
<p>With a countdown of three, two, one, Liva immediately exclaimed, </p>
