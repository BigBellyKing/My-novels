<p>Chapter 322: Propaganda War (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Following Chen Xu's announcement of news regarding <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>.</p>
<p>Numerous domestic media outlets instantly reported on it.</p>
<p>After all, many game designers and media in the gaming industry were well aware.</p>
<p>Of what <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> represented.</p>
<p>Clearly, Nebula Games was acting as the escorting game developer for Huanyu VR this time.</p>
<p>And <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> was this escorting masterpiece.</p>
<p>Despite the publicly released content, beyond a name and theme, there was nothing else.</p>
<p>But Nebula Games' reputation was widespread!</p>
<p>From its very first game to now, Nebula Games' reputation has been hard-earned, punch by punch.</p>
<p>Especially after <em>Warcraft</em>, which swept the entire RTS market, and the unique <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>.</p>
<p>So, even without much content yet.</p>
<p>Just the label of 'Produced by Chen Xu, Produced by Nebula Games'.</p>
<p>Was enough to make players at home and abroad eagerly anticipate it.</p>
<p>However, this situation also caused a frustrated feeling for Atrai and the Channel Alliance.</p>
<p>Whether it's movies, promotion, or making games.</p>
<p>We were clearly here first!</p>
<p>And these kinds of promotional hype tactics, why are you so skilled at them?</p>
<p>But displeasure aside, there was nothing they could do.</p>
<p>After all, they couldn't modify players' brains to prevent them from paying attention to <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, players were eagerly discussing the potential content and gameplay of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, which was a source of great enjoyment for many.</p>
<p>Guess right, 6666, guess wrong, no shame.</p>
<p>While <em>Storm Action</em> had players excited, honestly, there wasn't much to guess about.</p>
<p>After all, it was a game adapted from a movie.</p>
<p>But for Nebula Games, beyond the modern warfare theme, players knew nothing else.</p>
<p>This added a sense of mystery.</p>
<p>'Rational analysis: This is very likely an FPS game! And a modern warfare-themed game!'</p>
<p>'The commenter above is amazing! Like Zhuge Liang reborn! Listening to your words is like listening to words!'</p>
<p>'Damn the two idiots above, I hope such stupid replies appear next time!'</p>
<p>“Warning! No Matryoshka-style spread!”</p>
<p>Online, players were enthusiastically discussing related topics.</p>
<p>Atrai and the Channel Alliance also made an urgent response.</p>
<p>Free viewing of <em>Storm Action</em> to further boost IP promotion.</p>
<p>Behind-the-scenes footage of the male and female leads during game recording.</p>
<p>All their tricks were on display.</p>
<p>At the same time, <em>Storm Action</em> struck while the iron was hot.</p>
<p>Releasing its first promotional video.</p>
<p>The video recreated a classic scene from the movie.</p>
<p>The game's male protagonist infiltrates the armed militants' skyscraper base to rescue trapped comrades.</p>
<p>And ultimately defeats the evil forces.</p>
<p>Especially the final skyscraper explosion, combined with the tense and exciting music, was very powerful.</p>
<p>The original movie actually neared its end at this point.</p>
<p>But obviously, the game wouldn't follow the movie's plot entirely, as a two-hour storyline would struggle to support a dozen or even twenty-plus hours of main quest experience.</p>
<p>So, subsequent plot expansion was an inevitable matter.</p>
<p>In the video, the aftermath of this crisis saw the camera instantly switch to a dark basement.</p>
<p>At the same time, the male protagonist's incredulous voice came through: </p>
