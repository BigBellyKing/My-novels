                <p>Chapter 314: God Has Mercy, Fuze Does Not (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>As Song Ren and his five-person squad stood ready.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Alpha-numeric squad, now switched from defenders to attackers, appeared relatively relaxed.</p>
<p>"We got this!" Pulse, who had been the unlucky one in the first match, was now smiling brightly.</p>
<p>Especially in the last round, his Remote Charge had directly blown up three people, though one of them was his own teammate.</p>
<p>"But this game's maps are really convoluted; we couldn't even find the bomb's location."</p>
<p>"It should be on the first or second floor, I went to the basement but couldn't find it."</p>
<p>Sledge and Ash from the team spoke up.</p>
<p>"Not gonna lie, this game is actually pretty fun."</p>
<p>"Save the bragging for later, let's finish up quickly, I'm about to eat."</p>
<p>Blackbeard and Buck from the squad also spoke.</p>
<p>This round, the players were more relaxed. Of course, learning from Song Ren's painful lesson, none of them chose to play with shields or similar equipment.</p>
<p>For their Operators, only Pulse, who was previously a defender, chose Fuze, the same Operator their opponents had used in the last round.</p>
<p>"The enemy must be on the third floor, look, that panel has been replaced!" Pulse, now playing as Fuze, sharply noticed the difference and alerted his team.</p>
<p>"Alright, we'll slowly move upstairs through the interior. You'll use your grappling hook to breach the window, we'll hit them from both inside and out, and show them what a true counter-terrorism unit looks like!" The team's leader, the "Shock Brother" who had turned the tide earlier, was playing Sledge this round and explained to everyone.</p>
<p>With clear roles assigned, the four, led by Sledge, cautiously advanced towards the second floor, breaking down doors and wary of ambushes.</p>
<p>They steadily pushed towards the second floor, seemingly having forgotten about the drones.</p>
<p>This is a common occurrence for many new players transitioning from other games to Rainbow Six Siege: they often overlook the use of drones.</p>
<p>But if you were to say new players don't prioritize intelligence gathering, then as defenders, everyone was diligently watching the cameras.</p>
<p>They'd flop onto the ground, pull out their phones, and start watching the surveillance.</p>
<p>Joey, in the nursery, also gave a warning.</p>
<p>"They're on the second floor!"</p>
<p>"Stand ready! Joey, keep monitoring, don't alert them! If the room stands, we stand; if the room falls, we fall! We shall live and die with this mansion!" Song Ren whispered.</p>
<p>Everyone's muzzles were pointed at the main entrance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Fuze, acting alone, was having a grand time. The three-armor, one-speed Fuze was indeed a bit slow, and his footsteps were incredibly loud, but he wasn't worried about being heard; in fact, it served to divert others' attention.</p>
<p>Hitting the ceiling with his grappling hook, Fuze slowly began to climb upwards.</p>
<p>Soon he reached the second floor, where he was studying his Operator's abilities.</p>
<p>Playing this Operator for the first time, he still didn't know how to properly use him.</p>
<p>By this time, the others had also reached the second floor. Although there was a bomb right inside the studio across the wall, they had no idea due to their unfamiliarity with the map.</p>
<p>Everyone's attention was drawn to the children's bedroom in front of them.</p>
<p>Inside the room, Joey no longer checked the cameras, knowing that the opponents were all at the doorway.</p>
<p>Outside, the Alpha-numeric squad had already aimed down sights, standing ready.</p>
<p>"Soon, I'll smash open the door with Sledge. Buck, have your flashbang ready. Whether we survive their blinding suppression fire is up to fate. Don't stop moving, even if we die, we die inside the room!" Sledge outlined the upcoming assault tactics.</p>
<p>"Also, Fuze, you might have it a bit tough, because we need you to initiate. Fire a shot as the signal! The moment you shoot to draw their attention, you might get killed, but we'll rush in then to finish the job." Sledge said.</p>
<p>"No problem!" Fuze hadn't quite figured out his ability yet, but upon hearing his teammate's plan, he firmly declared his commitment to execute it.</p>
<p>It's just a suicide mission! For the team's victory, he was willing!</p>
<p>"Ready, I'm starting!" Fuze, outside the room, took a deep breath. However, he didn't opt for a simple gunshot; instead, he prepared to pull off a trick.</p>
<p>It was the explosive entry he'd seen in the promotional trailer, something he hadn't tried yet.</p>
<p>"This should be my ability, right?" Looking at the circular device in his hand, he was a bit unsure, but he didn't overthink it. After all, wasn't he just cannon fodder?</p>
<p>"Ready, I'm starting!" Jamming the device onto the reinforced panels, his feet braced against the wall, Fuze was visibly excited.</p>
<p>In the VR version's explosive air drop mechanic, Chen Xu had made modifications different from his previous life; it didn't require the use of breaching charges.</p>
<p>One could directly perform a flying kick air drop. While a flying kick wouldn't breach reinforced panels, it would trigger a corresponding animation, and Fuze was now doing just that.</p>
<p>"Fire your shot as the signal! We're waiting for you!" Sledge outside stood ready.</p>
<p>"Alright, let's begin!! Urah!!!!!!" As Fuze is a Russian Operator, his player shouted a characteristic line with great immersion at that moment.</p>
<p>While shooting in the air, he took out the remote control.</p>
<p>But the expected explosion didn't occur. Instead, there was a '咚咚咚咚咚咚…' (Thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump...)</p>
<p>This made him freeze for a moment.</p>
<p>Inside the room, Zhang Yi heard the 'thump-thump-thump' sound and suddenly panicked.</p>
<p>Damn it, he had played Fuze in the very first round, and that sound was all too familiar.</p>
<p>But could Fuze really breach reinforced panels?!</p>
<p>"Run! The cluster charge is coming!" Zhang Yi cried out in alarm, controlling his character to stand up from a crouched position.</p>
<p>At that moment, Sledge outside instantly breached the door, and four burly men burst in.</p>
<p>Influenced by that "Urah!" shout, the Sledge player also got into character the moment he breached the door.</p>
<p>Although the game didn't have open voice chat for all players, it didn't stop him from performing!</p>
<p>"FBI! Open The Door!"</p>
<p>Accompanied by the spirited cry, the four rushed into the room.</p>
<p>'Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p>
<p>[123 triggered friendly fire]</p>
<p>[123 killed himself]</p>
<p>[123 killed abc]</p>
<p>[123 killed qwe]</p>
<p>............</p>
<p>[Player 123's behavior in the match has been detected as malicious. They have been removed from the game and banned for 30 minutes as a warning. All Operators are requested to treat new players kindly for harmonious gameplay and to cherish their accounts.]</p>
<p>[Draw]</p>
<p>Unlike the previous life's setting where both sides received 1 point for a draw, Chen Xu opted for draws to award no points, maintaining the status quo as if the round hadn't happened.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, no one cared about the rare draw; everyone was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Fuze, nine kills?</p>
<p>No, Fuze, ten kills!</p>
<p>When he got serious, he even killed himself!</p>
<p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>As for outside the internet cafe, everyone who witnessed the scene burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Inside the game, with one teammate down, the four opponents fell silent for a moment before collectively exiting the match.</p>
<p>In a five-player premade mode, no random players would fill the spots.</p>
<p>With the enemies gone, Song Ren's team directly secured the victory and proceeded to the final settlement screen.</p>
<p>But by then, Song Ren and his team no longer cared about winning or losing; the image of that recent scene was still vivid in their minds.</p>
