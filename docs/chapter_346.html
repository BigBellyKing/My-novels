<p><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>'s popularity continued to soar.</p>
<p>Especially after most players experienced the story and then entered multiplayer versus, it became unstoppable.</p>
<p>The number of online players in multiplayer mode grew at an alarming rate.</p>
<p>Its fast-paced style, completely different from previous FPS games, instantly attracted a large number of FPS players.</p>
<p>Moreover, compared to the previous <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> was clearly much easier to pick up.</p>
<p>Just grab a gun and go; there's no economic system, so any weapon you want can be used directly after unlocking, complemented by a rich attachment system.</p>

<p>There's also Survival Mode, where players, solo or in teams, defend a single point against waves of enemies until they're eliminated.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu did not include modes like Ground War mode.</p>
<p>Because that mode was truly hard to describe. Combined with the inherent characteristics of killstreak rewards and the map design, it essentially turned into sniper battles, with players camping in rooms for what felt like a year.</p>
