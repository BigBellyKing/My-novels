                <p>Chapter 228: A True Miracle (Sixth update, seeking subscriptions and monthly tickets)</p>
<p>While Chen Xu and his team were conducting maintenance for “Minecraft” and developing its mobile and VR versions.</p>
<p>“Minecraft”'s unique gameplay attracted more and more players.</p>
<p>Initially, most players were focused on researching how to build beautiful small houses.</p>
<p>But as time progressed, many pro players had already discovered the ingenious uses of the Redstone system.</p>
<p>Like a puzzle, Redstone torches served to continuously send signals.</p>
<p>Doors, music boxes, and dispensers, on the other hand, were objects that opened when they received a signal and closed when there was no signal.</p>
<p>Levers and pressure plates were easy to understand; they were simply switches.</p>
<p>Repeaters functioned to regulate signals, because Redstone signals would lose strength after a certain distance, but with repeaters, they could be boosted to their maximum state.</p>
<p>Although no players had yet created things like calculators or pianos.</p>
<p>Simple facilities like automatic chicken farms, small minecarts, and signal doors had already been successfully built by players.</p>
<p>At the same time, some players exploring the adventure content of “Minecraft” also discovered a gameplay mechanic that could make them “bald” (frustrated): Enchanting.</p>
<p>Moreover, various kinds of temples existed in forests, deserts, and underwater.</p>
<p>Of course, some unlucky kids, upon seeing a desert temple for the first time, jumped straight down without a second thought, and were promptly educated by TNT.</p>
<p>These videos sparked heated discussion on “Minecraft”'s official forum.</p>
<p>‘Mom asked me why I was kneeling while watching the video!’</p>
<p>‘We all bought the game for 68 Yuan, so why is yours different from mine?’</p>
<p>‘I think I bought the wrong game; I'm playing “Minecraft”, but what world are you guys playing in?’</p>
<p>‘Holy cow, you can even play it like this?’</p>
<p>‘Seriously, selling this game for 68 Yuan to your Mr. Chen is a huge loss!’</p>
<p>‘Damn it, I'm still a caveman, living in a primitive society, and you guys have already entered the Industrial Age!?’</p>
<p>‘+1 for cavemen, I'm still working hard to build my own structure with my bare hands, and you guys are already setting up chicken farms and minecarts?’</p>
<p>Watching videos of various master players showing off, many players also joked online.</p>
<p>They said that what they were playing was “Minecraft,” while what these other people were playing was “Others' World”—they were practically two different games!</p>
<p>Of course, despite saying that, it didn't dampen these players' enthusiasm in the slightest.</p>
<p>Because any player could find their own unique fun in “Minecraft.”</p>
<p>This was all thanks to “Minecraft”'s unique characteristics.</p>
<p>The game itself didn't give you a so-called objective; everything was just the objective you set for yourself.</p>
<p>This extremely free gameplay style could be said to be unprecedented.</p>
<p>Coupled with its special game mechanics, the game was filled with all sorts of incredible gameplay, also sparking many ideas among players.</p>
<p>It truly validated the statement from the promotional video: the wider a player's imagination, the more fun the game becomes.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>A miracle.</p>
<p>This was the definition that game designers in the industry had given to “Minecraft” over the past month.</p>
<p>Not only PC designers, but also game designers specializing in the VR field, were dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Because in this past month, the power displayed by “Minecraft” had truly astonished everyone as a miracle.</p>
<p>It was simply incredible.</p>
<p>If the first-day sales of 3 million and first-week sales of 10 million were impressive, that would be one thing.</p>
<p>After all, there was no shortage of games in history that had achieved such results.</p>
<p>But the crucial point was “Minecraft”'s subsequent development; generally, after an explosive sales increase in the first week, the second week's sales would likely plummet dramatically, with halving being a relatively good outcome.</p>
<p>However, “Minecraft” was different; although its second-week sales declined, they were unusually stable.</p>
<p>This allowed “Minecraft”'s cumulative sales over two weeks to reach an impressive 17 million.</p>
<p>And there was no sign of it slowing down.</p>
<p>Similarly, it wasn't just domestically; the overseas version of “Minecraft” also launched two and a half weeks after the domestic release, priced at $14.9.</p>
<p>Initially, foreign players who knew Nebula Games, this developer, were very confused.</p>
<p>After all, before this, the developer had created “Dark Souls.”</p>
<p>Why had they suddenly developed a pixel-style game?</p>
<p>But after players paid attention to the game, they were immediately stunned.</p>
<p>Because when “Minecraft” launched overseas, Target Software directly <em>cosplayed</em> Nebula Games, translating and bringing various shocking domestic videos directly to foreign audiences.</p>
<p>Before the game even launched, various classic domestic builds, tutorial videos, and Redstone technology videos had their view counts explode.</p>
<p>This simultaneously ignited the popularity of “Minecraft.”</p>
<p>Within one week of “Minecraft”'s overseas launch, its sales had already reached 13 million.</p>
<p>And its subsequent trend was almost identical to the domestic market, steadily progressing.</p>
<p>Although it was indeed slowly declining, the decline was very limited.</p>
<p>It was as if this game possessed an extraordinary magic.</p>
<p>Although its price was similar to most independent games, this was no longer important in the face of its astounding sales.</p>
<p>After “Minecraft” burst forth with a sales miracle, major media outlets were filled with praise for the game.</p>
<p>Even the domestic Game Department unprecedentedly published a review.</p>
<p>‘It's impossible to find another game as unique as “Minecraft.”’</p>
<p>‘This is a game about blocks and adventure, though saying that might be too superficial. In this special game, players can explore a randomly generated world alone and create astonishing miracles.’</p>
<p>‘Whether it's a cramped prison darkroom or a luxurious large villa, players can fully unleash their free imagination to create in the game.’</p>
<p>‘In Survival Mode, players will collect resources as much as possible to build bases and weapons to cope with unknown dangers; almost every player can find their own joy in the game.’</p>
<p>‘As mentioned in the previous promotional trailer, the only limit to this game's fun would be the players' imagination. From the current perspective, this is clearly incredibly accurate.’</p>
<p>‘If you ask what kind of game a sandbox game is, then “Minecraft” is undoubtedly the answer!’</p>
<p>This evaluation was undeniably high, practically equivalent to the Game Department directly endorsing and acknowledging “sandbox game” as a special category.</p>
<p>As for the various designers in the gaming industry, they were repeatedly researching the settings of “Minecraft.”</p>
<p>If previously some game designers had scoffed at this game.</p>
<p>Thinking, what kind of tricks could a pixel-style sandbox game pull off?</p>
<p>But now, no one held that attitude anymore, because facts had proven one thing.</p>
<p>That is, “Minecraft” not only pulled off tricks, but it pulled off tricks that were adored by thousands.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu, at the center of the discussion, wasn't too focused on the industry and media's reaction to “Minecraft” at this time.</p>
<p>Chen Xu was currently editing and producing a very meaningful video.</p>
<p>It was the first video documenting the history and major events created by players in “Minecraft.”</p>
