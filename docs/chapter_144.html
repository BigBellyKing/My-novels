                <p>Chapter 243: Preparing to Head to the New World! (Fifth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>On this day, an official Weibo post was made on Chen Xu's and Nebula Games' official Weibo accounts.</p>
<p>The content was very simple: 'Preparing to head to the New World!'</p>
<p>Countless players who had long been waiting impatiently were already thrilled just by seeing this single sentence.</p>
<p>"It's here, it's here! It's finally here!"</p>
<p>"I wonder what the gameplay of this game will be like!"</p>
<p>"Haha, it feels a bit exciting!"</p>
<p>"Heading to the New World! Time to hunt Ancient Dragons, I want to be the Azure Star!"</p>
<p>Filled with excitement, countless players eagerly clicked on the video.</p>
<p>First, there was a black screen, followed by Nebula Games' corresponding game LOGO, and a very prominent Nebula Games Platform logo.</p>
<p>Then came the main footage of the video.</p>
<p>A gentle breeze blew, and the vegetation rustled softly.</p>
<p>In a silent ancient forest, a Hunter, with a Great Sword on their back, walked through vines into the tranquil depths of the forest.</p>
<p>This was an island, where giant trees and vines formed an ancient jungle. Strange creatures and lush plants were everywhere, with hanging vines and dense grass.</p>
<p>Then, led by glowing green Scoutflies,</p>
<p>The Hunter ventured deeper and deeper into the forest.</p>
<p>Plants, birds, beasts.</p>
<p>Everything was unlike anything found in reality. Evidently, this was a completely new world, with nothing connected to real-world content.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at a Great Jagras's nest,</p>
<p>The Hunter started running outwards, simultaneously using an item in hand to attract the prey's attention. As the Jagras in the nest rose, the Hunter stealthily hid in the tall grass nearby. After all the Jagras dispersed, the Hunter continued to search for information.</p>
<p>Finally, after traversing the intricate forest, the Hunter at last found their prey: a colossal creature resembling a Tyrannosaurus Rex.</p>
<p>The camera gave it a close-up, and the accompanying subtitle introduction allowed players to understand its name: Anjanath.</p>
<p>The Hunter donned a Ghillie Mantle, like green leaves, and carefully approached the Anjanath. Seizing an opportunity, the Hunter launched an attack on the Anjanath, striking its head fiercely with the Great Sword.</p>
<p>However, it didn't inflict much effective damage; instead, it enraged the colossal beast. Letting out an earth-shattering roar, the Anjanath, having located the Hunter, charged forward with immense savagery. But all of this was already within the Hunter's calculations; the Hunter showed no panic at the charging Anjanath, performing two rolls on the ground to evade.</p>
<p>The Anjanath, which had been charging, was instead caught by a Vine Trap, falling to the ground. The Anjanath on the ground struggled, kicking its limbs trying to break free, while the Hunter seized this chance to deal heavy damage with the Great Sword.</p>
<p>As the Hunter's Great Sword hacked and slashed, the Anjanath soon became covered in wounds. However, the injured Anjanath did not weaken; instead, it grew even more frantic. Breaking free from the vines, the Anjanath relentlessly attacked the Hunter, who found it difficult to parry for a moment. Although seemingly at a disadvantage, the Hunter remained unperturbed, just as before, observing the surrounding environment while dodging the Anjanath's attacks.</p>
<p>Eventually, traversing forests and canyons, the Hunter led the Anjanath into the territory of another monster—the Rathalos.</p>
<p>The behemoth on the ground and the fire-breathing Rathalos in the sky immediately engaged in a fierce battle. Meanwhile, the Hunter had cautiously retreated from the battlefield.</p>
<p>Taking out a Flare, the Hunter fired it into the sky.</p>
<p>The camera switched, revealing three Wingdrakes in the sky. They flew towards the outside of the forest. A moment later, the three Wingdrakes returned the way they came. Below the Wingdrakes, three Hunters, each carrying a Long Sword, were descending by grappling claws.</p>
<p>As the Three Longsword Heroes descended from the sky, they left behind three dashing figures. Then the camera returned to the Rathalos's camp, where the Anjanath and Rathalos were still fighting. The Hunter, by now, had hidden far away and, pulling out a Folding Stool and a Portable Grill from somewhere, was diligently preparing roast meat.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the game's title appeared in the center of the screen.</p>
<p>"Monster Hunter: World"!</p>
<p>Then, accompanied by a roar from the Rathalos, a burst of flames erupted from its mouth. The next moment, a line of text appeared in the center of the screen: "Trial Version available August 1st."</p>
<p>Amidst the cheerful BGM, the Hunter finally finished roasting the meat. The golden, crispy roast meat was even dripping with oil. As the Hunter devoured the meat, another line of text appeared in the center of the screen: "Monster Hunter: World" officially launches August 7th.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>The first-ever promotional video immediately thrilled players. Before this, many players had various speculations about the game. But those were just guesses.</p>
<p>Now, the appearance of this promotional video had many players incredibly excited. If it were a promotional video from another game developer, players might not be so thrilled, but this was Nebula Games! Every promotional video from them was basically indistinguishable from the actual content and could be regarded as an Actual Gameplay Demonstration. That's why players were so excited. Moreover, from this video, it basically showcased the gameplay and complete ecosystem of "Monster Hunter: World."</p>
<p>In terms of setting, the main scenario of "Monster Hunter: World" was a dense forest, with monsters primarily consisting of dragon-like creatures. Furthermore, in the game, "Monster Hunter: World" also demonstrated its gameplay. Searching for prey and hunting, it could be said to be quite comprehensive.</p>
<p>Another aspect was the combat system. It mainly used melee weapons, but judging by the attack patterns in the game, it didn't seem like the simple Basic Attack from "Dark Souls." It appeared to have more complex combo attacks, similar to the input commands in fighting and action games, and players could also use traps on the map to attack monsters. They could even pull off a "Borrowed Knife to Kill," letting other monsters help them deal with prey.</p>
<p>Finally, the appearance of the Wingdrakes bringing three Long Sword teammates represented the game's online multiplayer gameplay. As for the roast meat in the game, it indicated that the game also had some mini-games, not just hunting.</p>
<p>Of course, the most exciting point for players was the direct announcement of the launch date at the end of the promotional video. And just like with "Minecraft" before, players could download and experience a trial version.</p>
<p>However, a slight difference was that according to the introduction, this trial experience version was just for players to understand the game and was available for anyone to download. This was clearly to allow players to get a clearer picture of what kind of game "Monster Hunter: World" truly was. If it suited their taste, they could pre-order; if not, then so be it.</p>
