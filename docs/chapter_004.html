                <p>Chapter 4 Helper</p>
<p>Chen Xu's old face couldn't help but redden upon hearing Ruan Ningxue's words.</p>
<p>In an instant, however, Chen Xu recomposed himself, lightly coughed to diffuse the awkward atmosphere, and then began to think of excuses.</p>
<p>"Well, this... it's mainly due to multiple reasons..."</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue, sitting across the table, couldn't help but purse her lips.</p>
<p>A man's mouth, a deceiving devil!</p>
<p>"However, I can accept all the conditions you mentioned, but in return, I also have one request!"</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue said, looking at Chen Xu with a beaming smile.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Chen Xu was momentarily stunned.</p>
<p>He was still wondering how to persuade her.</p>
<p>Approaching her, Chen Xu didn't actually have much confidence initially; he just wanted to give it a try.</p>
<p>After all, he knew his own situation. Money?</p>
<p>He certainly couldn't produce any now. If he did, he wouldn't be able to make the game later.</p>
<p>After all, there were still some essential resources he needed to purchase.</p>
<p>Relying on the junior-senior relationship?</p>
<p>But she wasn't related to him, nor did she have an obligation to help him. Besides, it sounded suspiciously like drawing a big pie.</p>
<p>But now, there's a chance?</p>
<p>"What's your request, senior sister?" Chen Xu asked Ruan Ningxue.</p>
<p>"One month's time, and if your game's sales aren't good afterward, you'll have to come work for me!"</p>
<p>"At least two contracts! Of course, in terms of compensation, I certainly won't be thinking of freeloading off your labor like you, junior."</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue said with a smile.</p>
<p>Hearing Ruan Ningxue's words, Chen Xu was stunned for a moment, then came back to his senses.</p>
<p>As for doujinshi, Chen Xu didn't have too many thoughts. After all, in his previous life, there were quite a few female doujinshi artists.</p>
<p>For example, 'Yuzuki N', 'Nishizawa 5', <em>cough, cough</em>... Actually, Chen Xu didn't know any of these artists or their works, let alone seen them; he'd only heard about them from friends.</p>
<p>"So what kind of sales would be considered 'not good'?" Chen Xu asked Ruan Ningxue, having regained his composure.</p>
<p>If she were to mention sales in the millions, Chen Xu truly wouldn't have much confidence.</p>
<p>After all, this was a Parallel World, vastly different from the game environment of his previous life.</p>
<p>Although the factor of piracy was gone, the market itself was also different from his previous life.</p>
<p>Without capital for promotion and operation, relying solely on organic word-of-mouth from players would be extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Including highly acclaimed Independent Games from his previous life that sold millions, even tens of millions of copies.</p>
<p>But upon closer inspection, it would be found that many of these games only became popular half a year to a year later.</p>
<p>They were all largely unknown at first.</p>
<p>Even powerful titles like The Binding of Isaac were largely unknown in their early stages.</p>
<p>After all, even good wine fears a deep alley.</p>
<p>So, if Ruan Ningxue mentioned a million copies in sales, Chen Xu felt he'd rather go it alone.</p>
<p>Because if he agreed, the game he was currently planning to make would most likely lead him to become a doujinshi artist.</p>
<p>"Eh... 100,000, um, 50,000 then!"</p>
<p>"Within 1 month after release, if sales don't exceed 50,000, then you lose!"</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue took out her phone, seemingly sending a message.</p>
<p>After about a minute, Ruan Ningxue looked up and stated a number.</p>
<p>Hearing Ruan Ningxue's words, Chen Xu couldn't help but reveal a confident smile.</p>
<p>50,000 sales in one month?</p>
<p>Even though the game environment was slightly different from his previous life, and he didn't have much start-up capital.</p>
<p>But regarding this number, Chen Xu could only say it was an absolute giveaway.</p>
<p>"No problem." Chen Xu agreed straightforwardly.</p>
<p>"Then, senior sister, let's officially start tomorrow! I'll go back to do some preparation work first. See you tomorrow morning!"</p>
<p>After saying that, he waved goodbye to Ruan Ningxue, not giving her time to react.</p>
<p>Chen Xu simply turned and left the coffee shop.</p>
<p>Leaving behind only a still slightly dazed Ruan Ningxue.</p>
<p>Did I... perhaps say too little?</p>
<p>Thinking this, Ruan Ningxue quickly opened her contacts, found a phone number, and dialed it.</p>
<p>After two seconds, the other party connected.</p>
<p>"Sister Xin, you weren't tricking me just now, were you? Are 50,000 sales in 1 month really considered very high?" Ruan Ningxue wondered, recalling Chen Xu's confident demeanor just now.</p>
<p>A crisp female voice came from the phone: "No, it's not high, but that's relative. Weren't you asking how many sales would be considered high if someone was making a game for the first time and didn't have much money?"</p>
<p>"No money, first-time game maker, and hardly any engine resources available to a Game Designer—this is practically a hell-mode start! 50,000 sales would be S-rank difficulty. A few thousand sales in 1 month would be considered passing."</p>
<p>"Really?" Ruan Ningxue was skeptical.</p>
<p>"Of course, it's true. This is the judgment of a professional Gaming Industry Professional!"</p>
<p>"By the way, Xiaoxue, are you planning to make a game? Have you thought it through? I told you, if you come and help me with original art design and character illustrations, we can definitely make a big splash!"</p>
<p>Yang Xin on the other end of the phone sounded extremely excited.</p>
<p>"Sister Xin, Sister Xin? What are you saying? The signal here isn't good, let's talk later!"</p>
<p>Hearing the excited voice from the other end of the phone, Ruan Ningxue's expression subtly changed. She held the phone further away, said a couple of words, hung up, and then let out a long breath.</p>
<p>Then, recalling what Yang Xin had said on the phone, Ruan Ningxue couldn't help but smile.</p>
<p>First-time game developer, no money, hell-level difficulty—all these labels were now firmly attached to Chen Xu.</p>
<p>So, the problem of finding her own helper was finally solved!</p>
<p>The only slight regret was that this helper wouldn't officially start for another two months.</p>
<p>After bidding Ruan Ningxue farewell, Chen Xu returned to his apartment.</p>
<p>After tidying up his room simply, Chen Xu sat in front of his desk, looking at his laptop.</p>
<p>As a development machine, the computer's configuration was decent, at least sufficient for the Mirror (Game) project.</p>
<p>Of course, Chen Xu was currently completely unable to develop larger games.</p>
<p>Because he simply had no money, and his resource permissions for the official engine were insufficient.</p>
<p>As for resource permissions, there were essentially two ways to upgrade them.</p>
<p>The first was to become an officially certified Game Designer and advance one's Job Title.</p>
<p>As for how to advance?</p>
<p>Game sales and awards received were all points that could be included in the evaluation.</p>
<p>The second way was much simpler and more direct: directly use Money Power. How many resources you could use depended on how strong your Money Power was.</p>
<p>However, none of these things were important to Chen Xu at the moment.</p>
<p>Moreover, a game like Mirror (Game) wouldn't require much.</p>
<p>At least the resources Chen Xu could currently use were definitely sufficient.</p>
<p>Sitting in front of the computer, Chen Xu worked on the initial draft for Mirror (Game), which was the game design document.</p>
<p>Although Chen Xu was the only developer, Ruan Ningxue was only handling illustrations.</p>
<p>But that didn't mean Concept Drafts weren't needed.</p>
<p>Just like an outline for an essay, it could greatly improve efficiency.</p>
