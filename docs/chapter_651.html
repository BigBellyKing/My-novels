                <h2>Chapter 650: The Battle for Darrowshire (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h2>
<p>To continue this quest, it was necessary to help the little girl Pamela find her rag doll.</p>
<p>While not difficult, it was quite troublesome.</p>
<p>Because the rag doll had fallen into pieces, and during the search, they would encounter the ghosts of the surrounding residents.</p>
<p>However, after helping Pamela retrieve her beloved doll, the little girl also became happy.</p>
<p>'Thank you, you found it! You found my doll! Hooray, my doll, you'll help me scare away the bad guys, won't you!' Pamela raised the tattered doll, revealing a brilliant smile.</p>
<p>Then the little girl hoped Song Ren and his team would continue to help her find her aunt and Uncle Karlin.</p>
<p>In a place called Sorrow Hill in the Western Plaguelands, Song Ren and his group found Pamela's aunt. However, her aunt had also become a ghost.</p>
<p>Upon learning that Pamela had sent Song Ren's group to find her, she quieted down and told the players everything that had happened behind Darrowshire.</p>
<p>It turned out that many years ago, when the Scourge invaded Lordaeron, Darrowshire's connection with the Alliance main force was cut off.</p>
<p>At that time, there was only a team of Paladins in the small town, along with soldiers led by Pamela's father, Captain Joseph Redpath. Facing the Scourge's invasion, the people of Darrowshire fought desperately.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Captain Joseph Redpath and the coordination of the local Paladin garrison, they bravely fought, crushing the Scourge's attacks again and again.</p>
<p>But without any reinforcements, facing the Scourge's overwhelming assault, like a tide.</p>
<p>Pamela's father, Captain Joseph Redpath, had his soul controlled by dark magic in one battle, becoming another minion of the Scourge and betraying them in the midst of battle, ultimately leading to Darrowshire's downfall.</p>
<p>As the little girl Pamela's quest progressed,</p>
<p>Song Ren and his team's focus was no longer on the quest rewards.</p>
<p>Instead, their attention was centered on the story's plot.</p>
<p>They wanted to help the innocent and adorable little girl Pamela as much as possible.</p>
<p>Next, they found a ring buried beneath Joseph's tombstone in the graveyard, then headed to the northwest of Andorhal.</p>
<p>In the abandoned inn, they found the Gnome Priest Chromie.</p>
<p>Chromie told the players that it might be possible to save the souls of the enslaved warriors and residents, including Pamela's father, Captain Joseph.</p>
<p>However, what they currently had was not enough to awaken Captain Joseph Redpath.</p>
<p>To save him, they could only use a medium and a ritual to return to Darrowshire's past. Only then would it be possible to save the warrior's soul.</p>
<p>So, in the town center of Andorhal, everyone found a book item titled 'The History of Darrowshire.'</p>
<p>It recorded the events that had occurred in Darrowshire in even greater detail.</p>
<p>What followed was a rather long journey of item collection. First, they went to Light's Hope Chapel to find Captain Joseph's brother Karlin, and then they had to find Paladin Davi's Libram and Captain Joseph's shield.</p>
<p>It was quite cumbersome, to say the least. If Song Ren and Zhang Yi had known how troublesome this quest would be from the start, they wouldn't have undertaken it at all.</p>
<p>Just like the previous follow-up quest they received in the Plaguelands from a level 61 elite named Tirion Fordring.</p>
<p>It was simply impossibly bothersome. Of course, that NPC's dialogue at the time left a deep impression.</p>
<p>'Race does not define honor. I have seen some Orcs who were as honorable as the noblest Knights; I have also seen some Humans who were as evil as the most cruel Scourge.'</p>
<p>This line of dialogue also left a deep impression on Song Ren. Just as there were good and bad among the Horde, the same was true for the Alliance.</p>
<p>However, the continuation of that NPC's quest was absolutely infuriating, requiring them to enter Stratholme.</p>
<p>Although this Darrowshire quest was not simple either.</p>
<p>Corroded Skull, Mysterious Crystal, Hogger's Head, Marduk's Shattered Sword, Relics of the Battle of Darrowshire.</p>
<p>They traveled tirelessly, traversing the entire Plaguelands.</p>
<p>Finally, they handed these ritual items to the Gnome Priest Chromie.</p>
<p>Chromie gravely informed Song Ren and his team that if they wished to save Captain Joseph Redpath's soul,</p>
<p>They had to meet several conditions.</p>
<p>Ensure Davi survived before Hogger's death, ensure Captain Joseph Redpath survived before his fall, and then defeat the fallen Captain Joseph Redpath.</p>
<p>After confirming these key points, guided by Chromie, Song Ren placed the bundled relics in the center of the square.</p>
<p>The souls of Darrowshire's residents were awakened, and they would once again participate in the battle they had once fought.</p>
<p>As the magical ritual progressed, countless ghosts of Darrowshire seemed to be fighting in the flames.</p>
<p>Countless Undead screamed, countless heroes roared.</p>
<p>The words spoken during the Darrowshire campaign were conveyed to Song Ren and his team through these souls.</p>
<p>'The kingdom has abandoned us, we have no hope!'</p>
<p>The bewildered shouts of Darrowshire's guards echoed in their ears.</p>
<p>It was the helplessness of fighting to the death yet unable to achieve victory, the despair of resisting to the end only to be massacred.</p>
<p>'Where are the Knights of the Silver Hand? We need their help!'</p>
<p>The desperate soldiers cried out, repelling the Scourge again and again, only to face even fiercer attacks.</p>
<p>Perhaps they didn't know that all information about Darrowshire could not be transmitted.</p>
<p>But even so, these warriors continued to fight until the last moment, defending Darrowshire and their homes.</p>
<p>With Chromie's spell, the spirits of Darrowshire were awakened, reliving once more the war they would never forget.</p>
<p>The Scourge attacked again, and the alarm bells of Darrowshire rang out.</p>
<p>Countless soldiers picked up their weapons, defending against the Scourge's advance at every intersection of the small town.</p>
<p>Raging skeletons, evil Undead, the Scourge surged like a tide.</p>
<p>Darrowshire's defenses appeared so fragile.</p>
<p>Even though Song Ren and his team held their ground, they still felt overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The endless Scourge, like a tide, seemed capable of devouring everything.</p>
<p>Kill one, and two more would appear; everything was so despairing.</p>
<p>As Darrowshire's defenses steadily retreated, a resolute voice echoed through Darrowshire.</p>
<p>'Darrowshire, do not give up hope! We will not fail!'</p>
<p>It was the Knights of the Silver Hand stationed in Darrowshire. With the addition of the Paladin squad led by Davi, the Scourge's advance immediately stalled.</p>
<p>Clusters of Holy Light shone along the town's defensive line. The Holy Light was like a stimulant, injecting hope and vitality into everyone's hearts.</p>
<p>'Davi! The Light illuminates your heart, and I will tear it out!'</p>
<p>The Ghoul King Hogger also joined the fray, and the Scourge's offensive immediately intensified.</p>
<p>The Holy Light's defensive circle showed signs of collapsing. Davi immediately led several knights to charge at Hogger.</p>
<p>Seeing Davi surrounded by the Ghoul King's forces, Song Ren and his team immediately rushed to assist.</p>
<p>'Hogger is dead! Rally, guardians of Darrowshire!'</p>
<p>With the help of Song Ren's team, Hogger's head was cut off.</p>
<p>But the Ghoul King's poison was about to claim Davi's life.</p>
<p>Even the Holy Light could not save Davi's corrupted body.</p>
<p>As the war continued, Captain Joseph Redpath loudly encouraged the soldiers.</p>
<p>'Guardians of Darrowshire! Gather! We must defeat them!'</p>
<p>Under Joseph's leadership, morale soared again.</p>
<p>Persevere, just a little longer, just a little more, and Darrowshire could be held!</p>
<p>But the next moment, a Skeletal Warhorse, accompanied by dark mist, appeared on the battlefield.</p>
<p>A Death Knight in black helmet and black armor emerged.</p>
<p>'Redpath! Join us!'</p>
<p>Dumac's longsword swung. The next moment, Captain Joseph Redpath's body was engulfed in a dark aura, struggling and half-kneeling on the ground.</p>
<p>Under Dumac's evil magic, Joseph Redpath fell.</p>
<p>'Darrowshire! This is fate!' the fallen Captain Joseph Redpath said coldly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, screams and cries filled the air, and Darrowshire seemed to plunge into a terrifying hell.</p>
<p>Historically, Darrowshire was annihilated by the fallen Joseph Redpath's betrayal in battle.</p>
<p>But now, with Song Ren and his team's involvement, history would not repeat itself. Joseph Redpath and the souls of Darrowshire's people would be saved.</p>
