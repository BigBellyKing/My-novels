                <p>Chapter 290: You Can Do That?! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>"Ah! What's happening?"</p>
<p>"Sookbn lost again? Is Mr. Chen really that formidable?"</p>
<p>On the main commentary stage, Huang Donglai looked utterly bewildered; this was completely beyond his expectations!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sun Yixie next to him was chuckling. Seeing his good brother's bewildered expression, he offered comfort on the surface, but his words subtly fanned the flames.</p>
<p>"Oh, Brother Huang, it's perfectly normal to make a wrong prediction before the match."</p>
<p>"And Mr. Chen really has a trick up his sleeve. Who would've thought of this Night Elf mining harassment? Plus, Brother Huang, you're not a professional player after all, so misreading the situation is quite normal," Sun Yixie said with a smile to Huang Donglai.</p>
<p>"No, no, Brother Sun, I still think my perspective is correct. Of course, Mr. Chen definitely has some skills, but I still stand by my previous opinion: haven't you noticed that Mr. Chen's operational skill is actually a bit weaker than that of professional players?"</p>
<p>"Naturally, Mr. Chen is only a Game Designer, and the actual tactical performance of the Night Elves just now, I believe, surprised not only us but all players, including professional players. These pro players definitely won't underestimate Mr. Chen anymore."</p>
<p>"In such a situation, Mr. Chen's skill is definitely going to suffer a big loss," Huang Donglai analyzed rationally as a professional commentator and streamer.</p>
<p>Of course, he didn't forget to emphasize to the viewers what today's livestream was all about.</p>
<p>"So, Brother Huang, you think Mr. Chen will lose this round?" Sun Yixie subtly fanned the flames.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's not 'think,' it's 'definitely'! Sookbn before must have been an exception. I admit Mr. Chen is strong, but facing a pro player going all out, I think Mr. Chen will still struggle. Of course, that's fine, because even if Mr. Chen loses, he will still be glorious; as a Game Designer, Mr. Chen has done everything he can."</p>
<p>"Next, he's facing Lü Bu! Lü Fengxian! And with Sookbn already having lost, Satellite will undoubtedly be cautious and ready for battle. How can Mr. Chen win in this situation?" Huang Donglai stated, believing a professional commentator should have professional integrity.</p>
<p>He believed everything his eyes saw, because in the previous match between Chen Xu and Sookbn, he could tell that while Chen Xu's skills were indeed very good, there was still a slight gap compared to the top-tier professional players.</p>
<p>So, as a professional commentator, he bravely stated his understanding.</p>
<p>At this moment, the game had officially begun.</p>
<p>As for the map, it was NI, also known as the Northrend Islands.</p>
<p>This map had one major difference compared to the previous one.</p>
<p>The players' spawn points were fixed diagonally, with a neutral tavern in the middle.</p>
<p>And each player only had one expansion base next to them.</p>
<p>Satellite, playing as an Orc player in the game, slowly let out a breath of relief upon seeing this map.</p>
<p>On this map, he dared to say that if Chen Xu still used his previous mining strategy, he would surely be doomed!</p>
<p>The only variable was that his opponent was playing as Humans.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he chose a single burrow to perform a default Orc opening.</p>
<p>"It's the same single burrow fast tech, with Blademaster as the first hero, just like before. But note the very tricky position of Satellite's burrow; he chose a backward position close to the gold mine."</p>
<p>"Why place it there? Because this map has a tavern, to prevent the opponent from getting a Beastmaster to harass. And at this moment, the fourth Peon has come out, and Satellite immediately chose to scout."</p>
<p>"Satellite calculated everything!" The main focus on the field was on Satellite, and Huang Donglai analyzed the current situation.</p>
<p>But soon the view switched to Chen Xu's side, and like most ordinary players, he himself was a bit confused.</p>
<p>"Eh! Looking at Mr. Chen's build order here, it's Barracks first, then Farm, then Altar. The starting Footman is defaulting to scouting the tavern. Is he still planning to summon a neutral creep, a Beastmaster?"</p>
<p>"Eh! What's happening? The Lumber Mill is up, six Peasants immediately transformed into Militia and are heading towards Satellite's base. He summoned a neutral hero, the Firelord. What is going on?!"</p>
<p>Huang Donglai on the commentary desk stated that he couldn't understand it.</p>
<p>Equally bewildered was Satellite in the game.</p>
<p>He had a default opening. After the fourth Peon and the first Grunt and Blademaster came out, his scouting was complete at the center of the map. He saw a Human Footman near the tavern, which suggested a Human default opening with Barracks first, then a neutral hero. However, what he didn't expect was that the opponent directly chose a Firelord, which he didn't quite understand.</p>
<p>Wouldn't Archmage be better?</p>
<p>However, when he saw the second Footman behind it, and the swarm of Militia rushing over, Satellite became even more confused.</p>
<p>As a professional player, he had studied all the game's data. In that instant, he understood why the opponent didn't pick Archmage as the first hero, but Firelord instead.</p>
<p>Because at level one, Firelord is stronger than Archmage, and the Infernal summoned by Firelord also has a splitting characteristic; if not dealt with, it splits and doubles its combat power.</p>
<p>Also, starting directly with a neutral hero saves time and allows for an extra Human Footman.</p>
<p>But the key thing was, you want to take him out in one go with 1 hero, 2 Footmen, and 6 Militia?</p>
<p>You must be dreaming!</p>
<p>Militia aren't permanent.</p>
<p>Thinking this, Satellite immediately controlled his Blademaster to activate Wind Walk, ran over, and struck the Firelord with a slash.</p>
<p>In the early game, especially at level one, there was almost nothing that could contend with a Blademaster.</p>
<p>Satellite's idea was to draw the Militia's attention and buy some time.</p>
<p>But the next moment, Satellite was completely bewildered, because Chen Xu moved the Firelord to the side, but its direction was still towards his base. And with just that slight maneuver, it took two more slashes from his Blademaster, leaving it with only three-quarters of its health.</p>
<p>The bullet comments were also surprised.</p>
<p>'What's going on? Mr. Chen wants to all-in?'</p>
<p>'How can he all-in? Isn't that too fanciful?'</p>
<p>'Yeah, Firelord how can beat Blademaster in the early game? Even with Militia, there are only twenty seconds left. Once time's up, won't they all be easy targets for Blademaster?'</p>
<p>Chen Xu in the game, meanwhile, was smiling broadly.</p>
<p>Especially when he arrived at the Orc base and saw that very far-back burrow, he smiled even more widely.</p>
<p>Located next to the Orc Barracks, 800 yards away from the burrow (burrow attack range is 700 yards), 6 Peasants immediately began building Guard Towers.</p>
<p>This was also a characteristic of Humans: it cost lumber and gold, and multiple Peasants could build structures simultaneously.</p>
<p>Once a Guard Tower was completed, he upgraded it directly to an Arcane Tower without hesitation.</p>
<p>Before long, the second Guard Tower was also completed.</p>
<p>And the Lumber Mill at his base was also ready, so he immediately upgraded it to an Arrow Tower.</p>
<p>At this point, whether it was the players, the commentators, or Satellite on the field, everyone understood what was happening.</p>
<p>Building Defense Towers directly inside someone else's base, you can do that!?</p>
