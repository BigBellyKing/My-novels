                <p>“Qin Yi, the rice is burnt, and you're still chopping vegetables!”</p>
<p>“What am I supposed to do then? You said you'd wash the plates, but there isn't a single plate to put anything on! What else can I do but chop vegetables?”</p>
<p>“You're driving me crazy!”</p>
<p>“You're driving <em>me</em> crazy too!”</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games' office, Zhao Zhuo, responsible for level design, and Qin Yi, responsible for numerical design, had the following conversation.</p>
<p>This was the fourth such incident to arise during testing after the game DEMO was released.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, is this game of ours really for couples, meant to foster their relationship?” Yang Xin looked at Chen Xu with a very strange gaze.</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue, standing beside her, said nothing, but her head bobbing like a woodpecker fully conveyed that she shared Yang Xin's sentiment.</p>
<p>“Ahem, of course, it's not just for couples; friendships and brotherhood can also enjoy this game,” Chen Xu concluded earnestly.</p>
<p>“The reason it's like this is simply that Qin Yi and Zhao Zhuo are both quite competitive,” Chen Xu added.</p>
<p>“I just feel like something's not right,” Yang Xin muttered, looking at the <em>Overcooked</em> game screen in front of her.</p>
<p>At first, she felt this game was truly beloved by everyone.</p>
<p>But now?</p>
<p>She remained reserved because she had also played it.</p>
<p>Playing on easy difficulty and clearing levels wasn't much of a problem.</p>
<p>But when aiming for three stars, her blood pressure shot up instantly; sometimes she couldn't help but get a little frustrated.</p>
<p>“Alright, regarding the game's promotional video, Sister Xin, you and Senior Sister can keep an eye on it. I also have a media interview to attend,” Chen Xu said, changing the subject as he looked at the two who wanted to continue discussing <em>Overcooked</em> with him.</p>
<p>“Media interview?” Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue were a bit surprised.</p>
<p>“It's an exclusive interview with Game Timespace, also to prepare for the new game's promotion,” Chen Xu explained.</p>
<p>Hearing this, the two suddenly understood.</p>
<p>After a brief chat with Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin, Chen Xu headed towards the office.</p>
<p>This interview, although ostensibly for the promotion of <em>Overcooked</em>, was actually driven by the genuine interest of quite a few media outlets in him.</p>
<p>After all, in the broader gaming world, he still lagged a bit behind the top game designers and masters in terms of renown.</p>
<p>But at least within the independent game scene, the name Chen Xu still carried some weight.</p>
<p>“Teacher Chen, a pleasure to meet you! A pleasure!”</p>
<p>Pushing open the office door, Wu Tian, an editor from Game Timespace, greeted Chen Xu with an excited expression.</p>
<p>Ever since he accidentally encountered <em>Undertale</em> and experienced the shock it delivered, he had been quietly following Chen Xu. And Chen Xu's subsequent works had not disappointed him.</p>
<p><em>To the Moon</em> brought tears to even tough guys' eyes, and as for <em>Outlast</em>...</p>
<p>While personally, he wasn't particularly fond of horror games, he had to admit that it was an absolutely excellent horror game, one that could make even tough guys wet themselves.</p>
<p>One could say he had long admired Chen Xu as a game designer.</p>
<p>So, upon learning of the interview opportunity, he immediately applied to his editor for it.</p>
<p>“No need to call me Teacher Chen, just my name is fine,” Chen Xu said, feeling a bit awkward internally when Wu Tian called him “Teacher Chen.”</p>
<p>Although in his previous life, with the emergence of various rising stars, “Teacher Chen” and his glorious photos on his computer hard drive were no longer a big deal, in the photography industry, “Teacher Chen” was still considered a pioneering master.</p>
<p>So, whenever he heard people call him “Teacher Chen,” Chen Xu always felt the title sounded somewhat improper.</p>
<p>Wu Tian paused, a little unsure what to do, because from his perspective, “Teacher” was just an honorific, a perfectly normal address in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>“Uh... then Mr. Chen, first of all, thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to accept our interview.”</p>
<p>After a moment of thought, Wu Tian changed his address. Although he didn't know why Chen Xu disliked the title “Teacher,” he couldn't very well just call him by his first name.</p>
<p>“No need to be so tense or formal; we can just chat casually first,” Chen Xu said with a smile, taking a bottle of Coke from a nearby box and offering it to Wu Tian, then taking one for himself.</p>
<p>“Uh... o-okay,” Wu Tian replied, unconsciously taking the bottle of Coke and placing it in front of him, looking at the smiling Chen Xu.</p>
<p>“Well, let's start by discussing <em>Undertale</em>. After all, the previous <em>Mirror (Game)</em> wasn't very convenient to report on. The main reason for developing <em>Undertale</em> was discovering a niche in the market for a certain type of game. Before that, the 'meta-concept' appeared more in novels and films, so I pondered why this approach couldn't be used in games. Furthermore, in terms of immersion, games have a greater advantage.”</p>
<p>“As for <em>To the Moon</em>? How it truly is, I believe countless players have already given their answer. For <em>Outlast</em>, I indeed developed it with immense passion, and judging by player feedback, they clearly must have felt it too.”</p>
<p>“Players want it, and the market lacks similar games, so we make them. That's why I say I consider myself a Warrior of Love; every one of our games is filled with a volcano-like passion for our players, ready to erupt.”</p>
<p>“The same goes for the new game; it also harbors my 'love' for the players.”</p>
<p>A new game?!</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, Wu Tian, sitting there, his eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Finally, there was a captivating hot topic! Although he knew that Nebula Games' main purpose was likely to promote its new game, at least there was a 'scoop,' something exclusive to release.</p>
<p>Wu Tian, filled with anticipation, asked, “Mr. Chen, could you perhaps reveal a little information about the new game?”</p>
<p>“Of course, the new game will be an all-ages cooperative game, launching on February 14th, Valentine's Day.”</p>
<p>“We hope this game can deepen the relationships between couples. Of course, if you don't have a partner, you can still experience and enjoy the wonderfulness this game brings with your good brothers, sisters, and friends,” Chen Xu said with a sincere smile.</p>
<p>At the same time, Chen Xu also displayed two pieces of <em>Overcooked</em>'s Concept Art.</p>
<p>The adorable Crocodile Chef, Onion King, and Kevin the Dog, alongside two chefs in hats in a bustling kitchen, all wore smiling expressions.</p>
<p>To summarize in four words: harmonious and loving.</p>
<p>To add another four words: full of joy and warmth.</p>
<p>It made one immediately feel that the game was incredibly heartwarming, the kind of game friends absolutely must play together.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The interview wasn't particularly long, lasting less than 20 minutes.</p>
<p>With a refreshing smile, Chen Xu personally escorted Wu Tian to the main entrance, watching him enter the elevator.</p>
<p>“Ah, youth!” Chen Xu sighed with emotion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, inside the elevator, Wu Tian held his recording pen and the unopened bottle of Coke.</p>
<p>At this moment, he snapped back to reality and recalled the entire interview process.</p>
<p>He felt a little dizzy.</p>
<p>Shouldn't he have been the interviewer? Why did it feel like he had become a stenographer?</p>
<p>Looking at the recording pen and Coke in his hand, Wu Tian fell into deep thought.</p>
<p>When did he lose control of the conversation?</p>
<p>It seemed to have started with this bottle of Coke, didn't it?</p>
<p>“But at least it wasn't without any gains. The information about Chen Xu's new game is quite substantial! I need to quickly draft the news article!”</p>
<p>“I'll use 'The Transmission of Love' as the main title. And looking at the Concept Art for <em>Overcooked</em>, it feels incredibly heartwarming. It seems players with girlfriends will have a great Chinese New Year this year!”</p>
