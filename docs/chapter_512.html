                <p>Chapter 511: You Won't Even Give Me 300 Yuan!? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>This time, Song Ren was still using the Great Sword he had before.</p>
<p>Although he had unlocked a Bow, after a brief attempt, he felt it wasn't very easy to use. Normal attacks required charging, otherwise, they wouldn't even fire. Moreover, the damage and attack range varied depending on the charging time. The highest damage occurred at the moment of the charging flash, but then the damage would decrease. As for special attacks, they looked cool, but he felt the damage wasn't very high, barely scratching the Skeleton Puppets.</p>
<p>He felt its only advantage should be its ranged capability. But now that he had two dodge opportunities, he believed avoiding monster attacks shouldn't be a problem.</p>
<p>Excited, Song Ren started a new game. However, he quickly noticed something different: at the very beginning of the game, a God's Blessing was placed before him.</p>
<p>"Sure enough! The previous one must have been a plot kill, right?" Song Ren chuckled happily.</p>
<p>The god before him was still his familiar Zeus, but after talking to him, Song Ren showed a surprised expression.</p>
<p>'Greetings, young nephew, and most importantly, may my blessings and strength ultimately help you find your true home.'</p>
<p>Song Ren had originally thought that the blessing dialogues from NPCs in the game would all be the same, but he didn't expect them to be different?</p>
<p>And this time, Song Ren also noticed that the skills appearing on the interface still came in three directions: Lightning Attack, Thunder Dash, and Thunder Shot, corresponding to attack, projectile, and special attack modes, respectively.</p>
<p>But this time, he still chose Lightning Attack. He had experienced it before, and the effect looked very cool. When he swung his sword, it sparked with lightning, which was extremely flashy.</p>
<p>The first few rooms weren't too difficult, and by the third room, Song Ren encountered another deity: Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love. After conversing, several different options appeared, corresponding to projectile, dash, and a summoning blessing named 'Aphrodite'.</p>
<p>Song Ren didn't think much about it, instinctively choosing the last one. Of course, it wasn't because the blessing had more words, but because the description looked incredibly powerful! Accumulating the Divine Power Gauge allowed him to summon Aphrodite, who would shoot an arrow of charm that would turn opponents into traitors. Furthermore, consuming the entire Divine Power Gauge dealt a whopping 2500 damage. Wasn't this invincible?</p>
<p>How awesome!</p>
<p>So, without a moment's hesitation, Song Ren chose this aid skill. After making his choice, Song Ren saw a progress bar appear below his health bar UI in the bottom right corner, divided into four stages. Clearly, accumulating one segment of the bar allowed him to use it once. And the fuller the progress bar, the better the effect.</p>
<p>However, Song Ren quickly discovered a critical issue.</p>
<p>"Holy cow, does this Divine Power Gauge reset to zero?" In the previous room, by attacking and taking damage, Song Ren had accumulated one Divine Power Gauge but hadn't used it.</p>
<p>Song Ren in the game had a pained expression. He thought the divine power in the gauge could be saved up to use against BOSSes. But now he was told that the divine power in the gauge could only be used in the current room? And it all reset to zero afterward?</p>
<p>Discovering this mechanism left Song Ren utterly speechless. What was the point then? He had previously skipped rooms with the Centaur's Heart, which increased maximum health, just to get an extra key to unlock new weapons. Now he only had 50 HP, and relying on taking hits to build up the Divine Power Gauge was definitely unrealistic.</p>
<p>"Ah! A shop, I wonder if they sell health in there!" Song Ren looked at his eighty coins and the next shop room, a hint of anticipation rising within him. In shop rooms, he knew some blessings from the gods would appear. Though they were a bit expensive, costing 150 gold coins. He definitely couldn't afford them, but what he cared about now wasn't blessings, but health.</p>
<p>Even though he still had one Death Defiance opportunity, that was for BOSS battles; if he could avoid using it, he would.</p>
<p>With some anticipation, Song Ren walked into the shop room and saw a food item similar to fries and cola. He directly selected to buy it, replenishing a large chunk of health. However, looking at the nearby Power Pomegranate and a Zeus's Blessing item, Song Ren showed a regretful expression. He really wanted them! But he had no money.</p>
<p>At this moment, Song Ren's expression turned to surprise. Because he saw a money pouch inside the iron chest behind Charon.</p>
<p>What was going on? He hadn't seen this when he visited the shop before!?</p>
<p>Song Ren approached, and he was stunned.</p>
<p>'Borrow 300 gold coins from Charon's money pouch'</p>
<p>"Holy cow! You can even borrow money? Have I stumbled upon a hidden plot? My luck is insane, am I the chosen one?" Song Ren was overjoyed, this was absolutely wonderful! Just as he was thinking about needing money, he could borrow 300 from Charon.</p>
<p>He guessed it was probably a high-interest loan, like borrowing money in Animal Forest. It might just be that the game Hades would be stricter later on. For example, if he borrowed 300 gold coins, he might not be able to earn any more gold until the debt was repaid. But what did that matter?</p>
<p>If he borrowed money now, he could immediately enhance a skill and buy a God's Blessing!</p>
<p>With a bright smile, Song Ren decisively reached his sinful little hand into Charon's money pouch.</p>
<p>And at that very moment, urgent and passionate background music blared. Charon let out an enraged roar, and the next second the game scene switched to a platform located on magma, with four glittering money pots on it.</p>
<p>'Uh, look, Charon, I can explain. I just, uh, got used to casually taking whatever I want from my father's territory. I didn't mean to steal from you, I swear!'</p>
<p>The Prince of the Underworld in the game tried to defend himself against Charon. But even Song Ren, outside the game, could feel the helplessness in his words. Sure enough, the next moment, Charon in front of him let out a roar. Borrow money from him? Then he'd send him home!</p>
<p>"What the heck! It's just borrowing 300 yuan from you! Is it really necessary?! You won't even give me 300 yuan?!" Song Ren was utterly depressed. Charon's damage was explosive! He was nearly full health and got instantly killed by one hit. So after his Death Defiance, he didn't even struggle with his second life, choosing to lie flat.</p>
<p>He still hadn't encountered the first BOSS and was sent straight back home. But what left Song Ren most speechless wasn't even that, but the mocking dialogue with Hades after being sent home by Charon.</p>
<p>'Ah… come to confirm, you little rascal, according to the latest report submitted… you tried to steal from under Charon's nose? And you were killed? Even for you, that is exceedingly dishonorable.'</p>
<p>'Uh… I was borrowing it, not pilfering, okay? And why did no one ever tell me Charon was such a tough guy? I thought someone who ferries people all day would have a good temper.'</p>
<p>"This game is so hard!" Song Ren couldn't help but exclaim. And the moment his voice fell, Zhang Yi on the other side also sighed with emotion: "Yeah! It's so hard! I haven't even beaten the first BOSS. Oh, by the way, Old Song, have you beaten it yet?"</p>
<p>Listening to Zhang Yi's words, Song Ren froze slightly, then picked up the tea on the table and took a sip. "I haven't beaten it either, it's really too tough. But even though I keep dying and can't beat the monsters, I have to say, it's still pretty satisfying to play!" Song Ren subtly changed the subject. He wasn't lying! He really hadn't beaten the BOSS! He hadn't even seen it, how could he have beaten it?</p>
