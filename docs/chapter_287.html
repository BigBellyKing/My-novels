                <p>Chapter 286: Chen Xu Is Just a Game Developer, What the Heck Does He Know About Warcraft! (5th update, requesting subscriptions, monthly passes)</p>
<p>Online discussions regarding the balance of Warcraft were of great concern to many players who enjoyed RTS games.</p>
<p>Especially for players drawn to Warcraft, though they verbally claimed it was unbalanced and had become 'Orc Supremacy,' they essentially hoped the official developers would react quickly, for instance, by balancing the current version.</p>
<p>Finally, these players received a response, but it was slightly different from what they had anticipated.</p>
<p>"There are no problems with the balance in Warcraft. There is no such thing as Orcs being too strong. Each race has its unique tactics and gameplay. There are only the strongest players, not the strongest races. This Sunday, I will live stream Warcraft on the Shark TV Platform, engaging in a friendly exchange with the professional players participating in the Golden Tournament, to demonstrate the game's balance."</p>
<p>After Chen Xu's message was posted, players quickly noticed the official Weibo account's update.</p>
<p>Not just players, but also gaming industry professionals, even within Hero Entertainment's studio.</p>
<p>Zhou Qi, grinning like a sunflower, also noticed Chen Xu's official Weibo post and was immediately bewildered.</p>
<p>Regarding Warcraft's balance issues, it wasn't his doing. Although Human Wars had direct conflicting interests with Nebula Games' Warcraft, the various channels of the Nebula Games Platform had long been waiting for Nebula Games to make a mistake.</p>
<p>He hadn't even thought of taking action yet, and this wave of news about balance had already started.</p>
<p>At first, he also wanted to see how Chen Xu would deal with this balance incident.</p>
<p>The issue of balance, honestly, is both serious and not serious depending on how you look at it.</p>
<p>The key is how game developers choose to respond.</p>
<p>When facing balance issues, typically, a game designer would publicly apologize to players, then quickly react by adjusting numerical values, and the matter would be resolved.</p>
<p>As for whether it would be balanced afterward, that would require another period of testing.</p>
<p>After all, balance is something that requires constant adjustments.</p>
<p>Every adjustment inevitably creates some strengths and weaknesses, and many game designers, including even some hardcore players, understand this.</p>
<p>At this point, Zhou Qi felt it was a good opportunity for Human Wars to catch its breath.</p>
<p>He, along with most players and designers, believed Chen Xu would respond immediately, stating he would strengthen the Undead, Night Elves, or weaken the Orcs.</p>
<p>But they never expected Chen Xu to pull such a move.</p>
<p>Live streaming playing Warcraft to prove the game's balance isn't an issue?</p>
<p>What kind of move is this!</p>
<p>Many players were also surprised.</p>
<p>"My goodness, if I understand correctly, Chen Xu wants to live stream playing Warcraft to prove the game's balance isn't an issue?"</p>
<p>"No way, no way, Chen Xu can't really think he's better than those pro players, can he?"</p>
<p>"I think Chen Xu must be confident doing this, and as a game designer, he must have some unique insights, right?"</p>
<p>"Not necessarily. My mind thinks I'm a gaming master, but my hands disagree."</p>
<p>"The live stream hasn't even started yet, how can you be sure Chen Xu can't do it? I, on the other hand, think if Chen Xu says this, he must be confident, just think about The Monster Hunter: World before."</p>
<p>"What confidence? Before, that was playing against AI; now it's against real players, and pro players at that. Can Chen Xu possibly understand balance better than pro players?"</p>
<p>"Why can't he? Chen Xu is a game designer!"</p>
<p>"You're talking nonsense! He, Chen Xu, is just a game developer, what the heck does he know about Warcraft!"</p>
<p>"Honestly, if Chen Xu uses all four races and loses to the pro players with each one, wouldn't that prove the game is balanced?"</p>
<p>"?????? Although your reasoning makes me want to laugh, Chen Xu isn't an idiot; could he do something like that?"</p>
<p>Online players argued incessantly.</p>
<p>Mainly, they were divided into three factions.</p>
<p>The Spectator Faction was just waiting for Chen Xu to live stream that day and give a definitive answer.</p>
<p>Additionally, a portion of players trusted Chen Xu more, thinking that since Chen Xu dared to say this, he definitely wouldn't speak aimlessly; maybe he really has some genuine skills?</p>
<p>After all, he is a game designer.</p>
<p>The remaining players probably just thought Chen Xu didn't want to admit there were balance issues with the game.</p>
<p>After all, such things weren't unheard of before: officials stubbornly deny, stating the game had no problems, but the players did.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>In Nebula Games' break room during lunch break, a group of people were chatting with each other.</p>
<p>Their discussions mainly focused on the current news content online.</p>
<p>"Many people online are questioning it, Brother Qin, do you think Mr. Chen is really good at playing Warcraft?" A colleague asked Qin Yi.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Qin Yi.</p>
<p>"I don't know about that, but easily defeating a few of us is no problem," Qin Yi said, scratching his head.</p>
<p>After all, Chen Xu hadn't really played many games in front of them; it was only during the earlier development phase, when they conducted internal tests, that he easily defeated the three of them.</p>
<p>"So, Brother Qin, what about your skill level?" someone asked.</p>
<p>"So-so, probably around 2000 points combined," Qin Yi lightly coughed.</p>
<p>2000 points? That sounds quite high!</p>
<p>Hearing Qin Yi's words, everyone showed surprised expressions, ignoring the three words 'combined'.</p>
<p>At this point, Lin Rou interjected: "Brother Qin said 'combined'."</p>
<p>Combined?</p>
<p>"So you're all noobs?"</p>
<p>"<em>Cough, cough</em>, stop talking! Look at this, Mr. Chen now has a new meme!" Facing the strange looks from a few people, Qin Yi quickly changed the topic.</p>
<p>Then he showed the information on his phone.</p>
<p>It was a trending search term that had just climbed up:</p>
<p>'Chen Xu is just a game developer, what the heck does he know about Warcraft!'</p>
<p>Seeing this term, everyone instantly found it amusing.</p>
<p>"Haha, what's this all about, where did it come from?"</p>
<p>"If Mr. Chen knew about this, how upset would he be?"</p>
<p>"I think Mr. Chen should be used to it by now."</p>
<p>Everyone was amused beyond measure looking at this trending search term that had climbed up.</p>
<p>At this moment, Chen Xu, who had just confirmed things with Shark TV, walked out of the office. Seeing the amused crowd, Chen Xu was a little curious: "What are you all laughing about?"</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue, suppressing a laugh, handed the phone to Chen Xu: "Mr. Chen, you must be strong!"</p>
<p>"What the heck is this," Chen Xu was also a bit speechless looking at the trending search term, but his mindset hadn't changed much.</p>
<p>After all, he was already used to it; players always misunderstood him.</p>
<p>"But Mr. Chen, can you really beat those pro players?" Yang Xin and others next to him also asked curiously.</p>
<p>In their leisure time, they had also watched Chen Xu play Warcraft, but it wasn't against real people, but against the company's AI.</p>
<p>As for whether he was truly skilled or not, they weren't sure; anyway, none of them could beat him.</p>
<p>"I can hold my own against average ones, but against someone like Guadi, I'd have to rely on tactics and on-the-spot performance," Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Even deciding this, he still had some confidence. If these professional players truly understood all sorts of tactical gameplay, had already learned many playstyles of this game, and knew how to counter them, then he could easily be hard-countered by some players' actions.</p>
<p>But his approach was a dimension-reducing strike, and he also had a special item; this was his confidence.</p>
<p>Moreover, for him, it was actually also an opportunity; he had similar considerations before with Monster Hunter: World.</p>
<p>Letting players know that besides being a game designer, he also had the identity of a player.</p>
<p>Once such a persona was established, it would be very helpful for the future progression of game content.</p>
<p>After all, a designer who is also a pretty skilled player would actually create a stronger sense of identification for players.</p>
<p>At least when players were confused about game content, their first reaction wouldn't be that the game's numerical design or level design was wrong, or that the designer was acting up again.</p>
