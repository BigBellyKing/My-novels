                <h2>Chapter 233: We Have a Traitor Among Us! (Seeking Subscriptions, Monthly Tickets)</h2>
<p>The moment Chen Xu's official Weibo post went live, it instantly ignited the entire gaming industry once again.</p>
<p>Countless players and designers were astonished.</p>
<p>Although it was merely Chen Xu's official Weibo account, not an official announcement from Nebula Games.</p>
<p>Yet, everyone knew that a message posted by Chen Xu on his official Weibo account was essentially an official announcement from Nebula Games, wasn't it?</p>
<p>Without any surprises, less than a minute after Chen Xu's official Weibo post was released, Nebula Games' official Weibo account directly reposted it.</p>
<p>This immediately made countless players and designers unable to remain calm.</p>
<p>At the same time, the various chaotic rumors circulating online instantly vanished by more than half.</p>
<p>On one hand, Nebula Games' legal department had begun to act, collecting evidence and directly reporting to the police, then filing lawsuits. Lawyer's letter warning?</p>
<p>That doesn't exist. Either they didn't receive it, or if they did, it would definitely be a court summons.</p>
<p>While it wasn't possible to target everyone, making an example of a few leading figures was enough to serve as a deterrent.</p>
<p>And compared to small organizations, it was easier to collect relevant evidence against these leading figures.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it was also because there was simply no way to argue against it. Chen Xu had directly addressed the entire gaming industry, including players, in such a manner.</p>
<p>Although legally, even if Nebula Games or Chen Xu backed out, it wouldn't be illegal.</p>
<p>However, within the entire gaming industry, Nebula Games' reputation would immediately be ruined.</p>
<p>If it were merely to seize market share, Nebula Games wouldn't need to go to such lengths.</p>
<p>It was clear that Nebula Games was genuinely going all out.</p>
<p>No, it shouldn't be described as going all out.</p>
<p>Because Nebula Games was doing perfectly fine; the channel business was just their new venture.</p>
<p>What was truly life-threatening were those traditional channel distributors without R&amp;D capabilities.</p>
<p>Countless channel distributors were dumbfounded. Many had initially thought that Nebula Games was temporarily using a price war strategy to enter this industry segment.</p>
<p>But who would have thought that Nebula Games was directly smashing this segment to pieces?!</p>
<p>For countless ordinary game designers, it was like a festival.</p>
<p>Clearly, the emergence of the Nebula Games platform offered them a brand new choice and also acted as a channel price butcher.</p>
<p>As for the major channel distributors, at this moment, they could only stare helplessly.</p>
<p>Because there was simply no way out.</p>
<p>Restrict Nebula Games?</p>
<p>With what? Their heads?</p>
<p>Could they possibly run to players' homes, tie their hands and feet, and prevent them from spending money on the Nebula Games platform?</p>
<p>Now they could only pray that every game launched on the Nebula Games platform would have poor sales, preferably dying an instant death.</p>
<p>And in doing so, directly dragging down the reputation of the Nebula Games platform.</p>
<p>However, this was completely impossible.</p>
<p>Because the sales regulations within the Nebula Games platform had clear provisions.</p>
<p>Firstly, games launched on the Nebula Games platform must pass the review of the Game Department and obtain qualifications.</p>
<p>Secondly, all games must adhere to a refund policy.</p>
<p>Unconditional refunds within two weeks and if game time has not reached two hours. This ensures that players who encounter poorly made games can still get a refund.</p>
<p>On the second day after Chen Xu's official Weibo announcement, Nebula Games' official channels also announced new information.</p>
<p>Firstly, there was news that several new independent games and studio works would be exclusively launched on the Nebula Games platform. This had been discussed between Chen Xu and Zhang Yida earlier.</p>
<p>They had been preparing for the promotion of the Nebula Games platform.</p>
<p>Besides that, the most bewildering news for some major channel distributors was that several small domestic channel distributors had actually joined Nebula Games' camp and formed a partnership, transferring some high-quality games from their channels to Nebula Games to serve as inventory.</p>
<p>They also stated that they would establish a strategic partnership and jointly share their channel networks.</p>
<p>With this news, the major channel distributors, who were already confused, became even more bewildered.</p>
<p>They hadn't even started to exert force, and Nebula Games was already digging at their roots?</p>
<p>Rural encirclement of cities?!</p>
<p>Nebula Games is smashing the livelihoods of channel distributors, so why are you guys running off to join Nebula Games?</p>
<p>We have a traitor among us!</p>
<p>However, in reality, these channel distributors collaborating with Nebula Games primarily focused on independent games and specific categories of games, such as text adventure games and simulation games.</p>
<p>These games didn't have a large market share, but they had very stable player bases.</p>
<p>Major distributors didn't care for them, but for some small distributors, this segment was enough for them to make a living.</p>
<p>As for why these small distributors were willing to join Nebula Games' camp?</p>
<p>Because clinging to a powerful figure meant earning more!</p>
<p>For small distributors, industry unwritten rules?</p>
<p>They couldn't get any meat or soup from that.</p>
<p>In fact, many small distributors themselves had a revenue split of 3:7, or even lower.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they were small distributors, if they didn't give up profits or specialize in a certain field, which developer would be willing to release their games on their channels?</p>
<p>Just like the classic strategy of rural encirclement of cities in the previous life, these small distributors were also worth winning over.</p>
<p>At the same time, for these small distributors, collaborating with Nebula Games was completely a win-win situation.</p>
<p>Nebula Games needed some decent quality games to fill its game library.</p>
<p>Similarly, for these small distributors, Nebula Games' massive user base, even if only one percent of players bought the games they launched on the platform, would still be a huge profit.</p>
<p>As for whether they could retain their own platform's designers later?</p>
<p>These small distributors weren't worried about that.</p>
<p>Because Nebula Games, as an open platform, would definitely face a situation.</p>
<p>That is, it would be impossible to perfectly cater to all designers' works; this was inevitable.</p>
<p>Especially as more and more games come out in the future, as the effective recommendation slots are limited.</p>
<p>And since they, as small distributors, could survive well, they naturally had some foresight.</p>
<p>Don't be greedy, don't rush, just manage your own small domain.</p>
<p>As for truly being unable to resist, then there was nothing they could do. After all, their biggest advantage compared to major distributors was originally low commission and specialization.</p>
<p>But now that Nebula Games has entered the scene, and with such low commission, what they could offer was more targeted promotion for designers of niche categories, right?</p>
<p>So, since they couldn't think of a way to resist, they might as well enjoy it. If worst came to worst, they could always sit down with Nebula Games and talk slowly.</p>
<p>"How about you give me an honest price and buy me out? Then we'll be one big family, no need for two separate households."</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>A series of strategic plans had been in preparation since the development of Minecraft before the New Year.</p>
<p>The first batch of games to be launched on the Nebula Games platform included a total of 116 titles.</p>
<p>Among them, 16 were new games, and the rest were older games from channel distributors who had joined the Nebula Games camp.</p>
<p>As the first batch of games, these titles had clearly struck gold.</p>
<p>After all, Nebula Games' platform users were already there, and this could be considered the initial dividend for those who embraced Nebula Games.</p>
<p>Currently, only independent games are holding the fort. Second and third-tier game developers are mostly still observing. Unlike ordinary independent game designers, they have some bargaining power with distributors, and with Nebula Games' aggressive approach, major distributors will obviously make significant concessions.</p>
<p>For these game developers, it's natural to shop around and see what conditions they can get.</p>
<p>And as these games went online, many players were constantly paying attention.</p>
<p>"The number of games is pretty good!"</p>
<p>"But they're all old games, aren't they!?"</p>
<p>"No choice, the platform just launched. And what you're saying, do other platforms have new games every day?"</p>
<p>"That's true."</p>
<p>"And even though they're old games, the discounts are quite high!"</p>
<p>"Huh, there are so many ACG games? I've never even seen them before!"</p>
<p>"Some of these games actually look pretty good!"</p>
<p>"These games seem a little different from what I played before. There are also achievement trophies and card collection? Interesting!"</p>
<p>"The game community is also quite rich, with plenty of guides and reviews. Some even support the Workshop!"</p>
<p>Many players on the Nebula Games platform initially just looked at the new games out of curiosity.</p>
<p>But after checking them out one by one, many players found that quite a few games actually looked very interesting.</p>
<p>Moreover, these games weren't just simply launched on the Nebula Games platform; they had all been adapted for the platform.</p>
<p>For example, achievement and trophy systems, and in addition, related game communities were also very well-established.</p>
<p>Some even supported the Workshop. Some designers, after learning that their old games were going to be launched on the Nebula Games platform, even went back to update and polish them.</p>
<p>Some even went as far as to invest heavily in a complete graphics remake to ensure better visual performance, just to help their games sell better.</p>
<p>After all, old games on those small channels, even if remade, wouldn't get much attention outside of fan players.</p>
<p>But now it's different; this is an opportunity!</p>
<p>And a very rare one at that. Leaving aside other factors, the potential of the Nebula Games platform is undeniable, just from this wave of Minecraft.</p>
<p>At this point, it doesn't matter if they are old games; the goal is to make them the best they can be.</p>
