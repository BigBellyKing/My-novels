                <p>Chapter 741: The Illiterate God of War Father</p>
<p>After defeating the big BOSS in front of them, Kratos and Atreus in the game were ready to head home.</p>
<p>However, along the way, the forest was a little different from before; many different kinds of Undead Soldiers appeared. There were fire-attribute Undead Soldiers who burned themselves to ashes as they burned with flames, and there were monsters that seemed to be made of ice, striking them with a battle-axe would even deflect the blade, and only fist and foot attacks could more effectively inflict damage. But for Kratos, these mobs were basically weaklings.</p>
<p>As for his son next to him, Zhang Yi also noticed something: although Atreus was still very weak, only shouting, “Father, no!” “Father, be careful!” “Father, behind you!” his bow and arrow weren't entirely useless. They could stun mobs, triggering instant-kill execution QTEs. However, the efficiency was a bit low; it wasn't as fast as Kratos's own slashing.</p>
<p>The subsequent story wasn't particularly thrilling. Kratos simply took his son back home and earnestly instructed him.</p>
<p>Until an uninvited guest arrived at Kratos's doorstep.</p>
<p>But just then, an uninvited guest arrived.</p>
<p>“Hiding won’t help. I know who you are, and more importantly, I know your true identity.”</p>
<p>Listening to the mysterious person's words outside, Kratos quickly told Atreus to hide in the basement.</p>
<p>At this point, Zhang Yi was a little bewildered. Knowing Kratos's true identity? Could it be someone seeking revenge? But Kratos's only enemies were the Greek gods, and they were all dead. Could it be that Kratos had killed many people in the Norse realms over the years?</p>
<p>Listening to the voice outside, Zhang Yi looked bewildered. Kratos then opened the door, and standing there was a man covered in tattoos with a full beard.</p>
<p>Facing Kratos who opened the door, this mysterious person subjected him to all sorts of provocations, even punching Kratos in the face. Zhang Yi was instantly shocked. Was this shorty tired of living?</p>
<p>However, Kratos’s subsequent actions surprised Zhang Yi even more, making him realize that the Kratos who slayed gods and Buddhas had truly changed. Facing the provoking mysterious person, even after being punched in the face, Kratos merely suppressed his anger, warning the other party to leave his home.</p>
<p>Compared to the Kratos who would ruthlessly slaughter his way through Olympus at the slightest disagreement, he seemed incredibly insane. But Kratos, having a child, had clearly changed completely. He learned to restrain his anger because Kratos knew that in the house behind him was his son, Atreus.</p>
<p>But clearly, things wouldn't end so easily. Although Kratos suppressed his anger and warned the person to leave. From their previous conversation, it was clear that this shorty was no ordinary person. He was likely a deity, a god from Norse mythology!</p>
<p>After a brief cutscene, they entered another BOSS battle. This battle was a world apart from the previous fight with the Mountain Troll. Compared to this fight with the mysterious person, the previous Mountain Troll BOSS battle could only be called a tutorial.</p>
<p>There were no massive bodies like those of the Greek gods and Titans. This mysterious person was even shorter than Kratos. But when they truly fought, it was earth-shattering, perfectly illustrating what it means for gods to fight. The visceral strikes, combined with wide-swinging, powerful attacks and highly visually impactful performance effects, were stunning. Huge tree trunks were destroyed by their combat, and hard rocks crumbled under their blows. While they competed in strength on the mountainside, the entire mountain range was torn in half by their immense power, creating a bottomless canyon. From attacking with trees and pummeling the opponent against rocks, enhanced by activating Spartan Rage, this violent aesthetic, though different from the epic grand scenes before, was even more shocking to players.</p>
<p>In the end, Kratos still proved superior, snapping the mysterious person's neck and throwing him down the valley.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was still immersed in the fierce battle. Although it wasn't against a massive monster, the impact and shock made him sigh, feeling that this combat style was what God of War should be. Besides that, what made Zhang Yi most emotional was that Kratos might truly be old. In ancient Greece, Kratos slaughtered countless Olympian gods, enduring countless earth-shattering battles. But he always slayed gods and Buddhas, showing no signs of fatigue. But now? At the end of the battle, Kratos, covered in blood, lay on the ground, breathing heavily. He only got up after resting for a while, staggering and dragging his axe as he returned. Anyone could see that Kratos was truly exhausted after the great battle.</p>
<p>Returning home, based on the dialogue between Kratos and Atreus, the game's main quest gradually became clear: players needed to control Kratos and Atreus to journey to the highest peak in the Nine Realms of Norse mythology and scatter the ashes of the child's mother—a mother whose face was never revealed—at that highest mountain.</p>
<p>From this moment on, the game officially embarked on its journey, just as Zhang Yi had imagined; Kratos's every move had changed. Compared to the fiery Kratos of his youth, the current Kratos even exuded a sense of calm and peace. Zhang Yi, who had played the previous trilogy, had always thought these two descriptions would be entirely unrelated to Kratos. On their journey, while facing enemies, Kratos’s former shadow could still be seen, but more often, it was filled with teachings and concern for Atreus.</p>
<p>For example, in the game, Atreus and Kratos encountered a group of scavengers who wanted to eat their flesh. It was also here that Atreus killed a person with his own hands for the first time. Combined with how Atreus had previously been afraid to even harm an elk, this was clearly a strong psychological impact for him. Indeed, Atreus fell into confusion, and at this time, Kratos didn't yell but patiently guided him. Setting aside Kratos's identity, at this moment, Kratos was a kind old father.</p>
<p>However, this old father was still illiterate. Back in Greece, Kratos was manipulated by wordplay due to Athena's promises. But now, having left his homeland of Greece and arrived in unfamiliar Midgard, Kratos seemed to have learned nothing, remaining utterly illiterate. Facing Runic Runes that required solving puzzles, Kratos in the game looked bewildered.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Atreus, whom Zhang Yi had always considered a burdening troublemaker child, proved useful. Compared to his illiterate old father, Atreus was far more knowledgeable. So, when faced with Runic Runes he couldn't understand, Kratos would call out to his son: “Boy, what does it say?”</p>
<p>When faced with incomprehensible Norse culture, Kratos would again call out to his son: “Boy, what does this mean?” Anyway, anything related to cultural aspects entirely required Atreus to step up.</p>
<p>As the story slowly progressed, Kratos and Atreus encountered a Dwarf. Using some previously acquired items and Hacksilver, the Dwarf could forge equipment for them and upgrade their weapons. After upgrading his axe and his son’s bow and arrow, and with no resources left, Zhang Yi continued to advance with his son.</p>
<p>In many scenes, Zhang Yi noticed something similar to the thorns found in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. There were clearly some treasures within, but after searching every scene, he couldn't find a way to open them, which gave Zhang Yi a headache. He didn't know if he just hadn't found it, or if it was something he couldn't open at his current stage.</p>
<p>On their way to the highest mountain range, Kratos and Atreus encountered some special stories. For example, after hunting a rather strange wild boar with his son, a beautiful Forest Witch appeared, stating that the wild boar was her friend, a unique species, and the only one left in all Nine Realms. When this woman appeared, Zhang Yi felt a little excited.</p>
<p>Because during his previous Greek journey, whenever a pretty girl appeared, it usually meant the start of a Red Soul Extraction journey. However, he quickly realized he was overthinking things. The Kratos of the past would play naughty Red Soul Extraction mini-games. But the Kratos of today was not like before; time had left an indelible mark on him, and with a child now, Red Soul Extraction games were clearly no longer much concern to him.</p>
<p>Moreover, this Forest Witch seemed very friendly to Kratos and Atreus, making Zhang Yi mutter to himself, could she be Atreus's stepmother?</p>
<p>After leaving the Forest Witch, Kratos and Atreus, using the boat the witch had given them, finally arrived at the Lake of the Nine. From this moment on, Zhang Yi once again felt the epic charm of God of War.</p>
<p>God of War was still God of War. Compared to the previous Greek mythology journey, this Norse mythology journey had a richer plot presentation, and the magnificent scenes were even more shocking. Arriving at the center of the Lake of the Nine, the incredibly massive World Serpent shot up to the sky, directly lowering the water level and revealing hidden underwater sculptures and ruined cities. That incredibly shocking scene completely stunned Zhang Yi. It was truly incredible!</p>
<p>Of course, as the game progressed, Zhang Yi felt that God of War had changed genres, and its difficulty as an ARPG slowly increased. Without upgrading weapons, armor sets, and skills, fighting monsters was no longer a hack-and-slash experience but became a bit strenuous. This was because the monster types were diverse, with ranged attackers, melee fighters, and those who could cast spells, like sand-witch-like creatures. Kratos alone found it difficult to deal with them. Instead, Atreus, the troublemaker child whom he had previously looked down upon, was much more effective with his bow and arrow.</p>
<p>And as he upgraded the troublemaker child's equipment and skills, this initially useless child's help in combat grew significantly. Previously, Atreus's biggest role was to yell during combat:</p>
<p>“Father, get up!”</p>
<p>“Father, watch your back!”</p>
<p>“Father, are you alright?”</p>
<p>He seemed just like a mascot. His biggest use was to translate and explain Runic Runes Kratos didn't recognize when Kratos leaned in. But now that Kratos and Atreus had reached the Lake of the Nine, Kratos, while still maintaining his original illiteracy, Atreus grew stronger and stronger, even mastering close-quarters bow combat, swinging his bow to instantly stun mobs.</p>
<p>Watching Atreus eagerly observing his surroundings after an intense battle, and Kratos panting heavily, Zhang Yi felt that the art style seemed a bit off.</p>
