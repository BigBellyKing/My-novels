                <p>Chapter 699: Malice from the Depths of the Soul (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>“Damn, I feel like this Shichimen Warrior is even harder to beat than Genichiro!”</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was utterly numb. At first, he felt that this elite enemy in the dark and dingy place wasn't much different from the Seven Spears of Ashina or the Purple-clad Shinobi Lone Shadow he had encountered before.</p>
<p>But when he actually started fighting, he realized something was off. Aside from normal attacks, almost all of its skills could inflict him with a Fear DEBUFF. There were also the blue-purple orbs of light appearing in the air; losing health when hit was a minor issue, but the key was that the BUFF bar would stack up. And once the BUFF bar was full, unlike the Blazing Bull whose Fire attribute BUFF getting full would prompt 'feeling awesome,' this Fear DEBUFF would instantly kill him, which was simply unreasonable.</p>
<p>An even more crucial point was that this BOSS was an ADHD-ridden BOSS. Sometimes, when it summoned ghostly orbs on the ground, it would cast a magic circle. Although he could get free hits when he approached, his terror bar would visibly rise. But if he didn't attack, this Shichimen Warrior would not only teleport but also frequently fly into the air to launch orbs. This made it impossible to find an opportunity to deal damage, and once the surrounding orbs accumulated, only death awaited him. One could say that this Shichimen Warrior was like a hedgehog – you couldn't attack it, and you couldn't not attack it.</p>
<p>“How can there be such a disgusting monster! How can there be such a disgusting monster?!” Zhang Yi finally couldn't help but yell at the top of his lungs.</p>
<p>If the previous Genichiro Ashina made Zhang Yi feel difficulty, then the current Shichimen Warrior made Zhang Yi feel unbearable. This monster was simply too revolting!</p>
<p>And he had no idea how to beat it!</p>
<p>There were many players like Zhang Yi. After defeating Genichiro Ashina, that feeling made many players believe they had broken through their limits, much like a martial arts master who had achieved great success, just waiting to emerge and sweep away all opposition. And indeed, it was as players thought: as one of the beginner's teachers, Genichiro Ashina did allow players to improve their personal skills. This is the greatest feature of Souls-like games – it's not purely about increasing game stats, but more about improving one's own experience and techniques.</p>
<p>Moreover, the next few battles were indeed as players had imagined. Whether they first went to Mibu Village in the Land of Ashina, Senpou Temple at the dungeon entrance, or the Bodhisattva Valley of the Gun Fort, players would encounter BOSSes that made them feel stronger. Snake Eyes, Lone Shadow, Seven Spears of Ashina… For players who had endured the torment of Genichiro Ashina, these BOSSes were no longer so powerful or threatening. They only needed to carefully observe the BOSS's moves, and they could generally respond calmly and confidently. This was because these BOSSes did not have many variations in their moves, and whether it was the first phase or the second, there wasn't much difference. Furthermore, they didn't have many subtle telegraphs; unlike Genichiro's second phase or Lady Butterfly's second phase, which interspersed arrow shots and delayed sword techniques, these BOSSes were much more straightforward.</p>
<p>However, as they advanced, players soon encountered some bewildering monsters: the Shichimen Warrior and the Headless in the game. Most of the attacks from these two monsters carried a Fear DEBUFF. Once fully stacked, it would instantly kill the player without question. The Shichimen Warrior was relatively more agile, while the Headless came with an inherent aura that reduced player speed, making it extremely frustrating. The best items to use against these two foes were the Pacifying Agent and Divine Confetti. The former could dispel the Fear BUFF bar and also increase the player's resistance. The latter could deal additional damage to Apparition attribute monsters.</p>
<p>One could say that if Genichiro was the teacher who taught players dodge steps, blocking, parrying, and Mikiri Counter, then the Headless and Shichimen Warrior were the monsters that taught players to use items. But the crucial issue was that players whose foundations were not solid before, after enduring Genichiro's trial, had generally formed a habit: facing BOSSes with just a blade and a flask of sake. Many players, in order to gather money to buy Gourd Seeds and other items sold by Remnant Merchants at the entrances of various map areas, had even sold off all their items, including the most expensive Divine Confetti, to the shop. So, when players faced the Headless and Shichimen Warrior again, the completely different playstyle once again made them suffer tremendously. Of course, the only good news was that these BOSSes were merely elite BOSSes, and players could choose to bypass them.</p>
<p>After dying a dozen times, to the point where those around him were almost coughing themselves to death, Zhang Yi chose to back down. Yet, even so, the subsequent content tormented him to no end.</p>
<p>Because after leaving Ashina Castle, just like Farron Keep, Blighttown in Dark Souls, and the Forbidden Woods in Bloodborne, the malice of the maps and BOSSes slowly began to emerge.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>In the Hidden Forest,</p>
<p>Smoke hung heavy, and various Phantom Samurai, giant roosters, and a headless Headless made countless players feel like they were playing a horror game. 'Damn it, stop chasing me! Why are these phantoms stationary for everyone else, but for me, they chase relentlessly?' 'Can anyone save me? Where the heck am I supposed to go? I've circled the arena once!' 'Crap, crap, crap! How do I get up this house? Whose remnant is this? Why is jumping between these trees so hard?'</p>
<p>In this map, countless players were tormented to the point of ecstasy and agony, the dizzying experience of navigating the Forbidden Woods and Farron Keep once again surfacing. Especially some players who didn't notice the NPC's hint to find the poisonous fat guy, but instead saw the remnants left by other players using unconventional methods to jump through trees, thinking that was the correct path, and ended up jumping for an eternity. The only consolation was that in a house, players encountered the game's 'most powerful' BOSS, the Mist Noble, and had a satisfying fight.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Senpou Temple and the Gun Fort.</p>
<p>'Crap! These rats on the mountain path are even more disgusting, stop blowing poison darts! This isn't Blighttown!'</p>
<p>'Can anyone tell me how to fight this Armored Warrior? He's like a madman, I've done Shinobi Executions on him three times, why is he still so lively?'</p>
<p>'Don't you monks understand compassion? Come at me one by one, don't come at me in a group, and with staffs?!'</p>
<p>'Are you playing fair?! Guns are bad enough, but cannons too? All hiding so far away, come down if you dare!' Players who chose to go to Senpou Temple first also suffered brutal beatings, leaving them somewhat disoriented. The poison-dart-blowing rats on the mountain path reminded countless Dark Souls players of the poison dart guys in Blighttown. And on the path up the mountain, the monks would launch into a Senpou Arts attack without a word. In the long corridor, players would encounter an Armored Warrior who would shout 'Robert!' upon death. But upon first encounter, if not for a lucky Shinobi Execution near a window, players would likely feel despair, because no matter how many times they performed a Shinobi Execution, this BOSS would remain full of vigor. As for the other path to the Sunken Valley, the Gun Fort, players were desperate when they first arrived. Because as they traversed the treacherous cliffs, cannon fire and bullets would rain down from unknown places. It was common for their health bars to evaporate before they even saw the enemy. And such traps, after leaving Ashina Castle, in almost every new area map, players could feel that malice stemming from the depths of the soul. Countless players couldn't help but sigh with emotion. Indeed! Mr. Chen is still Mr. Chen. After all these years, he hasn't forgotten his original intention. The design of these maps, levels, and monsters is still so malicious!</p>
