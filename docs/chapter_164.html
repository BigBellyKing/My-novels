                <p>Chapter 263: You Call This a Normal Player? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>“There's not much to say about preparations; it's just about eating the Felyne Canteen meal with your desired stats, equipping the appropriate weapons and armor, and bringing auxiliary items.”</p>
<p>After enjoying a Felyne Canteen meal at the Hunter's Astera Settlement, Chen Xu conversed with the Research Team Leader who was still ceaselessly eating, then arrived at the Sector 11 expedition camp in Wildspire Waste.</p>
<p>Then, under the watchful eyes of the viewers in the live stream, Chen Xu ran all the way towards the Diablos's lair.</p>
<p>Sliding down the steep slope at the entrance, he could see the awakened Diablos running outwards, seemingly looking to forage for some cacti.</p>
<p>“This is pretty good luck; the Diablos is right at the slope, which is perfect for initiating Spirit Gauge State. Most players know how to do this, right?” Chen Xu said in a calm tone.</p>
<p>Through the live stream, players watched as the Hunter controlled by Chen Xu slid down, then, just as he was about to reach the Diablos, he leaped up, his Long Sword striking the Diablos. He landed and followed up with a Spirit Roundslash.</p>
<p>The Long Sword's first layer, White Blade, was activated.</p>
<p>Upon being suddenly attacked, the Diablos let out a roar, immediately performing a two-hit headbutt that sent the accompanying Palico flying.</p>
<p>“Generally speaking, if you have high confidence in your own skills, not bringing a Palico can actually increase a lot of effective damage output, because monsters often shift their Aggro to the Palico.”</p>
<p>“And in such moments, if you're a Great Sword, Long Sword, or Charge Blade player, you're very likely to miss your powerful attacks like True Charged Slash, Helm Breaker, or Super Amped Element Discharge.”</p>
<p>“Of course, what I’m demonstrating now is a normal Long Sword player’s Diablos hunting trip, so we’ll still bring the Palico because it significantly increases our fault tolerance, and its healing is also very useful.”</p>
<p>“These two consecutive horn attacks have a very long Stagger, which is perfect for sneaking in some damage. A Diagonal Slash combined with a Spirit Roundslash lets you get in a few extra hits and activate the Long Sword’s second layer, Yellow Blade.”</p>
<p>In the game, Chen Xu explained while controlling the Long Sword-wielding Hunter to attack the Diablos.</p>
<p>Amidst his casual commentary, the Long Sword had already reached two layers of Spirit Gauge.</p>
<p>Countless Hunters in the live stream, especially Long Sword users, were instantly bewildered.</p>
<p>'What? Two layers of Spirit Gauge already!?'</p>
<p>'A normal Long Sword player's Diablos hunting trip? Mr. Chen, do you perhaps misunderstand the word "normal"?'</p>
<p>'Not bringing a Palico, that's asking for me to die, right?'</p>
<p>'Oh, come on, stop arguing! Don't you think it looks easy? Isn't this just the normal mode for a Long Sword?'</p>
<p>The bullet comments in the live stream were scrolling rapidly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chen Xu in the game continued his demonstration.</p>
<p>The Diablos in front of him turned its head, its two front legs beginning to paw at the ground before it burrowed into it.</p>
<p>“This is the Diablos’s burrowing attack. Be careful here; only the first hit of Foresight Slash grants invulnerability. Subsequent hits only grant hyper armor, not full invincibility, though there is some damage reduction. So, when facing a burrowing attack, it’s best not to use Foresight Slash, as it's easy to take damage if you’re not proficient.”</p>
<p>Chen Xu demonstrated in the game as he spoke.</p>
<p>The moment the Diablos burst from the ground, the Hunter in the game retreated, and with a 'ding' and a flash of purple light, successfully performed a Foresight Slash into a Spirit Roundslash, activating Red Blade. However, the Hunter still lost one health bar, but at that moment, the Palico kindly delivered a Vigorwasp, replenishing his health.</p>
<p>“The Dragon Charge is similar to the burrowing attack, but unlike burrowing, the Dragon Charge has a higher chance of being evaded without damage if you position yourself well. Besides that, the Diablos’s roar attack can also be parried, but you need to pay attention to the wind-up animation of its head. However, I don't recommend normal Long Sword players to Foresight Slash the roar attack, as the benefit-to-risk ratio isn't proportional. It’s better to adjust your angle and Foresight Slash the Dragon Charge or regular headbutt attacks.”</p>
<p>As Chen Xu spoke, the Diablos in the game happened to rear its head and roar. At that moment, the Hunter in the game unleashed a Foresight Slash, perfectly parrying the roar attack, becoming immune to the stun effect, and following up with a Spirit Roundslash.</p>
<p>A streak of crimson light coursed along the Long Sword's blade.</p>
<p>And the players watching the live stream were now dumbfounded.</p>
<p>'This... Red Blade already!?'</p>
<p>'No, Mr. Chen, are you sure you're here today to teach Long Sword, and not to show off your skills and act pretentious?'</p>
<p>'Who could possibly learn this! If the Foresight Slash doesn't land, won't I just Cart back to camp!?'</p>
<p>'Thanks, Mr. Chen, I've already failed to learn it!'</p>
<p>'Oh my god, the roar attack and Dragon Charge can actually be Foresight Slashed? As a professional Long Sword player, this is news to me!'</p>
<p>'I'm stunned!'</p>
<p>'+1, I'm completely bewildered! Am I what you call a normal player?'</p>
<p>The surrounding players watching, especially those who played Long Sword, were all in tears.</p>
<p>Was this still the Long Sword they knew?</p>
<p>Why did it reach Red Blade so quickly?</p>
<p>And that little trick where Foresight Slash still takes damage even if successful—that's completely useless to them!</p>
<p>And Foresight Slashing the roar attack? What the heck is Foresight Slashing a roar attack? How could anyone react in time!?</p>
<p>“Furthermore, making good use of items is also very crucial; don't overlook them. And I believe most people probably haven't even tried capturing a BOSS, usually just outright killing them, right? Taking the Diablos as an example, after it burrows, you can use a Screamer Pod to blast it out, and at that point, the Diablos will be in a Staggered state for a long time, allowing Long Sword players to safely activate their Spirit Gauge.” Chen Xu explained.</p>
<p>After creating some distance, the Diablos in front began frantically digging at the ground with its thick forelimbs.</p>
<p>But just as it fully burrowed underground, Chen Xu controlled the Hunter in the game to switch to the Slinger, then fired the pre-loaded Screamer Pod.</p>
<p>Next, the previously ferocious Diablos was seen rolling around on the ground, letting out painful wails.</p>
<p>It sounded as if it was whimpering.</p>
<p>At this moment, the Hunter in the game took a step back, then—Helm Breaker!</p>
<p>The Long Sword-wielding Hunter stabbed the Diablos's wing. Even with its thick hide and scales, the attack caused flesh and blood to splatter.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Hunter stomped on the Diablos's massive body, leaping into the air, raising his Long Sword high, and descending like a meteor to viciously slash the Diablos's head.</p>
<p>“Clang!!”</p>
<p>With a sharp clang of metal, a dazzling blade flash instantly erupted from the Hunter's Long Sword, slicing from top to bottom, severing one of the Diablos's thick, massive horns in two!</p>
<p>Following the Hunter's attack, the Diablos let out another roar, then crashed to the ground, its legs thrashing as it struggled desperately.</p>
<p>The Hunter's movements in the game remained fluid: Spirit Roundslash to activate Spirit Gauge, then another Helm Breaker.</p>
<p>Finally, the Diablos, covered in sword slashes and with one of its enormous horns broken, struggled to get up and tried to flee.</p>
<p>Following closely, he arrived in the second area, where he executed another Helm Breaker, plunging deep into the Diablos's body, then slicing it from top to bottom.</p>
<p>A cold glint flashed, and the sword was sheathed.</p>
<p>The screen displayed a 'Hunt Successful' notification.</p>
<p>Cool, extremely cool!</p>
<p>However, the audience in the live stream fell silent.</p>
<p>Could they actually learn this!?</p>
