                <p>Chapter 308: Tough Guy Airdrop! (6th update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)</p>
<p>Whether he could clear this Realistic difficulty, Song Ren had a bit of self-awareness. That was, he definitely couldn't beat it. After all, he had just started playing, and didn't know much about the game yet. What's more, he was alone. So he simply wanted to experience it, and wait for Zhang Yi and the others.</p>
<p>[Locate the bomb and defuse it]</p>
<p>Entering the game, the mission objective was displayed in the middle, while a countdown timer was at the top, and two unrevealed "??" were on the right. Evidently, this meant he needed to defuse two bombs. The map was a café, so this wasn't a drill. The White Masks had planted bombs inside the café, and now his task was to infiltrate the café and defuse them.</p>
<p>Resurrecting at the coast, Song Ren wasn't afraid. Although his name sounded like a "cowardly person" (sǒng rén), he wasn't cowardly at all, except when playing horror games.</p>
<p>Choosing Sledge, Song Ren rushed forward with a shotgun. Although Sledge could also choose an assault rifle, considering that Rainbow Six Siege was different from normal FPS games, often involving close-quarters indoor firefights, Song Ren felt that shotguns would likely have greater lethality.</p>
<p>Arriving at the café's main entrance, the formerly open door had been boarded up with barricades. Seeing the planks in front of him, Song Ren chuckled. Did these flimsy planks think they could stop Sledge? Pulling out the sledgehammer from his back, he smashed it down directly. Instantly, the planks in front of him shattered into pieces.</p>
<p>The next moment, Song Ren's expression froze. Because behind the shattered barricade, in front of the café's main hall...</p>
<p>He saw three enemies wearing balaclavas and White Masks, holding guns, their dark muzzles pointed directly at him. And in front of them stood two deployable shields.</p>
<p>Clearly, they were well-prepared! The scene was incredibly awkward for a moment. "I should be outside, not inside." For some reason, a song lyric popped into Song Ren's mind, and the next moment, gunfire like firecrackers erupted.</p>
<p>[Operation Failed]</p>
<p>The notification appeared in the center of the screen. "What the heck! Shouldn't these White Masks be quietly waiting inside the shop? What's with this direct spawn-peeking at the door!?" Song Ren calmed himself down, utterly stunned.</p>
<p>Compared to his previous life, Chen Xu had made quite a few changes to the Terrorist Hunt Mode. Especially at the highest Realistic difficulty, a higher level of AI behavior was implemented. The White Masks in the game no longer just foolishly guarded the objective, occasionally patrolling and attacking when they heard movement.</p>
<p>Instead, they would have more stringent deployments, though their aim would still intentionally miss a shot or two. After all, in FPS games, if it came down to pure accuracy and reaction time, even the most talented human couldn't beat a computer. Of course, the intentional misses only lasted for a moment. Essentially, if you were exposed to AI gunfire for even a second, you were as good as dead.</p>
<p>Players needed to rely on their understanding of the map and skillful use of gadgets to succeed (the map environment contained resupply points for ammunition and gadgets).</p>
<p>"Forget it, no more Realistic difficulty! I'll play on Normal difficulty, surely that's fine!" Sighing, Song Ren decided to tactically disengage for now. Although he had been ambushed, and he also remembered that Rainbow Six Siege was a game completely different from typical FPS games. But Song Ren still chose not to stubbornly continue the challenge, because he knew he was indeed too green. If he couldn't beat the Realistic White Masks, surely he could beat the Normal ones?</p>
<p>Re-entering the game, this time the map had changed to one called Chalet. But it didn't make a difference to him; he didn't know any of them anyway. The mission was to locate and rescue the hostage.</p>
<p>For operator selection this time, Song Ren didn't pick Sledge again; instead, he chose Ying. After selecting the spawn point, Song Ren was smarter this time. Standing still, he pulled out his drone and began controlling the little vehicle to scout.</p>
<p>"This drone is still fun!" Song Ren controlled the drone, making it jump left and right, fully venting his operator's inability to jump onto the little vehicle. Creeping under the door crack, Song Ren saw a large group of White Masks at the main entrance. He pressed scan to mark them, but the next moment, a burst of bullets swept in, and Song Ren, who was controlling the drone, saw the display in his hand suddenly go static.</p>
<p>"What the heck!? The AI reacts to being scanned too?" Song Ren felt a pang of annoyance. Fortunately, each operator carried two drones. Although one was gone, he still had another. But he couldn't use it so casually now, or he'd lose his source of intel.</p>
<p>However, the swarm of enemies directly in front had made Song Ren a bit apprehensive, so he bypassed them and went to the eastern lawn area. Song Ren, at the base of the wall, looked up at the second-floor window. To rescue the hostage, if he were the kidnapper, where would he put the hostage? It would definitely be a place that's easy to defend and hard to attack, so very likely a second-floor bedroom or room. With so many forces at the main entrance, it meant there probably weren't many AI enemies on the second floor. So, wouldn't it be better if he attacked from the second floor, used it as a base, and slowly eliminated the enemies on the first floor?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Song Ren somewhat admired his own cleverness. Arriving at the base of the wall, a prompt appeared on the screen, and Song Ren also noticed a detail. That was, there was a slot-like area where the grappling hook could be used; otherwise, it couldn't be deployed. Following the prompt, he threw the grappling hook up, then took a step forward, pushing off the wall with his feet, climbing little by little. When he reached the window, Song Ren subconsciously wanted to smash the barricaded planks with his gun stock.</p>
<p>But at this moment, Song Ren remembered the window-breaching scene from the promotional trailer. And this time, the operator he was playing was Ying, and his gadget was a breaching charge. This seemed like a flashy move he could try, and the game apparently did support playing this way!</p>
<p>Attempting a swing, Song Ren's eyes lit up, and the next scene already flashed in his mind. With the explosion, the planks would shatter, he would rappel down to the second floor, and open fire on the terrorist personnel. How cool would that be!</p>
<p>He placed the breaching charge, then watched the flashing sparks. Timing it perfectly, Song Ren pushed off with both feet.</p>
<p>'Boom!'</p>
<p>A loud bang, and the tough guy airdropped!</p>
<p>Then with a "splat," the tough guy's corpse airdropped onto the grass.</p>
<p>[Operation Failed]</p>
<p>Looking at the "Operation Failed" screen, Song Ren fell silent, until Zhang Yi and the others' voices came through the channel: "Old Song, are you done playing?"</p>
<p>"Done! Done! Just finished!" Song Ren decisively exited and replied.</p>
<p>"That quick? Is this Terrorist Hunt Mode fun?" Joey asked at this moment.</p>
<p>"Yeah, what kind of gameplay is Terrorist Hunt Mode?" Wang Han also asked with interest.</p>
<p>Was Terrorist Hunt Mode fun? What kind of gameplay was it? Thinking about his experiences from these two rounds, Song Ren suddenly found himself unable to answer.</p>
<p>"I played Lone Wolf mode by myself, but I wasn't really <em>playing</em> it; I was testing the operators' abilities and some small tricks that might be possible in the game." Song Ren thought for a moment and said.</p>
<p>"Small tricks? What tricks?" Zhang Yi pressed.</p>
<p>"Nothing much, just some not-so-practical tricks. By the way, have you guys bought operators yet?! Hurry up and queue for a match! I can't wait to go counter-terrorism!" Song Ren quickly changed the subject.</p>
<p>"Of course we bought them!"</p>
<p>"Who's teaming up?"</p>
<p>"I'll host, invite everyone, invite everyone!"</p>
<p>Hearing Song Ren's words, everyone's attention was diverted, and they eagerly rubbed their hands, looking forward to their first match.</p>
