<p>Chapter 342: Chen Xu's Mercy? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Amidst the vast yellow sands, Soap and Price embarked on their journey to find Shepherd.</p>
<p>Whether for their own fallen comrades, for the world, or for Ghost and Roach, Shepherd had to die!</p>
<p>Here, they encountered Shepherd's ace in the hole: Shadow Company.</p>
<p>Fierce firefights erupted in the wilderness and inside the caves.</p>
<p>But as Price said, there was nothing Task Force 141 couldn't accomplish.</p>
<p>Even with only two of them left, they remained unstoppable.</p>
<p>Despite the enemy's superior equipment, formidable combat power, and numbers.</p>
<p>Facing Soap and Price, who were burning with the fire of revenge, Shadow Company was utterly unable to stop the two.</p>
<p>Shepherd was even forced to issue an order.</p>
<p>That was to use indiscriminate artillery bombardment to bury the two in this land.</p>
<p>One must know that besides Soap and Price, Shepherd's Shadow Company was also there.</p>
<p>Clearly, in Shepherd's eyes, all of them were mere tools, expendable.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Soap and Price had infiltrated Shepherd's communication devices beforehand, obtaining this crucial intelligence, and held their ground inside the cave.</p>
<p>The artillery bombardment not only failed to harm the two but also caused heavy losses to Shadow Company.</p>
<p>They chased Shepherd all the way, boarding a rubber dinghy for a thrilling chase on the turbulent river.</p>
<p>Only this time, they were no longer the hunted.</p>
<p>Innumerable enemy forces drove assault boats from behind, attempting to stop the duo's pursuit and allow Shepherd to escape safely.</p>
<p>Soap piloted the dinghy, while Price covered him.</p>
<p>Submachine guns, rifles, grenades, and RPGs.</p>
<p>A symphony of gunfire and a fireworks display unfolded on the turbulent river.</p>
<p>The assault boats were inherently fast, and on the turbulent river, there were not only various obstructing boulders but also narrow valleys.</p>
<p>Coupled with enemy attacks, the difficulty was extremely high.</p>
<p>Running aground, being shot, being bombed.</p>
<p>Repeated failures. This time, Zhang Yi did not adjust the difficulty to recruit level but maintained the normal difficulty.</p>
<p>These repeated failures only further ignited his vengeful fury as a player.</p>
<p>On the turbulent river, the piloting of the assault boat gradually became skillful. Splashing water and enemy artillery fire constantly appeared around them.</p>
<p>At the same time, many enemy dinghies capsized and were blown apart.</p>
<p>But Soap and Price, like reapers of death, clung tightly behind Shepherd.</p>
<p>“A1, this is Golden Eagle, report status!”</p>
<p>Amidst the sounds of wind, water, and gunfire, Shepherd's voice came through the walkie-talkie.</p>
<p>Because Soap and Price had previously hacked into Shepherd's subordinates' communication lines, they knew his orders like the back of their hand.</p>
<p>“Reporting, sir, W51 Paving is standing by downstream!”</p>
<p>“Received, W51, please note, we're almost there, over.”</p>
<p>“Received, hatch is open, please maintain speed above 30 knots, mind your vertical clearance!”</p>
<p>Shepherd was clearly prepared. Price and Soap could only watch helplessly as he boarded the plane.</p>
<p>“Attention, Golden Eagle has boarded, commencing evacuation. Sandstorm ahead, maintain altitude, all units stay safe.”</p>
<p>And then, a worse situation arose. Because they urgently needed to move forward, there wasn't just a waterfall, but a raging sandstorm in the distance.</p>
<p>No road ahead, pursuers behind.</p>
<p>They seemed to have fallen into a desperate situation.</p>
<p>But at this moment, Price did not panic.</p>
<p>“Steady the dinghy, Soap, steady the dinghy!”</p>
<p>Listening to Price's words, Zhang Yi showed no signs of urgency.</p>
<p>Because in the game, he, as a player, had long since acknowledged these NPCs who had fought alongside him.</p>
<p>He just needed to trust his comrades.</p>
<p>Controlling the dinghy, he stabilized it.</p>
<p>At this moment, Price moved, picking up his gun and aiming at the plane that was about to fly away.</p>
<p>Bang bang!</p>
<p>Two shots hit the pilot, and he also measured the distance. Using the grenade launcher mounted below the muzzle, a grenade was fired towards the plane.</p>
<p>“Boom!”</p>
<p>A loud bang accompanied by an explosion, and the plane lost control, plummeting like a kite with a broken string.</p>
<p>But at the same time, Soap and Price's dinghy also lost control and plunged down the waterfall.</p>
<p>After struggling in the turbulent river for a moment, the screen went dark.</p>
<p>When the screen reappeared, it was a vast expanse of yellow sand.</p>
<p>The sandstorm was raging, and the distant oil refinery was submerged in the yellow sand.</p>
<p>Braving the strong winds and yellow sand, Soap struggled to find Price.</p>
<p>And then, outside the distant plane wreckage, Soap saw a person.</p>
<p>Leaning against a broken car, and that person was Shepherd!</p>
<p>He was still alive!</p>
<p>Recalling the deaths of Ghost and Roach, Soap drew his combat knife, intending to kill Shepherd.</p>
<p>But unexpectedly, the seemingly weak Shepherd still possessed considerable combat power. In contrast, Soap, after a long battle and the previous struggle in the water, was now extremely weak.</p>
<p>Shepherd grabbed Soap's right hand holding the knife with one hand, and with the other, he delivered a solid punch to Soap.</p>
<p>Then Shepherd directly grabbed Soap's head and slammed it hard against the abandoned car.</p>
<p>“Clang!”</p>
<p>A loud noise, followed by a ringing in Soap's ears. This impact directly disoriented Soap, and his body uncontrollably collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p>At this moment, Shepherd picked up Soap's dagger and plunged it fiercely into Soap's chest.</p>
<p>“Splat!”</p>
<p>Blood instantly blurred his vision.</p>
<p>Feeling the gaming pod simulate the sensation in his lower abdomen, Zhang Yi involuntarily shivered.</p>
<p>But then came the worry: was Soap also…</p>
<p>At this moment, Shepherd's voice slowly sounded.</p>
<p>“Five years ago, I lost thirty thousand men in the blink of an eye…”</p>
<p>“But the whole damn world just stood by and watched.”</p>
<p>Saying this, Shepherd found his revolver and began to load ammunition.</p>
<p>“Starting tomorrow, we'll have countless patriots and volunteers.”</p>
<p>“I think you understand.”</p>
<p>The truth was revealed: the shocking nuclear explosion in the previous installment had planted the seeds of hatred in Shepherd.</p>
<p>But don't you dare say it so righteously!</p>
<p>For the so-called revenge for soldiers, why then did he treat Task Force 141 and Shadow Company as pawns?</p>
<p>Why did he collude with Makarov to massacre civilians and put Allen in mortal danger?</p>
<p>Perhaps you weren't like this at first.</p>
<p>But now, you are no different from a madman like Makarov!</p>
<p>Could Soap die at the hands of such a person! ?</p>
<p>Listening to Shepherd's so-called confession, Zhang Yi felt absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>But at this critical moment.</p>
<p>Captain Price arrived!</p>
<p>He knocked Shepherd, who was about to kill Soap, to the ground.</p>
<p>Then the two wrestled together.</p>
<p>However, compared to the better-conditioned Shepherd, Price was clearly no match now.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi controlled Soap, wanting to pick up the revolver on the ground, but Shepherd, in the midst of the struggle, clearly noticed this and, unable to free his hands, kicked the revolver away.</p>
<p>It was a life-and-death struggle, fist to flesh, but soon Captain Price was at a disadvantage, pinned to the ground by Shepherd and relentlessly beaten.</p>
<p>At this moment, Soap's gaze slowly shifted to the dagger in his chest, and a prompt appeared on the game screen.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi's heart trembled, accompanied by Soap's hands gripping the dagger and a painful gasp.</p>
<p>The feedback from the gaming pod continuously came, and finally, with a 'splat,' the dagger was forcibly pulled out by Soap.</p>
<p>Then he aimed at Shepherd in the distance.</p>
<p>Filled with rage, Soap used all his strength to aim the dagger at Shepherd's head and threw it.</p>
<p>The sound of the dagger cutting through the air made Shepherd instinctively raise his head.</p>
<p>The next second.</p>
<p>“Splat!”</p>
<p>The dagger accurately pierced Shepherd's head.</p>
<p>Conspiracy, war, and tides had all come to an end.</p>
<p>Shepherd was dead!</p>
<p>But at this moment, Zhang Yi felt no joy of revenge.</p>
<p>Because Soap's injuries were too severe, the screen had slowly turned from crimson to gray.</p>
<p>This was a premonition of in-game death.</p>
<p>But in the story, could Soap still breathe and recover health like in a game?</p>
<p>Would Soap also die in the end?</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was extremely worried.</p>
<p>He had no doubt about this possibility.</p>
<p>After all, Roach had already died.</p>
<p>But then the sound of a plane appeared.</p>
<p>Nikolai, he had come.</p>
<p>Although Price had told him before departure that no rescue was needed, he still came.</p>
<p>“I remember saying this was a one-way trip.”</p>
<p>“This time is no different, unless they'll keep hunting us.”</p>
<p>The two old comrades exchanged a smile.</p>
<p>“Let's go, I know a place where Soap can get patched up.”</p>
<p>The helicopter roared into the sky, gradually disappearing into the vast yellow sands.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi slowly let out a breath.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Soap didn't die!</p>
<p>That was truly great!</p>
<p>But was this Chen Xu's mercy?</p>
<p>Recalling the entire storyline of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Zhang Yi took a long breath.</p>
<p>With two consecutive installments, he truly had too much to say.</p>
<p>And not just him; with the launch of the second installment of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.</p>
<p>Global players were absolutely blown away!</p>
