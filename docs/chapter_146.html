<p>Chapter 245: Too Many Choices Can Be a Kind of Suffering Too! (Seventh update, requesting subscriptions, monthly passes)</p>
<p>Following that was a simple dialogue sequence, which allowed Zhang Yi to understand some of the game's story background.</p>
<p>Currently, his Hunter identity was that of the Fifth Fleet's Reconnaissance Team, tasked with traveling to the New World to uncover the secrets of Elder Dragon migration. Forty years had already passed since the first investigation. Recalling Nergigante from the promotional Concept Art, and Rathalos from the promotional CGI animation, Zhang Yi's heart was filled with anticipation. At the same time, looking at the cabins packed with Hunters all around him, his heart was filled with even more emotion. Just the Fifth Fleet alone had so many companions, not to mention the four Fleets before them. Once they truly arrived in the New World, they should all be recruitable teammates. As for the friendly Mohawk-haired Hunter in front of him, according to typical storytelling, he would clearly be a good companion for the player. And judging by the usual plot conventions, it seemed that each Fleet would have a Hunter join the protagonist's party. Ultimately, under the protagonist's leadership, they would unravel the secret of Elder Dragon migration, and the protagonist would eventually become the legendary Azure Star. Although the game had just begun, Zhang Yi was already mentally envisioning the game's plot.</p>
<p>Just as Zhang Yi was fantasizing, the ship in the game suddenly shook violently! Lights flickered, and all the books, wine glasses, and food on the table crashed to the floor. The entire ship's deck began to tilt. The Hunters in the cabin were also in disarray. The Mohawk-haired young man, a member of the Hunter Reconnaissance Team, quickly ran towards the deck. At the same time, Zhang Yi's bun-haired partner nearby also shouted a line: “Partner, hurry, let's go out and see!” The investigator, acting as his partner, quickly ran towards the deck, and Zhang Yi's character automatically followed. A black and white Palico also hopped out, following behind.</p>
<p>Arriving on the deck, they saw that the once calm sea was now turbulent with raging waves. Huge waves crashed onto the deck. The entire ship shook violently, and all the Hunters could only cling to ropes, anxiously watching everything around them.</p>
<p>‘Splash!’</p>
<p>Just as everyone was at a loss, a gigantic, strange black creature, resembling a volcano, suddenly emerged from the ocean. As it reached the ship's body, under the night sky, the once calm sea suddenly began to churn violently. A black volcano abruptly rose from the seabed, and the ship, which was on the creature's back, was instantly split in two. Amidst the turbulent storm, Zhang Yi noticed that this colossal black volcano was not, in fact, a volcano as he had imagined. It was actually a living creature! As this enormous ‘black volcano’ continued to rise from the water, the ship carrying the Fifth Fleet Hunters slid off its back, and the game's protagonist was involuntarily thrown off.</p>
<p>Moments later, the camera moved to the creature's back, where black rocks and flowing lava surrounded them. As for the other Hunters, they had evidently been separated. At this point, the voice of the Handler could be heard calling from a distance. Simultaneously, some specific operation guides appeared. Climbing, running, and so on... Evidently, like most games, this was the story and tutorial, teaching players how to play. However, what truly surprised Zhang Yi was that during his conversation with the Handler, he also learned the name of this volcanic creature: Zorah Magdaros!</p>
<p>“This can't be a monster I'll have to fight later, right? It's so huge, even trimming its nails wouldn't count! If you really have to fight it, it'd be like scraping calluses!” Zhang Yi, in front of his computer, was utterly stunned. He had originally thought that Anjanath and Rathalos from the previous trailer, and Nergigante from the promotional Concept Art, were already excessively large. And now, right off the bat, he was told that this creature, resembling a volcanic island, was also an Elder Dragon?</p>
<p>Despite the awe, this part of the story had little actual content; it simply taught players how to operate in the game. After going through it once, Zhang Yi essentially understood, and also grasped a particular feature. “Just like the Undead, they can't jump on the spot, but they have the added attribute of taking no fall damage – an invincible buff!” Zhang Yi couldn't help but exclaim, looking at his pink-haired, rather playful Hunter in the game. Following the Handler all the way, Zhang Yi soon controlled his character to climb to the top of Zorah Magdaros's head. Then, a cutscene triggered, in which the Hunter used a grappling hook to latch onto a Wingdrake in the air, carrying the investigator away from Zorah Magdaros's body. This cutscene of leaving Zorah Magdaros's body reminded Zhang Yi of the scenes in Dark Souls when leaving the High Wall of Lothric and the Northern Undead Asylum; there was a slight similarity! Plus, this game's dragon-hunting theme... was it hinting at something? For some reason, a very peculiar feeling arose in Zhang Yi's heart. But before he could ponder further, as the Wingdrake passed through the clouds, the beautiful scenery that appeared before him astonished him. The sun rose from the horizon, and the outline of the New World appeared in view. Giant ancient trees reaching straight into the sky, and Aptonoth resting by the coast. Peaceful and serene, this scenery, which only exists in fantasy worlds, made Zhang Yi's eyes widen. The visual presentation was absolutely of a first-class standard. Even more crucially, this unique art design was simply stunning.</p>
<p>Upon entering the New World, with the bun-haired Handler, Zhang Yi understood his current basic situation. Incidentally, he also learned basic operations like map-reading from the Handler, and the next step was the main quest to find the Hunter base. However, Zhang Yi didn't rush to advance the main quest immediately. Instead, he curiously observed his surroundings. The clear blue sky, floating white clouds, distant waves and sandy beaches, and the sea breeze swaying the vegetation, accompanied by the chirping of insects and the calls of birds. Turning a small corner in the dense forest, another entirely new vista greeted him. On the wide expanse of land ahead, there were many Aptonoth foraging. According to the Handler next to him, these were a very docile type of dragon. Zhang Yi cautiously controlled his Hunter, running close to an Aptonoth that was eating to observe it up close. After discovering Zhang Yi, the uninvited guest, the creature truly showed no intention of attacking. Instead, it was Zhang Yi himself who was startled and ran in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The game's opening, from the shock and tension of Zorah Magdaros to the tranquility of the Ancient Forest, felt incredibly good to him. The next segment of the story was similar to the previous escape from Zorah Magdaros, except that the escape from Zorah Magdaros taught players normal game controls. While this segment in the Ancient Forest taught players normal game systems, such as how to read the map, gather resources on the map, the function of the green Scoutflies, how to hide from Jagras in the tall grass, and how to climb vines. “Why no weapons yet? I can't fight!” Zhang Yi felt a bit exasperated. Although the scenery was beautiful, he still wanted to take a weapon and try out the game's combat system, as hunting and fighting were the core, no matter how he looked at it. After a brief complaint, Zhang Yi continued to advance the story. He followed the investigator deeper and deeper. Just as they were about to reach Astera, the Fleet's base, they were attacked by a Great Jagras, but thankfully, the Investigation Leader rescued them. As for the Great Jagras, it became food for an Anjanath. “This is an Anjanath? I thought it was just a super weak small monster!” Watching the Anjanath tearing at the Great Jagras in the cutscene, Zhang Yi in the game exclaimed. After all, in the previously released promotional video, the Anjanath was first brutally beaten by a Hunter, and then by a Rathalos, giving him the illusion that it was very weak. But now, looking at its massive body, Zhang Yi had a completely different feeling: it was quite fierce!</p>
<p>After overcoming the danger, they finally arrived at Astera. A colossal base built with wood and monster bones, the entire Astera looked like a fortress, making a strong visual impact. Inside the base, all the members of the Fifth Fleet they had seen earlier had arrived and were busy transporting supplies. After a conversation with the Commander, Zhang Yi also took a tour of Astera under the guidance of the Squad Leader. Designed like a tall tower, each floor, from the lowest to the highest, had different areas and functions. The lowest floor was the commercial district, and moving up, there was the Smithy for forging weapons and armor, dining areas, and the Hunters' quarters. Besides these, there were also the Ecological Research, Botanical Research, the Argosy, the Command Center... each area had its own unique characteristics. For instance, in the Canteen, there was an eyepatch-wearing Palico, and its assistant chefs were enthusiastically preparing various ingredients. Inside the Smithy, artisans swinging their hammers were constantly forging equipment for the Hunters. The entire camp was full of life, with every Hunter fulfilling their respective duties.</p>
<p>After a brief tour and introduction, the Squad Leader led Zhang Yi to the Hunter's Lodge, where he was to choose a weapon and begin his official hunting quests. “It's here, it's here, it's finally here!” Zhang Yi was a bit excited watching this scene. Although the previous series of tutorials had allowed him to experience the beauty of the New World and the grandeur of Astera. He was still eager to start hunting quickly. After all, this game is called Monster Hunter; hunting is the main theme! But after the excitement, Zhang Yi fell into a dilemma of choice. Because there were simply too many weapons in this game! Having too many weapons to choose from was also a kind of suffering! They all felt incredibly powerful!</p>
