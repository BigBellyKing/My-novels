                <p>Chapter 227: Subsequent Operational Arrangements (Five updates, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)</p>
<p>As time progressed day by day, topics related to "Minecraft" maintained a tremendous level of popularity.</p>
<p>On major websites, any content related to "Minecraft" consistently had high click-through rates.</p>
<p>Various building videos within the game, as well as all sorts of funny videos, and strategy explanation videos for new players.</p>
<p>Many game industry designers were utterly bewildered.</p>
<p>With the passing of the New Year's holiday, employees from various departments of Nebula Games had also successively onboarded.</p>
<p>At this moment, Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and others stood behind Chen Xu, with curious expressions, watching the screen on Chen Xu's monitor.</p>
<p>Steve sat in a tank, and in front of him was a giant BOSS, with a health bar UI above its head.</p>
<p>The game's content was very simple: players only needed to sit in the tank, continuously attack the enormous monster in front of them, and then dodge the TNT bombs thrown by the monster.</p>
<p>It was very rudimentary, but what surprised everyone was that this MOD mode was not created by Chen Xu, but rather by "Minecraft" players.</p>
<p>After this MOD was released, it also quickly became the MOD with the highest download count, second only to the building complex MODs previously released by Chen Xu.</p>
<p>In just one day, it reached 2 million downloads.</p>
<p>"You can even drive a tank and fight a BOSS in 'Minecraft'!" Ruan Ningxue, who was behind him, looked surprised.</p>
<p>"It's not just driving tanks and fighting BOSSes. Theoretically speaking, all types of games, whether RPGs, racing, or FPS, can be showcased within 'Minecraft' using the game's rules," Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Of course, the actual experience certainly wouldn't have the same feel and rich content as regular FPS, RPG, or racing games.</p>
<p>But the key point is: when players play these types of games in "Minecraft," do they care about the feel of the game?</p>
<p>What they care about is that "Minecraft" can be played in such a way.</p>
<p>They are experiencing that unique characteristic.</p>
<p>Just like many players like to engage in adult content in normal games, but then like to study plot and life philosophy in adult games.</p>
<p>Do they truly want adult content and to discuss life philosophy?</p>
<p>Not really, they simply want something unique.</p>
<p>This is an inherent human nature.</p>
<p>Originally, in Chen Xu's plans, he had also secretly thought about creating some unique modes for players.</p>
<p>Such as Hide and Seek, Master Builder, and so on.</p>
<p>But now it seems he had clearly underestimated the players' creativity.</p>
<p>This MOD in front of him, called "Tank Battle Against Evil Monsters," although its content was very simple, had clearly opened a new door for "Minecraft" players.</p>
<p>Chen Xu believed that it wouldn't be long before more unique MODs would definitely appear.</p>
<p>"We don't need to worry about the rest. Everything can be left to the players. However, the maintenance of the community and the game environment must be done well!" Chen Xu said to the operations team.</p>
<p>Regarding the operations team, their primary focus was not on content operations for the game.</p>
<p>It was more about maintaining the game environment.</p>
<p>For instance, if players engaged in personal attacks, insults, and similar behaviors within the game, they would be given warnings, temporary mutes, temporary bans from online mode, as well as permanent mutes, or permanent bans from online mode.</p>
<p>Of course, unless they were deliberately asking for trouble, they would generally not trigger the permanent mute and permanent online ban package.</p>
<p>At most, it would just be a temporary mute.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, the operations team also nodded.</p>
<p>"Also, Lin Rou should collect information on players across various online servers. Later, this can be made into a 'Minecraft' documentary series, specifically for recording the history of 'Minecraft,' including various memes within the player community. We can also make some series out of these, for example, the first player to dig-three-fill-one at night, the first player to choose not to build a house but instead place their bed directly in an underground mine or cave. All of these can be made into a documentary, belonging to the history and memories of 'Minecraft' players." Chen Xu said to Lin Rou.</p>
<p>Regarding "Minecraft," Chen Xu was very clear about how long its lifespan truly was. Even after ten years of its release, its player growth numbers were positive every year, and it even repeatedly created new active player counts.</p>
<p>And in his previous life, its sales reached 230 million, becoming the best-selling game in the world, and it was continuously breaking this record.</p>
<p>It could be said that this game was entirely a miracle.</p>
<p>Therefore, regarding the official community and the maintenance of the game's atmosphere, Chen Xu naturally wouldn't neglect it.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, the mobile version of 'Minecraft' and the VR version of 'Minecraft' can also be put on the agenda," Chen Xu said, looking at Qin Yi and the others.</p>
<p>Among them, the mobile version, meaning the phone version, would share data with the PC version.</p>
<p>That is, if you bought the PC version, you could play the mobile version.</p>
<p>However, due to platform and hardware limitations, the mobile version, compared to the PC version, would have more content stripped down.</p>
<p>Firstly, there would be a visual downgrade; the mobile version certainly couldn't have the same graphics as the PC version.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of controls, it would also be more frustrating than the PC version, after all, it could only be operated via a touchscreen using a virtual joystick.</p>
<p>Besides that, there are also game modes; compared to the showcase mode and online mode in the PC version, the mobile version clearly would not be able to support them.</p>
<p>In addition, there are all sorts of MODs. Although the core gameplay data content itself is the same, considering the hardware performance, many MODs that can run on PC clearly would not be able to be supported on mobile phones.</p>
<p>If there were any advantages, it's that essentially every player likely owns a mobile phone and can play "Minecraft" anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>As for the VR version, it would be much more convenient and easier.</p>
<p>Even on the VR version, it could present graphics superior to the PC version. Of course, this refers to the game's original configuration.</p>
<p>After all, if one were to truly speak of maximum visual performance, then whether it's PC or VR, an unlimited DIY customization could be performed.</p>
<p>How high the machine's performance limit truly is depends on how fat your wallet is.</p>
<p>But in terms of mainstream configurations, at this stage, VR still has an edge over PC.</p>
<p>Therefore, the original content of "Minecraft" could be completely replicated in the VR version.</p>
<p>All that's needed is to adapt the controls for VR mode; after all, playing in a gaming pod using sensors is a different experience than on PC.</p>
<p>However, unlike the PC and mobile versions sharing data, the VR version would definitely require an additional purchase.</p>
