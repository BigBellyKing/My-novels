                <p>Chapter 257: Diablos is the Bottom of the Sandy Land (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Song Ren's face was tense.</p>
<p>Since starting the game, he hadn't "carted" once. The only truly dangerous encounter he'd had was with the Tobi-Kadachi.</p>
<p>Because the Tobi-Kadachi's attack frequency was too high, and he had been a bit greedy with his attacks.</p>
<p>He didn't choose to disengage to drink a potion, almost "carting." Fortunately, a Palico delivered a honey fruit to him then, saving his hide.</p>
<p>But now, Song Ren had a premonition: facing the Anjanath before him, he might "cart"!</p>
<p>Because this massive Anjanath in front of him was completely different from the monsters he'd encountered before.</p>
<p>Its attack power reminded Song Ren of Dark Souls.</p>
<p>Though it wasn't the kind of "two hits crippled, three hits killed" feeling of Dark Souls, these attacks were far fiercer than any previous BOSS.</p>
<p>"Maybe it's just that this one move has a particularly high attack power?"</p>
<p>Song Ren pulled back, then swung his Long Sword and charged forward again.</p>
<p>However, as soon as he got close this time, Song Ren saw the Anjanath in front of him let out a roar.</p>
<p>Immediately, the Hunter he controlled involuntarily clutched his ears.</p>
<p>Then, the Anjanath charged, knocking him flying, and his health bar instantly dropped by a quarter.</p>
<p>"This Anjanath is so strong!"</p>
<p>Dodging attacks incessantly while fighting, Song Ren experienced something called "oppression" for the first time.</p>
<p>He had always used the Long Sword's Spirit Blade combos to build up his Spirit Gauge.</p>
<p>But now, facing the Anjanath, there was no time to charge his Spirit Gauge.</p>
<p>He did try once, but the Anjanath kicked him flying directly.</p>
<p>As he fought, Song Ren found himself in an awkward situation: he had run out of healing potions.</p>
<p>And at that moment, the Anjanath conveniently headed towards the large platform seen in the previous trailer.</p>
<p>"Rathalos isn't here!"</p>
<p>Looking at the large platform, and recalling the scene from the trailer where the Anjanath and Rathalos battled, Song Ren had hoped to encounter the Rathalos, in a "when the snipe and clam fight, the fisherman benefits" scenario.</p>
<p>But now, it was clear the Rathalos was out.</p>
<p>The Anjanath, having just arrived at the Rathalos's lair, also spotted Song Ren pursuing it.</p>
<p>This instantly infuriated the Anjanath.</p>
<p><em>I didn't want to fight you before, I even retreated proactively, and now you dare to follow me!?</em></p>
<p>In that instant, the Anjanath let out a roar, its hind legs suddenly pushing off the ground, leaping into the air and pouncing towards Song Ren.</p>
<p>After a chaotic battle,</p>
<p>four words appeared on Song Ren's screen.</p>
<p>"EXHAUSTED AND COLLAPSED"</p>
<p>As the four words appeared, the screen went dark.</p>
<p>When the image reappeared, two little Palicos were seen pushing him back to camp in a small cart, then unceremoniously dumping him on the ground.</p>
<p>Song Ren, having been "carted" back to camp for free, recalled the process of being brutally beaten by the Anjanath, feeling somewhat bewildered.</p>
<p>The Anjanath's attack power was a bit ridiculous!</p>
<p>Although his armor was a bit outdated and he had only upgraded his weapon, it shouldn't have been <em>this</em> bad!</p>
<p>He had even eaten a Felyne Canteen meal that boosted his stamina at the start, but the damage was still too high!</p>
<p>It made no sense!</p>
<p>"Well, at least 'carting' back to camp only reduces the rewards, and the monster's health should still be the same as before. This is like getting several chances; I'll be more careful this time and definitely beat it!" Song Ren returned to his tent, refilling his healing potions to ten. Unfortunately, he had no honey left, so he couldn't make Mega Potions.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Song Ren once again embarked on the journey to battle the Anjanath.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>In reality, Song Ren wasn't the only one who felt the "water temperature" was rising.</p>
<p>Many players generally had the same feeling.</p>
<p>Some sensitive players already sensed it when they encountered the Tobi-Kadachi.</p>
<p>And when they met the Anjanath, this feeling was confirmed.</p>
<p>After all, the "newcomer killer" wasn't a title earned in vain.</p>
<p>To be fair, the Anjanath is actually quite easy to deal with; its tail and head are breakable parts.</p>
<p>Its attacks are also mostly repetitive: intimidating roars, head swings and bites, hind-leg digging, standing broad jump, charging Dragon Charge, and fire breath.</p>
<p>Its attack wind-ups are very obvious, making them generally easy to dodge.</p>
<p>For its fire breath, although the damage is high, the wind-up is very long, so it's still easy to avoid if you pay attention.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you can lure the Anjanath to the Rathalos's territory at the top and happily become a finisher.</p>
<p>Also, the Anjanath itself is vulnerable to many elements, especially water-element weapons, which can easily be crafted using previously acquired materials.</p>
<p>The main reason most players "carted" here was that the previous monsters were too easy to fight.</p>
<p>When they got to the Anjanath, facing this guy whose attack power suddenly soared, many players found it a bit overwhelming.</p>
<p>However, at this point, players only felt that something was slightly off.</p>
<p>Because the game allows for teaming up; facing the Anjanath alone can be a bit difficult.</p>
<p>But with multiple players, facing the Anjanath, which has many weaknesses and is quite clunky, is relatively easy.</p>
<p>And the most crucial point was that after defeating the Anjanath, the monsters players encountered even felt easier than the Anjanath.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>"Old Song, this is what you meant by the difficulty increasing a lot? Is that all there is to it? We beat it in one try." In the voice channel, Zhang Yi chuckled after he, Wang Han, Song Ren, and Joey defeated the Odogaron in the Rotten Vale.</p>
<p>"Stop bragging! You try to solo hunt this Odogaron!" Song Ren rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>"Why would I solo hunt if I can team up? Great Sword is very popular in teams!" Zhang Yi chuckled.</p>
<p>"It's probably the game's mechanism: start simple, then intersperse a more difficult monster, followed by easier monsters until the final BOSS," Song Ren said, subtly changing the subject.</p>
<p>He had indeed "carted" three times against the Odogaron in front of him.</p>
<p>Mainly because this creature, though seemingly small and even weaker than the initial Great Jagras,</p>
<p>was practically a hybrid of the Tobi-Kadachi, Anjanath, and Pukei-Pukei.</p>
<p>If caught and attacked, it would inflict a continuous bleeding status.</p>
<p>At the same time, the entire monster seemed to have ADHD, running around like a Tobi-Kadachi with incredibly swift movements.</p>
<p>While its attack power wasn't as high as the Anjanath's, its frequency was high, and getting caught meant a brutal combo.</p>
<p>And with the added effect of the game's AI performance, whether it was an illusion or not, this creature felt very cunning to Song Ren.</p>
<p>It often moved to its preferred main hunting grounds, which were filled with obstacles and effluvium.</p>
<p>This made hunting extremely difficult.</p>
<p>So, after "carting" three times, Song Ren decisively opted for the "call for backup" strategy.</p>
<p>"Indeed, the Zorah Magdaros battle, and the Legiana and Radobaan, were quite weak," Zhang Yi agreed, nodding.</p>
<p>The Zorah Magdaros was the mountain-like monster from the very beginning of the story, its entire body covered in hard rock.</p>
<p>And it wasn't a direct fight; you just had to fly onto its back and destroy its heat-dissipating organs. Nergigante would come to join the fun in the middle, but it was just a minor role.</p>
<p>As for the Legiana, its ice breath was a bit troublesome, and its movements were quite agile, but fortunately, after upgrading equipment, its attacks weren't too high.</p>
<p>"By the way, are we going to continue teaming up for the quests?" Joey asked.</p>
<p>"How about we part ways for now, and team up again only when we encounter a monster we can't beat? I feel like the monsters after this should be relatively easy," Song Ren judged based on his experience. After all, the Anjanath was difficult, then there was a period of easy BOSSes, and when he reached the Odogaron, he again felt a clear increase in difficulty. So, based on previous experience, the monsters after the Odogaron should be easier.</p>
<p>"Okay, I need to go hunt the Anjanath again; I'm just one material short of an upgrade."</p>
<p>"Then we'll disband the team for now!"</p>
<p>Everyone spoke their minds, and a decision was quickly made.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Song Ren also returned to the Hunter's Astera.</p>
<p>First, he went to the Astera's workshop to see which materials he needed to upgrade his equipment.</p>
<p>After getting everything ready, Song Ren went to talk to the investigator.</p>
<p>"Huh! This isn't a single quest this time? Two appeared at once!" Song Ren was very surprised to find that there were two quests this time.</p>
<p>According to the story, the Hunter asks the Ancient Dragon People about the movements of the Zorah Magdaros, and the Ancient Dragon People state that only by defeating the Rathalos and Diablos will they be qualified to know this secret.</p>
<p>Therefore, these two quests appeared in the quest list, requiring separate hunts for Rathalos and Diablos for the story to progress.</p>
<p>"RATHALOS: PEAK OF THE FOREST"</p>
<p>"DIABLOS: BOTTOM OF THE SANDY LAND"</p>
<p>The Rathalos quest likely referred to the place in the previous trailer where the Anjanath went to the Ancient Forest and was "taught a lesson" by the Rathalos.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when he hunted the Anjanath, he hadn't encountered the Rathalos, so he didn't know its combat prowess.</p>
<p>But Song Ren was more curious about the other monster, the Diablos.</p>
<p>After all, he had already seen the Rathalos in the trailer, but he had never seen the Diablos!</p>
<p>"I'll leave the Rathalos for now."</p>
<p>Moreover, it felt like the Rathalos, flying in the sky, would be quite difficult to fight.</p>
<p>Compared to that, the Diablos seemed a bit more reliable.</p>
<p>After all, Diablos are herbivores, so their temperament should be relatively gentle, just like the Aptonoth.</p>
