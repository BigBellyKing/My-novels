                <p>Chapter 583: Ethan, The True Man (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Song Ren, controlling Ethan in the game, could clearly feel Ethan's weakness at this moment.</p>
<p>His movements were no longer as agile as before, and he gasped heavily with every stretch of road he walked.</p>
<p>Along the way, there were also many werewolf-like monsters, spewed out from the mold, attempting to obstruct Ethan's path.</p>
<p>However, even without Chris's luxurious gear, for Ethan, these monsters couldn't stop him from rescuing his daughter.</p>
<p>But by the time Ethan navigated through numerous perils and reached the altar, the ritual seemed to have already been completed.</p>
<p>Miranda stared intently at the thick black liquid on the stone platform in the center of the altar. Her eyes were filled with anticipation as it pulsed as if boiling.</p>
<p>'Ah! Little Eva, my sweet daughter, come to me! Eva… is that you, Eva? Ah! I've missed you so much.'</p>
<p>Saying this, Miranda plunged her hands into the viscous black liquid.</p>
<p>A plump, sleeping infant was brought out.</p>
<p>However, the moment Miranda picked up the infant, her previously ecstatic expression froze.</p>
<p>'What? My power… is disappearing?'</p>
<p>Miranda looked incredulous. An indescribable power, endlessly flowing from the infant, was steadily draining Miranda's own strength.</p>
<p>As this power was extracted, Miranda's body began to collapse, her eye sockets taking on the black, moldy state. Clearly, Rose's power was far stronger than Miranda had imagined.</p>
<p>Or perhaps, the Mold entity had chosen Rose, not Miranda.</p>
<p>In any case, Miranda's ritual had clearly failed. The resurrected being was not her daughter Eva, but still Ethan's daughter, Rose.</p>
<p>'Rose! Miranda! Give Rose back to me!'</p>
<p>Watching Miranda holding Rose, Ethan aimed his gun at her but didn't fire.</p>
<p>Because she was still holding Rose in her hands.</p>
<p>'Interesting, your body isn't simple.' Miranda looked at the arriving Ethan with some surprise, but didn't appear flustered. Even though a good portion of her power had been absorbed by Rose in her arms, in Miranda's view, the gap between her and Ethan was still immense.</p>
<p>It was like throwing an axe into the sky; the sky was so high and vast, no matter how high the axe was thrown, it couldn't even scratch the sky's surface.</p>
<p>It was like pouring ink into the ocean; the ocean was so wide and grand, no matter how much ink was poured, it couldn't pollute the ocean's color.</p>
<p>It was like lighting a lamp under the sun; the sunlight was so brilliant and dazzling, no matter how brightly the lamp burned, it couldn't overshadow the sun's radiance.</p>
<p>'You must understand, once I truly kill you, everything…' Miranda wasn't in a hurry to act, looking at Ethan, ready to utter some harsh words.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>But before Miranda could finish, a gunshot suddenly rang out, and a burst of blood splattered from Miranda's head.</p>
<p>At the same time, from the mold-covered area above the statue, Chris's roar echoed: “Save Rose! Hurry!”</p>
<p>Decisively, Ethan immediately rushed to Miranda's side, preparing to snatch his daughter Rose back.</p>
<p>Accompanied by Miranda's roar, the mold began to rage, forming a barrier that blocked Chris's squad and everyone else outside.</p>
<p>At the same time, Rose was hidden by Miranda within the mold.</p>
<p>This was a war between Miranda and Ethan.</p>
<p>'You have completed your mission, Mr. Winters. You dealt with all my false children and awakened the glorious Mold entity. Now, please don't worry about little Rose; I promise to make her truly happy. Therefore, you can now die in peace… forever! You understand a parent's feelings, don't you? So why deny me?'</p>
<p>'Crazy woman, why don't you understand! Rose is my child! Not yours!'</p>
<p>'Don't interfere! The Mold entity saved me from the abyss of despair! Bestowing immense power upon me!'</p>
<p>'Yes, the Mold entity merely drove you mad!'</p>
<p>Ethan had completely entered a state of fury.</p>
<p>Because of this crazy woman, his fate had been altered.</p>
<p>Including Eveline three years ago!</p>
<p>Originally, he could have lived a stable life as a programmer, quietly with Mia, watching his daughter Rose grow up day by day.</p>
<p>But now, not only had he become a Fungal Beast, but this lunatic seemed intent on continuing to harm his daughter, using her as a vessel to resurrect the Mold entity and her daughter Eva?</p>
<p>How could this not enrage Ethan?</p>
<p>The large-caliber Magnum revolver made Miranda sway left and right, and grenade shells exploded on her body.</p>
<p>Shotguns, sniper rifles…</p>
<p>Using all his weapons, Ethan fought a desperate battle with Miranda within the barrier.</p>
<p>Under the massive firepower, Miranda, who had already lost some of her power, couldn't endure and let out a painful scream.</p>
<p>Ethan wasn't faring well either; his body was gradually collapsing. Although he could still cleanse himself to treat his injuries, he was slowly undergoing calcification.</p>
<p>Black, asphalt-like mold liquid spread, instantly piercing Ethan's calf and suspending him.</p>
<p>Miranda cackled maniacally, her sharp claws piercing Ethan's body.</p>
<p>But Ethan completely ignored his wounds, merely gripping his firearm and continuously shooting Miranda in the face.</p>
<p>A bloody melee ensued, with blood and black mold liquid splashing everywhere.</p>
<p>The sole thought sustaining Ethan's fight was to save Rose!</p>
<p>'Your time is up! Ethan Winters, I will have the Mold entity devour you, making you disappear forever!'</p>
<p>Miranda's sharp blade once again pierced Ethan's heart.</p>
<p>'You're the one who deserves to die!'</p>
<p>The last shotgun round was aimed at Miranda's chest, a single shot to her soul!</p>
<p>The powerful bullet directly blew Miranda's chest to smithereens.</p>
<p>'My daughter… my Eva!'</p>
<p>A shriek was squeezed from Miranda's mouth.</p>
<p>Crack, crack…</p>
<p>Subsequently, Miranda's body rapidly calcified, then shattered into fragments scattered across the ground. With Miranda's death, the encompassing barrier also began to calcify and crumble.</p>
<p>Just then, an infant's cry awakened the already blurry-conscious Ethan.</p>
<p>Amidst the crystalline remains of Miranda's death, a pink-cheeked infant was crying.</p>
<p>'Rose!' Even though he was struggling to move, his body on the verge of collapse, Ethan still dragged his broken body to Rose's side immediately, holding her tightly in his arms.</p>
<p>'Rose… it's okay… it's all over.'</p>
<p>But as he spoke, Ethan's right hand rapidly calcified. With a gentle breeze, it turned to dust and dissipated into the air.</p>
<p>At this point, Ethan could no longer hold on, and he knelt to the ground with a thud.</p>
<p>Yet, even then, the arm holding Rose remained as steady as a mountain, without the slightest tremor.</p>
<p>This final decisive battle didn't feel particularly difficult to Song Ren.</p>
<p>Of course, this was also because he was playing on the easiest difficulty.</p>
<p>But his focus wasn't on the combat at all; it was on Ethan's performance.</p>
<p>He hadn't played too many horror games. The original Outlast and the previous Resident Evil game hadn't left him with a particularly deep impression of the characters; he even forgot the reporter's name in Outlast.</p>
<p>But without a doubt, Ethan's performance in this installment, Resident Evil Village, truly moved him.</p>
<p>Ethan Winters, a true father and a true man.</p>
