                <p>Chapter 457: Mr. Chen’s Love Returns! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>At this moment, Song Ren was completely stunned.</p>
<p>The change came too quickly, like a tornado. A moment ago, he was still wondering why the people he delivered messages to were all Riddler-like and wouldn't speak properly. Now, was this family already shattered? All the men in the family, except for himself, were arrested and thrown into prison? And his mother suffered mental trauma due to the soldiers' attack and the family disaster?</p>
<p>“It’s alright, the game has only just begun.”</p>
<p>“We must believe in Mr. Chen!”</p>
<p>Despite many past precedents, Song Ren, who had experienced a lot of joy in the previous Uncharted game, still chose to believe in Mr. Chen.</p>
<p>As night fell, Song Ren controlled Ezio as he climbed to the window of the tower where his father was imprisoned and held a conversation. What surprised Song Ren was that Ezio's father seemed to have already anticipated being imprisoned. He told Ezio to go back home, where there was a hidden secret room containing evidence that could save them, which he should hand over to the Magistrate Uberto. That is, the fat man who had previously appeared at Ezio's house.</p>
<p>“I see! Everything is going according to plan!”</p>
<p>After the conversation, Song Ren's face was filled with sudden realization as the mission information updated. All of this was going according to plan, just a false alarm.</p>
<p>The cheerful Song Ren returned home. At the same time, Ezio in the game also unlocked the Eagle Vision skill and found clues about the secret room through some hints. After opening the secret room, he found a box inside. Inside the box were a letter and a set of Assassin’s equipment. A long sword, an Assassin’s uniform, and throwing knives, but without the Hidden Blades seen in the previous promotional trailer.</p>
<p>“So, Ezio’s old man is also an Assassin? An Assassin family!?” Seeing this, Song Ren had a sudden realization.</p>
<p>This makes sense! Everything is smooth now! Next, it would be about rescuing his father and then beginning the family’s Assassin legacy. From Ezio’s father to Ezio. Quite reasonable!</p>
<p>To the sound of the BGM from climbing the tower with his brother earlier, Ezio equipped the Assassin’s uniform and weapons from the box. It must be said that one phrase is indeed true: clothes make the man. Although the original Ezio was a handsome young man, his look could only be described as that of a well-born ruffian. But putting on this Assassin’s uniform, his handsomeness immediately went up a notch. He even felt a bit of a swagger when he walked.</p>
<p>“So next, I just need to hand over this evidence to that Uberto guy and rescue my family, right?”</p>
<p>Looking at the in-game mission objective, Song Ren spun around twice on the spot, preparing to head to the mission location to hand the letter to the person named Uberto and clear his family’s name. Just as Song Ren was about to set off, two soldiers appeared at the manor’s entrance, intending to kill Ezio outright.</p>
<p>“Finally, a weapon duel!”</p>
<p>Song Ren felt a bit of anticipation watching the combat scene load. After all, he had fought several times before, but always bare-handed. Now, a brand-new weapon system was unlocked. Drawing the straight sword from his waist, Song Ren slashed towards the two assailants in front of him.</p>
<p>Unlike the original in his previous life, Chen Xu had made many action modifications for Assassin’s Creed. Firstly, it featured more agile performance, unlike the somewhat stiff movements of the second installment in his previous life, where one could only fight enemies one by one when ganged up on. Of course, so far, players in the game haven’t unlocked all combat techniques. For example, Parry, as Ezio hadn’t fixed his Hidden Blade yet. Additionally, the kill streak system hadn’t been implemented yet. Because the current Ezio was not yet an Assassin. Nevertheless, with dodges, regular blocks, and combos, the action experience still felt very satisfying to Song Ren.</p>
<p>Song Ren also confirmed one thing: the difficulty of Assassin’s Creed was not very high. In reality, this was true; if one simply wanted to clear the game, the difficulty of Assassin’s Creed would not be very high. But there was a special setting in the game: synchronization rate. The truly difficult part was achieving perfect synchronization; that was where Assassin’s Creed became challenging.</p>
<p>Without much effort, Song Ren quickly took down these two small fries. In the city of Florence, besides ordinary passersby, there were many hostile forces. However, these were not city guards, but rather henchmen of the Vieri family. Before getting his weapon, Song Ren would avoid these people when encountering them on the road, but now, with his Assassin gear, Song Ren didn’t think twice and went wherever there were many people. After eliminating over a dozen people along the way, Song Ren arrived at the mission objective, handing the letter to the fat man Uberto.</p>
<p>However, something felt off to him: the fat man named Uberto in front of him just didn’t seem like a good person, and his smile was particularly cunning. His final remark, inviting Ezio to sleep at his “quite large” house, felt especially sinister. The subsequent plot confirmed Song Ren’s suspicion.</p>
<p>The next day, Ezio blended into the crowd and arrived at the Piazza della Signoria, where Uberto was presiding over the trial. Ezio’s father cried out that he was innocent, stating that the evidence was in the envelope Uberto received. But the other party flatly denied it, claiming he had never received any letter. Clearly, this fat man had betrayed Ezio and his father. Thus, 17-year-old Ezio could only watch helplessly as his father and brothers were hanged.</p>
<p>“Holy crap! They’re really dead?!”</p>
<p>Song Ren in the game was utterly bewildered, watching Ezio’s family being hanged. What about the promised family happiness? The game just started, and three of Ezio’s family members were already gone!? However, Song Ren didn’t have much time to reflect, as Ezio was now being pursued by soldiers. Crucially, in the cutscene, the sword in Ezio’s hand was broken, leaving Song Ren unarmed. Fortunately, with the help of one of Ezio’s father’s thief friends, Song Ren narrowly escaped the pursuers and arrived at a pleasure house called Seeking Fragrant Roses, run by Paola, a relative of the family’s maid.</p>
<p>“It’s over! Mr. Chen is showing his ‘love’ again!” Song Ren, observing Ezio’s family temporarily settled at Seeking Fragrant Roses, was utterly speechless. Recalling what Ezio’s family had said earlier, it was all foreshadowing flags! And even though Uncharted was very friendly, this new Assassin’s Creed just came out and immediately stabbed the player without a word. Although it was still early in the game, various plot points had shown players the warmth of his family. First climbing towers with his brother to see a doctor, then helping his younger brother find feathers—was all this just to ruthlessly wound the players later? While it wasn’t as distressing as watching Arthur Morgan gradually weaken and die on the hilltop in Red Dead Redemption, it was still a bit hard to take.</p>
<p>Song Ren sighed twice and refocused on the game. The brothel madam Paola, who had taken in Ezio and his family, revealed some information: she had once received help from Ezio’s father, who had saved her life in the past. So Paola began teaching Ezio some small tricks on how to hide himself. And she had Ezio go to Leonardo da Vinci, who, following a secret letter, repaired the Assassin’s Hidden Blade. Ezio then received news from Paola: Uberto would be attending the unveiling of Verrocchio’s latest work that night, located in the cloisters of the Basilica of Santa Croce.</p>
<p>“So now I should head to the Basilica of Santa Croce and personally kill that fat traitor?”</p>
<p>Song Ren took a deep breath, looking at the mission prompt. Although the death of Ezio’s family made him feel a bit down. But he was still looking forward to the upcoming plot, especially as the Assassin’s Creed promotional trailer he had watched earlier replayed in his mind. After all, the game was called Assassin’s Creed. Stealth and Assassination would certainly be core gameplay elements. Now, it was finally time for the main event. Assassin’s uniform, Hidden Blade—everything was ready, all that was left was the assassination!</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Song Ren controlled Ezio as he pushed open the door of Seeking Fragrant Roses. The next moment... the screen suddenly cut out, taking him to the Animus space, and a prompt appeared before Song Ren.</p>
<p>“Trial content has ended, please look forward to the official version”</p>
