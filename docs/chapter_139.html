                <p>Chapter 238: Not Even a Promotional Video Left? (Eighth update, seeking subscriptions and monthly passes)</p>
<p>After Chen Xu finished explaining the entire game concept draft to everyone, the "Monster Hunter: World" project was officially launched, and the team began to operate efficiently.</p>
<p>With previous experience developing "Dark Souls," the entire team was no longer new to the action system. Movements for different weapons were recorded.</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue's team also continuously produced original concept art drafts, then contacted third-party art outsourcing companies to generate art assets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chen Xu and Qin Yi continued to test the AI's performance, mainly to plan the difficulty numerical values for various BOSSes in the upcoming "Monster Hunter: World."</p>
<p>Regarding the BOSS performance in "Monster Hunter: World," Chen Xu actually didn't want the BOSS difficulty to only be reflected in the high numerical values leading to a low margin of error.</p>
<p>For example, if a normal monster attacks the hunter five times consecutively, the hunter will Cart.</p>
<p>But if a tempered monster attacks the hunter three times, the hunter Carts.</p>
<p>Before better AI technology was available, naturally, changes could only be made through numerical adjustments.</p>
<p>For instance, higher attack power, granting monsters a higher attack frequency, and faster speed.</p>
<p>However, with the current AI visual enhancement technology, Chen Xu hoped that the difficulty of monsters in the game would not only be reflected in numerical values but more so in their in-game performance.</p>
<p>For example, after implanting a series of commands such as escape, attack, enrage, and ambush into the BOSS.</p>
<p>BOSSes in the game would utilize advantageous terrain to attack players.</p>
<p>They would also provide action feedback based on player performance in the game.</p>
<p>For instance, in normal mode, players habitually distance themselves, then start sharpening their weapons or drinking potions.</p>
<p>A BOSS with a higher difficulty AI performance would directly execute a Dragon Charge.</p>
<p>However, after adjusting the AI numerical values to the highest, Chen Xu thought it best to take it easy.</p>
<p>Because under the highest AI performance, the BOSS's behavior was truly outrageous.</p>
<p>If genuinely implemented, the following situations would most likely occur.</p>
<p>A Longsword Hero performing a Red Blade Helm Breaker, ready to show off a clean cut.</p>
<p>The BOSS would take tiny steps to dodge the Longsword Hero's Helm Breaker, then counter with a Dragon Charge.</p>
<p>A Greatsword user mindlessly charging a powerful attack for the BOSS, and the BOSS would stand five meters away, looking at them like an idiot.</p>
<p>In a normal game mode, monsters primarily exhibit their habits; as for combat applications, those should be reserved for players hunting tempered dragons.</p>
<p>After all, "tempered" implies having experienced a hundred battles.</p>
<p>So it's quite normal for them to be more experienced in combat and know how to deal with hunters.</p>
<p>Of course, there must still be an upper limit to the difficulty value.</p>
<p>Players must still be able to farming decorations normally, right?</p>
<p>Otherwise, wouldn't "Monster Hunter: World" lose a major part of its fun?</p>
<p>Wouldn't players' desire to grind protest?</p>
<p>A Monster Hunter game that can't be extensively grinded, is that still Monster Hunter?</p>
<p>During this period, Chen Xu and his team gradually developed the content for "Monster Hunter: World."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the gaming industry was far from calm.</p>
<p>Firstly, "Minecraft" continued its fervent momentum.</p>
<p>Players were discovering more and more ways to play in the game.</p>
<p>At the same time, various MOD modules emerged endlessly, greatly enhancing the community content of "Minecraft."</p>
<p>As for sales, many game designers in the industry had become numb to them.</p>
<p>Beyond "Minecraft," another piece of news caught the attention of many designers in the industry.</p>
<p>That was, despite the major channel providers successively lowering their respective revenue-sharing ratios, they clearly weren't prepared to sit idly by.</p>
<p>On May 1st, several major channels announced a strategic partnership, forming a Channel Alliance to share channel resources.</p>
<p>At the same time, NetDragon and TengHua successively announced several major titles, stating that their works would also be available on the Channel Alliance.</p>
<p>This was unprecedented because NetDragon and TengHua had always been among the largest domestic channels themselves, and their respective games were essentially exclusive to their own channels.</p>
<p>But now, they were directly launching across all channels, the implications of which were self-evident.</p>
<p>This also put many designers in a dilemma.</p>
<p>The main reason was that once they joined the Channel Alliance, they could no longer launch on platforms other than the official ones.</p>
<p>Yet, the development trend of Nebula Games Platform here was still very good.</p>
<p>Multiple works had proven one point: the user base of Nebula Games Platform was sufficient to support game sales.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu remained very calm regarding the actions of NetDragon, TengHua, and the major channels.</p>
<p>Just as those channel providers couldn't do anything to Nebula Games, Chen Xu currently had no immediate solutions for them either.</p>
<p>The rest primarily relied on the accumulation of time; if Nebula Games Platform offered more excellent games and better services to players, then naturally Nebula Games Platform would become the largest channel, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Currently, Nebula Games Platform had entered a stable development stage.</p>
<p>Both its user base and game developers had stabilized.</p>
<p>The remaining task was to maintain the platform's competitiveness continuously with one excellent game after another, which was what Chen Xu feared least.</p>
<p>However, for more ordinary players, compared to the platform business.</p>
<p>More players were still focused on the games themselves.</p>
<p>Especially Chen Xu's fans, who were now in an uproar.</p>
<p>The reason was very simple: countless players discovered that Nebula Games was not participating in this year's gameplay Expo.</p>
<p>This suddenly left countless players bewildered and confused.</p>
<p>After all, Nebula Games had participated in the previous two expos.</p>
<p>In the first expo, they presented two small games and a trailer as the grand finale; in the second expo, they started with a trailer and a frustrating small game, The one with the big hammer.</p>
<p>But this third expo, Nebula Games was simply gone?</p>
<p>This immediately sparked widespread discussion among countless players.</p>
<p>'My gosh! Who noticed? Nebula Games isn't even participating in this year's gameplay Expo!?'</p>
<p>'Holy crap, really?'</p>
<p>'No way? Is Nebula Games no longer making games, but directly changing to be a channel provider?'</p>
<p>'Who told you that?'</p>
<p>'Can't you read? Obviously, I'm guessing!'</p>
<p>'But it's not impossible! The blazing momentum of "Minecraft" has made Nebula Games extremely profitable, plus Nebula Games Platform is on the right track. Although its commission is the lowest in the industry, and Mr. Chen said the profit is very small, it's stable!'</p>
<p>'No way!?'</p>
<p>Innumerable players' guesses became increasingly outlandish.</p>
<p>Many people even @-mentioned Chen Xu's official Weibo account.</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games, Chen Xu, who was leading the team in intense development of "Monster Hunter: World," felt speechless looking at the online comments after being reminded by his assistant Lin Rou.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he issued an official Weibo post.</p>
<p>"Thank you very much for your concern for Nebula Games. However, our non-participation in this year's gameplay Expo was a result of careful internal evaluation, as we are actively developing a brand-new blockbuster."</p>
<p>"To bring this new surprise to players even sooner, we decided not to attend this gameplay Expo, and instead dedicate ourselves wholeheartedly to developing the new work for players."</p>
<p>"So, please look forward to it."</p>
<p>Following Chen Xu's official Weibo post, many players became excited.</p>
<p>So that's it!</p>
<p>They are actively making a new game!</p>
<p>But soon, as players' excitement grew, they discovered a problem.</p>
<p>Aside from knowing that Nebula Games was developing a brand-new blockbuster.</p>
<p>They had no idea about its theme, genre, platform, or development progress!</p>
<p>Previously, Nebula Games, even when participating in the gameplay Expo, never brought playable content; they always just used a promotional video to get by.</p>
<p>This year, Nebula Games directly ditched the expo, so not to mention a so-called demo, there isn't even a promotional video!?</p>
