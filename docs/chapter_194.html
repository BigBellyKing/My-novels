                <h3>Chapter 294: How Can 60 Population Lose to 50 Population? (6th update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)</h3>
<p>Chen Xu's Wisp was placed at the opponent's neutral creep camp, but didn't scout the Blademaster who was leveling up.</p>
<p>Arriving at the neutral shop in the center of the map, Chen Xu saw the Blademaster who had already reached the neutral shop.</p>
<p>The Blademaster had already sold his Town Portal scroll, and also had a Circlet of Nobility and a stack of Dust of Appearance.</p>
<p>Clearly, the opponent was planning a heavily-equipped Blademaster build this match.</p>
<p>He had originally intended to buy that Circlet, but since the opponent had already bought it, he could only retreat for now.</p>
<p>Chen Xu chose to bypass the Blademaster and head straight for the Orc base. At the same time, Guadian had also scouted Chen Xu's base with his Orc Footman.</p>
<p>The single-line blockade made it impossible to enter, so he turned to kill a group of Sea Turtles and their two sons below.</p>
<p>“I don't know what you're playing, I'll just go with the default. Harassing my base to stop me from leveling?” Guadian, currently clearing creep camps, watched as the Demon Hunter ran into his base and started haphazardly attacking his shop, largely understanding the opponent's intention.</p>
<p>After attacking the opponent's shop for a while and seeing only Peons come to repair it, with no Blademaster in sight, Chen Xu knew that the opponent likely didn't intend to bother with him.</p>
<p>He immediately stopped wasting time. Instead, he led the Demon Hunter to the neutral shop and bought a Staff of Teleportation, an item that allows teleportation to an allied unit.</p>
<p>At the same time, he pulled his Archery units out from his base to start leveling, while upgrading to Tier 2 back home.</p>
<p>The audience and commentators were all surprised.</p>
<p>“What's going on?! An Archery unit going straight for Tier 2 tech?!”</p>
<p>“That's too desperate, isn't it?!”</p>
<p>On the commentary desk, Huang Donglai was also confused: “Is Mr. Chen planning to rush Tier 3 and use Mountain Giants? But that doesn't make sense! That way, he won't be able to stop a Tier 2 Orc Wolf Rider push!”</p>
<p>“Yeah! And what's that Staff of Teleportation for?” Watching Chen Xu control the Demon Hunter to return home and drink from the Moon Well to replenish health, Sun Yixie on the commentary desk was also puzzled.</p>
<p>The moment Tier 2 was completed, the neutral tavern immediately spawned the Beastmaster. He then summoned Quillbeasts and ran into the Orc base. At the same time, Chen Xu's Demon Hunter bought a Staff of Preservation (which can teleport one's hero back to the main base) from the Ancient of Wonders in his base.</p>
<p>By this time, the Beastmaster and Quillbeasts had already reached the Orc base. The Beastmaster attacked the outer shops, while the Quillbeasts directly penetrated deeper to attack a barracks under construction. The opponent clearly intended to go for a dual barracks spam strategy.</p>
<p>After this, a teleportation circle appeared above the Quillbeasts, and then the Demon Hunter was teleported over. The previously purchased Staff of Teleportation had found its use.</p>
<p>The building under construction was very fragile; two rounds of attacks instantly destroyed it. At the same time, Chen Xu continued to control his Level 2 Demon Hunter, Quillbeasts, and Beastmaster to attack the outer Burrows.</p>
<p>“Aren't you leveling anymore? Trying to harass me to death?” Guadian, who was leveling up, finally couldn't help but exclaim upon seeing this.</p>
<p>Before, a single Demon Hunter could be ignored.</p>
<p>But now, with a Beastmaster, Quillbeasts, and a Level 2 Demon Hunter, ignoring them would definitely lead to trouble.</p>
<p>The distance was quite far, and he had already sold his Town Portal scroll at the neutral shop earlier, so he could only walk his Blademaster and Shaman back home.</p>
<p>By the time they arrived, one Burrow had already been destroyed.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Demon Hunter, already at low health from Burrow attacks, was still teaming up with the Quillbeasts to attack the Peons chopping wood nearby. However, the moment he saw the Shaman, Chen Xu immediately used the Staff of Preservation to teleport himself back to his base.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu deliberately delayed the Beastmaster a bit, who was immediately hexed by the Shaman and then surrounded by three Orc Footmen. The Blademaster, using Wind Walk, rushed over and cleaved the Beastmaster's head. After a flurry of attacks, the Beastmaster regrettably died.</p>
<p>“Do you see that?! This is GOD! This is a god, this is the Almighty! The strongest Orc player right now, no, the strongest Warcraft player! That cross-shaped encirclement was too beautiful!” On the commentary desk, although Huang Donglai felt that commentators shouldn't favor one player, at this moment, recalling how the three players he had previously favored had all suffered crushing defeats, he still couldn't control himself.</p>
<p>“Indeed, it's impressive. Chen Xu's in trouble this time!” With his hair on the line, Sun Yixie also agreed.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu's mindset hadn't changed much. He was still playing very relaxed, and he found that his state was getting better and better, with his operations becoming much smoother.</p>
<p>Methodically, he revived the Beastmaster and continued with the same old routine.</p>
<p>“Beastmaster, Quillbeasts, and Demon Hunter, target your Burrows.”</p>
<p>What the heck!? Guadian was utterly speechless. What kind of playstyle was this?</p>
<p>Harassing him to death?</p>
<p>The Beastmaster died once already, and he's still coming back?</p>
<p>And aren't you leveling up?</p>
<p>Guadian was getting a bit annoyed by the harassment, but there was truly no good way to deal with this Beastmaster and Demon Hunter right now.</p>
<p>If the Demon Hunter's life was in danger, he would immediately use the Staff of Preservation to return home. After the Beastmaster died once, Chen Xu clearly wouldn't make that mistake again.</p>
<p>The overall impact wasn't huge; it was just genuinely annoying to be constantly harassed.</p>
<p>While Guadian was leveling up and resisting harassment, Chen Xu had already upgraded to Tier 3, built two Ancient of Winds, and capped his population at 50, as this would not trigger upkeep costs.</p>
<p>Then he immediately started producing master-level Druids of the Talon.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Demon Hunter and Beastmaster had already bought all the Invulnerability Potions on the map.</p>
<p>Soon,</p>
<p>“What's going on? Mr. Chen is building Druids of the Talon and capped his population at 50 to avoid upkeep!”</p>
<p>“Looking at the abilities, it seems Mr. Chen is planning to use Cyclone to restrict the Blademaster.”</p>
<p>“It actually seems feasible!”</p>
<p>“Isn't that too idealistic?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, and Guadian's Wolf Rider army is already taking shape, and the Blademaster is almost Level 5!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Mr. Chen has 50 population, and Guadian has 60! How can he win this?!”</p>
<p>Some people in the bullet comments had already guessed what Chen Xu was planning.</p>
<p>On the commentary desk, Huang Donglai and Sun Yixie also realized it.</p>
<p>“Just like with the Frost Armor Spider before, Guadian might be in trouble!” Sun Yixie said.</p>
<p>Druids of the Talon were cheap and didn't take up much population. Night Elf armies formed very quickly, and Chen Xu soon assembled a 50-population army and headed towards the Orc base.</p>
<p>“Oh, relax, just look at the Druid of the Talon's health. They're so fragile, they die in a few hits. Although magic attacks deal higher damage to heavy armor, and Wolf Riders' damage against units is generally average, the health advantage is here. And how can 60 population lose to 50 population?”</p>
<p>“How can you lose with a fully equipped Blademaster?”</p>
<p>“A Level 1 Beastmaster, a Level 1 Goblin Tinker, how do you fight that? You could just A-move and win!”</p>
<p>“They're about to engage! Charge, charge, charge! Let them see what a Wolf Rider 'riding face' looks like!”</p>
<p>Guadian, who was leveling up and returning home to buy two more Mega Potions to get his Blademaster to Level 5, now noticed Chen Xu's army.</p>
<p>He was instantly startled.</p>
<p>A Level 3 Demon Hunter, two Level 1 Goblin Tinkers, and a Beastmaster, followed by two Quillbeasts and a group of colorful Druids of the Talon.</p>
<p>The moment they met, the Goblin Tinker immediately threw down a Pocket Factory, while the Demon Hunter cast a Mana Burn on the nearby Shaman, and Faerie Fire landed on the Blademaster's head.</p>
<p>The Beastmaster, Goblin Tinker, Demon Hunter, and other units at the front furiously hacked at the Wolf Riders.</p>
<p>The Blademaster, afflicted with Faerie Fire, tried to use Wind Walk upon landing but it was useless; he was immediately cycloned into the air again.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Wolf Riders who charged into the formation were also cycloned into the air one after another.</p>
<p>The Orc Footmen looked formidable, but after being hit with Faerie Fire for armor reduction and then subjected to the magic attacks of the Druids of the Talon, a single volley left them all at critically low health.</p>
<p>Instantly, Guadian felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Because at this stage, it seemed he couldn't beat the opponent at all.</p>
<p>His main combat power was concentrated on the Blademaster.</p>
<p>As soon as the fight started, his main Blademaster and Wolf Riders were flying in the air.</p>
<p>A Blademaster with god-tier equipment, flying the entire time, how was he supposed to fight like this?</p>
<p>The Druids of the Talon directly cycloned their heroes into the air, while the Beastmaster and Goblin Tinker's summoned units were like a tide.</p>
<p>Plus, the heroes had Invulnerability Potions, Staff of Preservation, and Staff of Teleportation, allowing them to go home for a drink and teleport back to fight, essentially giving them two lives. How the heck were they supposed to fight this?!</p>
<p>The defeat was swift and complete.</p>
<p>At the same time, on the commentary desk, the two commentators who had made bold predictions were utterly stunned.</p>
<p>“What's going on?! Are Druids of the Talon that powerful? Guadian lost too?!”</p>
<p>As Guadian typed “GG”, all the players instantly erupted in excitement.</p>
<p>Qin Yi and others watching from the lounge area at Nebula Games also let out exclamations of surprise.</p>
<p>Chen Xu also stretched.</p>
<p>From the moment the Blademaster was cycloned, the outcome of this battle was essentially sealed.</p>
<p>To play the Cyclone strategy effectively, the best approach is to start with a Far Seer, then a Tauren Chieftain, paired with Spirit Walkers, and then quickly secure Mass Healing and Invulnerability Potions.</p>
<p>Basing on powerful AOE to directly eliminate the fragile Druids of the Talon.</p>
<p>In this match, the opponent started with a Blademaster, and their second hero was a Shaman, not even a Tauren Chieftain, using a versatile playstyle. Additionally, the opponent was unfamiliar with this particular strategy and didn't produce many Spirit Walkers, which already gave Chen Xu a significant advantage.</p>
<p>There was also a crucial reason why Chen Xu chose this playstyle.</p>
<p>That is, the Cyclone strategy is very effective at limiting the opponent's actions.</p>
<p>When units are all flying in the air, what kind of body blocking or extreme low-HP kiting do you want to play?</p>
<p>You're dreaming!</p>
<p>Without Spirit Walkers, Orcs facing the Cyclone strategy virtually have no room for intricate maneuvers; they can only rely on their opponent's mistakes.</p>
<p>Because the Night Elf Cyclone strategy is at its strongest during the 50 population stage.</p>
<p>50 population relying on Druids of the Talon can fight against an Orc 60 population.</p>
<p>Once this window is passed, every minute delayed reduces the chances of winning.</p>
<p>In the live stream, the screen was already flooded with various bullet comments.</p>
<p>“Holy cow, Night Elves can play Orcs like this too?”</p>
<p>“I'm convinced. Are you really a Game Designer or a professional player, damn it?”</p>
<p>“Seriously, if anyone ever says Orcs are too strong in Warcraft again, Mr. Chen, I'll help you chop them alive!”</p>
<p>“I'm telling you! Orcs ARE too strong! Didn't you see that out of Mr. Chen's four wins, two of them involved summoning the Beastmaster?!”</p>
<p>“Give the ally above a proper burial; my Italian cannon has already fired!”</p>
