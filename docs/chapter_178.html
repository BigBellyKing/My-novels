<p>Chapter 277: This Game is Absolutely Phenomenal! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>“The visual presentation is excellent!”</p>
<p>Wang Han, sitting next to him, couldn't help but praise the game screen before her.</p>
<p>Even though she didn't like playing RTS games, it wasn't like she had never played one. She could tell the quality of <em>Warcraft</em>'s visual presentation at a glance.</p>
<p>“It's not just the visual presentation; the game's setting also seems to have something special!” Although not a hardcore RTS player, Zhang Yi had played for a while and had some understanding of RTS games.</p>
<p>Following the system's prompts, Zhang Yi searched for the Prophet.</p>
<p>Upon reaching a flag in the middle, the Orc soldiers who had previously appeared in the CGI cutscene ran out from a nearby building. There were three of them, surrounding Thrall, whom Zhang Yi was controlling. These were clearly the unit types in the game.</p>
<p>Patrol, move, attack, hold position – compared to typical RTS games, <em>Warcraft</em> offered richer operational functions. However, what felt different to Zhang Yi was the design of the soldiers and heroes.</p>
<p>Thrall in the game was a unique hero who could level up to increase corresponding attributes and possessed unique Skills. As for the regular soldiers, they only had basic attack panels and no special attributes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there was a significant difference between heroes and regular soldiers. Beside the skill bar on the right, there was also an Item inventory. Although there were no items yet, it was clear that the game supported acquiring and using items. However, it seemed only heroes could use them.</p>
<p>In the past, games like <em>Human Wars</em> also had some special units, such as siege beasts, which were strategic control units capable of turning the tide of battle. In <em>Warcraft</em>, it was clear that heroes were more than just that. Being able to use Skills and items could greatly impact the battlefield. Crucially, heroes could also increase their level and possess elements of progression usually only seen in RPGs, such as Strength, Agility, and Intelligence.</p>
<p>This feeling reminded Zhang Yi of the Three Kingdoms era, somewhat akin to a general leading soldiers into battle.</p>
<p>Besides these elements, the attributes of the units in the game also gave him a hint of something new. In previous RTS games, it was basically a free-for-all of various unit types. While there was talk of counter-units, it mostly boiled down to building units and having them fight each other. But with <em>Warcraft</em>, even though he had just started, looking at the three green Orc soldiers on their panels, Zhang Yi could already see the difference.</p>
<p>Soldiers and heroes had entirely different Attack Types and Armor Types. This meant that the damage dealt between different unit types would also vary. While Zhang Yi was noticing these details and sensing the distinctiveness of <em>Warcraft</em> as an RTS, Wang Han's attention was clearly elsewhere. As someone who rarely played RTS games, she might not have noticed this aspect at all.</p>
<p>Wang Han was more focused on the hero Zhang Yi was currently controlling, named Thrall.</p>
<p>“Your Thrall's main attribute seems to be a Mage, right? Why is his appearance and attributes so strange?” Wang Han interjected.</p>
<p>Listening to Wang Han, Zhang Yi also shifted his attention to Thrall in the game. Muscular, wielding a huge hammer, and riding a black dire wolf, then looking at his attribute points: 16 Strength, 18 Agility, 19 Intelligence.</p>
<p>If it weren't for Intelligence taking the lead, it would be impossible to tell this was someone who cast spells!</p>
<p>“This is actually quite normal. After all, this hero named Thrall is an Orc. As an Orc, being muscular, riding a wolf, and having a hammer as a weapon — don't you think that's very reasonable?” Zhang Yi pondered for a moment before offering his opinion.</p>
<p>“Hmm… it does seem quite reasonable, but a Mage who wields a hammer? Why does that feel so strange?” Wang Han looked at the burly Thrall in the game and once again voiced her thoughts.</p>
<p>“He's not necessarily a Mage; it just means this character named Thrall has higher Intelligence,” Zhang Yi explained.</p>
<p>“Oh, come on, stop dwelling on this issue, and quickly check out the game's performance!” Seeing that Wang Han seemed about to say something else, Zhang Yi changed the subject. After all, these details weren't crucial. And actually, if you thought about it, it was quite realistic; after all, Orcs are generally perceived as burly. If this Thrall were a delicate young idol, people would probably question if he was even an Orc.</p>
<p>“However, compared to other RTS games, <em>Warcraft</em> brings so many changes and innovations!” Zhang Yi said with some emotion. Controlling Thrall, Zhang Yi began to advance the Story Campaign. As he commanded, Thrall and the Orc soldiers in the game would give corresponding dialogue feedback to the player's orders. In Versus Mode, the dialogue was generally fixed. But in the Story Campaign, compared to his previous life, Chen Xu had made some changes.</p>
<p>Specifically, the various dialogue feedbacks would be dynamically paired with the current plot progression, providing players with a higher sense of immersion. Pushing through the prologue's plot bit by bit, some content gradually unfolded before Zhang Yi. For instance, the impact of heroes on the overall battle.</p>
<p>Taking Thrall as an example, the Thrall in the prologue currently only had two Skills, mainly to avoid overwhelming players. One was Chain Lightning, a group-damaging AOE spell. The other was a scouting Skill that could reveal areas in the Fog of War.</p>
<p>As an RTS player, Zhang Yi immediately recognized the importance of Thrall's Skills. In traditional RTS games, the competition was often more about technical skill. Whoever had superior micromanagement was more powerful. As for unit counters and tactics, they existed, but their significance wasn't truly great. But in <em>Warcraft</em>, he saw something different: the changes that heroes brought to the gameplay. A well-placed Skill could even determine the outcome of a skirmish.</p>
<p>Of course, he didn't know if this held true in the actual multiplayer mode. For now, he was just systematically progressing through the game's Story Campaign. Since he was playing on easy difficulty, Zhang Yi found it quite straightforward; he only lost two Orc soldiers throughout. After rescuing an Orc named Grom Hellscream, Thrall and the Orcs of The Horde set sail using human ships.</p>
<p>The next moment, a CGI appeared on the screen, exciting Zhang Yi. A brand-new CGI! How much had this game actually developed?! From a distant cliff, watching Thrall's fleet depart, the Mysterious Wizard muttered to himself: “Go forth, young Thrall, to the lands of Kalimdor, for there you shall find your destiny.”</p>
<p>As the Mysterious Wizard's words fell, a melodious tune began to play, and the scene transformed into a Raven flying off into the distance. The screen briefly went dark, the Raven soared through the Alterac Mountains, swept over barren valleys, and finally arrived at a prosperous Human city-state: Lordaeron. In the great hall, countless voices were discussing animatedly. Their topics revolved around Orcs and the Plague.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the aging King Terenas sat in contemplation on his throne. At this moment, the Raven flew in from somewhere, landing in the center of the great hall. Concurrently, the background music turned somber. This eerie Raven caught Terenas's attention. Suddenly, a strange green light emanated from the Raven, and to everyone's astonishment, it transformed into a man – the Prophet who had previously guided Thrall.</p>
<p>His voice, however, echoed throughout the great hall: “Humanity is in peril! A dark power is about to return, and the entire world stands on the brink of war!” “Listen to me! Your people's only hope is to go west, to the ancient lands of Kalimdor!”</p>
<p>The palace ministers commanded the guards to drag this 'madman' out, but the old King stood up and stopped them. He looked at the Wizard before him, his face stern: “I do not know who you are or what you believe! But now is not the time to spread prophecies. Our kingdom is beset by conflict and turmoil, but it is for us to decide how best to protect our people! Not you! Please leave!”</p>
<p>The Wizard slowly lowered his head, his voice turning somewhat grim: “I once failed to save humanity and abandoned my own, but this time, I will not do so again.” “If you cannot accept this task, then I will find another who will.” The Wizard slowly turned and departed, leaving behind a whisper that only he could hear: “I have given my warning; now their fate is in their own hands.”</p>
<p>The screen went dark, the CGI ended, and a new game chapter appeared. This CGI wasn't very long, lasting about 3 minutes. But it had already revealed enough: the animosity between Orcs and Humans, the mysterious Plague spreading in Lordaeron, and why this Prophet, who had previously sought out Thrall, wanted both Humans and Orcs to go to the ancient western land of Kalimdor.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Zhang Yi didn't immediately proceed. Instead, he felt a mix of excitement and exhilaration. It was simply too polished! Even though less than an hour had passed, <em>Warcraft</em> had completely won him over, at least in its single-player Story Campaign!</p>
<p>Zhang Yi turned to express his excitement to Wang Han, but found she was no longer there. She had evidently gone to quietly download <em>Warcraft</em> herself and try it out. So, Zhang Yi quietly opened his Microphones and turned on his mic.</p>
<p>“Old Song, what do you think of <em>Warcraft</em>?! This game is absolutely phenomenal! I've never played an RTS game like this before! And the CGI is just incredible!”</p>
<p>After saying this, he exited the voice channel. He had vented his excitement. As he didn't know Old Song's progress yet, it was a good choice to quickly leave after speaking to avoid any spoilers for later content.</p>
