                <p>Chapter 226 Ten Million Sales (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Second day of the Lunar New Year</p>
<p>Regarding Minecraft's sales figures, they have also been released.</p>
<p>Thanks to the initial promotion, especially those special videos of Along the River During the Qingming Festival, the Forbidden City, as well as the piano and calculator builds.</p>
<p>All allowed Minecraft to gain immense popularity before its official launch, coupled with its relatively low price and the pre-sale that had been open for a month.</p>
<p>All these reasons led to Minecraft's sales volume literally exploding.</p>
<p>Minecraft 24-hour sales: 3,212,231 copies.</p>
<p>First-day sales of 3.2 million.</p>
<p>To say it's unprecedented and will never be surpassed would be a bit of an exaggeration.</p>
<p>But at least it's the best performance in recent years.</p>
<p>Although Minecraft is only priced in two digits and has a clever aspect to it, regardless, the first-day sales of 3.2 million are undeniable.</p>
<p>What also astonished many industry designers was the incredible gameplay of Minecraft and the positive reviews from players.</p>
<p>Previously, after the Early Access trial that began with the pre-sale, Minecraft's player rating was 9.0 points, neither high nor low.</p>
<p>But now, its rating has reached a high score of 9.8.</p>
<p>An incredible figure.</p>
<p>Although previously, due to Minecraft's powerful promotion, it had already achieved a 'breaking out of its niche' effect.</p>
<p>Even making many non-gamers aware that Minecraft existed.</p>
<p>Coupled with the early pre-orders, many gaming industry designers felt that Minecraft would achieve high first-day sales.</p>
<p>But once the 3 million sales were revealed, everyone was truly shocked.</p>
<p>"My heavens, Chen Xu is too fierce, isn't he? A pixel block-building game with such high sales?"</p>
<p>"Stop calling it a block-building game, does your block-building game look like this?"</p>
<p>"Mainly, Minecraft's promotion is too strong!"</p>
<p>"Indeed! It's the first time I've seen a game that can pull off such elaborate tricks in promotion."</p>
<p>"It's completely a textbook-level promotion!"</p>
<p>"It's impressive, but it feels like only Minecraft could achieve it and it has no reference value whatsoever."</p>
<p>"That's right, Minecraft can be promoted like this mainly because of the game's underlying mechanics; ordinary games can't replicate this approach at all."</p>
<p>Industry designers who had been following Minecraft were all filled with emotion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in TengHua's Voyage (Game) project office.</p>
<p>After receiving the sales data for Minecraft, Zhu Yi also let out a long breath and felt a bit relieved.</p>
<p>At first, he really wanted to contend with Minecraft, especially after its trial ended.</p>
<p>But because of Minecraft's subsequent promotion, he finally restrained himself, choosing to even waste the previous warm-up promotional materials and endure for a while.</p>
<p>Looking back now, this could be said to be a brilliant move!</p>
<p>After all, the gaming industry is a very magical industry.</p>
<p>No one can say for sure what might happen; a highly anticipated blockbuster might suddenly suffer a Waterloo, while some small-scale productions might suddenly become incredibly popular, spreading across the globe.</p>
<p>Such cases occur almost every year.</p>
<p>Moreover, Chen Xu himself has an amazing track record, having created many miracles.</p>
<p>Coupled with Minecraft's incredibly high popularity and stunning content demonstrations.</p>
<p>Zhu Yi was also extremely cautious, and looking back now, he made a brilliant move!</p>
<p>In a month's time, by then, Minecraft's popularity should have mostly passed.</p>
<p>By that time, his Voyage (Game) when it launches, should be relatively stable.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>The gaming industry's attention to Minecraft obviously had nothing to do with the players.</p>
<p>As for the players, entering Minecraft once again and experiencing it, more and more content was being discovered.</p>
<p>From not understanding anything at first to being able to build furnaces with stone and learning to cook food in the furnace, as well as smelting iron ingots, crafting armor and weapons, etc.</p>
<p>From initially only knowing how to dig a pit to bury themselves to being able to dig a cave and live like cavemen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some players also discovered that the small animals in the game could even be tamed with food.</p>
<p>As time progressed, players gradually uncovered the joys of this game.</p>
<p>Of course, during this process, there were also some tragic incidents.</p>
<p>For example, dying in the wilderness with a large pile of materials and then not being able to find the death spot to retrieve them.</p>
<p>Finally building a cozy and warm home, then venturing out into the wilderness for an adventure, only to find no way back home, still alive, but essentially dead.</p>
<p>Because of this, many players, in order to find their way home after going out and prevent themselves from getting lost, would build a very tall structure near their home as a beacon, or build a directional beacon after walking a certain distance so they could find their way back home.</p>
<p>And of course, there were even more despair-inducing incidents, such as some players laboriously building a home, only to open the door the next morning after sleeping and find a Creeper crouching at the entrance. Before they could react, the white flash and hissing sound already appeared.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on various communities and video platforms, posts and videos about Minecraft also flooded the platforms.</p>
<p>"Minecraft First Experience, Basic Tutorial to Show You How to Play!"</p>
<p>"Dig-three-fill-one, Cavemen, Using Local Materials, Which of these have you done?"</p>
<p>"Step-by-step guide on how to build a duplex villa!"</p>
<p>"MC Infrastructure Team: Recreating the Great Wall!"</p>
<p>On various video and community websites, the corresponding posts basically ranged from simple to in-depth.</p>
<p>Initially, most were tutorial-like videos and posts for new players.</p>
<p>Mainly, players who understood the basic game rules were educating the newcomers.</p>
<p>However, soon, as players became more familiar with the game, more and more videos emerged in full bloom.</p>
<p>There were various funny prank videos, technical videos on building houses, and strategy videos simply teaching players how to better survive in Survival Mode.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on major live streaming platforms, Minecraft also experienced a boom; many streamers would stream this game in their spare time.</p>
<p>Of course, more often, countless players in Minecraft were playing the game in their own preferred ways.</p>
<p>Some players treated it as a pixel-style block-building game, playing in Creative Mode or entering peaceful pure servers to build structures with like-minded players.</p>
<p>Some players treated it as a survival adventure game, in Survival Mode, collecting resources and carefully exploring the unknown.</p>
<p>Some players treated it as a unique multiplayer game; in multiplayer mode, forming groups and developing extensively.</p>
<p>Still other players treated it as a travel game, admiring the magnificent structures Chen Xu had created, as well as buildings opened by other players.</p>
<p>Of course, there were also some online disputes online; for example, some players kindly opened servers without setting them to indestructible, and were then subjected to malicious destruction by others.</p>
<p>There are bad people in the crowd!</p>
<p>But compared to other games, it can be said that Minecraft is one of the games with the least hostility.</p>
<p>Even in the multiplayer mode most likely to cause disputes, compared to other games, it was much more harmonious.</p>
<p>As for this, Chen Xu didn't pay too much attention.</p>
<p>After all, where there are people, there is a community; player matters should be left to the players to resolve.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>As time progressed, soon Minecraft's subsequent sales figures were compiled by third-party organizations.</p>
<p>First-week sales: 10.12 million copies, weekly active users: 8.62 million.</p>
<p>Although during this period, the popularity of Minecraft was clearly felt.</p>
<p>But once these figures were released, everyone was still stunned.</p>
<p>What's going on? First-week sales of 10.12 million copies, and more critically, weekly active users even reached 8.62 million?</p>
<p>What kind of monster is this!</p>
<p>It's important to know that for games with massive promotional campaigns, first-day sales can account for the majority of their total sales or even half of them.</p>
<p>But this rule seemed to fail for Minecraft.</p>
<p>Because its trend was simply too stable.</p>
<p>In NetDragon's and TengHua's two studios, though not together, Meng Zuo and Zhu Yi, looking at Minecraft's related data, were both a little 'doubting life itself'.</p>
<p>Especially Zhu Yi, who had originally planned to launch Voyage (Game) a month after Minecraft went online.</p>
<p>But later, with limited funds, he had already figured out how to promote it.</p>
<p>But Minecraft's ever-increasing popularity directly scared him off.</p>
<p>Although he felt that Minecraft's sales would be terrifying, the first-week sales of ten million still astonished him.</p>
<p>Even though Minecraft's price wasn't high, this was only the first week!</p>
<p>And judging by the situation, its popularity showed no signs of cooling down, even more exaggerated than Fall Guys back then.</p>
<p>If this growth rate continues, then won't Minecraft become the best-selling game of all time?</p>
<p>Moreover, Minecraft's so-called sandbox gameplay was completely different from the core discussions in the gaming industry before!</p>
<p>At this moment, he felt a little lost.</p>
