                <p>Chapter 281: Warcraft Craze (7th update, please subscribe and vote for monthly passes)</p>
<p>In a certain residential community in the Imperial Capital.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, taking a cardboard box from the storage locker, had an excited look on his face. Today was the official release day for Warcraft, but he didn't immediately sit in front of his computer as usual. Because he had something more important to do.</p>
<p>“Wow, this is heavy! Nebula Games, couldn't you make it a bit smaller?!”</p>
<p>After unwrapping the outer packaging from the storage locker, Zhang Yi found himself in a pickle. Because he realized that Nebula Games was too honest. The collector's Steelbook Collector's Edition of Warcraft truly was a large steel box. Measuring 30-40 centimeters in length and width, and 15 centimeters in height, its front was emblazoned with the pattern of Frostmourne, and its overall tone was bleak. This thing had completely exceeded his imagination.</p>
<p>“Where am I going to hide this when I get home?” Looking at the collector's Steelbook Collector's Edition in his hand, Zhang Yi was stumped.</p>
<p>“Hide it in the wardrobe, under the quilt, where you always hide your money,” a familiar voice came from behind him.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, holding the steel box, turned his head and saw a familiar figure behind him.</p>
<p>“Cough, cough… weren't you out buying groceries?” Zhang Yi coughed twice, trying to dispel the awkwardness.</p>
<p>“How long does it take to buy groceries? Come on, let's go home. Don't I know your little schemes? Hiding small change, I won't even bother talking about you, you have no creativity at all,” Wang Han rolled her eyes and said irritably.</p>
<p>“Alright, let's hurry home. I think the Steelbook Collector's Edition has some background stories about Warcraft, which would be a good supplement,” Wang Han walked ahead, even appearing a bit more anxious than Zhang Yi. It must be said, she was truly a little addicted. Warcraft felt like watching a TV series to her. If it were an ordinary RTS, it wouldn't be so addictive, but the key was that she was curious about Warcraft's plot! For example, what would happen to Arthas later, and what was the origin of that mysterious wizard who could transform into a raven.</p>
<p>Back home, after plating the cooked dishes and glancing at the time, seeing that it was still early for dinner, Wang Han and Zhang Yi sat side-by-side in front of the computer. One opened the Nebula Games Platform to enter Warcraft, while the other opened the collector's Steelbook Collector's Edition.</p>
<p>“So that's it! Orcs weren't originally a race of Azeroth!”</p>
<p>“The wizard is called Medivh. It was said that he once had the chance to save humanity but abandoned his humanity, referring to being influenced by this guy called Sargeras, and then participating in the construction of the Dark Portal, allowing orcs to enter Azeroth!”</p>
<p>As players who had purchased the collector's Steelbook Collector's Edition, Zhang Yi and Wang Han played the game while referencing the art book album in the collector's edition. At the same time, enthusiastic players online also posted the relevant content from the collector's edition online, allowing more players to know. In the collector's edition, Chen Xu didn't reveal much, only explaining why humans and orcs harbored such animosity, as well as the origin of the Lich King Ner'zhul, Medivh's past, and so on. But it was precisely these simple details that allowed players to feel just how vast the world-view of Warcraft truly was.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on major live streaming platforms, just like with the previous Monster Hunter: World, Warcraft also formed a craze. On the day of its launch, streamers on all major platforms simultaneously played Warcraft. Large numbers of players were captivated by the game's CGI, its excellent plot, and its revolutionary gameplay.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Under Medivh's guidance, Thrall managed to restore Grom Hellscream's sanity through a ritual. Then, Thrall and Grom Hellscream ventured to Demonfall Canyon in Ashenvale, attempting to defeat the mastermind behind it all, the Destroyer Mannoroth.</p>
<p>During the battle, Thrall furiously swung Doomhammer at Mannoroth, but the demon's power was so immense that he easily defeated Thrall. At this critical moment, Grom Hellscream let out a furious roar. Relying on the power gained from the demon blood, he poured all his might into swinging Gorehowl, shattering the demon's chest plate and slicing the demon's evil heart into pieces.</p>
<p>Mortally wounded, Mannoroth exploded in a gush of flames, leaving only the still-raging Grom Hellscream. Amidst the swirling hellfire, as Mannoroth died, the fervent crimson in Grom Hellscream's eyes gradually faded. The demon blood boiling within the orcs calmed, and the orcs were finally completely freed from the demon's curse forever, no longer slaves to demons. In the last moments of his life, Grom Hellscream regained his honor.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>“A betrayer?”</p>
<p>“In truth, I am the one who was betrayed.”</p>
<p>Accompanied by rolling thunder, a blurry black figure appeared in the shot, his identity revealed by the twin wings on his back and the horns on his head — Illidan. Dark clouds and fierce winds roared and swirled. The tumultuous waves on the sea continuously surged.</p>
<p>“Even now, I am still being hunted.”</p>
<p>“I am still hated.”</p>
<p>“But now, my sightless eyes can perceive horizons invisible to mortals!”</p>
<p>Illidan gazed somberly into the distance.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, the hand of fate must be taken into one's own hands!”</p>
<p>Amidst the crashing thunder and surging sea, a closed eye in the deep ocean opened. Countless Murlocs swam upwards from the depths of the sea.</p>
<p>“At the cost of my eyes, I bring ruin to those who presume themselves worthy!”</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>‘The Frozen Throne is mine, demon, get out of my sight!’</p>
<p>‘Leave this world, and never return. Should you dare, I shall be waiting…’</p>
<p>In a vast expanse of white snow and ice, Arthas, riding a Skeletal Warhorse and transformed into a Death Knight, confronted Illidan, who had transformed into a demon.</p>
<p>‘I swore to destroy it, Arthas, and this task must be completed!’ Illidan, wielding the Warglaives of Azzinoth, declared unapologetically.</p>
<p>What followed was an intense battle.</p>
<p>Frostmourne bloomed with an ominous glow, as the Lich King within the Frozen Throne infused Arthas with ascending power. On the other side, Illidan's demonic wings spread, and blue-green flames ignited around him.</p>
<p>The fight scenes, like those in a blockbuster movie, were thrilling. Finally, Arthas proved superior; Illidan's chest was pierced by Frostmourne.</p>
<p>Arthas ignored the heavily wounded Illidan, who lay on the ground, purple blood flowing from him. Wielding Frostmourne, he advanced towards the towering Frozen Throne.</p>
<p>Innumerable chaotic whispers, their specific contents indiscernible, echoed around the Ice Prison where the Lich King Ner'zhul was confined. Arthas, holding Frostmourne, ascended to the summit step by step.</p>
<p>‘Bring the sword back, so that… I may be utterly freed from this accursed confinement.’</p>
<p>Ner'zhul's wicked whispers echoed in Arthas's ears.</p>
<p>Before the final throne, Arthas gripped Frostmourne tightly with both hands and heavily struck the Ice Prison. Whispers, roars, the screen plunged into brief darkness, then the ice shattered, and a helmet slid down the steps to Arthas's feet.</p>
<p>Looking at the helmet that had landed at his feet, Arthas slowly picked it up and placed it on his head.</p>
<p>‘Now, we are one.’</p>
<p>The camera view instantly shifted. Arthas, clad in armor, one hand gripping Frostmourne which was impaled there, sat upon the throne at the apex of the Ice Tower. There was no background music, just an utter silence. Then the camera slowly zoomed out, revealing Icecrown Glacier and the colossal Ice Tower, and faint background sounds gradually began to echo.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>After Warcraft's release, many players who initially came for the RTS gameplay, after experiencing the single-player story and progressing through the plot, completely lost interest in playing multiplayer mode, immersing themselves wholeheartedly in the story. Because it was simply too magnificent. The plot alone had already excited countless players. Not to mention that Warcraft, throughout, made insane use of various exquisite CGI. Especially with the characters in each event, players felt that each of them had their own beliefs, their own burdens, and their own choices.</p>
<p>Online, characters like Grom Hellscream, Arthas, Illidan, Maiev Shadowsong, Sylvanas Windrunner, and Kael'thas were all vivid in players' memories and had many fans. Of course, there were also some more controversial characters.</p>
<p>For example, Jaina, who helped the orcs wipe out most of her father Daelin's armed forces, resulting in her father's death at Rexxar's hands.</p>
<p>Grand Marshal Garithos, who sent Kael'thas and the Blood Elves on a suicidal mission, and upon learning they received Naga assistance, immediately ordered their complete execution.</p>
<p>Maiev Shadowsong, who completely tied her life's meaning to Illidan, utterly disregarding so-called good and evil.</p>
