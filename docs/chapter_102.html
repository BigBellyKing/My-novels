<p>“Is this game fun?”</p>
<p>As Wang Han was preparing to explore new frontiers, Zhang Yi, who had already defeated Yhorm the Giant, pulled up a stool behind her and asked curiously.</p>
<p>“It’s quite fun! The main gameplay involves collection, building, and survival,” Wang Han replied.</p>
<p>Even though she had only survived to the eighth day, and in a rather haphazard way at that.</p>
<p>Yet, Wang Han was already experiencing some of the joys of Don't Starve.</p>
<p>‘Collection,’ ‘survival,’ and ‘getting stronger’ – truly, no game can escape these three points.</p>
<p>This even includes some story-driven linear games.</p>
<p>In linear games that tell a story, even if the game itself doesn't have collection elements, survival elements, or upgrade elements.</p>
<p>The protagonist of the story, as they gradually get stronger or acquire new things, players actually immerse themselves in the role of the protagonist.</p>
<p>And Don't Starve, using ‘survival’ as its driving force, allows players to experience ‘collection’ and ‘getting stronger,’ thereby feeling the satisfaction and joy gained within the game.</p>
<p>“Hey, what’s that sound?” Zhang Yi asked, a little curious.</p>
<p>Because the nighttime atmosphere was too eerie, Wang Han had already switched the game’s audio output from her headphones to speakers.</p>
<p>At that moment, a rumbling sound came from the speakers, a bit like thunder and a bit like the howl of some wild beast.</p>
<p>And then, Wilson in the game began to mutter to himself.</p>
<p>‘I think I hear something, do you? I always have a bad feeling.’</p>
<p>Wang Han looked at Wilson’s words on the screen and couldn't help but feel nervous.</p>
<p>Because she had already gained a rough understanding of the game's mechanics.</p>
<p>When Wilson spoke, there was always a reason.</p>
<p>“I don’t know either, probably not, right?” Wang Han replied to Zhang Yi, cautiously standing still and waiting for a while. After about a minute, nothing happened, and Wang Han relaxed, though she also felt a bit puzzled.</p>
<p>“How strange. Could it be that my sanity is too low? That’s why Wilson felt a sense of crisis and became a bit muddled?” Wang Han mused, feeling it was odd. At the same time, she prepared to look for flower patches and green mushrooms to boost her character’s sanity.</p>
<p>Just as Wang Han was about to go search for resources and pick some flowers.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a dog bark emerged from the game. Above the map, two ferocious Hounds appeared and pounced towards the Wilson she was controlling.</p>
<p>“What’s happening? What kind of monster is this? There weren’t any monsters here before!” Wang Han froze as she watched the two Hounds pouncing at her. Hadn’t she just passed this spot? When did these monsters appear? Where did these two dogs come from?</p>
<p>However, this question, at least in this playthrough, would not be answered.</p>
<p>Under the Hounds’ bites, Wang Han’s Wilson was not at full health to begin with. Moreover, these Hounds were very fast and had high attack power.</p>
<p>Although she tried to retaliate with the axe in her hand, it felt like merely scratching an itch. After two rounds, her Wilson collapsed directly into a pool of blood.</p>
<p>[Beware of Hounds] (Please heed Wilson’s intuition)</p>
<p>Wang Han was speechless looking at the achievement notification that popped up.</p>
<p>What good was telling her now!</p>
<p>She had already been bitten to death by Hounds!</p>
<p>“That’s it, you died?” Zhang Yi, standing behind her, was stunned.</p>
<p>“I should have made armor and weapons first. I wasted too much time wandering around before!” Wang Han summarized her eight-day experience in the game and reflected on it. Then she turned to glance at Zhang Yi beside her: “Stop talking nonsense, log on!”</p>
<p>Hearing Wang Han’s words, Zhang Yi promptly stood up: “Wait, I’m coming right away!”</p>
<p>Returning to his room, Zhang Yi skillfully opened the Nebula Games Platform and downloaded Don't Starve.</p>
<p>............</p>
<p>Just like Zhang Yi and Wang Han, after Don't Starve went live, many players immediately jumped into the game to experience it.</p>
<p>However, for many players, their first survival journey only allowed them to experience a very small fraction of Don't Starve’s content.</p>
<p>Complex gameplay like building camps and advancing technology was not touched upon at all.</p>
<p>The only thing they truly experienced was various ways to die. No matter how carefully one planned, unexpected events would always occur in the game, ending the player’s survival journey.</p>
<p>And in the relevant community forums, many players who got their hands on the game immediately started posting to share their experiences.</p>
<p>‘This game feels like it has so much content! I’ve played for over two hours and feel like I’ve only scratched the surface!’</p>
<p>‘+1, I’ve been playing all afternoon. Even though I’ve never survived past a double-digit day count, it’s still really fun!’</p>
<p>‘Haha, this is too real! The first time I died was when I tried to steal a bird egg and got pecked to death by a Tallbird.’</p>
<p>‘233333, I encountered a group of red-butt bulls on the prairie and got gored to death by them!’</p>
<p>‘Anyone accidentally burn themselves to death while setting the forest on fire?’</p>
<p>‘I’m disgusted. Am I the only one who didn’t make a fire at night and then got killed by some monster in the darkness?’</p>
<p>‘+1 for dying in the darkness without a fire, that’s how I died too!’</p>
<p>‘Although it’s a small game, it feels super fun, especially when you’re scavenging with friends. Before you know it, several hours have passed.’</p>
<p>‘Exactly, exactly. It’s definitely more interesting when playing with friends.’</p>
<p>‘Haha, playing online with friends, you really need clear division of labor. The first time Hounds came, it was based on the number of players, and N Hounds came at once, biting both me and my friend to death.’</p>
<p>‘Exactly, exactly! Those dogs are too fierce! How do you fight them?!’</p>
<p>‘The first encounter with Hounds isn’t too bad. Just craft some grass armor, kite them a bit, and you can chop them down. Of course, if you want to be safer, you can craft a spear.’</p>
<p>‘Everyone, pay attention: absolutely do not let your sanity drop too low, otherwise you’ll see a bunch of shadowy phantom creatures. They’re incredibly powerful; they’re what killed me.’</p>
<p>‘I think this game’s name doesn’t fit its content at all. It’s called Don't Starve, but I’ve never actually starved to death!’</p>
<p>Countless players were sharing their game experiences, or rather, their death experiences, on the forum communities.</p>
<p>Among them, Hounds, as the rookie killer, undeniably topped the list of death causes.</p>
<p>When players hadn’t yet figured out how to truly play the game, and were still slowly exploring it bit by bit.</p>
<p>Even just two ordinary Hounds could cause immense damage to players.</p>
<p>As countless players recounted their bizarre death experiences in Don't Starve, many also stated that despite the game being named Don't Starve, truly starving to death was quite rare. Most deaths were due to various other accidents.</p>
<p>Therefore, calling this game Don't Starve is completely misleading; its true name should be ‘The 100 Ways Wilson Can Die!’</p>
