                <h1>Chapter 102: Cruel War</h1>
<p>Chapter 102: Cruel War</p>
<p>Facing an injured Freddie, even though Anna was a doctor, a clever housewife cannot cook without rice. Without medical supplies at hand, Anna couldn't magically heal Freddie's wounds.</p>
<p>So Emile and the dog ventured deep into the German army's territory to find medicine for Freddie.</p>
<p>Here, Liuliu could clearly feel that the puzzle-solving difficulty was much higher than before.</p>
<p>It not only required paying attention to the timing of German soldiers' patrols but also coordinating actions with the dog.</p>
<p>After much effort, Liuliu finally maneuvered Emile to find the medicine for Freddie.</p>
<p>By this time, Baron von Dorf had already escaped.</p>
<p>After treating Freddie with the found medicine, Emile and his companions quickly resumed their journey.</p>
<p>This time, their journey would take them to Reims, where the German army had carried out an air raid, leaving the entire city in ruins and its people struggling to survive.</p>
<p>Once a prosperous metropolis, facing the aerial bombardment by Zeppelins, countless houses collapsed.</p>
<p>Many French citizens fled for refuge.</p>
<p>Watching this scene unfold, an enraged Freddie wanted to go forward and see the situation, but another shell landed beside him. He could only hide in a nearby cave, the entrance of which was blocked by a huge obstacle from the explosion, separating Emile, Anna, and Freddie.</p>
<p>On the other side, Freddie looked at the distant Zeppelin. Realizing there was no way to rendezvous with Emile, he chased after it alone.</p>
<p>Anna began to aid the wounded. Emile couldn't push the obstacle away by himself; it required five people. So, he had to rescue the trapped refugees with the dog first, then seek their help to push the obstacle aside and catch up to Freddie.</p>
<p>In Shark TV, watching this plot, Liuliu smacked her lips, deep in thought: "Why do I always feel like this plot is hinting at something?"</p>
<p>"Freddie got bombed twice in a row; he's such an old unlucky guy, and combined with his skin color..."</p>
<p>Liuliu stopped there. Because the bullet comments in the live stream would continue for her.</p>
<p>Glancing at the now lively bullet comments in the live stream, Liuliu refocused on the game.</p>
<p>While rescuing the suffering citizens in the city of Reims, Liuliu noticed a particular detail. That is, in the game, whether it was Emile, the protagonist, or other NPCs, all characters had no eyes.</p>
<p>But a little girl trapped in a room, she had a pair of bright eyes. Such a contrast was clearly full of irony. Well... of course, the dog accompanying Emile was an exception.</p>
<p>After successfully rescuing the refugees, Emile and the dog immediately followed Freddie's footsteps. They encountered Baron von Dorf at the Cathedral.</p>
<p>Here were two consecutive BOSS battles. The first involved Emile and the dog attacking through the organ's air pipe, which was incredibly creative. The second involved controlling Freddie to pick up grenades thrown by Baron von Dorf, but not yet exploded, to attack the Zeppelin's propellers.</p>
<p>After destroying two of the Zeppelin's propellers, Baron von Dorf escaped again. It was then revealed that the pilot on the airship was Karl.</p>
<p>On the other side, Anna, ignoring Emile and Freddie, drove a car by herself with the dog, rushing towards the direction where the Zeppelin crashed.</p>
<p>It was at this moment that players understood the story behind the last character, 'Anna'. Nine months prior, Anna was undergoing veterinary training. When she received a letter from her father, the German army was already within 20 miles of Paris.</p>
<p>Her father told her he was well and advised her not to return to their home in Belgium until the war ended. But patiently waiting was clearly not Anna's personality, so she decided to go find her father. However, all taxis in Paris had been requisitioned to transport soldiers to the Marne River front.</p>
<p>So Anna found a seemingly damaged car on the street, fixed it, and headed to the front as a driver. Just like before when she saved Emile and Freddie, this segment also featured a driving mini-game. Especially with the background music titled 'Can-Can music', it was even more cheerful than before.</p>
<p>The ringing of bells from passing vehicles, and the shaking of barrels on carts, were all perfectly timed to the beat. What was even more brilliant was that in the middle-to-late part of the journey, two cars suddenly appeared in the middle of the road, trapping Anna's taxi between them, fully demonstrating what it meant to be "surrounded by men."</p>
<p>At this point, the rhythm shifted from the lively 'Can-Can music' to Offenbach's 'Barcarolle', as if transporting players to the Venetian canals at night. But before players could fully immerse themselves, the rhythm instantly and seamlessly switched back to the cheerful 'Can-Can music'.</p>
<p>Watching this scene, Liuliu in front of the computer and the audience in the live stream all found it amusing. After all, the scene was simply too cheerful and full of joy. Anna in the game was also very happy.</p>
<p>[September 7, 1914. The taxi sped through the night. Anna was proud and happy to be able to help soldiers reach the front lines.]</p>
<p>But the next second, the entire style of the game changed instantly.</p>
<p>[Until Anna arrived at the front and witnessed the cruel truth with her own eyes.]</p>
<p>Anna in the game, Liuliu who was playing the game in reality, and the viewers in the live stream all fell silent in unison. The battlefield was deadly silent, strewn with corpses.</p>
<p>The bodies of fallen soldiers and warhorses piled up like mountains. Despite the hand-drawn 2D art style, a profound sense of heaviness could be felt through the screen. Especially when contrasted with the earlier cheerful scenes, this sense of contrast was even more pronounced.</p>
<p>Driven by compassion, Anna remained at the front to care for the wounded. Each life saved was a small victory in this war. She sawed off necrotic arms from the wounded, and under the bridge, bodies were so numerous they were simply dumped there like trash.</p>
<p>Just then, a cry for help came from the ruins. It was an enemy soldier still alive. Without distinguishing friend from foe, Anna helped extract the bullet, saving his life. While aiding the wounded, Anna overheard nearby French officers discussing Belgium, specifically that the German army was planning to test a new type of poison gas weapon near Ypres, which was Anna's hometown.</p>
<p>Worried about her father's safety, Anna decided to return to Ypres. At home, the rescued governess told Anna that her father had been captured by Baron von Dorf, who wanted to use advanced weapons in the war. For this, Anna embarked on a journey to find Baron von Dorf.</p>
<p>This led to the earlier scene where Anna, in the nick of time, rescued Emile and Freddie. Emile, Freddie, and Anna, three people from different countries, ethnicities, and with varied identities, now shared a common goal.</p>
<p>At this point, the game's timeline reverted. Anna, chasing the airship, found no sign of her father when she reached the destination. Instead, she found Karl, severely wounded and trapped. After helping Karl escape, she learned from him that her father had already fled with Baron von Dorf via an emergency plane from the airship before it crashed.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the severely wounded Karl was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp, while Emile was brought before a military tribunal as a deserter. However, thanks to Emile's actions in Reims, he was released. But the place of his release was... the front lines, a name known to all: Verdun.</p>
<p>Arriving at the front, Emile fought fiercely with other soldiers for three months, and the season changed from autumn to bitter winter. On the battlefield, Emile, like all the other soldiers, was ravaged by war and endured the harsh winter.</p>
<p>For all the soldiers on the battlefield, the greatest solace came from letters from home. Emile also received a letter from his daughter at home. However, there was no good news; food shortages, rampant disease, and soaring death tolls. Amidst all these desperate tidings, there was only a ray of hope: a photo of his grandson, Victor, learning to walk.</p>
<p>During this period, the German army launched another offensive, but fortunately, Emile survived the war once again. He and Freddie were even awarded medals for their outstanding contributions. Meanwhile, good news came from Anna: the severely wounded Karl was almost fully recovered.</p>
<p>Yet, correspondingly, the war grew increasingly tragic, with death tolls steadily climbing. Monthly casualties of 70,000 earned Verdun the moniker of a meat grinder. Faced with the escalating intensity of the war, Emile and Freddie were assigned the mission to retake Fort Douaumont, where they once again encountered their old adversary, Baron von Dorf.</p>
<p>Freddie and the dog held off Baron von Dorf, while Emile proceeded to detonate the explosives within Fort Douaumont. Although the fortress was eventually blown up, the German army still held their position. The mission failed. Emile looked at the distant fortress, utterly dejected.</p>
<p>[Marie, my darling. The war took the life of a dear friend, who was like a brother to me. His passing dealt me an unimaginable blow.]</p>
<p>[Let's talk about something happy. Karl has recovered, and his physical condition is increasingly stable. I'll go see him on my next leave. How are you? Are you well?]</p>
<p>But what Emile didn't know was that, at the same time, Karl also received a letter from Marie. The letter stated that Victor, his son, was seriously ill. This made Karl want to see his wife and son, but he understood that this war would not end, so he made a decision — to escape from the prisoner-of-war camp.</p>
<p>Watching the game's plot unfold, Liuliu, sitting in front of the computer, felt an immense heaviness. She had fully experienced the cruelty of war.</p>
<p>"No way? Did Freddie die? Did the dog die too? And Karl is escaping the POW camp, will something happen to him too?"</p>
<p>Although the character in the game had switched to Karl, Liuliu didn't immediately start playing. Instead, she was still immersed in the information she had just received.</p>
