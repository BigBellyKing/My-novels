<p>Chapter 456: This plot development is not what I expected! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>“This map is quite large!”</p>
<p>Song Ren in the game couldn't help but exclaim. He swam along the Arno River for half an hour before finding a place to land.</p>
<p>And this Florence map really seemed huge. However, most areas remained unexplored. Only after he and his brother had climbed a tower and performed a bird's-eye view scan was a portion of the local map information unlocked.</p>
<p>Apparently, this aspect was similar to Zelda. Players needed to climb to a viewpoint and then synchronize to unlock the current map information.</p>
<p>Another thing that amazed Song Ren was the numerous details in the game. Earlier, when going to Cristina's place and during his escape from being chased, Song Ren hadn't paid close attention. Now, having climbed out of the river and following the mission's guidance home, Song Ren could truly observe this world.</p>
<p>It was incredibly realistic. However, this realism stemmed from the meticulous shaping of details. Like in the previous Uncharted, what left the deepest impression on him was that small town in Madagascar. The ultra-high graphical fidelity combined with a modern city made it feel incredibly real.</p>
<p>But that was, after all, a modern setting. Yet, the current Assassin's Creed gave Song Ren a genuine sense of history. The Renaissance-era architecture, clothing, and even the expressions of passersby on the streets all presented Song Ren with a feeling of authenticity.</p>
<p>Everything around seemed genuinely real: Florence Cathedral, Giotto's Bell Tower, Baptistery of St. John, Basilica of Santa Croce, Basilica of San Lorenzo, Ponte Vecchio, Pitti Palace, and so on… Throughout the streets and alleys of Florence, countless residents dressed in various ways, along with merchants, all had their own dwellings.</p>
<p>During the day, all NPCs engaged in their respective activities, much like in Red Dead Redemption, where each NPC had a complete daily routine. Some headed towards the cathedral square, others towards the city gate, and still others made their way to an entertainment venue called 'Seeking Fragrant Roses', evidently seeking a little physical relaxation.</p>
<p>In reality, one couldn't know what Renaissance Florence truly looked like. But in Assassin's Creed, players could personally enter this constructed world and experience the unique charm of that era.</p>
<p>After marveling at his surroundings for a while, Song Ren guided Ezio towards the mission objective.</p>
<p>“Ezio! Do you think I'm deaf and blind? I know about your conflict with Vieri yesterday, and the episode with Cristina!”</p>
<p>“Do you know? Your behavior is unacceptable! This… this…”</p>
<p>Giovanni looked at Ezio, appearing utterly indignant, and swung his right fist twice in the air. The normally unruly Ezio lowered his head in front of his father.</p>
<p>Watching Ezio get lectured, even though he was playing the protagonist, Song Ren felt a little satisfied. After all, he was the one controlling Ezio during the running and fighting; why wasn't he allowed to control him when he was out enjoying himself?</p>
<p>However, Giovanni's next words made Song Ren understand why Ezio was acting like a hooligan.</p>
<p>Giovanni's previously angry demeanor suddenly shifted as he clapped Ezio on the shoulder: “This reminds me of when I was your age!”</p>
<p>Ah! The source was found! Like father, like son, this was a family tradition!</p>
<p>But wait, wasn't his brother quite proper? Song Ren mused.</p>
<p>What followed was a series of family tasks, mostly trivial matters, but they made Song Ren feel rather heartwarming. For instance, helping his younger brother collect feathers. This was also a collectible element in the game, but what made Song Ren speechless was that when Ezio asked his brother what the feathers were for, the brother kept him in suspense, saying he wouldn't tell Ezio until all the feathers were collected.</p>
<p>There was also helping his sister teach her cheating boyfriend a lesson. Along the way, he climbed along rooftops, successfully finding a viewpoint and unlocking the surrounding map information.</p>
<p>Song Ren also noticed that when performing a Leap of Faith from a viewpoint, Ezio would always land in a haystack or a flower cart. So, generally, if there's a flower cart or haystack, it means there's a Leap of Faith spot nearby? Song Ren pondered, but he didn't have time to test his theory, as he still had a mission to complete.</p>
<p>Arriving at the square, a cutscene triggered. Ezio's sister's boyfriend was clearly a scumbag. When Ezio found him, he saw him getting intimate with a large, tank-like woman.</p>
<p>“This guy's审美 (aesthetic judgment) definitely has some issues.”</p>
<p>Song Ren thought about the model of Ezio's sister, then looked at the scumbag's mistress, and felt speechless. You can actually bring yourself to drive this tank? Unbelievable!</p>
<p>After entering the combat segment, Song Ren chose not to use counter-attacks for executions. He wanted to properly teach this guy who bullied his sister a lesson, so he opted to grapple him and then use knee strikes to vital areas.</p>
<p>But what Song Ren found most interesting was the final mission concerning his mother. It involved going to Leonardo da Vinci to retrieve a painting.</p>
<p>Yes, the same Leonardo da Vinci who completed the 'Mona Lisa'. Of course, at this time, da Vinci was still an unknown artist, having just finished his apprenticeship with Verrocchio.</p>
<p>This greatly surprised Song Ren. Initially, he thought it was just a fictional Renaissance world. But now, it seemed not to be? Da Vinci was, after all, a real historical figure.</p>
<p>And from the related introduction that popped up, the game didn't seem to have heavily modded Leonardo da Vinci's life story or anything. It still provided a very complete introduction, even including people's accusations of his preference for men.</p>
<p>He returned home with da Vinci's painting, listening to Ezio's mother chat with da Vinci on the way. At this point, da Vinci was already showing a tendency to study anatomy. Some things Song Ren understood, others he didn't fully grasp. But from this simple small plot and interlude, he could tell that Assassin's Creed was clearly not set against a completely fictional historical backdrop.</p>
<p>Next, he helped his father retrieve some letters, but what puzzled Song Ren was that everyone was being mysterious, like a Riddler-like character.</p>
<p>And when Ezio returned home, a huge change had occurred. His father, elder brother, and younger brother had all been arrested, with only his sister and mother spared thanks to the help of a family servant.</p>
<p>“Holy cow, what's going on? The entire family incarcerated?!” Song Ren couldn't help but be shocked by this turn of events.</p>
<p>He didn't know why, but he suddenly had a bad feeling. The plot was unfolding differently from what he had expected! It wasn't a heartwarming story, like Uncharted?</p>
