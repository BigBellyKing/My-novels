<p>Chapter 242: The Difficulty is Just Right, Absolutely Perfect! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Time passed day by day, and during this period, quite a few games launched their promotions.</p>
<p>The Channel Alliance, too, began promoting certain games.</p>
<p>However, this had little impact on Nebula Games.</p>
<p>After all, Chen Xu had just announced a lot of news about <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>.</p>
<p>Moreover, at this stage, both the so-called Channel Alliance and Nebula Games understood it was a protracted struggle.</p>
<p>A winner wouldn't be decided anytime soon; it would depend on a continuous stream of games, constantly increasing player attention, spending, and stickiness to their platforms.</p>
<p>While various players online were discussing the currently popular games.</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games' office.</p>
<p>Chen Xu was confirming some of the subsequent content for <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> with Qin Yi and his team.</p>
<p>Game development was exceptionally smooth. With the experience gained from developing <em>Dark Souls</em>, many areas weren't as difficult.</p>
<p>Furthermore, compared to before, with Nebula Games Platform's transformation, the team's size had also increased.</p>
<p>At the same time, the employees who could directly join Chen Xu's team at Nebula Games were essentially industry elites.</p>
<p>Under Chen Xu's leadership, the speed of game development was naturally unlike before.</p>
<p>Now, the entire game's framework was largely set up, and a large amount of art assets had also been approved.</p>
<p>What remained primarily were the feedback on different weapon and BOSS action performances, as well as numerical design and fine details.</p>
<p>“The appearance of third-party monsters shouldn't be too frequent. This is one of the game's selling points, but not the core element.”</p>
<p>Sitting at his workstation, Chen Xu was looking at the screen.</p>
<p>While battling a Diablos, he was suddenly interrupted by a rogue Barroth.</p>
<p>Although the Barroth was directly crushed – if the Diablos hadn't been a vegetarian, there probably wouldn't have been a bone left of it.</p>
<p>But in ten tests, the Barroth appeared five times, almost a fifty percent chance.</p>
<p>Such a high probability was simply too much.</p>
<p>The entire game world belonged to a continuous open world, with areas partitioned by narrow tunnels, rushing rivers, and steep cliffs. Simultaneously, the game's entire ecological chain environment would be dynamic.</p>
<p>However, too high a probability was not a good thing.</p>
<p>“An occasional appearance can bring a pleasant surprise to players, but constant appearances won't be a surprise; they'll be annoying. Lower the probability further. You can refer to the Easter egg setting of the Merm and Pigman battle in <em>Don't Starve</em>.” Chen Xu told the employees next to him about some shortcomings in the game.</p>
<p>“Hmm... The Bazelgeuse is an exception, though, as its ecological habit is to constantly traverse and hover across the New World, seeking prey.” Chen Xu added.</p>
<p>“Then, Mr. Chen, do we need to adjust the difficulty later?” Qin Yi asked tentatively.</p>
<p>Having already set up the monster actions in the game, they were very aware of the game's difficulty.</p>
<p>This game might look simple, but it was actually very hardcore.</p>
<p>Especially when players first encountered monsters like Diablos.</p>
<p>Frequent Dragon Charges, tough scales, extremely high attack power, and various roars that could stun you.</p>
<p>It was incredibly troublesome.</p>
<p>Not to mention the weapons in the game, each looking incredibly cool.</p>
<p>But in reality, to play well, one truly needed practice.</p>
<p>If a player had just started and didn't know anything, the most likely outcome would be Great Sword's three-charge swinging at air, Charge Blade's Super Amped Element Discharge chopping the ground, Long Sword's Foresight Slash never parrying, and a hammer meant for the head ended up 'repairing feet'.</p>
<p>No, for newly inducted players, there's a high probability they wouldn't even know Super Amped Element Discharge and would just chop haphazardly.</p>
<p>So, ultimately, the hunters' daily routine would evolve into three consecutive cart returns to camp.</p>
<p>“Adjust what? The game's difficulty is perfectly suitable, just right! Look how easy the Great Jagras is to deal with, and the Kulu-Ya-Ku can be defeated casually. Compared to <em>Dark Souls</em>, it's much more user-friendly. Gradually progressing from easy to difficult, isn't that normal?” Chen Xu said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, Qin Yi was momentarily speechless.</p>
<p>Chen Xu couldn't help but smile.</p>
<p>In reality, the difficulty of <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> had already been significantly reduced.</p>
<p>One must know that the original <em>Monster Hunter</em> series was truly very difficult.</p>
<p>And the difficulty of <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> could be said to be just right.</p>
<p>Because if players followed the main story and occasionally farmed for equipment, they would only acquire the ability to be instantly killed around Nergigante.</p>
<p>During this process, with healing smoke, mantles, traps, and Palicos as assistance, the difficulty had indeed dropped significantly.</p>
<p>There were even many ways to cheese the game.</p>
<p>Of course, this required players to have an introduction and an understanding of some of the system designs in <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>.</p>
<p>If they didn't understand...</p>
<p>Great Sword's charge was a man's romance; Charge Blade's Super Amped Element Discharge was pure damage as long as it was unleashed; Long Sword was cool enough, and the Palico was cute enough, and that was that.</p>
<p>“If all else fails, isn't there a team-up system? Players can just team up to hunt monsters.” Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Looking at the smiling Chen Xu, Qin Yi and the others sitting nearby were completely speechless.</p>
<p>Seriously, they believed him!</p>
<p>Team up to hunt monsters!?</p>
<p>可以说作为一款共斗游戏, <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> 绝对能展现出不一样的魅力.</p>
<p>In most games, teaming up usually reduces the difficulty significantly.</p>
<p>But <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> was different; for new players, multiplayer hunting actually increased the difficulty!</p>
<p>Even though there was no friendly fire damage, attacking teammates in the game would cause them to flinch.</p>
<p>Facing a Dragon Charge, your Dual Blades-wielding teammate next to you unleashes a Demon Dance.</p>
<p>Trapped in a flinch, you watch in despair as the Dragon Charge turns into a Cart.</p>
<p>The Long Sword's Spirit Blade combo and Rising Slash sever the tail; in your mind, you already envision the elder dragon struggling and crying out in pain, but the next moment, a three-charged hammer unexpectedly smashes into your face.</p>
<p>In cooperative hunting, the most dangerous entity isn't the BOSS, but your teammates beside you.</p>
<p>Dual Blades "repairing feet" and "rubbing backs" all showing white numbers, spinning and jumping straight into a Cart.</p>
<p>Protect the elder dragon in front of you, strike down your teammates beside you.</p>
<p>This was the daily routine of hunters teaming up!</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Days passed one by one.</p>
<p>Many games gradually began their warm-up promotions.</p>
<p>Within the industry, many designers were also discussing the recent wave of game fervor.</p>
<p>“Has everyone been following the recent games? Their popularity seems pretty good.”</p>
<p>“Of course it's good. NetDragon, TengHua, and the Channel Alliance over there haven't said it, but it's clearly a joint cooperation.”</p>
<p>“Are they targeting Chen Xu? Preparing to ambush <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>?”</p>
<p>“Not necessarily. It's probably a test. Mainly, these games are of decent quality, but they lack distinct features.”</p>
<p>“But <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> is a hunting game, which is a relatively niche genre!”</p>
<p>“So it's a test. If <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>'s performance isn't good, the Channel Alliance will definitely jump out. But if <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> performs well, they'll just play dead.”</p>
<p>“But speaking of which, Chen Xu hasn't had much reaction recently, has he? There's no news about <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> either. Feels a bit low-key.”</p>
<p>“Development has been going on for a while, so it's probably in the final stages. But honestly, I really hope Chen Xu succeeds. After all, the Nebula Games Platform truly changed the landscape where domestic channels dominated.”</p>
<p>Many industry designers were chatting.</p>
<p>As for the players, they were a bit restless.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Before, there were constant leaks about <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> every few days.</p>
<p>But what about now?</p>
<p>Other games had all started their various promotions.</p>
<p>Why was Nebula Games still silent?</p>
<p>Surely they didn't just make a folder, right?</p>
<p>And while players were daily @-mentioning Chen Xu's official Weibo account, and frequenting major forums and communities to discuss the progress of <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, Chen Xu and Nebula Games' official Weibo released the latest news about <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>.</p>
<p>And they also just announced something that got many players quite excited.</p>
