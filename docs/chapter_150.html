                <p>Chapter 249: This is a Musou game! (Requesting subscriptions, monthly passes)</p>
<p>Looking at the ground covered in Jagras corpses, Zhang Yi meticulously collected materials one by one.</p>
<p>Even though it was just a trial version, and progress wouldn't carry over (only the character customization would), Zhang Yi still made sure to collect every single material on the ground.</p>
<p>This was simply a gaming habit he had developed over many years.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether an item was useful, or if it would be irrelevant even after completing the game or its entire lifespan, as long as it could be collected easily, it had to be stored in his inventory.</p>
<p>Unless his inventory and storage box were full, he would never even consider discarding any material.</p>
<p>Frugality and resourcefulness were essential virtues for every player.</p>
<p>"My health bar is incredibly sturdy! There's no difficulty at all!"</p>
<p>Looking at more than half of his health bar remaining, Zhang Yi was filled with emotion.</p>
<p>Ever since he started playing the Dark Souls series, his concept and impression of health bars had become somewhat blurry. But now, in Monster Hunter: World, he finally rediscovered that familiar health bar.</p>
<p>"It's just a bit unusual that the monsters don't have health bars."</p>
<p>Zhang Yi noticed this in the game. It seemed that to enhance the player's sense of immersion in hunting, Monster Hunter: World, despite having damage number indicators, did not feature a monster health bar. Instead, it used an electrocardiogram-like indicator.</p>
<p>After completing the mission and returning to Astera, Zhang Yi didn't rush into new quests. Instead, he opened the voice channel to chat with his friends.</p>
<p>"Old Song, have you guys finished your mission? These monsters feel like they're not enough to fight!" Zhang Yi said with emotion in the voice channel.</p>
<p>The next moment, Song Ren and his friends' voices came through.</p>
<p>"Of course we finished! Long Sword is an overpowered weapon! One Spirit Roundslash takes down a bunch! But it's true, it's not enough to fight, it's just not satisfying!" Song Ren also spoke with a hint of lament.</p>
<p>"Exactly, exactly! My hammer is super strong! Charge up, then a big Windmill Attack, and these dragons just die as they spin!" Wang Han was also very satisfied with her chosen weapon.</p>
<p>"Dual Blades are amazing, super fast attack speed! And the Demon Dance in Demon Mode is just like cutting through butter!" Joey added.</p>
<p>"The Bow is also very strong! One charged Dragon Piercer for one dragon! The damage is too high! This hunting game has become a shooting game for me!" Wang Yifan chimed in in the voice channel.</p>
<p>"This Monster Hunter: World really feels like a Musou hack-and-slash game! I wonder if there will be difficulty options later. While it's really satisfying to mow down enemies now, I have to admit I miss the slightly challenging and difficult gameplay of Dark Souls," Zhang Yi mused in the voice channel.</p>
<p>Although he used to get dizzy from being beaten so much while playing Dark Souls, he had to admit that the exhilarating feeling of overcoming a powerful enemy was something he had never experienced in any other game until now.</p>
<p>And while Monster Hunter: World was certainly fun to play, it still felt like something was missing. A little bit of challenge, and these dragons were so fragile, it wasn't quite satisfying enough!</p>
<p>It wasn't just Zhang Yi and his friends; many players online felt the same way.</p>
<p>After entering the game, experiencing the charm of the New World, and embarking on their first battle, players, regardless of the weapon they chose, had only one feeling: absolute exhilaration! The gameplay experience was pure hack-and-slash!</p>
<p>Fighting monsters felt completely stress-free, almost as if it ended before they could even fully enjoy it.</p>
<p>Of course, some players chose weapons like the Hunting Horn or Insect Glaive, and while their damage might have been a bit less impressive, they still had an easy time.</p>
<p>Additionally, thanks to the Palico mechanic in the game, players discovered after entering the game that these adorable little cats weren't just hunters' pets, but true companions who fought alongside them.</p>
<p>During combat, the Palico always drew the monster's aggro, allowing the player to simply follow behind the monster and unleash a barrage of damage.</p>
<p>Beyond combat, players could also wander around the jungle, fish by the river, gather materials, scout for monsters, and more. The overall game experience was very comfortable.</p>
<p>This led many players to feel that just by exploring a bit, an hour and a half had passed since they started their first mission.</p>
<p>On major community forums, players who hadn't even finished the trial content and had just completed the first mission were eagerly posting to share their experiences.</p>
<p>"This Monster Hunter: World is so much fun!"</p>
<p>"Yeah! The health bar is so sturdy, monsters barely scratch me!"</p>
<p>"And the damage is super high too! Three hits for a Jagras, is this a hack-and-slash hunting game?"</p>
<p>"I think so! And according to some of the content released by the game, it's mainly about challenging various dragons, farming materials, and crafting gear. And grinding games are usually hack-and-slash, right?"</p>
<p>"Haha, excellent! I was originally planning to wait and see, but now it feels like a must-buy!"</p>
<p>"This game feels perfect for a relaxing retirement! It seems quite casual."</p>
<p>"Right, right! I saw gathering and catching bugs in the game, I wonder if you can fish? Hunting with friends, admiring the scenery, fishing, and gathering herbs sounds incredibly relaxing!"</p>
<p>"+1, it feels like a very casual and relaxing game. And the weapons in the game correspond to classes, so if you get tired of one weapon, you can switch to another and craft entirely new gear."</p>
<p>"By the way, what do you all think is the strongest weapon?"</p>
<p>"Definitely the Long Sword! Foresight Slash and Helm Breaker are super cool!"</p>
<p>"Great Sword is also fierce! Three-charge slashes obliterate everything!"</p>
<p>"Tch, the Hammer disagrees! The Tornado Destroys Parking Lot!"</p>
<p>"Enough talk, Charge Blade is invincible! Sparkles and flashes all the way!"</p>
<p>"Insect Glaive begs to differ! 360-degree aerial spiral attacks, one staff and one Kinsect, with red, white, and yellow Kinsect buffs shining bright, unparalleled in the world!"</p>
<p>"Hunting Horn just smiles without speaking. Attacks come with their own BGM, who else can do that? Every move has a melody, every blow has power! A tune that breaks the heart, where to find a soulmate at the ends of the earth!"</p>
<p>Players excitedly shared their experiences on forums and in group chats. This game was clearly much more friendly than most had imagined.</p>
<p>Although, in actual play, it was certainly not as impressive as their boasting suggested. More often than not, it involved Longsword Helm Breakers hitting nothing but dirt, and Greatsword three-charges slicing through thin air.</p>
<p>Charge Blade Super Amped Element Discharges spammed haphazardly, and Dual Blades Demon Dances awkwardly flailing in place.</p>
<p>However, many players completely overlooked these minor blunders, as the dragons in this game were truly weak. Missing an attack? No big deal! Just land a couple more hits, and the damage would all come back!</p>
<p>For a time, the Monster Hunter: World community forums were filled with an atmosphere of "It's so good!"</p>
<p>Of course, a small handful of players expressed that this was only the early game, and they didn't know how it would be later on. But these were a minority and were quickly drowned out by the joyous chatter of the general population of hunters.</p>
<p>Many players who had been on the fence, watching more and more videos and player discussions, couldn't help but download the trial version. After experiencing the exhilarating thrill of the hunt, they all unhesitatingly pre-ordered the game.</p>
