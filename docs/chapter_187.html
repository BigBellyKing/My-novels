                <p>Chapter 287: The Milky Scent is Too Strong! (6th update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)</p>
<p>Over the past two days, at Nebula Games, Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, and a few others had been continuously developing the RPG maps Chen Xu provided.</p>
<p>Currently, the development was essentially nearing its end.</p>
<p>There was still some content that needed to be perfected.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you guys leaving work yet?” Chen Xu looked at the people in the company with a bit of surprise.</p>
<p>It was past closing time, and there was no urgent work requiring overtime today.</p>
<p>“Uh, Mr. Chen, aren’t you streaming on Shark TV tonight? We want to watch, we want to watch.” Qin Yi said with an embarrassed smile.</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue, Yang Xin, Lin Tao, Lin Rou, and even Zhang Yida from the Operations Department all nodded like bobbleheads.</p>
<p>Listening to them, Chen Xu felt a little speechless: “Don’t you all have phones? Couldn’t you just go to the live streaming platforms to watch?”</p>
<p>The few of them just chuckled twice, offering no further explanation.</p>
<p>How could watching it live, right here, be the same as watching a stream?</p>
<p>Shaking his head, Chen Xu ignored them, stretched, and walked over to the project room. He had streamed <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> in this very room before.</p>
<p>This time, he had already communicated with Shark TV in advance, and there was even a dedicated official host and commentator.</p>
<p>At the same time, Chen Xu also turned on his computer's webcam, ensuring that the keyboard and mouse were visible to others, to prevent competitors from slandering and maliciously smearing him later.</p>
<p>As he entered the live stream room, dense bullet comments scrolled across the screen.</p>
<p>Even though it was still a black screen, it was clear that many people were already waiting for the show.</p>
<p>Then, Chen Xu opened his streaming software.</p>
<p>Without setting any delays, the moment the stream successfully connected, the live room immediately displayed Chen Xu's screen.</p>
<p>Instantly, the audience in the live room erupted.</p>
<p>“It’s really Chen Xu!?”</p>
<p>“He’s actually going to play against professional players? I wonder if Chen Xu can win a match tonight?”</p>
<p>“Looks very uncertain!”</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, why don’t we just nerf the Orcs and pretend this never happened?”</p>
<p>The bullet comments in the live stream scrolled past.</p>
<p>Over the past two days, players, especially <em>Warcraft</em> players, had been constantly discussing this very event.</p>
<p>Everyone had different opinions, particularly regarding Chen Xu’s personal skill.</p>
<p>“Alright, everyone, stop spamming. Tonight’s theme is very simple: you all think <em>Warcraft</em> has balance issues, but as the game designer, I think there are no problems.”</p>
<p>“So, the solution is also very simple. Since <em>Warcraft</em> is an RTS game with considerable competitive depth, I’ll play against some high-level players, and then you’ll see if there are any balance issues.”</p>
<p>“Of course, it won’t be like you imagine, where I play all four races and get beaten senseless from start to finish, and then claim there’s no balance problem. Today, I’ll mainly showcase the unique characteristics of each race and some tactical gameplay. Currently, everyone generally feels that Orcs are strong, mainly because their various tactics have been thoroughly developed by players.” Chen Xu said with a playful tone, simultaneously entering a host lobby.</p>
<p>While chatting casually with the players, Chen Xu silently opened the system and used the Keyboard Spewing Milk Card he had previously drawn. He wondered if it was just his imagination.</p>
<p>After using it, Chen Xu inexplicably felt a milky scent waft from somewhere.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the official commentary channel for tonight’s <em>Warcraft Balance Exhibition Match</em>, Shark TV had two professional commentators introducing the evening’s general situation.</p>
<p>“As you all know, tonight’s program features Mr. Chen, the designer of <em>Warcraft</em>, who wishes to play against professional players. This is primarily to address the current balance concerns regarding the game.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen’s idea is good, and I think what he says makes a lot of sense. After all, <em>Warcraft</em> is a newly released game, and I myself played it a bit when it first came out. The development of various races is still unclear to everyone, so claiming there’s bad balance now, I think, is quite premature. You see, even the professional Human, Night Elf, and Undead players haven’t complained about bad balance.”</p>
<p>“However, with this program, I think Mr. Chen is in for it tonight.” Huang Donglai, a well-known RTS player himself, offered his judgment.</p>
<p>“Brother Huang, I think you’re speaking a bit too soon. You don’t know Mr. Chen’s skill level yet, what if he’s really strong?” Sun Yixie interjected, disagreeing.</p>
<p>“Oh, impossible! Look at the opponents Mr. Chen is facing tonight, I even wonder if they’re intentionally trying to cause trouble. What kind of opponents have they picked? All of them are among the strongest. There’s Guadi, who hasn’t lost a single match from the qualifiers to the group stages. His three-line micro left me stunned. Do you know what <em>Warcraft</em> players call him now? He’s not human, he’s a god! He’s GOD!”</p>
<p>“And there’s Satellite, also known as Lu Bu, Lu Fengxian! Additionally, Grandmaster also showed incredibly strong dominance in the group stages. They’re all strong as oxen, alright?”</p>
<p>“Anyway, let’s first see who Mr. Chen’s opponent is for the first match!”</p>
<p>“Oh no! This is terrible! The first one up is Sookbn! Although he has accumulated more than twenty runner-up titles in his career, and he seems not to have fully adapted since transitioning to <em>Warcraft</em>, his strength is absolutely not to be underestimated. His main race is Orcs, and not a single one of his rush attack victories in the group stages exceeded 15 minutes.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen is in for it now! Ah, I can’t even bear to watch!” Huang Donglai sighed on the commentary desk.</p>
<p>Bullet comments in the live stream also filled with crying emojis.</p>
<p>In the match room, Chen Xu and the first professional player he would face tonight successively entered the host lobby.</p>
<p>At this moment, in a training room of a club in Modu, the player named Sookbn was also a little nervous.</p>
<p>After all, his opponent tonight was no ordinary person; it was the game’s designer.</p>
<p>In RTS games, the gap between high-level players and ordinary players is significant.</p>
<p>He had accumulated over twenty runner-up titles. Was it just bad luck?</p>
<p>No, it was simply that his skill wasn’t as good as others.</p>
<p>If it were an ordinary player, he wouldn't mind dominating them.</p>
<p>But the crucial point was that his opponent was Chen Xu. If he crushed him too badly, what if the Orcs got nerfed into the ground?</p>
<p>Because he actually felt that Orcs were strong mainly because many players were delving into their intricacies.</p>
<p>At least when he played against some Night Elf and Human players, the chances of winning were generally a 60-40 split.</p>
<p>And that was also considering map factors.</p>
<p>However, going easy on him was also something he didn’t quite dare to do.</p>
<p>After all, if he were to go easy, and then rumors spread online about him being bribed by Nebula Games to throw the match, that would be even worse.</p>
<p>With immense apprehension, Sookbn entered the game. There was a five-second freeze time before the game started, allowing players to think and perform simple courtesies.</p>
<p>After typing GLHF on the screen to each other as a courtesy, Sookbn made up his mind.</p>
<p>He decided not to overthink it and just play his normal, true game.</p>
<p>Over in Nebula Games’ project room, Chen Xu was quite relaxed, and his thoughts had become incredibly clear. Clearly, the commentators on the main stage weren’t optimistic about him!</p>
<p>Everything was progressing smoothly, but this item was a bit problematic; the milky scent was indeed a bit too strong.</p>
