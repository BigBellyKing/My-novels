                <p>Chapter 276: First Experience (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Sitting in front of his computer, Zhang Yi was also eagerly awaiting the unlock of the <code>Warcraft</code> trial version experience.</p>
<p>"Ah, why did Nebula Games make an RTS game this time?" Wang Han, sitting next to Zhang Yi, was scrolling through information on her phone, chatting with Joey.</p>
<p>When it came to RTS games, neither Wang Han nor Joey particularly liked them.</p>
<p>They had played them, but couldn't get the hang of them.</p>
<p>Because they felt the controls were too complicated.</p>
<p>At most, they'd play against AI opponents.</p>
<p>"I feel like <code>Warcraft</code> might be different," Zhang Yi said.</p>
<p>He himself occasionally played RTS games, but wasn't very skilled; he was just at an average person's level.</p>
<p>He was the type to silently build up an army, then drag a box with his mouse and A-click them towards the enemy base.</p>
<p>A single decisive push: if his units all died, then the opponent won.</p>
<p>If his units didn't all die, then 'sorry, your base is gone'.</p>
<p>"Exactly, it's hard to say about <code>Warcraft</code>'s multiplayer, but I feel the single-player mode should be quite good," Song Ren and Wang Yifan said in the voice channel.</p>
<p>"What kind of story can an RTS have? The single-player story in <code>Human Wars</code> almost put me to sleep," Wang Han said.</p>
<p>She had played some RTS games before, thinking if she couldn't win multiplayer and found simple AI opponents boring, she might as well try the single-player story.</p>
<p>The result was truly disappointing, to sum it up in one sentence.</p>
<p>It was always: the enemy is attacking, so we need to do this and that.</p>
<p>We defeated the enemy and won, but then new enemies attacked again.</p>
<p>It really almost put her to sleep.</p>
<p>"You can't compare other developers to Chen Xu. I still have a lot of faith in him, even if he always pulls some tricks," Zhang Yi said, full of confidence in <code>Warcraft</code>.</p>
<p>Especially that CG animation, it truly shocked Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>He had never seen a game company invest so much in an RTS game before.</p>
<p>Moreover, the short one-minute CG video for <code>Warcraft</code> at the time had also made Zhang Yi very curious.</p>
<p>Because he felt that <code>Warcraft</code> was different from typical RTS games, which often just turned their so-called single-player stories into tutorial levels.</p>
<p>He felt that <code>Warcraft</code> would genuinely have a complete single-player story.</p>
<p>Recalling Chen Xu's previous mention of subverting the 'RTS genre' and the '700 million development cost'.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi also had a bold guess: would <code>Warcraft</code> put a lot of effort into its story?</p>
<p>Like most players, he thought that Chen Xu, venturing into the RTS field for the first time, might struggle with balancing issues in multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>But a single-player story was different.</p>
<p>This tested level design, and considering Chen Xu's level design in <code>Dark Souls</code> and <code>It Takes Two</code>, was there any room for doubt?</p>
<p>So he believed there was a high probability that Chen Xu was focusing on the single-player story for <code>Warcraft</code>.</p>
<p>He still had considerable confidence in games produced by Nebula Games.</p>
<p>He even secretly used his private stash of money to buy a Collector's Edition of <code>Warcraft</code>!</p>
<p>Of course, he definitely couldn't let her know, or else he might end up doing all the laundry from now on.</p>
<p>After all, buying the Collector's Edition of <code>Warcraft</code> wasn't the key point; the key point was that he had a private stash of money.</p>
<p>"Alright, alright, you play first and I'll watch. If it's fun, I'll try it myself later; the game isn't going anywhere anyway," Wang Han said to Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>"It's time! Old Zhang, I'm muting my mic!" Song Ren's excited voice came from the voice channel.</p>
<p>"O.J.B.K!" Zhang Yi replied and immediately clicked on the <code>Warcraft</code> icon.</p>
<p>Entering the game, the Nebula Games LOGO flashed by.</p>
<p>The first thing was a CG animation.</p>
<p>It was the same CG promotional animation Chen Xu had previously released on the official Weibo account.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi had already watched it more than once, but this time he still chose not to skip it.</p>
<p>The CG content was relatively easy to understand.</p>
<p>It meant that Humans and Orcs were not friends, but opposing factions, but a sudden evil enemy descended from the sky, forcing Orcs and Humans to unite.</p>
<p>Soon the CG animation ended, and the game's UI interface appeared.</p>
<p>The background was a scene resembling an iceberg, presumably an in-game location.</p>
<p>Aside from the exit game and settings options.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi observed that there were three different choices in the game.</p>
<p>Story Campaign, LAN local multiplayer, and online multiplayer.</p>
<p>However, online multiplayer and LAN were currently grayed out, clearly not supported in the trial version.</p>
<p>But this made Zhang Yi excited, because judging from the content of this trial version, Chen Xu clearly wanted players to experience the single-player story, which perfectly matched his guess.</p>
<p>"Let me see how this single-player story is!" With an excited heart, Zhang Yi eagerly clicked the Story Campaign button.</p>
<p>The Story Campaign was no different from other games; difficulty could be chosen before entering.</p>
<p>Easy, Normal, and Hard.</p>
<p>Considering this, Zhang Yi thought carefully for a moment and chose the easiest difficulty.</p>
<p>"You're really embarrassing yourself," Wang Han next to him couldn't help but say, speechless.</p>
<p>If it's the easiest, then it's the easiest. What's the point of your mouse hovering back and forth between 'Hard' and 'Normal' for three or four seconds and then choosing neither?</p>
<p>"Cough, cough... This is Mr. Chen's game after all. Think about <code>Dark Souls</code> and <code>Monster Hunter: World</code>. I'm just being proactive," Zhang Yi explained with an awkward cough.</p>
<p>After selecting the difficulty, what appeared on Zhang Yi's screen was 'Chapter One'. Clearly, this single-player story was a linear game, requiring players to clear it chapter by chapter.</p>
<p>After clicking on Chapter One, Zhang Yi was stunned.</p>
<p>Because there were simply too many levels in this first chapter!</p>
<p>He counted briefly, there were a full twelve sub-chapters!</p>
<p>However, only the first one was lit up, displaying the level name: 'Thrall's Vision - Seeking the Prophet' (The original prologue and Chapter One were merged).</p>
<p>The rest were still grayed out, their level names unclear.</p>
<p>"I just wonder how long each level will be," Zhang Yi grew even more expectant.</p>
<p>He directly clicked on the first prologue level.</p>
<p>The screen gradually faded to black, and narration began.</p>
<p>'The sands of time have run out, Son of Durotan.'</p>
<p>'The horns of war echo in the wind, the lingering shadows of old poison the land, and blazing war once again scorches the world.'</p>
<p>'Leading thousands of troops to dye the battlefield with blood, mortals blindly rush towards their doom, unaware that the Burning Shadow is about to devour all things.'</p>
<p>'You must gather the Horde and lead them to their destiny!'</p>
<p>On the battlefield, human armies and orc armies were clashing. Then, just like the previous opening cutscene, countless fireballs burning with green flames rained down from the sky.</p>
<p>The next moment, the camera switched to a high mound, where an Orc who had just awoken from a nightmare looked disoriented in a barracks.</p>
<p>This segment of CG was essentially a completion of the content from the previous promotional CG, but it also raised many questions and curiosities for Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>Humans and Orcs battling, what exactly was that fiery figure descending from the sky?</p>
<p>What was the Burning Shadow?</p>
<p>And who was that mysterious mage at the end?</p>
<p>Controlling the Orc named Thrall who had just awakened from a nightmare, Zhang Yi's heart was filled with curiosity.</p>
<p>Curiosity aside, he quickly refocused his attention on the game.</p>
<p>The character named Thrall advanced under the Prophet's guidance.</p>
<p>This was a basic game operation tutorial.</p>
<p>But what surprised him most was the overall quality of the game.</p>
<p>Zooming in the camera, he could even clearly see the exquisite modeling of the characters in the game.</p>
<p>Including the textures of the water on the ground and the grass, all were quite exquisite.</p>
<p>Was this really an RTS game?</p>
<p>The quality was simply too high!</p>
<p>He hadn't even played the game's content yet.</p>
<p>But just the modeling and graphics of <code>Warcraft</code>, combined with the earlier CG, had already left Zhang Yi in awe.</p>
<p>It could only be said that the current performance of <code>Warcraft</code> completely exceeded his expectations.</p>
<p>Compared to the CG animation, there was indeed a noticeable gap.</p>
<p>But compared to other RTS games, even without considering the content, the presentation alone was far superior!</p>
