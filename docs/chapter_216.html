                <p>Chapter 316: No Player Can Resist the -90% Little Green Bar (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games' office, Chen Xu leaned back on the sofa, chatting with Meng Zuo via video call.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, the Game Department gave Rainbow Six Siege a very high evaluation!" Meng Zuo said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>The media scores for it weren't exceptionally high, nor were they low.</p>
<p>But aside from players, Rainbow Six Siege also received high praise from the Game Department.</p>
<p>This was primarily because Rainbow Six Siege's characteristics were too distinct.</p>
<p>From a training perspective, the military version of Rainbow Six Siege was more about training ideological awareness.</p>
<p>For example, teamwork, timely reporting of various information, and feedback.</p>
<p>When it came to actual combat, the content within VR certainly couldn't be the main focus.</p>
<p>But even so, compared to other games, even the military versions provided in previous years, Rainbow Six Siege performed exceptionally well.</p>
<p>"How are NetDragon's preparations for the subsequent versions?" Chen Xu smiled, not directly answering, but instead asked.</p>
<p>"The ranking system is complete, and a considerable gap has already emerged between the current casual player base and the high-tier players. It should launch shortly after the New Year," Meng Zuo replied.</p>
<p>During this period, he was also feeling quite triumphant.</p>
<p>He had participated in the Rainbow Six Siege project, which could be called a great success, and Chen Xu was unaware of it.</p>
<p>As a NetDragon employee, Meng Zuo had quite a few information channels.</p>
<p>Regarding TengHua and the Channel Alliance, the new title they had been heavily promoting previously had gone completely silent.</p>
<p>Regular players didn't know yet, but according to some internal NetDragon information, there was a high probability that the project had been cut short.</p>
<p>After all, Rainbow Six Siege's performance was, to put it mildly, outstanding.</p>
<p>In this situation, neither the market nor the Game Department could suppress Rainbow Six Siege.</p>
<p>Immediately canceling the project to cut losses was a relatively rational move.</p>
<p>This also generated considerable excitement within NetDragon.</p>
<p>Meng Zuo, who supported the collaboration between NetDragon and Nebula Games, was also promoted and received a raise.</p>
<p>He was now considered part of NetDragon's management, holding a certain degree of influence.</p>
<p>After chatting with Meng Zuo for a while, Chen Xu hung up the phone.</p>
<p>The subsequent PC version of Rainbow Six Siege would be ported and developed by NetDragon.</p>
<p>Based on the VR version, some detailed animations and visual fidelity might be reduced.</p>
<p>However, the main content would not differ significantly from the VR version.</p>
<p>Cross-platform matchmaking would also be added to the game.</p>
<p>After all, the control schemes for the VR and PC versions were slightly different.</p>
<p>To be precise, in the Parallel World, the VR version was actually easier to control than the PC version.</p>
<p>This was because it offered a stronger sense of realism and immersion, while shooting in real life was genuinely difficult.</p>
<p>However, VR was still a game. Therefore, unlike the PC platform, which used a mouse for aiming and movement, VR games generally employed gaze tracking combined with aim correction.</p>
<p>Thus, enabling cross-platform matchmaking was necessary, allowing players to choose freely.</p>
<p>As for projects, there wasn't much left.</p>
<p>Because the Spring Festival was approaching.</p>
<p>The main focus would be on the platform and currently operating games, using the opportunity to launch some events.</p>
<p>Launching events typically served three purposes: boosting game popularity, increasing revenue, and appeasing players.</p>
<p>Sometimes, even if you didn't want to rely on holiday events to boost popularity or revenue, you still had to hold them.</p>
<p>Because if you didn't, the players would revolt.</p>
<p>"Other games are having events! Why aren't you!?"</p>
<p>"What, you're saying other games' events are just to trick players into spending money?"</p>
<p>"Then we're willing to be tricked into spending money for beautiful skins and fashion!"</p>
<p>"Release a swimsuit skin for Auntie IQ, and see if we'll buy it in droves!"</p>
<p>"Hmm... wait, no, that wouldn't work. The art style and game setting would clash too much."</p>
<p>"So forget the swimsuit! Give us a pink, anime-style gun, and see if we'll buy it in droves!"</p>
<p>For many players, sometimes with a continuously operating game, especially one with in-app purchases.</p>
<p>During festivals and holidays, the absence of such temporary events makes players feel utterly uncomfortable!</p>
<p>And for Chen Xu, there really wasn't much of a choice.</p>
<p>Because Nebula Games currently operated quite a few titles.</p>
<p>Even Overcooked, from back in the day, was still operating stably.</p>
<p>Although its peak concurrent player count was only around ten thousand.</p>
<p>But it would still continue stable operations, just without any new official content.</p>
<p>It relied more on the Workshop player community and official reviews and approvals of player suggestions.</p>
<p>Currently, the truly operational games were Sanguosha, Fall Guys, and the recently launched Rainbow Six.</p>
<p>However, while there wasn't much to operate in terms of game content.</p>
<p>Nebula Games' biggest focus right now wasn't games, but the platform itself!</p>
<p>"Let's proceed with this model. Game developers can voluntarily participate in the event, and we should clearly explain the pros and cons to them," Chen Xu said, nodding to Zhang Yida.</p>
<p>This year would mark Nebula Games' first major promotion.</p>
<p>When the Nebula Games Platform was established last year, Chen Xu didn't adopt a major promotion model due to the limited number of games.</p>
<p>It relied more on the platform continuously releasing new titles.</p>
<p>The situation was different now, with NetDragon and Nebula Games having formed a strategic partnership.</p>
<p>The game library immediately expanded. As for promotions, Chen Xu had already communicated with NetDragon in advance.</p>
<p>NetDragon had no objections and was very cooperative.</p>
<p>Chen Xu estimated that Rainbow Six Siege's performance had clearly satisfied NetDragon.</p>
<p>Moreover, Rainbow Six Siege was not a one-time transaction.</p>
<p>Subsequent weapon skins and other items would also be significant revenue streams.</p>
<p>The rest involved communicating with various major developers.</p>
<p>"However, Mr. Chen, isn't this discount a bit too generous? Many manufacturers are also concerned about this," Zhang Yida asked.</p>
<p>"What's there to worry about? Digital games aren't physical goods. When they can be sold at their peak, players will buy them immediately. Besides, most of the games in the major promotion have been online for over a year. Aren't Monster Hunter: World and Warcraft not included?" Chen Xu said.</p>
<p>Zhang Yida nodded, then discussed this platform event segment with Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Some classic games, as well as niche titles with good reputations, would be included in this New Year's Special.</p>
<p>No one could resist the allure of a -50% or higher little green bar; it was the straw that broke the camel's back.</p>
<p>It was the wicked little hand reaching into players' wallets.</p>
<p>Upon seeing that percentage-based little green bar, a man's smile would involuntarily appear in players' minds.</p>
<p>As if under some spell, players would willingly hand over their wallets.</p>
<p>Aside from the popular little green bar.</p>
<p>The rest involved the company's event arrangements.</p>
<p>After all, Nebula Games now had a considerable number of employees.</p>
<p>An annual meeting was arranged at a five-star hotel, with a professional performance team hired.</p>
<p>As for year-end bonuses, all departments had already distributed them.</p>
<p>At that time, every employee attending the annual meeting, regardless of their position, would receive a unified 5888 red envelope. The annual meeting prizes would also be closely related to games.</p>
<p>Such as custom-made themed computers, mobile phones, VR gaming pods, and so on.</p>
<p>Employees, regardless of their department, were all very happy, immersed in this joyful atmosphere.</p>
<p>Chen Xu certainly felt happy too, but for him, this was more of a formality; the main focus remained on the research and development plans for the coming year.</p>
