                <p>Chapter 303: Special Operators (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>After the news of NetDragon and Nebula Games collaborating spread, online players enthusiastically discussed it.</p>
<p>It was clear that this appeared to be a VR blockbuster, developed by two highly anticipated game developers, NetDragon and Nebula Games, working together. Furthermore, this would be Nebula Games' first major VR game.</p>
<p>Silent Hill PT couldn't be counted, as it was developed earlier for the Game Department to test the new VR version. Due to the special nature of its theme, it wouldn't be accessible to ordinary players. Therefore, currently, the only version available to online players was the PC version of Silent Hill PT.</p>
<p>As for Minecraft, it was considered a more unconventional existence. If judged solely by its visual presentation, disregarding its MOD content, Minecraft's visual performance in VR was actually mid-to-lower tier. In terms of graphics, it clearly couldn't be called a blockbuster.</p>
<p>But this time, with the mysterious game named R6, things were different. With two companies joining forces, all players believed it would definitely be a blockbuster; otherwise, there would be no need! For a time, online players were abuzz with discussions.</p>
<p>“I wonder what kind of game this R6 actually is! A letter and an Arabic numeral, impossible to guess!”</p>
<p>“I think it should be an ARPG, after all, Nebula Games excels in that genre.”</p>
<p>“Either an ARPG or an RPG, or perhaps an action-adventure game. Storytelling is certainly one of Nebula Games' strengths.”</p>
<p>“Do you think it could be a VR version of Dark Souls?”</p>
<p>“I hope not. The PC version is already torturous enough for me. A VR version would be torturous and make me wet myself from fear. Just imagine facing animated corpses in VR, and entering the scenes of Farron Keep and the underground prison.”</p>
<p>“Damn, stop talking, I can already picture it in my head.”</p>
<p>“Hehe, I've already wet myself.”</p>
<p>The available information was simply too scarce, so players online were just bragging and chatting idly. Since they didn't know anything, they just made wild guesses.</p>
<p>However, for TengHua, the Channel Alliance, and some well-known Game Designers in the industry, there was a clue as to what kind of game Nebula Games and NetDragon were collaborating on. It was clearly related to the notice from the Game Department, and if it involved that, it was highly likely to be an FPS game.</p>
<p>Chen Xu, at Nebula Games, paid no heed to the online discussions and continued to draft the design concept document.</p>
<p>Regarding the VR version of Rainbow Six Siege, whether for the player or military version, there were still many actions and details that needed to be refined. The military version, naturally, leaned towards realism.</p>
<p>For instance, in the player version, when scanned by reconnaissance drones and cameras, players would be alerted, letting them know their position was exposed. This obviously couldn't be done in the military version.</p>
<p>As for camera usage, in the military version, dying would result in a black screen, with no way to call out locations or use cameras to provide information. The ordinary player version, however, allowed this, though there was a high probability that ordinary players would go AFK on cameras after dying, thinking they had no contribution left since they were 'free kills.' In reality, this behavior was quite wrong. While alive, they might indeed have made little contribution, but after dying, providing information to teammates by calling out locations through cameras could be more valuable than their contributions while alive.</p>
<p>Besides these, there were many other details that required careful consideration, but these were all aspects that needed to be tackled bit by bit during development. For Chen Xu right now, the priority was to complete the game's general framework.</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay, there wasn't much difference from later versions of Rainbow Six Siege. At the start of the round, the attacking team would use reconnaissance drones to gather information on bomb and hostage locations. The defending team, on the other hand, would fortify the interior, such as barricading, opening up passages, and setting up traps. This allowed them to defend more effectively based on the indoor environment. Additionally, there were various related gadgets, as well as each operator's unique characteristics and skill equipment.</p>
<p>The attacking team was divided into roles such as intelligence gathering, breaching obstacles, and assault. Similarly, the defending team had roles like intelligence gathering, hindering attacks, concealed ambushes, and laying traps.</p>
<p>As for the special operators, Chen Xu didn't plan to include too many in the early stage, opting instead for those with distinct characteristics.</p>
<p>Xiao Meilian, codenamed Ying, a Flying Tigers special operator. Her unique ability was 'Candela's Flash Thunder,' a cluster flashbang that could be embedded into surfaces or launched as a grenade. It temporarily blinded and deafened all operators inside, regardless of allegiance, but Ying herself remained unaffected due to her specialized goggles and helmet.</p>
<p>Sledge, codenamed Sledgehammer, hailing from a city above the Scottish Highlands. He became captain of the Scotland National Youth Rugby Team, eventually joining the army at 18, and five years later was recruited into the British 22nd Special Air Service Regiment. His unique ability was the breaching hammer, which had a simple and brutal effect: it could smash open any breachable, destructible surface; he also had a deployable machine gun and bulletproof panels, but with a durability limit.</p>
<p>Fuze, born into a military family in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, immigrated to Russia shortly before the fall of the Soviet Union. While his demeanor seemed rough, he possessed strong moral values. His unique ability was the Cluster Charge, a special device that could be placed on destructible walls and floors. Once activated, it would sequentially deploy 5 explosive pucks from right to left behind the obstacle, each with the power of a hand grenade.</p>
<p>There were ten operators for the attacking team and ten for the defending team.</p>
<p>No, to be precise, there should be eleven, as there was one special operator that both the attacking and defending teams could use: the Recruit operator. His biggest feature was his lack of features. He had no special abilities, was fixed at two armor and two speed (referring to his resilience to damage, movement speed, and sound output), but could choose from a wider variety of firearm and gadget loadouts.</p>
<p>Soon, the game's design concept document was complete, and it entered the routine meeting and presentation session.</p>
<p>However, unlike before, this meeting also included Meng Zuo from NetDragon, as well as members of their working group.</p>
<p>From their expressions, it was evident that everyone present was very much looking forward to it.</p>
<p>After all, this was Nebula Games' first VR blockbuster.</p>
<p>As for the game type, everyone present already had a general understanding. It was a counter-terrorism game, but unlike traditional counter-terrorism games, this would be a game that focused more on its core mechanics.</p>
<p>But how this game would actually perform was finally about to be revealed.</p>
