                <h1>Chapter 40: Heated Discussion</h1>
<p>Inside the Modu Game Department.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous life, in the Parallel World, various entertainment industries were not determined by a single overarching department. Instead, they were subdivided into different specialized departments.</p>
<p>Naturally, the Game Department was responsible for all matters related to games. This included domestic agents representing overseas games, the review of domestic games, and games that had already passed domestic review and were launched but intended for export overseas. All of these fell under the Game Department's scrutiny.</p>
<p>Regarding the review process, unlike the one-size-fits-all approach of the previous life, the Parallel World had a detailed Rating System. This was primarily due to the more advanced technology in some areas of the Parallel World; at the very least, the online real-name authentication for games was thoroughly implemented.</p>
<p>Minors shouldn't even think about seeing boobs; they definitely wouldn't find them. It was precisely because of this factor that the review regulations were more lenient than in the previous life.</p>
<p>Of course, if one insisted on producing adult content, that was still strictly prohibited. Just like Chen Xu's first developed game, Mirror (Game), it could only be exported and then re-sold domestically. It was considered a gray area, not supported but also not directly shut down.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Game Department offered its self-developed game engine to the public. It was somewhat similar to the Unreal Engine of the previous life, except one was commercial while the other became state-owned. Moreover, their technologies were not on the same level.</p>
<p>At this moment, within the Modu Game Department, the relevant leaders and judges responsible for the Sci-Fi Game Design Competition were holding a meeting to discuss the situation. Unlike ordinary players, these judges were expected to play virtually every game. Therefore, their scoring was primarily based on summaries provided by the review staff below them, combined with their own judgment of the games' content. After all, it would be utterly unrealistic to play through the story of so many games from start to finish within such a short timeframe.</p>
<p>Considering the significant player feedback on games selected in previous years, this time a decision was made for players and official representatives to co-score the entries. After all, the purpose of the Game Department holding the competition was to better guide the domestic game market environment. And the game market, ultimately, was decided by the players. If the officials selected suitable games, but players disliked them, how could that possibly guide the market?</p>
<p>"Let's start with the voting for the first-place award. Everyone, please explain your choices one by one," said the Reviewing Leader seated at the head.</p>
<p>"NetDragon Games, designer Meng Zuo's Galaxy Heroes, has some flaws in its plot presentation and numerical design, but the rhythm of its level design is exceptionally outstanding," the first judge began, as everyone started to speak in turn.</p>
<p>"Nebula Games, designer Chen Xu's To the Moon, while not particularly noteworthy in terms of pure gameplay, utilizes a reverse chronological narrative that can be described as perfectly paced."</p>
<p>"I concur. Although Chen Xu's game is different from his previous Undertale, and doesn't showcase an astonishing system of settings, its pure story is enough to be profoundly moving."</p>
<p>"Galaxy Heroes is indeed excellent, but To the Moon is also superb. However, from a personal perspective, I believe most ordinary game designers likely lack the resources to create games like Galaxy Heroes. To the Moon, on the other hand, is different. So, from that standpoint, I lean more towards choosing To the Moon."</p>
<p>"While I also acknowledge the excellence of this game, can To the Moon truly be considered a sci-fi game? Fundamentally, it seems to tell a love story, doesn't it?"</p>
<p>"Strictly speaking, To the Moon isn't sci-fi, of course. But if we apply such a rigorous standard, over forty percent of the entries in this competition wouldn't qualify as sci-fi."</p>
<p>"I still have reservations. I'm more optimistic about Galaxy Heroes."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The Game Reviewing Leaders for this event entered into a heated debate over the game selections. Meanwhile, online, countless players were also busy experiencing and trying out the various competing games.</p>
<p>In terms of initial popularity and promotion, many of the competing games had received some push. But if there was one that stood out the most, it was still Chen Xu.</p>
<p>After all, the buzz around Undertale hadn't fully subsided, and then Zhong Mei, who had previously feigned death, reappeared, only to be utterly crushed by Chen Xu. So, in terms of popularity, it could be said that Chen Xu had completely seized control.</p>
<p>This also led many players to try out To the Moon immediately. And across various forums and player groups, there was already a flurry of enthusiastic recommendations and discussions.</p>
<p>"I strongly recommend everyone try Chen Xu's new entry, To the Moon; it moved me to tears!"</p>
<p>"Oh, come on, buddy upstairs, is it really that serious? Moved to tears? Isn't this a game Chen Xu made in just over ten days?"</p>
<p>"So what if it was made in just over ten days? If it's good enough, it's awesome! And the story is truly incredibly moving. Once you play it, you'll understand what 'game that makes even tough guys cry' means."</p>
<p>"Damn, seeing you guys discuss it, my tears are starting to well up again!"</p>
<p>"Is it really that exaggerated?"</p>
<p>"Why don't you go play it yourself and find out? This game made me realize just how low my tear threshold is!"</p>
<p>"That amazing? Holy crap, I'm going to buy one and try it."</p>
<p>"Who are you all voting for? I've decided on To the Moon, and no one can change my mind!"</p>
<p>"Same here, I've decided to vote for To the Moon!"</p>
<p>"While I was also very moved, I don't think To the Moon really counts as a sci-fi game."</p>
<p>"Who cares if it's a sci-fi game or not? I'm just going to cast my vote for it!"</p>
<p>These players, who had tried To the Moon right away, unhesitatingly cast their votes for the game. As for whether it strictly counted as a sci-fi game? After experiencing its moving storyline, very few players cared. After all, why should they bother so much about whether it was sci-fi or not? If they thought the game was excellent and that it touched them, then voting was the logical conclusion. As for its eligibility, that was something for the officials to confirm.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Soon, the three-day sales figures for this batch of competing games were released. To the Moon led the pack, achieving 193,000 sales, while Galaxy Heroes, in second place, had 87,000 sales.</p>
<p>These numbers were already quite astonishing. However, there were two main reasons for such a significant sales lead.</p>
<p>Firstly, To the Moon was a dual-platform game, available on both mobile and PC, reaching a broader player base. Secondly, To the Moon was priced at only 15 Yuan.</p>
<p>Galaxy Heroes, on the other hand, was 65 Yuan.</p>
<p>Although the low price of To the Moon was also related to its game length. After all, the entire game, from start to finish, was actually only a little over four hours long.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a lower price still had a significant impact on sales.</p>
