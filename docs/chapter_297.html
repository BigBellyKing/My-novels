                <h1>Chapter 296: The RTS Achilles' Heel (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h1>
<p>In the days following Chen Xu's demonstration of the balance in <code>Warcraft</code>.</p>
<p>Various online gaming communities, as well as Chen Xu's official Weibo account, were filled with all sorts of comments.</p>
<p>And from these comments, one could see the countless grievances of players.</p>
<p>'That's just too damn unethical! Mr. Chen is something else!'</p>
<p>'Exactly! Exactly! He just dropped a line about a new version launching soon, then played dead!'</p>
<p>'It's agonizing!'</p>
<p>'But what do you guys think this new version will contain? A brand new race? It seemed like we could already control the Naga race in the campaign mode!'</p>
<p>'Yeah, right? And don't you think the Naga race is highly complete, with comprehensive building functions, and units from peasants to Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 are all there? Plus complete offensive and defensive tech, unit skill tech, and even their own shops and heroes. They could totally be released as a new race.'</p>
<p>'I don't think so. The Naga units are simply too strong. I feel like adding them to the game would somewhat break the balance.'</p>
<p>'Exactly, with their performance in the campaign, if the Naga are added, it'll probably really turn into Naga Supremacy.'</p>
<p>'I, for one, think it might be a new story campaign. Could it be the story after Arthas became the Lich King?'</p>
<p>'That's hard to say for sure!'</p>
<p>Players were discussing animatedly, guessing about the information and content of the new version that Chen Xu had previously revealed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Nebula Games office, Chen Xu was feeling very comfortable and relaxed.</p>
<p>At this moment, he was checking the several RPG maps that Qin Yi and Ruan Ningxue had created.</p>
<p>Chen Xu could tell that the few of them had put a lot of effort into these maps.</p>
<p>Including their level of detail and numerical balance, they were better than in his previous life, as the available resources were different after all.</p>
<p>Additionally, some of the heroes in these maps were also distinct, and they even included several easter egg-like heroes from Nebula Games' own titles.</p>
<p>For example, the Undead from <code>Dark Souls</code> and the Azure Star from <code>Monster Hunter</code>.</p>
<p>And these maps each had their own unique characteristics.</p>
<p><code>Defend the Sword Pass</code>: Players choose heroes from the Shu Kingdom of the Three Kingdoms to defend against Wei's attacks, with content like dungeons, quests, and grinding for equipment, just like typical RPG gameplay.</p>
<p><code>Calamity of the Western World</code>: Players can choose various heroes and gradually advance the plot, just like a normal RPG. The entire game even spans four to five hours.</p>
<p><code>Demon Hunter Chronicles</code> was divided into different phases: grinding monsters and equipment for progression, then entering a defensive phase, and finally an offensive phase.</p>
<p>As for <code>Monopoly of the World</code> and <code>Pyramid Escape</code>, the former featured a board game-like gameplay similar to Monopoly, while the latter combined numerous casual mini-games where survival was achieved by maneuvering to avoid traps.</p>
<p>Of course, Chen Xu also made some changes in this aspect.</p>
<p>In his previous life, the RPG maps, mini-games, and tower defense maps in <code>Warcraft</code> were generally fine, usually lasting around an hour and a half.</p>
<p>However, some defense maps and RPG maps often had durations of two to three hours, or even four to five hours.</p>
<p>This would often lead to players quitting midway, and once a player quit, especially on a high difficulty, it would become nearly impossible to clear the game.</p>
<p>Therefore, Chen Xu also added a save mechanism to the game.</p>
<p>Players could save their progress if they quit midway and then continue their unfinished game later. Of course, considering server issues, there was also a time limit for this.</p>
