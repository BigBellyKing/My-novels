                <p>Chapter 656: Mr. Chen, They're Going to Kill Us! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>As time slowly progressed, more and more new players entered <code>World of Warcraft</code>.</p>
<p>They began to experience the unique charm of Azeroth.</p>
<p>And for everyone, it could be said that they had unique joy and emotions on this land of Azeroth.</p>
<p>Scrambling for monsters with other players in the newbie zone, queuing up together to fight quest BOSSes.</p>
<p>Or on the streets, asking mages for food and drink.</p>
<p>Or receiving a helping hand from passing players when their health was low in the wilderness and they were about to be killed by monsters.</p>
<p>There were also those destitute days in the game, where to learn a skill, they packed up everything they could sell and threw it into the shop.</p>
<p>At the same time, there were also stories in the game that moved players deeply.</p>
<p>'Of Love and Family', 'Battle for Darrowshire', 'Black Dragon Gate', 'Everlasting Devotion'...</p>
<p>Each side quest also saddened many players.</p>
<p>Online, whether on major forums or websites, discussions and reviews about <code>World of Warcraft</code> were rampant, and everyone lavished praise on this groundbreaking game. Its exquisite CG animations, grand worldview architecture, diverse and distinctive professions and races, complex and profoundly structured storyline, rich and varied dungeon designs, as well as faction-versus-faction PVP arenas and battlegrounds, all immersed players deeply.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the popularity of <code>World of Warcraft</code> showed no signs of cooling down.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this was mainly because <code>World of Warcraft</code> is an online game.</p>
<p>It differs greatly from single-player games, as the content of single-player games is limited. The content of online games, however, can be said to be infinite. Even if many players have completed the current version's content, there is still more to play, as a significant part of online gaming is rooted in social interaction.</p>
<p><code>World of Warcraft</code>'s raid dungeons, guilds, and opposing faction PVP gameplay are all part of this social aspect.</p>
<p>And precisely because of this, with the widespread popularity of <code>World of Warcraft</code>, even some players who were initially uninterested in games were drawn in.</p>
<p>After all, when something becomes a trend, people find it genuinely difficult to resist the temptation.</p>
<p>Of course, these players are temporarily considered blue ocean users, falling into the casual and light gaming category.</p>
<p>But it can be affirmed that a considerable number of these users will be converted into core <code>Warcraft</code> players.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>Online, many game designers were also discussing the impact of <code>World of Warcraft</code> and the future direction of game development.</p>
<p>These have always been frequently debated topics within the gaming industry.</p>
<p>But the impact brought by <code>World of Warcraft</code> this time was simply too profound.</p>
<p>To say it's globally popular is no exaggeration.</p>
<p>Any video website, any community forum, any live streaming platform, and even chat groups on social media platforms, contained content related to <code>Warcraft</code>. Undoubtedly, this was a phenomenon-level performance.</p>
<p>As an MMORPG, compared to Chen Xu's previous games like <code>Red Dead Redemption</code>, <code>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</code>, and <code>The Last of Us</code>,</p>
<p><code>World of Warcraft</code> is clearly more special because it is an online game.</p>
<p>Many industry designers and game developers were also discussing whether such social MMORPGs would become the mainstream in the future.</p>
<p>After all, players' need for social interaction is always very important.</p>
<p>Previously, social games primarily gathered on mobile platforms.</p>
<p>Why? Because it allowed players to utilize their fragmented time more effectively.</p>
<p>However, with the increasingly powerful development of VR technology, many users now relax in VR worlds during their leisure time.</p>
<p>And the success of <code>World of Warcraft</code> this time also proved a point: the MMORPG market has always had great potential.</p>
<p>It's just that a game like <code>World of Warcraft</code> hadn't appeared before.</p>
<p>"The biggest drawback of single-player games is that the playable content is limited, making it difficult to generate continuous revenue. <code>World of Warcraft</code>, as an online game, is different; it can continuously generate profit."</p>
<p>"The future development of VR will definitely focus more on social elements. MMORPGs, as a type of multiplayer game, will become the main core in the future."</p>
<p>Many designers discussed this on relevant professional forums, though there were also many dissenting opinions.</p>
<p>"Online games aren't that easy to make either. Setting aside <code>World of Warcraft</code>'s complex gameplay, dungeons, and story worldview design, just look at the scale of its Azeroth. How many AAA-tier games could be made with the investment poured into this one game?"</p>
<p>"Exactly! Compared to normal single-player games, a game of <code>World of Warcraft</code>'s scale requires immense human resources and capital."</p>
<p>"It's true that <code>World of Warcraft</code> is globally popular now, but single-player games will also never be replaced, just like TV series and movies."</p>
<p>As <code>World of Warcraft</code>'s data continued to climb, the relevant debates in the gaming industry became increasingly fierce.</p>
<p>But for Chen Xu, these debates in the gaming industry had no bearing on him.</p>
<p>Right now, he was more focused on bringing players a game that he found personally interesting.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, they're going to kill us!"</p>
<p>In the meeting room, Yang Xin's expression was very complex as she looked at Chen Xu's plot outline summary, then paused and forced out a sentence.</p>
<p>Next to her, Ruan Ningxue, Qin Yi, and Meng Zuo also looked like they wanted to speak but hesitated.</p>
<p>Regarding the new project after <code>World of Warcraft</code>, Chen Xu had already given them an inside scoop earlier.</p>
<p>But now, having received the latest proposal and quickly scanned the relevant characters and plot, everyone fell silent.</p>
<p>Because this was a classic revisited!</p>
<p>If they were to name the games they'd made that could most wound players' hearts, Yang Xin and the others felt that this script in their hands could easily rank in the top three.</p>
<p>"How so? Isn't the ending perfect? A family reunited, then passing away peacefully in the end." Chen Xu coughed lightly.</p>
<p>"But Mr. Chen, this isn't just one protagonist!" Yang Xin couldn't help but complain.</p>
<p>"A beautiful ending always has some twists and turns. How can everything be smooth sailing every time?" Chen Xu coughed lightly.</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu, everyone was speechless.</p>
<p>However, Ruan Ningxue, on her part, was very interested in the content of the document.</p>
<p>"But Mr. Chen, how are we going to present the art style for this new work? There are simply too many elements, aren't there?" Ruan Ningxue asked curiously.</p>
<p>'Religion, race, corporate capital, utopia, steampunk, and even exceptionalism. The plot will even include simple discussions related to quantum mechanics and Einstein's theory of special relativity.'</p>
<p>It could be said that in terms of theme, this was absolutely the most complex game they had faced to date.</p>
