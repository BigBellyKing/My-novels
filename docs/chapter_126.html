                <p>Chapter 225: Freedom is the Core (Seeking Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Both private servers, single-player mode, and official servers were filled with extremely excited players.</p>
<p>Without exception, all players who visited the buildings Chen Xu displayed on the display server immediately entered <em>Minecraft</em> with an excited heart, ready to show off their skills and construct the buildings from their minds.</p>
<p>In Nebula Games' office, despite it being the Spring Festival, considering the importance of <em>Minecraft</em> to the development of the Nebula Games Platform, Chen Xu had previously discussed overtime work during the New Year with his team. Of course, it wasn't too much.</p>
<p>The main task was to be responsible for various tasks during the New Year. Employees living in Modu who were on duty during the New Year would work from the office, while non-local employees could return home for the New Year and work remotely. Naturally, the corresponding welfare plans were also complete. Coupled with the year-end bonus just issued before the New Year, quite a few people were willing to stay and work overtime. In fact, because the number of willing individuals exceeded Chen Xu's expectations, they even had to draw lots to select staff. Of course, this was mainly due to the generous overtime pay and various benefits.</p>
<p>As Chen Xu walked out of the office, Yang Xin greeted him excitedly, with Qin Yi and Lin Tao also by her side. Everyone present also lived in Modu, and they were all beaming with excitement.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen! Sales have already surpassed 3 million! According to today's trend, it's very likely to break 4 million!" Yang Xin said excitedly.</p>
<p>The others, including Qin Yi, were equally thrilled.</p>
<p>"Hmm, keep an eye on the servers, and the backup servers can also be activated," Chen Xu nodded, acknowledging their report and telling Qin Yi and the others.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, aren't you excited?" Yang Xin looked at Chen Xu, a little bewildered, and Qin Yi and the others beside her were also puzzled. First-day sales might reach 4 million!</p>
<p>This could definitely be considered a shocking number in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Although <em>Minecraft</em>'s price offered a significant advantage compared to large-scale games, these sales were genuine. It might even challenge 10 million in first-week sales.</p>
<p>"Don't forget, <em>Minecraft</em> started pre-orders a month in advance, and this is just the beginning. There's no need to get overly excited, and the overseas version hasn't even launched yet," Chen Xu said calmly.</p>
<p>The previous videos of Along the River During the Qingming Festival, Forbidden City, and others had served as excellent publicity. Coupled with Nebula Games' consistent reputation, <em>Minecraft</em> reached its current seemingly astonishing stage by combining its first-day sales with pre-order sales. But Chen Xu knew that this was actually just the beginning. These videos merely showcased the game's potential. To truly experience the fun and charm of the game, players needed to fully participate. This was a highly replayable game that only got better the more you played it. At this stage, it could only be said to have gotten off to a good start. In fact, the current Workshop still only contained the few building complex MODs that Chen Xu had put in.</p>
<p>At the same time, Chen Xu had also made some settings regarding MODs to protect the rights of MOD authors. For example, a MOD author could set whether subsequent players could make modifications to their original MOD. If Player A created a castle, but Player B only changed a few things on it and then claimed it as their own MOD, this situation would be restricted. After creating a corresponding building, players could set whether other players could perform secondary creation after uploading it. Furthermore, Chen Xu had also specifically established a department to maintain the <em>Minecraft</em> community.</p>
<p>In his previous life, the reason <em>Minecraft</em> was so popular was inextricably linked to its excellent community environment.</p>
<p>After discussing the current situation of <em>Minecraft</em> with Qin Yi and the others, Chen Xu returned to his office and opened <em>Minecraft</em>'s management backend to check the game's relevant data.</p>
<p>Currently, the official servers primarily consisted of three groups:</p>
<p>Survival, Creative, and Showcase.</p>
<p>"Showcase" was where building complexes like Along the River During the Qingming Festival and Forbidden City were placed, allowing players to visit them freely.</p>
<p>"Survival" was a large server that could accommodate 2,000 players. In this mode, there were no strict rules; everything depended on the players' own development. The entire game world was a super large map, and its appearance was randomly generated. Players were also randomly assigned spawn points on the map. Of course, each player would have many other players around them. After all, it was a multiplayer game. If players had to start with just their fists and only encounter other players after developing to a certain extent, then there would be no need for a multiplayer mode. So, generally, players would often encounter others while collecting resources in the early stages. At this point, whether they chose to huddle together for warmth, be mutually hostile, or develop individually, was up to the players themselves. Chen Xu and Nebula Games would not interfere with this in any way. Of course, the 2,000-player server capacity was an upper limit, and eventually some players would leave. However, according to the plan, if even one-tenth of the players remained, it would be sufficient for the ecological environment of a server.</p>
<p>However, in addition to these rule-unrestricted servers, there were also servers specifically for players who enjoyed building houses and peaceful construction. In these servers, players could not attack each other, though the monster settings were still retained. Furthermore, to prevent troublemaking players from destroying their home bases, players in peaceful mode servers could set their buildings to be indestructible by others and possessed a skill that allowed them to save their buildings at a specific point in time, essentially a save file function. This could be used indefinitely in peaceful mode. In regular multiplayer mode, there was a cooldown time, and buildings were not indestructible, but depending on the materials used for construction, there would be a special durability. Other players wishing to dismantle them would require specific tools and the process would be relatively slow. Additionally, in any mode, players could save their in-game data as a save file and transfer it to single-player Survival Mode, though this was a one-way transfer.</p>
<p>While these gameplay elements existed in private community servers in his previous life, Chen Xu estimated that some players would like these settings, but others would not. But it didn't matter, because the core of <em>Minecraft</em> itself lay in freedom. You couldn't say which mode was the true gameplay of <em>Minecraft</em>. There were also mini-game mechanics planned for later, but Chen Xu didn't intend to release these through official channels. After all, the early stages relied on official guidance, but later on, it would depend more on the power of the player community. Of course, Chen Xu wasn't without a backup plan; if all else failed, he could use a private account and pretend to be an ordinary MOD creator to release them!</p>
