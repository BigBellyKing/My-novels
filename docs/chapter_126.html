                <p>Chapter 126: Spreading the Hype</p>
<p>As players began to view Dark Souls more objectively, on the major Dark Souls game community forums, the players' discussions were no longer as aggressive as before. At the same time, the game's ratings also began to gradually rise.</p>
<p>Although there were still many players who bought and refunded the game, to Chen Xu, this was a very normal phenomenon. Because even though Dark Souls possessed a unique elemental charm, naturally, not all players enjoyed this kind of high-difficulty, hardcore challenge. For some players, Dark Souls was clearly not a game they would enjoy. However, for players who persevered, after defeating Gundyr the Ash and passing through the High Wall of Lothric, the unique aroma of this bottle of fine wine, the Souls-like game, fully diffused, captivating them deeply.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of spreading its influence, Dark Souls replicated the success of Outlast, and was even more popular. The main reason was that previously, no other game had been as unique as Dark Souls. Many players who had experienced Dark Souls, carrying their 'goodwill', enthusiastically recommended and promoted this game to their friends.</p>
<p>“Chen Xu’s Dark Souls, I recommend you try it! What type is it? It’s a hack-and-slash! Super satisfying!”</p>
<p>“See this Greatsword? See this BOSS? Isn’t it cool? Come play Dark Souls with me! It seems like we can also team up to fight BOSSes later.”</p>
<p>“A shield, a longsword, let’s Link the Fire in this desperate world! If you’re my brother, come to Lothric and Link the Fire with me!”</p>
<p>“Isn’t the Fire Keeper sister pretty? Isn’t this Knight handsome? Do you want to Link the Fire together?”</p>
<p>Many players painstakingly tried to entice their friends to join the grand Firelinking endeavor.</p>
<p>In addition, photos of Chen Xu from the exhibition a few months ago, and from the previous online press conference, were all dug up by players. Coupled with his remark ‘Warrior of Love’ from a media interview a year ago, he was once again pushed to the trending topics list by players. Especially with the creations of some Photoshop masters, Chen Xu was even turned into memes. In the exhibition photos, Chen Xu was originally holding a microphone, but this time it had been replaced with the Dark Souls game icon. And beside it, a line of text cordially greeted players: Will you Link the Fire?</p>
<p>Below Chen Xu's official Weibo post announcing the launch of Dark Souls, countless players who had previously declared 'I want to Link the Fire' and 'I must Link this Fire' now re-stated their opinions. They all expressed that whoever wanted to Link the Fire could go do it, as they certainly couldn't anymore.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the game, monsters that had subjected countless players to cruel deaths, such as Gundyr the Ash, ordinary Hollows, Lothric Knights, Winged Knights, Uchigatana Guy, Crystal Lizards, and Mimics, each had corresponding memes. For example, 'Do you feel the burning passion of the producer?' and 'This is my love for the players!'. The spread of these memes further boosted the secondary propagation of Dark Souls' popularity, adding more fuel to the game's sales. Of course, beneath these flames lay a flood of player grievances.</p>
<p>While the hype continued to ferment, many players also came up with mischievous ideas, tagging Chen Xu's personal account on the official Weibo, expressing their hope that he could come and serve as the Firelinking Leader, guiding everyone to Link the Fire together. Although it was rumored that the incredibly impressive promotional video at the online press conference was made by Chen Xu, that was just a rumor, after all; many players still harbored the desire to see Chen Xu suffer, eagerly adding fuel to the fire.</p>
<p>Although countless UP hosts and streamers were suffering on major video and live streaming platforms, different identities brought different levels of excitement and novelty!</p>

<p>Nebula Games' office.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, about the follow-up arrangements?” From the Marketing and Operations Department, Zhang Yida was a little uncertain. Although he had considerable confidence in the quality of Dark Souls, Chen Xu also knew that a game's success wasn't solely dependent on its inherent quality; corresponding marketing and promotion were also extremely helpful for a game. Simply put, the game's inherent quality mostly guaranteed the lower bound of sales, but to achieve higher sales and influence, besides the game's quality, promotion and the creation of buzz were also extremely important. In his previous life, there was no shortage of such examples, the most well-known being Titanfall 2. In terms of quality, its reputation was phenomenal; apart from the single-player campaign being too short, it had no other flaws and surpassed its predecessor in every aspect, yet it ultimately flopped disastrously. Its core issue was its overly strong competitors: Battlefield 1, COD, and Overwatch, all powerful FPS rivals of the same genre, and their main focus was on multiplayer online modes. Coupled with the fact that it didn't secure any promotional resources, its fate was naturally a dead end. Therefore, regarding the mixed reviews from players online after Dark Souls' release, even though data showed no major issues, Chen Xu still confirmed some subsequent preparations with Zhang Yida, including guiding the game's trending topics. However, before they even made a move, the spontaneous efforts of players online had already steered Dark Souls in a positive direction.</p>
<p>“Maintain our official game forum community well. Also, prepare to open the Dark Souls Workshop when the time comes. As for operations, cease everything except for ad placements.” Sitting on his chair, Chen Xu thought for a moment before telling Zhang Yida.</p>
<p>Afterward, Chen Xu chatted with Zhang Yida about matters related to Dark Souls merchandise. This mainly involved things like collectible figures for later, but Nebula Games would not participate directly, instead licensing them out and only being responsible for subsequent quality control.</p>
<p>After Zhang Yida left the office, Chen Xu sat in front of his computer and opened Dark Souls. He had also noticed the various online mentions from players tagging him on the official Weibo in his spare time. However, he had no plans for live streaming. Because, for now, most players were still in a state of exploration with Dark Souls, so, he would try not to interfere too much in this area. But he should still capitalize on his own popularity when appropriate. No live stream, but recording some edited videos related to Dark Souls was perfectly fine. It could also serve to guide and reassure players.</p>
<p>(Ah... secretly adding an extra chapter, and I fell while adding it [sobbing], need monthly passes and recommendation votes to get back up.)</p>
<p>Just to say... I've deleted all the argumentative comments directly. That's the thing about writing game-related articles; every time I check comments, it's all arguments. There's nothing to argue about. If it's really unbearable, just call the author an idiot; I'll take it... Also, can't comments be a little more playful/indulgent, a bit more harmonious...?</p>
