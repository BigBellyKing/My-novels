                <p>Chapter 364: Game Launch (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>In the gaming industry, 'Beautiful World' and 'Red Dead Redemption', which had already begun their promotional warm-up, were undoubtedly the main topics of discussion among players recently.</p>
<p>However, a post on Chen Xu's official Weibo account garnered significant attention from many players, including those in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>The Weibo post was not long, containing only a few simple sentences.</p>
<p>'Regarding some key points that online players are curious about, I'd like to briefly mention a couple of features of "Red Dead Redemption" here.'</p>
<p>'Firstly, it's a completely different genre from "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare". Players will experience more interesting gameplay and a seamless large map, fully immersing themselves in the freedom and charm of the Western world.'</p>
<p>'Secondly, in terms of story, "Red Dead Redemption" will feature multiple ending choices this time, allowing players to become either a good person or a bad person.'</p>
<p>There was no lengthy discourse, just a simple answer to the two most hotly debated topics among online players previously.</p>
<p>Yet, from these few simple sentences, players and game designers in the industry gleaned a lot of information.</p>
<p>"Multiple endings!? Become a good person or a bad person, so the implication is that if you become a bad person, the protagonist's ending won't be a good one, but if you become a good person, it will be a good ending?"</p>
<p>"That must be what it means, and it's quite normal, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"A shiver of indignation! Ghost, Roach, Soap, Gaz, Griggs, and others, far away in heaven, roared: Why didn't they have multiple endings!?"</p>
<p>Reading Chen Xu's words on the official Weibo account, many players enthusiastically discussed the plot details he revealed.</p>
<p>Multiple endings were no longer a particularly novel game mechanic.</p>
<p>It was well-known to many veteran Nebula Games players—or rather, veteran Chen Xu players, as Nebula Games hadn't even been established back then.</p>
<p>The very first game Chen Xu made, 'Mirror (Game)', was a standard multi-ending game.</p>
<p>Pure Love and Netorare, two extreme endings, had even sparked a debate between Pure Love Warriors and Netorare Warriors in the Adult Game Industry at the time.</p>
<p>Now, 'Red Dead Redemption' was clearly following a similar path.</p>
<p>Of course, some players felt that things might not be so simple.</p>
<p>After all, if Captain Price was considered the protagonist in 'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare', then even though Captain Price didn't die in the end, Task Force 141 was completely wiped out.</p>
<p>And in the new game 'Red Dead Redemption', Arthur Morgan had a gang.</p>
<p>However, aside from this, what was most surprising was Chen Xu's announcement regarding the game's features.</p>
<p>Players will experience more interesting gameplay and a seamless large map.</p>
<p>This phrasing sounded a bit familiar, as if it had been heard somewhere before.</p>
<p>Wasn't this what Atrai had been promoting externally before?!</p>
<p>Many players were stunned.</p>
<p>And it wasn't just players; the gaming industry was also shocked.</p>
<p>'Red Dead Redemption' with a seamless map?</p>
<p>That visual quality couldn't possibly allow for it!</p>
<p>At Atrai, Antorini, after seeing Chen Xu's Weibo post, immediately launched a Cosmic VR device and entered the environmental theme previously released by Nebula Games.</p>
<p>With such visual performance, how could it achieve seamlessness?</p>
<p>Antorini frowned.</p>
<p>Or did Chen Xu have another trick up his sleeve?</p>
<p>Perhaps he would divide the seamless large map into segments, then play a CG cutscene to load when transitioning between certain areas.</p>
<p>For example, while players were riding horses, or performing other actions?</p>
<p>Or perhaps when heading to a certain map, players would need to take a train?</p>
<p>It would appear seamless in the game, but in reality, it would still involve loading zones.</p>
<p>Pondering the possible methods, Antorini felt he had guessed the truth.</p>
<p>As for graphical downgrades, although uncommon in the gaming industry, Antorini didn't think Nebula Games would resort to that.</p>
<p>The more he thought about it, the more he felt his idea was correct.</p>
<p>Petty tricks! Why promote it this way?</p>
<p>It was nothing but a gimmick!</p>
<p>As for the talk of richer gameplay, Antorini didn't care about that at all.</p>
<p>How rich could it be?</p>
<p>Like this environmental theme, running a farm in the West, raising pigs and farming?</p>
<p>"If it's only to this extent, 'Red Dead Redemption' is still quite uncertain. Also, we can't let them get a head start," Antorini said. Although he still had some concerns, he was very confident in his own game.</p>
<p>From the current situation, he felt that the threat from 'Red Dead Redemption' wouldn't be too significant, but its launch date still needed attention.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>In the following period, Atrai's promotion for 'Beautiful World' was in full swing, with new game information and content being revealed almost daily.</p>
<p>Each new gameplay mechanic and character steadily raised players' expectations.</p>
<p>'Red Dead Redemption' wasn't actually lagging behind either; besides its previous promotional videos, more was showcased within its environmental theme.</p>
<p>In addition to farming, raising pigs, and playing dominoes and poker, players discovered that a newspaper feature had been updated within the environmental theme.</p>
<p>Every day, a newsboy would deliver a newspaper.</p>
<p>It introduced various situations in the Western world.</p>
<p>In the game, newspapers were a very important item.</p>
<p>Besides the main story content that had occurred, much information for side quests could be found in the newspapers.</p>
<p>Of course, the newspapers Chen Xu currently released to players would certainly not involve actual game content.</p>
<p>They primarily served as an introduction to the social background of the time.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>As the project gradually progressed, days turned into weeks.</p>
<p>Finally, amidst the anticipation of players worldwide.</p>
<p>'Red Dead Redemption' and 'Beautiful World' successively announced their launch dates.</p>
<p>'Red Dead Redemption' would launch on January 16th, while 'Beautiful World' would launch on January 15th.</p>
<p>Unlike before, where Atrai would first announce its promotional content, and then Nebula Games would follow suit.</p>
<p>This time, however, 'Red Dead Redemption' announced its launch date first, with Atrai quickly following.</p>
<p>Even Chen Xu within Nebula Games was surprised.</p>
<p>Because the development of 'Red Dead Redemption' had been exceptionally smooth this time, yet even so, the current launch would not include online mode content, only the pure story content.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, Atrai had announced its launch date so quickly, and it was exactly one day earlier than theirs?</p>
<p>However, surprise aside, since the release date had already been announced, Chen Xu had no plans to make any adjustments.</p>
<p>Because everything had already been planned, and Chen Xu believed that a single day wouldn't significantly impact 'Red Dead Redemption'.</p>
<p>Unless it was three or four days, or even a week in advance.</p>
<p>Otherwise, a mere one or two-day difference in release schedules wouldn't truly affect the overall situation for the games involved.</p>
<p>Chen Xu was surprised, but Antorini at Atrai was even more relieved, grateful that everyone at Atrai, including himself, had been working overtime during this period.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it would have been impossible to set such a date.</p>
<p>Looking at the release date, Antorini couldn't help but smile.</p>
<p>He felt it was a sure win!</p>
<p>At least in terms of the release date, he had already surpassed 'Red Dead Redemption'.</p>
<p>The rest was up to the market to decide.</p>
<p>And he could finally get some good rest these few days. On January 15th, he planned to sleep in.</p>
<p>He would enjoy a full day's sleep, then wake up the next day to savor the sweet fruits of victory.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>January 15th</p>
<p>'Beautiful World' officially launched, while 'Red Dead Redemption' also began its pre-download phase, allowing players to enter the game as soon as it launched on the 16th.</p>
<p>Major game developers and designers in the industry were also closely watching.</p>
<p>Recently, these two games had completely dominated the gaming industry's spotlight.</p>
<p>But who would ultimately be the winner was hard to say.</p>
<p>After all, 'Red Dead Redemption' and 'Beautiful World' were both games of the same genre and theme.</p>
<p>If they were of different themes or genres, there would be an impact on sales, but it wouldn't be too significant.</p>
<p>However, with them being of the same genre and theme, the impact would be far greater.</p>
<p>As for the players, they weren't thinking too much.</p>
<p>Players who purchased 'Beautiful World' directly entered the game to experience it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, players who pre-ordered 'Red Dead Redemption' were pre-downloading it, while also following 'Beautiful World''s performance on platforms like live streaming, eagerly anticipating their own experience with 'Red Dead Redemption' tomorrow.</p>
