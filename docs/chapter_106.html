                <p>Chapter 205: Doubts About the Design Concept Draft (Fourth Update, Seeking Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Everyone present in the conference room was a little stunned.</p>
<p>Before this, they knew that Chen Xu would lead them in a new project, and it was basically confirmed to be a sandbox game.</p>
<p>They had considered many themes and related gameplay ideas.</p>
<p>But now, looking at the building block toys Chen Xu had placed on the table for better illustration, Qin Yi and Ruan Ningxue were all a bit confused.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, is our next new project a building block game?" Yang Xin asked curiously, looking at the building block toys in front of her and the simple concept draft on the projection screen.</p>
<p>Although Chen Xu hadn't fully explained the detailed content of the concept draft yet,</p>
<p>Qin Yi and the others had already identified some characteristics of this game, titled "Minecraft."</p>
<p>First, in terms of art, the game adopts a pixel style.</p>
<p>All things in the game are essentially composed of pixels and can be destroyed.</p>
<p>For example, if the basic pixel block in the game is 1x1, then a huge stone might be composed of four 1x1 blocks.</p>
<p>The same applies to other objects.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, isn't the content of 'Minecraft' too simple? I'm not talking about the extended combinatorial content in the game, but the overall direction of the game itself." Qin Yi took over from Yang Xin, organized his words, and continued.</p>
<p>Qin Yi didn't explicitly state the rest, but everyone present understood his meaning.</p>
<p>That is, compared to "Don't Starve," "Minecraft" didn't seem to have a clear gameplay objective.</p>
<p>"Moreover, Mr. Chen, a large number of sandbox games are likely to be launched soon." Zhang Yida said, this being the most concerning point for him as head of operations.</p>
<p>It was also a very critical core issue.</p>
<p>Other game developers wanted to capitalize on the sandbox game trend brought by "Don't Starve."</p>
<p>There might be some mediocre ones, but there could also be some high-quality games that would impact "Minecraft."</p>
<p>Furthermore, there was another very crucial factor: the launch time of "Minecraft," also a sandbox game, was too close to "Don't Starve."</p>
<p>If its quality didn't surpass "Don't Starve," it would also have a certain impact on Nebula Games' reputation.</p>
<p>"And regarding the game's art style, Mr. Chen, why are we using pixel style? It feels a bit strange." Ruan Ningxue, responsible for art, also voiced her confusion.</p>
<p>Pixel art games are actually quite rare nowadays.</p>
<p>After all, pixels often represent retro, and the reason pixel game graphics were adopted in the past was due to limitations of display devices and console memory size.</p>
<p>Moreover, it's genuinely difficult to create a good pixel game, because pixels are essentially bitmap graphics, composed of individual square pixels. To truly do pixel art well, the art team needs to place each pixel one by one, which is actually more troublesome than normal art creation.</p>
<p>So, unless a game's selling point is its era or nostalgia, pixel style is generally not chosen now.</p>
<p>But "Minecraft" chose to use pixel style, which made Ruan Ningxue feel a bit strange.</p>
<p>After all, from the design concept draft, "Minecraft" didn't look like a retro or nostalgia-driven game at all.</p>
<p>Everyone spoke one after another, expressing their doubts.</p>
<p>Clearly, at this time, developing such a sandbox game, and a pixel-style sandbox game at that, left everyone perplexed.</p>
<p>Listening to everyone's words, Chen Xu smiled.</p>
<p>He wasn't bothered by their doubts.</p>
<p>In fact, he thought it was a good thing, as everyone was thinking.</p>
<p>"First, let's recall what I told you before about the core of 'Don't Starve.' Survival provides a strong objective for players, but it's not the game's essence. Creation is the essence of a sandbox game."</p>
<p>"And everything in 'Minecraft' revolves around 'creation' as its most core gameplay."</p>
<p>"This creation isn't just simple building with blocks; it's about using 'Minecraft' as a vehicle to create game mechanics."</p>
<p>"In fact, if other sandbox games concurrently launched all take 'Don't Starve's' survival as a reference point, then they've already gone completely in the wrong direction. They might become excellent survival games or cooperative games, but they won't be excellent sandbox games." Chen Xu said to Qin Yi and the others.</p>
<p>Qin Yi mused, "So, a sandbox game is predicated on creation and freedom, and everything else can be discarded?"</p>
<p>"Precisely, that's the idea. Of course, I wasn't sure before if players would accept this unique sandbox gameplay, so 'Don't Starve' was a trial run. And judging by player feedback and results, it seems quite good."</p>
<p>"As for the art, first, I need to correct a misconception: it's not that 'Minecraft' <em>must</em> adopt a pixel art style, but rather that 'Minecraft' needs to be <em>pixelated</em>! Pixels are sacrificed for freedom and creation, because 'Minecraft's' gameplay dictates that the world must be composed of countless blocks, just like building blocks." Listening to Chen Xu's words, Ruan Ningxue suddenly understood.</p>
<p>These are two completely different concepts. A pixel art game simply means the game is rendered in that art style, but "Minecraft" is different; it needs to pixelate the game world, meaning dividing the game world into individual cubes, which are essentially the pixels in normal pixelation.</p>
<p>The underlying concept is entirely different.</p>
<p>To summarize it simply, a sandbox game like "Don't Starve" is a semi-assembled toy.</p>
<p>When you buy this toy, players need to piece it together, and based on the core assembly.</p>
<p>They can change clothes and colors, but the fundamental base remains unchanged.</p>
<p>"Minecraft," on the other hand, is like modeling clay and sand. On its own, it looks unremarkable, but what it can be molded into, whether beautiful or ugly, depends on the player's creativity.</p>
<p>"Don't Starve" is played within a predetermined set of world rules, while "Minecraft," as its name suggests, is about creating your own world.</p>
<p>The conference room was very quiet; evidently, everyone was still processing Chen Xu's words.</p>
<p>"So that's how it is." Qin Yi nodded deeply.</p>
<p>Judging solely from the design concept draft, Qin Yi felt there was nothing particularly special about "Minecraft."</p>
<p>But after Chen Xu's in-depth explanation, he understood completely.</p>
<p>Although he couldn't be certain whether such a game would be accepted by players and the market,</p>
<p>One thing was certain:</p>
<p>Chen Xu had clearly given "Minecraft" a great deal of thought.</p>
<p>"And pixels aren't necessarily crude; they can also be made beautiful." Chen Xu said, looking at Ruan Ningxue.</p>
<p>Pixel art indeed symbolizes retro.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean it has to be retro.</p>
<p>Can't modern art technology be applied to pixel style?</p>
<p>Of course it can. In his previous life, there was a very famous pixel game that perfectly integrated its technology into pixels, and that was "Octopath Traveler" from SE. Of course, because of SE's pricing, players also nicknamed it "50 Per Square."</p>
<p>The traditional grand narrative and fragmented ensemble storytelling weren't perfect, but its most commendable aspects were arguably the music and the pixel art style combined with modern technology.</p>
<p>Moreover, in his previous life, with various high-definition texture packs and lighting effects applied to "Minecraft," it could still give players a visual experience comparable to AAA-tier games. This shows that pixels don't necessarily equate to outdated graphics.</p>
