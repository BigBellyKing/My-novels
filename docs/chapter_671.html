                <p>Chapter 670: The Most Profound Masterpiece in History (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>From some clues, Zhang Yi also learned the name of this underwater city: Rapture.</p>
<p>Chen Xu had also made some special settings here, leaving behind video data and other easter egg-style foreshadowing. After all, Chen Xu planned for the next installment to be based on the story of the first Rapture, as well as the content of the Burial at Sea DLC.</p>
<p>So, it was natural to leave some foreshadowing appropriately.</p>
<p>In the game, Elizabeth led Booker to the surface of this world and to a lighthouse, not giving Zhang Yi much time to observe the underwater city.</p>
<p>At this moment, Elizabeth seemed to understand something, guiding Booker forward to explore the unknown truth.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was just an illusion, but suddenly Zhang Yi, in the game, felt Elizabeth's gaze held a hint of pity and complexity.</p>
<p>Pushing open the lighthouse door, something astonishing happened. Behind the door was an endless space. Within this space stood countless lighthouses, seemingly identical yet subtly different, and countless different Elizabeths and Bookers.</p>
<p>This was not the world Booker knew, but a place where Elizabeth explained the Multiverse Theory to him.</p>
<p>Each lighthouse represented a different version of the world, and each world contained different Elizabeths and Bookers. What differentiated these worlds were the words: choice.</p>
<p>Constants dictated that every world had the same people or things. Variables caused people to make different choices. Different choices then triggered new, endless variables.</p>
<p>Now, Elizabeth, having unleashed her full power in this world, possessed immense energy. She could freely travel to different worlds and witness their developments.</p>
<p>At this point, she fully understood the meaning of Comstock's words before his death.</p>
<p>And guided by Elizabeth, Zhang Yi, in the game, was completely shocked.</p>
<p>Elizabeth slowly led Booker to reclaim his lost memories, first showing him a scene in a river. It was a baptism, which the church attempted to give Booker to cleanse his sins committed after the Wounded Knee Massacre.</p>
<p>But Booker refused the baptism at the last moment. Afterward, he numbed his guilt with alcoholism. Years later, his wife died in childbirth, pushing him to the brink of depravity, drinking and gambling daily until he was deep in debt.</p>
<p>Until October 8, 1893, Lutece, on behalf of Comstock, found Booker. Lutece offered to clear Booker's debts if he sold his daughter to Comstock. Booker initially agreed but quickly regretted it.</p>
<p>So, as Comstock prepared to leave this world through a tear, Booker pursued him. However, during the struggle, the child's pinky finger was severed by the closing tear. To commemorate this, Booker carved Anna's initials, AD, onto his hand. Years later, Lutece found him again, offering him a chance to get his daughter back, but the side effects of dimension-hopping caused him to lose his memory.</p>
<p>At this point, Zhang Yi understood. Existing in two different worlds, this was why Elizabeth gained her ability to travel through time and space! And Elizabeth was Booker's daughter.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, Booker was both happy and filled with remorse and pain. Happy that Elizabeth was his daughter, and remorseful and pained because Elizabeth had suffered so much over the years due to him.</p>
<p>Booker then proposed an idea: go back in time and kill Comstock, which would change everything. But upon hearing this, Elizabeth showed a sorrowful expression. She repeatedly asked Booker if this was truly what he wanted.</p>
<p>After receiving his answer, Elizabeth pushed open a door. And the world and truth behind that door instantly confirmed Zhang Yi's speculation.</p>
<p>Choices lead to variables. So, what would Booker become if he had accepted the baptism and embraced religion back at Wounded Knee? Why did Comstock seek Booker's child, and not someone else's?</p>
<p>Because Comstock <em>was</em> Booker himself!</p>
<p>If Comstock was to never appear, then the source of it all had to be stopped—and that source was Booker himself!</p>
<p>For countless worlds to have a future free of Comstock, the only way was to kill every Booker before his baptism.</p>
<p>This would sever the possibility of that choice.</p>
<p>“All… must end. Not just in this world, but in all of us.”</p>
<p>Numerous Elizabeths appeared before Booker. Mature, sexy, intellectual – various styles, various ages. Listening to Elizabeth's words, Booker was clearly shocked. He muttered, “Smother him in his crib.”</p>
<p>“Smother… smother… smother…” the surrounding Elizabeths harmonized.</p>
<p>The Elizabeth belonging to Booker looked at him with sorrow: “Before the choice, before you are reborn…”</p>
<p>The preacher beside them then spoke: “My child, by what name do you wish to be known?”</p>
<p>“He is Comstock.”</p>
<p>“He is Booker DeWitt.”</p>
<p>Elizabeths from different worlds embraced Booker’s arms.</p>
<p>“No… I am both.”</p>
<p>Looking at the Elizabeths around him, as if making a decision, Booker relaxed his entire body. Then, the Elizabeths from different worlds pushed Booker’s head into the water.</p>
<p>Just as Comstock drowned, accompanied by various bubbles, it was like when Booker first arrived in Columbia and was pushed into the water for baptism by the preacher.</p>
<p>The game's perspective blurred.</p>
<p>Finally, the entire view plunged into darkness, and the camera shifted to Elizabeths from different worlds in a river. They slowly disappeared. However, Zhang Yi noticed that just as the very last Elizabeth was about to vanish, the game screen froze, transitioning to the credits display.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was still immersed in the story of BioShock Infinite. He needed a moment to recover. The game's plot had completely exceeded his imagination. Even now that the entire mystery was unraveled, he still felt a sense of shock.</p>
<p>He had seen many plot twists in games, like Joel choosing to damn the world to save Ellie in The Last of Us. But never had he experienced something as intense as BioShock Infinite.</p>
<p>The enemy, from beginning to end, was actually Booker himself? Multiverse, Quantum Mechanics, Steampunk, Utopian Religious Theology, Grandfather Paradox… Zhang Yi truly hadn't expected the story of BioShock Infinite to be like this.</p>
<p>And now that the ending had revealed everything, thinking back carefully on his previous gameplay experience, Zhang Yi realized there had been countless hints throughout the game.</p>
<p>For example, the False Shepherd and AD symbols, the mysterious Lutece siblings, and Booker being forced into the water for baptism in Columbia. Even Booker's nosebleed when he first met Comstock, and later the nosebleeds and memory mix-ups caused by traveling through time and space with Elizabeth. All of these had hinted that Booker had already traveled through time from the very beginning.</p>
<p>An incredible game! Absolutely a masterpiece! It was even, in Zhang Yi's opinion, Nebula Games' most profound game to date in terms of story content. This was the thought that came to Zhang Yi's mind. However, after a brief period of awe, Zhang Yi quickly realized something.</p>
<p>Booker was dead, and Elizabeth had also disappeared? Seriously, the father died, and the daughter was gone too? So, what about the next BioShock?</p>
