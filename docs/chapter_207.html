                <p>Chapter 307: First Game Experience (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Amidst the eager anticipation of passionate players,</p>
<p>Chen Xu's official Weibo account, Nebula Games, and NetDragon's official websites all announced content related to the <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code> experience.</p>
<p>However, it wasn't just that players could download the official VR version from the Nebula Games Platform and NetDragon Game Platform.</p>
<p>There was also an offline event.</p>
<p>An Early Access trial conducted with VR internet cafes in major cities across the country.</p>
<p>For online players, Early Access required purchasing the game beforehand, while offline, the VR internet cafes provided a dedicated VR internet cafe exclusive version. Players could use their NetDragon and Nebula Games accounts to log in and play directly, with their account data stored.</p>
<p>Compared to general VR games, <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code> was priced slightly lower.</p>
<p>After all, the game itself had in-app purchases for things like skins, and it was a purely online game with no single-player content.</p>
<p>The price in China was 499 Yuan, and the overseas price was 99 dollars.</p>
<p>As for overseas, there were no similar offline VR internet cafe events, as operating conditions didn't permit it.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Soon, the date arrived at February 1st. This year, the New Year was celebrated relatively late, still about half a month away.</p>
<p>For players who had long been looking forward to <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code>, they couldn't wait to jump into the game and experience it as soon as it unlocked that day.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi and Wang Han, who had already entered their New Year's Holiday, also agreed to head to a VR internet cafe.</p>
<p>They both actually owned VR gaming equipment, but only one unit was at home.</p>
<p>Who would get to play became a crucial factor. Plus, their old friend Song Ren had been quite busy previously, but with the New Year approaching, he had also freed up some time.</p>
<p>So, they decided to take this opportunity to meet up offline, enjoy the game during the day, and then have dinner together in the evening.</p>
<p>“So many people! It seems a lot of them are here to try out <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code>!” After Zhang Yi and the others paid and registered at the front desk, they managed to get a private room with five sleeping pods. In the center of the lobby, there was a huge screen displaying a <code>Warcraft</code> match, apparently a high-ranked game from the PC area of that internet cafe. However, Zhang Yi also noticed a small window next to it, showing a countdown timer for <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code>'s upcoming unlock. It was clear that once this game unlocked, it would take its place as the new featured game.</p>
<p>“Well, it's almost New Year, and lately, this is the only major title that has launched,” Song Ren said, not particularly surprised.</p>
<p>“Alright, alright, stop chatting, hurry up and get on your machines, log in, and wait for the servers to open. Oh, by the way, have you guys bought the game?” Wang Han asked.</p>
<p>“Of course we bought it! How could we not buy Mr. Chen's game?” Song Ren replied.</p>
<p>Wang Yifan and Joey both agreed.</p>
<p>As they chatted, the group entered their gaming pods, eagerly awaiting the game's unlock.</p>
<p>As soon as the time arrived, everyone quickly reacted and entered the game.</p>
<p>Previously, Chen Xu and NetDragon Games had communicated with the Game Department regarding whether the military version could be made available to players, but ultimately, it couldn't be settled.</p>
<p>However, the differences in content between the military version and the player version were primarily reflected in the details.</p>
<p>For example, in Hostage Mode, the defenders could force the hostage to move to a position advantageous to them, which was already a set mechanic.</p>
<p>Additionally, there were no prompts whatsoever in the game. Players wouldn't be notified if they were scanned, or that their position had been exposed.</p>
<p>Heartbeat sensors also wouldn't produce obvious beeping sounds, and the performance of gadgets like breaching rounds, as well as the destructive power experienced by players, was also different.</p>
<p>If these features were truly presented to players, Chen Xu estimated that while players might show initial interest,</p>
<p>They would quickly stop playing. It would primarily serve as a gimmick.</p>
<p>After all, it was too unbalanced. For the attackers, the disadvantages would be numerous.</p>
<p>But that was closer to the realistic situation.</p>
<p>“The game forces you to go through the new player tutorial!” Zhang Yi said in the voice channel.</p>
<p>“Same here. It's just a new player tutorial, won't it be over quickly?” Song Ren replied.</p>
<p>“I've already started!”</p>
<p>Compared to the <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code> of his previous life, Chen Xu had put a lot of effort into the game's guidance.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this was because <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code> wasn't a simple casual game.</p>
<p>The maps were slightly more complex than typical FPS games. For first-time <code>Rainbow Six Siege</code> players who didn't consult any map guides, getting lost was commonplace.</p>
<p>Coupled with the various Operator skills, it was quite challenging to pick up.</p>
<p>Therefore, when players entered the game, they would undergo a new player training session.</p>
<p>In addition, the game had a built-in information system.</p>
<p>Demonstration videos of each Operator's skill effects, layered maps of relevant locations, and camera positions.</p>
<p>This made it easier for players to understand this content within the game.</p>
<p>Song Ren had also entered the game tutorial ahead of the others.</p>
<p>There were eleven Operators, but currently, only the Recruit was available.</p>
<p>So there wasn't much choice.</p>
<p>He entered the game tutorial.</p>
<p>“Shooting, running, crouching, prone, stealth walk, fast roping... you can even breach windows like this!”</p>
<p>Song Ren watched as his in-game character pushed off a wall, swung backward with a rope, kicked a wooden board, and breached the window. He was visibly excited by the display.</p>
<p>Such scenes, usually only seen in movies, combined with the feedback from the VR perspective, were unbelievably cool!</p>
<p>Other operations generally posed no major problems.</p>
<p>The only point was that in this game, the character's running and walking movements were quite sluggish.</p>
<p>But thinking about it, it was quite realistic. After all, carrying tens of pounds of counter-terrorism gear, how could one not be sluggish?</p>
<p>“So this is how attackers play, start with a small drone, enter the building, and begin scouting and gathering info.”</p>
<p>“Hey, if I get scanned, will I be discovered? Does that mean if someone scans me, I'll get a notification?”</p>
<p>Seeing the notification screen that appeared after his drone, which had squeezed through a door crack, scanned an enemy and was immediately destroyed by an AI, Song Ren suddenly realized.</p>
<p>The overall new player tutorial didn't delve into overly deep content, primarily focusing on basic common knowledge.</p>
<p>Controls, information gathering and feedback for attackers and defenders, the functions of different equipment, how Operator skills are activated, and how to achieve victory in the three different modes.</p>
<p>With a total of five new player tutorial levels, and not being new to FPS games, Song Ren quickly completed them.</p>
<p>He then unlocked the selection qualification for 10 Operators, five attackers and five defenders.</p>
<p>He didn't really know which ones were good, so aside from Ying for the attackers and Lau Sing (Lesion) for the defenders, whom he set as mandatory choices,</p>
<p>Even though Lesion's real name was Liao Zilang, combining it with the English name Lau Sing just sounded so much catchier.</p>
<p>For the remaining slots, he just picked randomly.</p>
<p>For instance, he chose Blackbeard, Ash, and Sledge, who had left a deep impression on him from previous promotional videos. As for the last one, he wasn't particularly fond of shield-wielding characters, so he finally set his sights on a Russian character.</p>
<p>Fuze, according to his description, was all about explosives. His Operator skills and equipment were all related to explosives, clearly a fierce firepower output point, a perfect match for him.</p>
<p>“You guys haven't finished the tutorial yet?” After selecting his Operators, a moment of silence fell over the voice channel, and Song Ren asked, a little frustrated.</p>
<p>“Not yet, I'm only on the third level!”</p>
<p>“Just reached the fourth level! The game's sense of immersion is really strong! And destroying houses is especially fun!”</p>
<p>Everyone's comments made Song Ren feel a bit glum.</p>
<p>The fastest one was only starting the fourth level?</p>
<p>“Then I'll go try out Terrorist Hunt Mode to get some practice. Call me when you guys are ready!” Song Ren said.</p>
<p>Waiting around was a bit boring, so he decided to play some Terrorist Hunt Mode.</p>
<p>From the description, it seemed to be the game's PVE mode, and it could be played solo, which was perfect for waiting for his friends.</p>
<p>As for the information station?</p>
<p>He never consulted that stuff when playing games!</p>
<p>Did a veteran FPS player need it?</p>
<p>“Normal, Hard, Realistic? I'll try a round on Realistic.”</p>
<p>Looking at the selectable options, Song Ren thought for a moment and decided to try a Lone Wolf Terrorist Hunt on Realistic difficulty.</p>
<p>He wanted to see just how realistic this difficulty truly was.</p>
