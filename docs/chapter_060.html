                <p>Chapter 60: Players Always Misunderstand Me!</p>
<p>Online discussions about <em>Outlast</em> continued.</p>
<p>How long this fire surrounding <em>Outlast</em> could burn ultimately depended on how long it could sustain itself on live streaming platforms.</p>
<p>Because relying solely on the game's inherent horror quality, expecting <em>Outlast</em> to maintain its massive popularity was unrealistic.</p>
<p>At the same time, some game developers and designers online had rumored plans to develop similar horror games.</p>
<p>Clearly, they were preparing to piggyback on the wave of horror enthusiasm <em>Outlast</em> had brought.</p>
<p>As for the genre, there was no need to even think about it; most would uniformly be escape-style gameplay with no combat system.</p>
<p>Chen Xu didn't pay too much attention to this.</p>
<p>Because the development of <em>Outlast</em> was not originally in Chen Xu's plans before this.</p>
<p>Had he not happened to draw an item that could convert Emotion Points at the time, Chen Xu wouldn't have planned to develop this game.</p>
<p>“In terms of time, two months is a bit too rushed.” Chen Xu checked the date, calculating in his mind.</p>
<p>Truly large-scale games and VR games, as before, were temporarily not being considered.</p>
<p>There was still a lack of capital.</p>
<p>Additionally, due to the approaching New Year, even if he wanted to develop a medium-sized game, it would have to wait until after the New Year to launch.</p>
<p>During this period, Chen Xu also planned to recruit some talents from headhunters who could be responsible for aspects other than game development.</p>
<p>Besides that, there was the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>From a functional perspective, the Nebula Game Store's various features were actually quite comprehensive at present.</p>
<p>Store, Inventory, Community, Friends, and Comments, including the Creative Workshop found on the Steam Platform in his previous life, were all available.</p>
<p>Of course, some interfaces, such as recommendation-related UI, hadn't been implemented yet, as there were only three games in total: <em>Outlast</em>, <em>To the Moon</em>, and <em>Undertale</em>.</p>
<p>The platform was already mature; the key was the lack of a player user base.</p>
<p>Currently, Nebula Games Platform had only sold a total of 15,000 copies of its games.</p>
<p>As for daily active users, it was less than 1,000 people.</p>
<p>However, despite the dismal numbers, Chen Xu still held high hopes for the platform.</p>
<p>“Funds are not a problem for now; it's almost time to start focusing on the platform.” Chen Xu mused.</p>
<p>To accumulate platform users most quickly, an exclusive strategy was clearly the most effective.</p>
<p>Major game developers and channels both domestically and internationally actually had related exclusive strategies.</p>
<p>However, this method certainly didn't suit the current Nebula Games.</p>
<p>He had some money, but the capital gap with major game developers was still significant.</p>
<p>If he were to truly employ an exclusive strategy, he would inevitably have to launch games that were sufficiently attractive.</p>
<p>But the key issue was that launching such types of games at this time would definitely be benefiting other game developers.</p>
<p>After all, gameplay wasn't protected, and the many multiplayer online games from his previous life that focused on gameplay creativity were Chen Xu's ultimate weapons.</p>
<p>Using them now wouldn't be attacking others, but rather attacking himself.</p>
<p>'Multi-channel, buy-to-play, discounted price, pass binding, multiplayer online.'</p>
<p>Sitting in front of the computer, Chen Xu pondered for a long time, then picked up a signature pen beside him and wrote a few keywords in his notebook.</p>
<p>This was the definition he gave to the new game he was planning to develop.</p>
<p>Channels, needless to say, Nebula Games was not suitable for an exclusive approach at the moment.</p>
<p>Buy-to-play was to complement the discounted price, better enticing players to visit the Nebula Games Platform for purchases.</p>
<p>As for pass binding, it meant that if players purchased the upcoming new game on other platforms, they would have to register a Nebula Games pass account for authentication.</p>
<p>This might indeed lose a group of players who found it troublesome, and some channels even prohibited this account linking model.</p>
<p>However, it was still very important for the early user accumulation of Nebula Games.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether they made a purchase, or even if players only registered without downloading the platform, at least they would be tricked into registering a pass first.</p>
<p>Multiplayer online was to better ensure this mode, allowing players to engage in cross-platform multiplayer.</p>
<p>As for project selection, this game would also not be very large in scale.</p>
<p>After all, it was an exploratory game.</p>
<p>Coupled with the fact that this year's Spring Festival was relatively late, with New Year's Eve falling on February 11th.</p>
<p>Two months was enough time to develop a small-budget game.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Sitting in front of the computer, having set a plan for the broad development direction, Chen Xu came out of the office to get some fresh air and also to consider which game to choose for the next new project.</p>
<p>After all, there was a relatively wide range of options.</p>
<p>It was already after working hours, and some employees who hadn't gone home for lunch greeted Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Chen Xu nodded in response to each of them. Looking at the office area, Chen Xu also wondered if it was time to expand.</p>
<p>He hadn't felt it when there were fewer people, but now with the R&amp;D department and other departments together, the office space was a bit crowded, with each workstation simply separated by partition boards.</p>
<p>However, this thought had just arisen and before he could think further, he was interrupted by Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue, who came over.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, you've been made into a meme,” Ruan Ningxue said with a smile.</p>
<p>“No, more accurately, what our Mr. Chen said has been made into a meme,” Yang Xin said, holding up her phone.</p>
<p>Chen Xu glanced at it, a little speechless.</p>
<p>Yang Xin's phone showed a screenshot that had been Photoshopped.</p>
<p>The content of the image was a screenshot of <em>Outlast</em>'s protagonist doing 'abdominal exercises' for the Scissors Doctor, with a line written next to it: “I am the Warrior of Love!”</p>
<p>Yang Xin slid the screen, and a new meme appeared: a screenshot of the Fat Security Guard Uncle losing his head.</p>
<p>Of course, the image had a mosaic blur, and a line of text accompanied it: “I am also the Warrior of Love!”</p>
<p>“That meme hasn't died down yet?” Chen Xu was a little speechless, but also slightly amused.</p>
<p>“Of course not! If any <em>Outlast</em> player doesn't know this meme, they'd be shaming their own terrifying experience!” Ruan Ningxue said, grinning.</p>
<p>“Exactly!” Yang Xin echoed.</p>
<p>“Who told you to give such a definitive explanation back then, Mr. Chen!” Ruan Ningxue pulled up Chen Xu's previous official Weibo post.</p>
<p>The likes had already exceeded 500,000, and there were over 70,000 comments.</p>
<p>“Players always misunderstand me!” He said, but Chen Xu's face still held a cheerful expression, and a thought flashed through his mind.</p>
<p>“Hmm, I've decided! I need to prove my 'Warrior of Love' label. The next game will be a truly wholesome game.” Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue looked surprised: “Mr. Chen, a new project so soon? What type of game is it!?”</p>
<p>“A truly wholesome game? Mr. Chen, you're not going to use that <em>Outlast</em>-style rhetoric again, are you?” Yang Xin expressed suspicion.</p>
<p>“Don't rush, I'll ponder it for a couple of days and tell you once the game content is finalized. But the scope won't be very large. It just so happens that this year's Spring Festival and Valentine's Day fall together, so I'll present players with a very suitable game for the occasion.” Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
