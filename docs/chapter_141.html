                <p>Chapter 240: Players' Various Speculations (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>The message posted by Chen Xu on Nebula Games' official Weibo account was very simple.</p>
<p>It was just a character concept art.</p>
<p>However, the character in this Concept Art wasn't a typical human, but a dragon. With four legs and two wings, a head adorned with massive white horns extending outwards, and an incredibly colossal body covered in menacing, deadly thorns, it sent shivers down one's spine. Its huge wings covered its shoulders, folded, and its dark black and dark purple scales revealed the brutal nature of this evil dragon.</p>
<p>The overall design was incredibly domineering and full of oppressive power.</p>
<p>Below this image, Chen Xu also published a piece of text describing the creature:</p>
<p>'Nergigante: A large Elder Dragon monster, characterized by countless sharp black spikes growing all over its body and extremely thick, sturdy horns, possessing an incredibly strong desire to attack and a ferocious, violent temperament, an Elder Dragon species with overwhelming power.'</p>
<p>'Furthermore, Nergigante possesses extremely powerful regenerative abilities, and in order to maintain these abilities, it requires a vast amount of energy. To this end, Nergigante seeks to prey on monsters containing high-purity energy, though in reality, all living creatures are Nergigante's prey. Based on this, rumors of the "Elder Dragon of Destruction" emerged, hence it is also known as Nergigante.'</p>
<p>Below the official Weibo account, many players were stunned.</p>
<p>Because generally, shouldn't the promotional target of a game be its protagonist?</p>
<p>Why was this a dragon?</p>
<p>Could it be that in the new game, players would be playing as this entity called Nergigante?</p>
<p>If judged by Nergigante's description, would this game involve controlling this monster called Nergigante, hunting various creatures everywhere?</p>
<p>Big fish eat small fish?</p>
<p>What was going on?</p>
<p>Seeing this Weibo post from Chen Xu, many players were quite bewildered.</p>
<p>"What's going on? What exactly is Chen Xu's new game? They released one Concept Art, and I can't guess it at all!"</p>
<p>"See, I told you! Mr. Chen is getting better at fooling people! Before, attending the gameplay Expo at least meant a decent promotional trailer, but now we're dismissed with just a single piece of Concept Art!"</p>
<p>"It's time to bring out that meme again!"</p>
<p>"Big bro upstairs, Mr. Chen has too many memes! Are you talking about this one (Warrior of Love.jpg), or this one (Will you Link the Fire?.jpg), or maybe this one (It's being made, it's almost released.jpg)?"</p>
<p>"23333333 (laughter), Mr. Chen has so many memes!"</p>
<p>"I seriously suspect Mr. Chen is tricking us again, just like before, and he hasn't even created a folder for this!"</p>
<p>"By the way, I have a bold, but not necessarily correct, conjecture: Could the new game be a Souls series game? Telling the story before Linking the Fire? After all, Gwyn, the Witch, and others defeated the Ancient Dragons, but we don't know how they defeated them. And this Nergigante could very well be one of the Ancient Dragons. In the new game, we'll control Ancient Dragons to fight against Gwyn, Nito, and the Witch at their peak."</p>
<p>"Big bro, your conjecture is too bold and definitely wrong! Haven't you noticed? This dragon's art style is completely different from the Dark Souls series! Dark Souls' art style leans towards European and American dark fantasy realism, but this Nergigante clearly has an Eastern-flavored fantasy realism style, so it definitely isn't a Dark Souls series game!"</p>
<p>As Chen Xu's Weibo post went live, many players engaged in all sorts of speculation.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu soon released a second piece of Concept Art.</p>
<p>The content was very simple, still featuring the Nergigante from before, but this time, in the same scene, a human appeared.</p>
<p>It was a hunter, clad in armor and wielding a Longsword longer than himself, confronting the Nergigante.</p>
<p>At the same time, on this piece of Concept Art, players finally understood the name of his new game: Monster Hunter: World.</p>
<p>With the release of this second Concept Art, it clearly brought more content and drew more players into the discussion.</p>
<p>"Monster Hunter? Holy crap, is this a hunting game!?"</p>
<p>"Wait! A hunting game? Does that mean this Nergigante fellow is our target in the game!?"</p>
<p>"It wouldn't really be a Souls-like game, would it?"</p>
<p>"My feelings are very complex right now!"</p>
<p>"So it's changed from 'Will you Link the Fire?' to 'Will you hunt?'"</p>
<p>"The first Concept Art was a dragon, and the second only showed a hunter. Don't you think this is a hint? Hinting that the dragon is the protagonist, and the hunter we play is the prey?"</p>
<p>"I think there's a possibility. Look at the game title, do you think it could be understood this way? 'Monster (noun) Hunts (verb) Man (noun)'"</p>
<p>"Holy crap, that's a divine way to interpret Monster Hunter, but I have to say it's really vivid!"</p>
<p>When many players saw this second Concept Art, the impression of 'suffering' immediately came to mind.</p>
<p>Especially after previous titles featured Seath the Scaleless, the Nameless King riding a dragon, and Black Dragon Kalameet.</p>
<p>Many players thought, 'Could this really be a Souls-like game?'</p>
<p>After all, Nebula Games' previous major titles were just two Dark Souls games!</p>
<p>Regarding this, many players online were a little excited, and a little scared.</p>
<p>After all, Dark Souls had left an incredibly deep impression on them.</p>
<p>Including the phrase, 'Will you Link the Fire, big bro?', which had already become a meme.</p>
<p>Of course, more masochistic players were cheering and reveling at this moment. Although it was no longer a story about Linking the Fire,</p>
<p>wasn't hunting essentially the same?</p>
<p>"Here it comes, here it comes, a Souls-like game!"</p>
<p>"It's finally here! Do you know how I've spent this past year? I don't feel right unless I'm being tortured!"</p>
<p>"I'm a bit impatient now. I heard it also utilizes Nebula Games' latest AI technology!"</p>
<p>"The previous 'Die Hard Mode' felt like it had improved a bit, but there wasn't much difference, right?"</p>
<p>Many players were extremely excited.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, to many people's surprise, Chen Xu released another official Weibo post.</p>
<p>'I understand the enthusiasm of players online, but here I want to say that Monster Hunter: World is not a Souls-like game. It is purely a co-op hunting game.'</p>
<p>'The main gameplay involves using various weapons, traversing through jungles with your hunter companions to hunt dragon-like creatures, collecting materials from them to craft better weapons and armor, and finally uncovering the truth about the Elder Dragons.'</p>
<p>'So, I emphasize again, Monster Hunter: World is not a so-called Souls-like game. Therefore, players who are expecting a Souls-like game experience might be disappointed.'</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games, Chen Xu looked at the various comments online and sent out an official Weibo post to clarify.</p>
<p>It was very necessary to make a statement regarding the online discussions among players.</p>
<p>After all, as a designer full of passion and care for players, he certainly had to clear up players' misunderstandings!</p>
<p>Believing Monster Hunter: World was a Souls-like game, only to go in and find it completely different from what they imagined—how disappointed would those players be?</p>
<p>Same old~</p>
