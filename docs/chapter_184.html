                <p>Chapter 283: Esports Planning and New Version Plan (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>In the period after "Warcraft" was launched.</p>
<p>Aside from the game's story, which attracted some regular players,</p>
<p>Many players who were passionate about RTS gameplay were also researching the gameplay and content of "Warcraft."</p>
<p>Not inferior to "Warcraft"'s single-player story, the RTS gameplay content of this game was discovered by many players to be far more complex than they imagined.</p>
<p>Initially, most players generally just continuously recruited units, recruited heroes, then teched up and pushed all-out.</p>
<p>As for anything else, they were completely clueless.</p>
<p>But as players gradually understood more, many master RTS players, targeting the game's characteristics, discovered the impact of high-level heroes on the battle situation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, heroes could use items, and some simple tactics were invented, such as letting small units accompany heroes to level up in the early game to quickly increase their hero levels.</p>
<p>At the same time, there were also some targeted gameplay strategies. For example, the Orc Blademaster, with Wind Walk, could go into the enemy's base to harass their Peasants.</p>
<p>They would follow enemy leveling parties and then use Wind Walk's bonus damage to last-hit and steal experience and treasures.</p>
<p>And to counter early-game harassment from Blademasters and faster-moving Demon Hunters, some players also discovered the mysteries of base building in "Warcraft." For instance, they would wall off the path to the gold mine, preventing harassment.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games' office, Chen Xu was testing the "Warcraft" Map Editor.</p>
<p>Just then, a knock came at the office door. After receiving the notification, Lin Rou walked in.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, Shark TV contacted us, saying they hope to acquire authorization for a 'Warcraft' esports event," Lin Rou said to Chen Xu.</p>
<p>"Esports event? Tell me more," Chen Xu asked, slightly startled by Lin Rou's words.</p>
<p>Esports events were actually part of Chen Xu's plan.</p>
<p>It was just that Chen Xu hadn't considered it at this stage.</p>
<p>The main reason was that the skill levels of "Warcraft" players were still inconsistent.</p>
<p>Hosting a "Warcraft" tournament, to be honest, didn't have much prestige.</p>
<p>Moreover, for players, it was currently more of an exploratory phase, and the viewership wasn't that strong.</p>
<p>Because RTS is a rather special type among esports titles.</p>
<p>If you understand it, it's definitely the most spectacular to watch.</p>
<p>But if you don't understand it, you'll be completely lost.</p>
<p>Because for esports titles like FPS and MOBA, even if you don't understand the intricacies,</p>
<p>You can still grasp the simplest information, like a solo kill, or a 1 HP player counter-killing a 100 HP player.</p>
<p>But what about RTS?</p>
<p>This involves macro management.</p>
<p>For example, if a hero dies once, some players immediately call GG; if a few Peasants die, they immediately call GG;</p>
<p>Players who understand the game mechanics know that this is very normal.</p>
<p>Because they've fallen too far behind, and this time is enough for the opponent to accumulate a huge advantage and macro them to death.</p>
<p>But for players who don't understand, it feels bewildering. They have no idea about the tactics. In their eyes, one side just lost a hero and three units, then suddenly surrendered. They might even suspect match-fixing.</p>
<p>In Chen Xu's opinion, launching an RTS tournament at this stage wasn't a good idea.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the Parallel World, the esports industry wasn't as underdeveloped as one might think; on the contrary, it was quite prosperous.</p>
<p>Third-party event organizers, various sponsorship channels, and standardized clubs and guilds were all very well-established.</p>
<p>This led to quite a few titles in the RTS esports sector.</p>
<p>Even though "Warcraft" was very popular, did someone already want to run an esports event just after its launch?</p>
<p>With this doubt, Chen Xu listened to Lin Rou's explanation, then suddenly realized.</p>
<p>"Shark TV wants to host a platform event?" Chen Xu looked at Lin Rou.</p>
<p>It was simple: the live streaming platform saw that "Warcraft" was very popular, and there were many signed RTS master players on the platform. So, they wanted to buy a platform event authorization from Nebula Games to host a Shark TV "Warcraft" Monthly Tournament, where Shark TV's signed streamers would compete.</p>
<p>As for sponsorship, prize money, and operations, Shark TV would handle everything. Nebula Games would act as a supervisor, taking a look now and then, and just collecting money.</p>
<p>To put it plainly, the platform wanted to host an event under the guise of competition. As for the content, it was similar to early esports internet cafe tournaments.</p>
<p>There were no offline audiences or offline venues.</p>
<p>"You contact the people at Shark TV. We can discuss this. However, we should also establish a dedicated department here to learn about the relevant content and the intricacies involved," Chen Xu thought for a moment and said to Lin Rou.</p>
<p>Chen Xu also valued the esports sector quite a bit.</p>
<p>Not for the money or the revenue from hosting competitions.</p>
<p>What Chen Xu cared about most was the promotion such esports events provided for the game.</p>
<p>When a game has a suitable 'pond,' esports can be an excellent way to solidify player stickiness and IP value.</p>
<p>For example, games like "League of Legends" and "DOTA" in his past life, even if player numbers decreased, the overall IP value of the games didn't fall at all.</p>
<p>Because many players would still watch matches even if they didn't play the game. For "Warcraft," cultivating such IP value was clearly very necessary.</p>
<p>Of course, one point to grasp was that third-party events and official events should advance simultaneously.</p>
<p>Like Blizzard in his past life, if you said they had the ability, they'd want to hog everything, leading to StarCraft 2's falling out with third-party organizers during its golden era, completely messing up a good hand.</p>
<p>But if you said they lacked ability, for games with continuously declining popularity like Overwatch, the clubs and events were still run well, even to the point where everyone had a sustainable livelihood.</p>
<p>This cooperation with Shark TV, besides further promoting the game, also made Chen Xu want to cultivate Nebula Games' internal understanding of the esports industry.</p>
<p>After all, in the future, Nebula Games would inevitably develop games of this type.</p>
<p>And these types of competitive games, if operated well, are basically evergreen.</p>
<p>As for how Shark TV would actually host the first 'internet cafe tournament' for "Warcraft," they would discuss it slowly later.</p>
<p>After finishing his conversation with Lin Rou, Chen Xu also sent a message in the work group chat.</p>
<p>He asked HR to see if there were any employees willing to transfer positions, as well as to recruit new staff.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, are we going to host esports tournaments?" After discussing with Lin Rou, Chen Xu stretched a bit and walked towards the project room. Seeing Chen Xu arrive, everyone seemed a bit curious.</p>
<p>"We're just giving authorization for Shark TV to organize it. Our own direct department will learn from the experience. Even if we officially host events later, it will mostly be handed over to third parties. We just need to understand this area and know how to operate competitive games," Chen Xu shook his head and said.</p>
<p>"Speaking of which, 'Warcraft' certainly meets the conditions for hosting tournaments now," Qin Yi said.</p>
<p>"Warcraft" has been online for some time now, having passed its initial stage, and player skill levels have gradually differentiated.</p>
<p>Coupled with "Warcraft"'s popularity domestically, it has essentially crushed other RTS games.</p>
<p>Therefore, there have been rumors among major clubs that they will transform their other RTS game divisions into "Warcraft" divisions.</p>
<p>With the influx of other professional RTS players, there are certainly no shortage of so-called master players.</p>
<p>"Alright, enough talk. You've all had enough rest. Get ready for the 'Warcraft' new version planning," Chen Xu said with a smile, looking at them.</p>
<p>He took out a document that had been printed long ago.</p>
<p>"Uh! New version planning!?" Everyone was surprised. Was a new version going to be released so soon?</p>
<p>However, when they saw the document in front of them, they were even more bewildered.</p>
<p>What was this matching what?</p>
<p>'Defend the Sword Pass,' 'Pyramid Escape,' 'Demon Hunter Chronicles,' 'Monopoly of the World,' 'Calamity of the Western World'—what are these?</p>
<p>How did "Warcraft" get involved with pyramids and the Sword Pass?</p>
