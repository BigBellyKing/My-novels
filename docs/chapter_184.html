                <p>Chapter 183: The Difference Between Reality and Imagination (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Having clearly realized that the Catacombs were not a map suitable for the early game, coupled with his accidental lighting of a bonfire, he found himself in a dead end.</p>
<p>At first, Song Ren still wanted to salvage the situation, trying to see if he could find a way out.</p>
<p>After all, having played the previous Dark Souls game, he was quite familiar with the Dark Souls series.</p>
<p>That is, whether it was the BOSSes or the Level Design in the game.</p>
<p>Although it was certainly frustrating for players, tormenting them to the point of tears.</p>
<p>However, it wasn't completely unsolvable; if the original path was impassable, and given that the Catacombs appeared early in the game, there must be a way from the Catacombs to other areas or back to Firelink Shrine.</p>
<p>Therefore, with the last shred of dignity as a veteran Firelinker, Song Ren decided to investigate further.</p>
<p>After wandering around in the pitch-black Catacombs for a long time and experiencing countless deaths, Song Ren finally decided on one thing: to face reality.</p>
<p>It's time to honestly start over!</p>
<p>Song Ren had fully felt the malicious design of this game.</p>
<p>Up until now, besides the demon BOSS at the beginning that could be defeated by environmental kills, he hadn't seen any real major BOSSes, let alone renowned gods like Gwyn, Nito, the Witch, and Seath the Scaleless.</p>
<p>The terrain and the mobs alone had given him countless stern warnings.</p>
<p>Out of that last bit of remaining 'pride,' he started a new save file. Although he knew the Knight class was frustrating to start with, Song Ren resolutely chose it, and for his starting item, he still picked the Master Key, whose use he hadn't yet figured out.</p>
<p>With previous experience, the path through the Undead Asylum was very easy. In less than five minutes, he collected everything he could and arrived back at Firelink Shrine.</p>
<p>The only thing that made Song Ren feel somewhat better was that in online mode, the numerous bloodstains on the ground indicated that many other players were suffering alongside him.</p>
<p>He even saw quite a few bloodstains on the ground within Firelink Shrine itself.</p>
<p>Clicking on them, he was even amused.</p>
<p>Because upon examining these bloodstains, it was clear that these players hadn't been killed by monsters or provoked the Crestfallen Warrior in the shrine; they had fallen to their death within the shrine.</p>
<p>This was because there were many items emitting white light in the shrine, but some were located quite high off the ground, amidst crumbling ledges, and one misstep would send you falling.</p>
<p>And for a Firelinker, falling was arguably the greatest threat.</p>
<p>Even in the previous game, even with trainers enabled, fall damage was still a major threat.</p>
<p>After enjoying a wave of various abnormal deaths from the rookie players in Firelink Shrine, Song Ren wandered around for ten minutes. He finally arrived at a tunnel resembling a cave. After killing a few Skeleton Soldiers and some rats in the sewers, a new world unfolded before Song Ren: he had reached a new map called Undead Burg Outskirts, the very map Zhang Yi had mentioned to him earlier.</p>
<p>At the entrance were just two Hollows armed with shields and axes. Compared to the hordes of Skeleton Soldiers in the gloomy Catacombs, this scene felt like heaven.</p>
<p>"This really is the right path, isn't it? What was I doing before...?" Song Ren looked at the new map before him, feeling as though tears were about to fall.</p>
<p>Clearly, the previous map was entirely Chen Xu's malicious design, intentionally placing several high-level maps right next to the spawn point to trick players into entering.</p>
<p>And upon closer thought, Song Ren felt even more frustrated.</p>
<p>He didn't know what the New Londo Ruins, which Zhang Yi had mentioned earlier, looked like, because he hadn't found them yet.</p>
<p>But the Catacombs were absolutely frustrating!</p>
<p>Along the way, the skeletons in the graveyard served as the first line of defense; the exploding skulls and Skeleton Soldiers on the stepped path into the cave were the second line of defense; the skeletons on the path after rolling down the stairs into the Catacombs proper were the third line of defense; and finally, the Lantern Hollow that immediately shot fireballs as players approached the bonfire was the ultimate deterrent.</p>
<p>New players would typically die on the way and then return to Firelink Shrine.</p>
<p>Only some veteran Undead who had played the previous game would, with high probability, enter and light the bonfire.</p>
<p>So this high-level area right next to Firelink Shrine was clearly designed to target veteran players!</p>
<p>With these thoughts, Song Ren began exploring the new map.</p>
<p>However, with further exploration, Song Ren quickly discarded any thoughts of 'heaven' he previously held.</p>
<p>Because, whether it was his illusion or not, the minor mobs in Undead Burg were far more 'enthusiastic' than the mobs on the High Wall of Lothric.</p>
<p>He didn't even need to get close; simply approaching slightly, these minor mobs would rush at him with knives and axes, like enthusiastic villagers.</p>
<p>And they'd immediately launch a combo attack; getting hit even once would leave him either dead or crippled.</p>
<p>Before playing, Song Ren had an impressive and sophisticated image of himself in his mind.</p>
<p>Elegant rolling, sharp backstabs, swift parrying.</p>
<p>With a flick of his wrist, he'd slice and dice, eliminating every obstacle on the Firelinking path.</p>
<p>But in reality, it was all the opposite!</p>
<p>Moreover, Song Ren noticed that the mobs in this Undead Burg were much more agile than in the previous game.</p>
<p>Even in the corridor ahead, after lighting the first bonfire, Song Ren encountered a Black Knight wielding a sword and shield.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that in the previous game, the Black Knight first appeared in a small room beneath the Road of Sacrifices, and wasn't the type to block your path.</p>
<p>But now, this Black Knight had directly replaced the role of the Lothric Knight from the previous game, becoming a roadblock in such a narrow corridor that could only fit one person?</p>
<p>"Maybe its attributes have been nerfed?"</p>
<p>Song Ren guessed, and as an excellent Undead, he had fought Black Knights in the previous game.</p>
<p>Dealing with an old acquaintance should be easy to handle, right?</p>
<p>He locked on, approached, stabbed once, and the health bar above its head dropped a tiny bit.</p>
<p>Then the Black Knight turned and continuously slashed.</p>
<p>He raised his shield to block, and his stamina bar instantly vanished.</p>
<p><strong>YOU DIED!</strong></p>
<p>Song Ren, resurrected at a nearby bonfire, returned to the starting point, looking at the motionless Black Knight, and fell silent.</p>
<p>Farewell! Once I get a full Havel's Set and a Black Greatsword, I'll definitely come back and have a proper fight with you.</p>
<p>Having made his bold declaration, he pressed on, narrowly avoiding a powder keg pushed down by a Hollow, and entered a scene resembling a Watchtower. Here, Song Ren discovered his Master Key actually came in handy, opening a door in the Watchtower.</p>
<p>Behind the door was a downward corridor, leading him all the way down.</p>
<p>Reaching the very bottom, Song Ren saw the Havel's Set he had been yearning for.</p>
<p>Only this time, the set was worn by someone else.</p>
<p>And this guy was even wielding a Dragon Tooth.</p>
<p>Killing him didn't even require a second hit; with one swing of the hammer, Song Ren watched his health bar instantly go from full to empty.</p>
<p>Again, those familiar three words: <strong>YOU DIED!</strong></p>
<p>Resurrecting at the bonfire once more, Song Ren decided to take a break. He leaned back in his chair, silently pulled out his phone, and browsed the forum, where he saw a rookie's inquiry post.</p>
<p>'Hey fellow players, can anyone tell me how <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em> compares to the previous work?'</p>
<p>There were no replies yet. Song Ren glanced at the time, pondered his own game experience over the past hour, and silently typed a reply.</p>
<p>'Different details, yet equally exquisite and brilliant map design!'</p>
<p>'Different timelines, yet they offer players the same familiar experience!'</p>
<p>'A must-play sequel for Dark Souls players!'</p>
<p>Looking at his own comment, Song Ren nodded in satisfaction.</p>
<p>Not a single lie.</p>
<p>Starting you off with several high-level maps, full of treacherous traps—isn't that exquisitely brilliant?</p>
<p>Familiar emotions. Look at the '<strong>YOU DIED!</strong>' screen after death—isn't that familiar?</p>
<p>You're already playing Dark Souls, doesn't that mean you came for the masochism? Why not dive into the game and experience the thrill of being thrashed?</p>
