                <h2>Chapter 282: Stay Steady, We Can Win (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</h2>
<p>With the launch of <em>Warcraft</em>, the game's popularity surged.</p>
<p>After all, <em>Warcraft</em> was excellent in every aspect. Whether it was the graphics, the story, or the gameplay, it gave players a sense of novelty and amazement.</p>
<p>Besides its surging popularity, sales also skyrocketed. Especially overseas, <em>Warcraft</em>, despite launching a week later than domestically, still caused quite a stir. After all, the production quality was simply too exquisite; neither domestic nor international RTS games had ever reached <em>Warcraft</em>'s level of quality.</p>
<p>As for sales, <em>Warcraft</em> had already recouped its investment by the first week. Many designers in the gaming industry looked on in astonishment and envy.</p>
<p>Of course, envy was envy, and astonishment was astonishment. But genuinely, not many designers or game developers had the courage to undertake such a project. After all, <em>Warcraft</em> succeeded, but what if it had failed? High risk, high reward, but the risk was too immense; for many game developers, failure would mean eternal damnation.</p>
<p>During the period following <em>Warcraft</em>'s launch, the RTS game market essentially heard only one voice. Both players and media gave the game exceptionally high ratings. Game media and player aggregate reviews consistently hovered around 9.5 points.</p>

<p>All sorts of news articles and topics were related to <em>Warcraft</em>. About its sales performance, its game quality, and its content. For a time, <em>Warcraft</em>'s prominence was unmatched.</p>
<p>In contrast to <em>Warcraft</em>'s glory, Hero Entertainment's <em>Human Wars</em> on the other side was looking rather bleak.</p>
<p>A week after <em>Warcraft</em> launched, <em>Human Wars</em> bit the bullet and released an update regarding its remaster. Originally, this should have been fairly good news. Because before this, <em>Human Wars</em> had announced a free remaster, providing players with a game overhaul and better visual presentation. Along with new version content updates, coupled with <em>Human Wars</em> itself being the number one RTS game domestically before <em>Warcraft</em>, this news had many players excited and expectant.</p>
<p>But that was before; now, it was completely different. Before, everything was just words; no one knew who was bluffing and who was truly impressive. But now, <em>Warcraft</em>'s quality was out in the open. Comparatively, <em>Human Wars</em>' remastered visuals were a bit dismal.</p>
<p>Of course, it was indeed much better than the old version, with some detailed improvements. But the key was that during this period, players' standards had largely been raised by <em>Warcraft</em>. Not only was the CGI exquisitely produced, but <em>Warcraft</em>'s in-game models themselves were also very refined. Faced with the <em>Human Wars</em> remaster, many players' first reaction was to compare it to <em>Warcraft</em>.</p>
<p>But that comparison led to big trouble.</p>
<p>“Although it's free, I still want to say that if you don't want to remaster it, you don't have to.”</p>
<p>“The higher the expectation, the greater the disappointment. What is this?! Compared to <em>Warcraft</em>, it's completely crooked melons and cracked dates!”</p>
<p>“To be fair, <em>Human Wars</em>' remaster is still excellent, focusing on nostalgia. From the remastered graphics, I feel the same way I did when I first played the game five years ago. Thank you, <em>Human Wars</em>, for letting me revisit my childhood memories!”</p>
<p>“Seriously, please release a new version quickly, otherwise, if you drag it out any longer, I feel like I'll never play <em>Human Wars</em> again.”</p>
<p>“+1, <em>Warcraft</em>'s multiplayer battles are also very interesting! Oh, and can someone help me tell <em>Human Wars</em> that I can't go back, and don't look for me, I'm afraid <em>Warcraft</em> might misunderstand.”</p>
<p>The internet was flooded with various feedback. Even fans of <em>Human Wars</em> had to admit that its quality was indeed blown away by <em>Warcraft</em>.</p>
<p>The main reason players reacted so strongly was that <em>Human Wars</em>' attitude had been far too high-profile. Judging by their posture, many players thought <em>Human Wars</em> was going to have an 'Imperial City PK' with <em>Warcraft</em>.</p>
<p>Then, <em>Warcraft</em>'s quality emerged, giving players an incredibly stunning impression, which subconsciously raised expectations for <em>Human Wars</em>' performance. But once it was truly revealed, those expectations immediately plummeted into an abyss.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, inside Hero Entertainment, Zhou Qi was utterly helpless.</p>
<p>Didn't he know the quality couldn't compare? But it was already done, and it was indeed an improvement, so they couldn't just stop updating and pretend to be dead, right? As for a new version? For an RTS game, let alone a major version change, even a slight numerical adjustment could have a significant impact on game balance, not to mention adding various units. It would require slow and careful testing!</p>
<p>“<em>Human Wars</em> feels like it's completely lost!” Yang Hong, the president of Hero Entertainment, sighed in his office.</p>
<p>On his desk sat a row of collectible figures: Tyrande Whisperwind, Sylvanas Windrunner, Illidan's fangirl Lady Vashj, and Maiev Shadowsong. As for why Jaina wasn't there? Because he didn't like her.</p>
<p>Listening to Yang Hong's words, Zhou Qi, sitting beside him, glanced at the figures on the other's desk and hesitated. He desperately wanted to say, 'We are about to fight to the death, why do you surrender first, Boss!' despite the fact that he too had registered a Nebula Games Platform account, bought a copy of <em>Warcraft</em>, and clocked over 30 hours of playtime.</p>
<p>“We've lost half the battle, but not entirely.” Zhou Qi took a deep breath and said.</p>
<p>“Hmm?” Yang Hong looked at Zhou Qi. Although he played <em>Warcraft</em> privately, it didn't mean he didn't want to win. After all, <em>Warcraft</em> was a competitor's game!</p>
<p>“In terms of quality, we can't compare; in terms of story, we can't compare; in terms of gameplay novelty, we also can't compare...” Zhou Qi paused here, feeling a bit awkward himself, “But it still comes down to this: the most important thing for an RTS is balance. <em>Warcraft</em> has only just launched, and players are still in a state of exploration, unfamiliar with the game's mechanics and gameplay.”</p>
<p>“Once everyone understands how to play this game, there will inevitably be controversies regarding balance. That's when <em>Human Wars</em> will have its chance! We'll emphasize the competitive and fair aspects of RTS!” Zhou Qi's voice gradually grew louder.</p>
<p>Yes, they couldn't compete on quality. And the gameplay didn't seem as innovative either. For ordinary players, <em>Warcraft</em>'s appeal completely surpassed that of <em>Human Wars</em>. But this was an RTS game!</p>
<p>However, <em>Human Wars</em> had one major advantage: its excellent balance. In the past, there weren't a few RTS games that tried to challenge <em>Human Wars</em>' position. But in the end, it was <em>Human Wars</em> that had the last laugh. Why? It relied on its balance!</p>
<p>Although <em>Warcraft</em> was a formidable dark horse, there was still a chance. And once balance issues arose, resolving them would take time. Not to mention, an RTS game with such rich mechanics as <em>Warcraft</em> – a balance issue there would ripple through the entire system.</p>
<p>This interim period was <em>Human Wars</em>' crucial opportunity to turn defeat into victory. Stay steady, we can win!</p>
