                <p>Chapter 158: Thoughts on a DEMO Game (Wishing Happy Mid-Autumn Festival in advance, 8 updates, requesting subscriptions, monthly passes)</p>
<p>Upon answering the phone, Chen Xu was even more surprised to find that it was the Minister of the Modu Game Department, with whom he had met a few times before.</p>
<p>“Minister Yang, is there something I can help you with?” Chen Xu asked, getting straight to the point with some curiosity.</p>
<p>“Indeed, there’s quite a significant matter. Did you see the news earlier? Weigu Tech overseas announced a major breakthrough in their new generation VR gaming pod equipment, allowing players to have a more immersive experience,” Yang Chen said over the phone.</p>
<p>“I saw it,” Chen Xu replied.</p>
<p>Regarding this, Chen Xu had seen the industry news Lin Rou collected daily. However, he hadn't paid much attention to it at the time.</p>
<p>The reason was simple: this immersive mode, according to current data, requires players to be completely immersed in the game and maintain a high level of concentration. This also means players are receiving a massive amount of information, leading to greater mental energy consumption compared to regular PC games. As for black technology like the subconscious mind found in SAO from his previous life, which allows players to enter a mental network for deep sleep, it clearly hadn’t been achieved in this Parallel World. Moreover, although the price of VR gaming pods had dropped since their initial release, they were still beyond the reach of most players. Mainstream VR gaming pods generally cost around 50,000 Yuan, which was much more expensive than a PC capable of smoothly running mainstream blockbusters. As for higher-tier VR equipment, there was no need to even mention it. Therefore, most players still played games in VR experience stores, similar to internet cafes. These factors combined meant that VR's market share had not actually surpassed that of PC platforms. Furthermore, the cost of game development for VR was generally higher than for PC. Apart from top-tier developers annually launching dedicated VR games, even second-tier game developers, when releasing VR games, usually tested the waters on the PC platform first, and only after achieving excellent results would they port a VR version. It was precisely for these reasons that Chen Xu had Nebula Games primarily focus on PC platforms for now.</p>
<p>“Domestically, our new generation VR gaming pod equipment has also entered a testing phase.”</p>
<p>“However, we lack games for testing. Additionally, because the new generation VR gaming pod will provide players with a stronger sense of immersion, it also requires multi-faceted safety testing. After all, some games might be fine on PC platforms, but on VR platforms, under an immersive experience, they could give players a special kind of thrill.”</p>
<p>“Of course, some things can’t be explained in a few words over the phone. Please log into the Game Department's official website backend and check the sent mail. If you’re interested, you can come to the Game Department tomorrow afternoon,” Yang Chen told Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Although he wasn't entirely clear on the specifics, after hearing Yang Chen's words, Chen Xu generally had a grasp of the situation. This was clearly a competition in the realm of cutting-edge platform technology. For the Game Department, VR equipment held a different significance, much like consoles in his previous life. In its early years, Nintendo rose to dominance after the Atari crash, and all professionals in the gaming industry had to bow to Nintendo’s will; the royalty system was a product of that era.</p>
<p>After hanging up, Chen Xu logged into the Game Department's official website and quickly understood the situation. It was basically as he had thought.</p>
<p>The next day, in the conference hall of the Game Department building, Chen Xu was a little surprised because quite a number of designers were present. TengHua, NetDragon, and other prominent domestic game developers all had representatives. Among them, Chen Xu also saw some familiar faces, such as the good Teacher Meng.</p>
<p>“Teacher Meng, you’re here too?” Chen Xu went over to greet him.</p>
<p>Meng Zuo, who was chatting with someone, heard the voice and turned to see Chen Xu approaching with a smile. The scene of him holding someone else's trophy that night flashed through his mind again, and he showed an embarrassed but polite smile: “Mr. Chen, you’re here too.”</p>
<p>However, before Chen Xu had time to catch up, Yang Chen from the Game Department stepped onto the stage in the conference room.</p>
<p>“You are all leading figures in the gaming industry, and the purpose of gathering you here this time is actually very simple.”</p>
<p>“The new generation VR gaming equipment has entered a testing phase.”</p>
<p>“At the same time, for this new generation VR equipment, the game engine on the development machine has also undergone special adaptation, opening up a new physics engine architecture.”</p>
<p>As Yang Chen spoke, the designers, including Chen Xu, basically understood the Game Department's intention in convening them. In short, there had been new progress in VR equipment and engine integration. However, it was still some distance from being launched to the market. But overseas, their progress was similar, and they had already started promoting. Naturally, the domestic side couldn’t fall behind, but there was a lack of relevant game content for testing. Of course, it wouldn't be a full game, but more like a game experience DEMO, and it wasn't without benefits. Firstly, there would be special subsidies from the Game Department, and the intellectual property produced would belong to the designers and developers. Simply put, the Game Department would pay for you to create it, and the subsidy amount was substantial. Of course, the quality had to be up to par, and the Game Department would also track the progress in real-time. Naturally, the designers invited were generally above the mid-tier in the domestic industry, and no one would be foolish enough to try to scam subsidies. Secondly, participating in the testing offered another benefit: new technologies would certainly not be immediately promoted to all designers for free. Designers participating in this initiative would receive priority access to relevant permissions. As for designers who did not participate, they would have to spend money for extra resources or permissions, just like before.</p>
<p>After Yang Chen's brief introduction.</p>
<p>The designers were then led by the Game Department staff to the Game Department's research and development park. Under the guidance of the staff, they personally experienced the corresponding effects. Soon, it was Chen Xu's turn.</p>
<p>Upon entering the gaming pod, the scene was an environment resembling a bare shell apartment. Chen Xu also understood the meaning of Yang Chen's earlier words. He had experienced VR gaming pods in this Parallel World before, and while the sense of immersion was strong, there were still some flaws. However, the overall feedback from the new generation VR gaming pod was perfectly flawless. Wearing the haptic feedback suit and gloves, lying in the gaming pod, every action he made received incredibly realistic feedback. Walking, jumping, punching—Chen Xu tried a few movements, and although he felt a certain difference from reality, the feedback he received was almost indistinguishable from it.</p>
<p>“The immersion brought by VR equipment interaction in this world has reached such a level!” Chen Xu exclaimed, exiting the gaming pod with a look of awe.</p>
<p>However, he was also aware of the problems that needed to be addressed. The most direct issue was the negative effects caused by overly strong immersion. Taking <em>Dark Souls</em> as an example, if it were made into a VR game with the level of immersion Chen Xu had just experienced, players would likely not be able to play it, not deterred by the difficulty, but by the immersion itself. Just imagine the rats in the sewers, the eerie scenes in the Irithyll Dungeon, let alone some horror games!</p>
<p>After all the designers present had experienced it, Yang Chen explained the relevant matters to everyone. In short, if the designers present were interested, they could create a DEMO game for the Game Department to test, and then based on the feedback, modifications would be made to the gaming pod's sense of immersion. Because the immersion was too strong, it needed to be toned down in certain areas. It sounded a bit comical and contradictory, but after the actual experience, Chen Xu could understand the meaning of these words.</p>
<p>When it came to the subsequent registration process, besides some game designers who genuinely had ongoing projects and couldn't spare the time, thirteen senior job title designers, including Chen Xu, remained. Meng Zuo was also among them.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, are you planning to participate in the Game Department’s DEMO production this time?” Meng Zuo asked, looking at Chen Xu, who was queuing with him, with some curiosity.</p>
<p>After all, news about a <em>Dark Souls</em> sequel had been rampant online. Shouldn't Chen Xu be busy developing <em>Dark Souls</em>? How could he also take on this task from the Game Department? Could it be that <em>Dark Souls</em>' development progress was too fast and no longer required Chen Xu's oversight? Thinking about it, it didn't seem impossible. After all, with it being a sequel, the foundation was already there, and it was almost an unwritten rule in the gaming industry that sequels could reuse many art assets, greatly saving development time.</p>
<p>Completely unaware that Meng Zuo was once again visualizing things, Chen Xu smiled: “I’m curious, and this is also my first time developing a VR game. Plus, I have some interesting ideas.”</p>
<p>This was indeed true; given such an opportunity, Chen Xu really wanted to give it a try.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Chen Xu’s words, Meng Zuo’s eyes lit up, and he immediately became enthusiastic: “Actually, the design of VR games isn't much different from PC games. The main differences lie in the control modes and the varied perspectives offered by the cameras. While most VR games are first-person, for some specific games and segments, third-person is more suitable, such as action-oriented games focusing on visual effects.”</p>
<p>“Then, Teacher Meng, we can exchange ideas later,” Chen Xu said, looking at the enthusiastic Meng Zuo. He couldn’t help but sigh, Teacher Meng really is a good person!</p>
<p>“Of course.” Meng Zuo smiled happily. His first defeat in the Game Design Competition, his second time being overshadowed at the gameplay Expo, and his third time at Game of the Year, he received no awards, forming a stark contrast with a certain someone who took home trophies. This time, he was finally going to reclaim his glory. Since Chen Xu called him Teacher Meng, this time he would truly act as a teacher!</p>
<p>“Oh right, Mr. Chen, do you have any ideas for a new game?” Meng Zuo asked, remembering something.</p>
<p>“I have an idea for the new game's name: PT,” Chen Xu nodded with a smile.</p>
<p>“PT? What does that mean? It sounds a bit strange,” Meng Zuo asked curiously.</p>
<p>“It’s an acronym for Playable Teaser. After all, this demo can be considered a playable teaser. We can also add a prefix and call it ‘Silent Hill PT’,” Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Silent Hill PT, that sounds quite profound! Then, Mr. Chen, we’ll talk in more detail when the time comes!” Meng Zuo said with a laugh.</p>
<p>“Absolutely,” Chen Xu replied, nodding.</p>
<p><em>Ahem</em>, the chapter title indicated one more update than there actually was; please forgive me, readers, the author doesn't have permission to edit titles. Also, I wish everyone a Happy Mid-Autumn Festival in advance. Tomorrow's update time will be somewhat unstable due to the holiday, but it shouldn't be less than 5 chapters. I’ll try to finish writing about this transitional game, PT. It's mainly because this game is truly a pity; those interested can search for it on Bilibili. It's especially interesting and very heartwarming, and it even offers little pecks of love… Trust me (sincere face).</p>
