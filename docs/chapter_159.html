                <p>Chapter 258: Diablos, I'll Be Back! (Fifth Update, Please Subscribe and Vote for Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>'Speaking of the Fire Dragon and the Horned Dragon, it must be the Rathalos and the Diablos, right?'</p>
<p>'The only path we can take is to hunt those two monsters, to stand at the apex of the ecosystem...!'</p>
<p>Standing next to the bun-haired receptionist, Song Ren accepted the Diablos quest out of the two available.</p>
<p>“Please don't use 'we' like that, okay? From start to finish, you haven't contributed a single bit to hunting dragons, you've just been dragging me down the whole time. That old lady from the Odogaron hunt, she saved you once and you cried and swore you'd never be reckless again, but I've saved you so many times and you still do whatever you want!” Song Ren looked at the bun-haired receptionist's words and finally couldn't help but complain.</p>
<p>He had initially thought this receptionist would be a great helper, but she was completely useless!</p>
<p>Every time he saw her, she was just eating, eating, and eating.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when he returned from the wilderness, he even saw her rummaging through his storage box, chewing on something. He didn't need to be a genius to know she was sneaking snacks.</p>
<p>At that moment, Song Ren recalled how, during the promotion for Monster Hunter: World, Chen Xu's official Weibo account had posted introductions to various types of dragons.</p>
<p>Among them, he remembered a monster called the 'Gluttonous Tyrant,' whose attribute was gluttony, something like a Deviljho.</p>
<p>This bun-haired receptionist of yours is practically a baby Deviljho! Always eating!</p>
<p>Of course, if it were just the eating, that'd be one thing, but the main issue was that she was also an expert monster attractor.</p>
<p>Jagras, Great Jagras, Legiana, Odogaron—go ahead, open up a Deviljho next time!</p>
<p>After accepting the quest and finishing his Felyne Canteen meal, Song Ren arrived at the Wildspire Waste, the Diablos' territory. He couldn't help but sigh deeply as he looked at the bun-haired receptionist beside him.</p>
<p>What a useless eater!</p>
<p>When would he ever encounter a truly competent NPC Hunter teammate?</p>
<p>“Forget it. Just stay put at the base and don't cause me any trouble; that'll be enough.” Song Ren looked at the bun-haired receptionist before him, letting out a sigh of disappointment.</p>
<p>Fully stocked with antidotes and healing potions, Song Ren set off to track down the Diablos.</p>
<p>After a brief detour in the Wildspire Waste, Song Ren quickly triggered a cutscene.</p>
<p>A dragon, fully armored, walked across the sandy terrain towards him.</p>
<p>However, it wasn't the Diablos, but a Barroth—the thick-skinned monster that also flung mud.</p>
<p>Just then, the entire Wildspire Waste began to tremble violently.</p>
<p>Some Hatebirds nearby were startled and flew into the air.</p>
<p>The Barroth ahead also seemed to sense something. Its face contorted in fear as it glanced around, ready to flee.</p>
<p>But in the next moment, the ground beneath the Barroth suddenly broke apart.</p>
<p>A massive monster burst from underground!</p>
<p>Amidst the rolling sand and dust, the monster's colossal figure was vaguely visible.</p>
<p>This was the largest monster Song Ren had seen so far, second only to Zorah Magdaros; even the Nergigante and Rathalos he'd encountered before weren't as big.</p>
<p>Song Ren had originally thought the Barroth was quite large, but compared to the monster before him, it was just a little brother.</p>
<p>It had a massive body, two extremely thick long horns, and armor that looked as hard as rock.</p>
<p>Its tail was forked, like a hammer, giving it a very imposing look.</p>
<p>While Song Ren was still marveling, the Barroth was directly pinned to the ground and dragged by the colossal creature that had burst from underground.</p>
<p>Though the Barroth struggled repeatedly, it was no match for this behemoth.</p>
<p>Then, the Diablos incessantly clawed at the ground, and amidst the swirling sand, both the Barroth and the Diablos vanished before Song Ren.</p>
<p>However, the sandy ground ahead began to collapse, and the hunter in the game frantically scrambled to get out.</p>
<p>But the quicksand relentlessly flowed into the hole, and ultimately, the hunter plummeted heavily into the underground cavern.</p>
<p>Rising from the yellow sand, the hunter coughed while surveying the cavern.</p>
<p>Yellow sand still rustled down from the entrance, forming a sand waterfall that encircled the hunter.</p>
<p>Through the yellow sand, he faintly saw the Barroth lying motionless not far away.</p>
<p>Besides that, there were many white bones, though he couldn't tell what creatures they belonged to.</p>
<p>At this point, the quicksand stopped.</p>
<p>In the cavern, the Diablos, having just dealt with the Barroth, clearly discovered another uninvited guest.</p>
<p>The Diablos turned its head, glaring at Song Ren with hostile eyes, and let out a massive roar.</p>
<p>Underneath this enormous roar, the hunter in the game covered his ears and shook his head. The vibration from the sound waves caused the yellow sand overhead to rustle down once more.</p>
<p>“Oh my god! Isn't this Diablos a herbivore? Why is it so ferocious?!”</p>
<p>Looking at the massive Diablos before him, Song Ren felt completely numb. He finally understood one thing.</p>
<p>That is, the Diablos is indeed a herbivore, but being a herbivore doesn't mean it won't kill!</p>
<p>The Barroth was minding its own business, walking along—who did it offend?</p>
<p>You, Diablos, just burst out of the ground and took down the Barroth.</p>
<p>If you were going to eat it, fine, but why are you, a cactus-eating herbivore, so vicious?!</p>
<p>The world is so beautiful, wouldn't it be better if we had a little more love?</p>
<p>Song Ren looked at the Diablos before him, utterly bewildered.</p>
<p>This Diablos is simply too big!</p>
<p>He highly doubted whether the Odogaron, which had given him some trouble before, would be instantly flattened into a meat patty by a single slap from the Diablos.</p>
<p>“Don't panic! Song Ren, you can do this!”</p>
<p>“It's a herbivorous Diablos, just looks a bit fierce! Big body weak to the rear, furry body weak to fire. This Diablos must be very clumsy, and when facing huge monsters, attacking its vulnerable spots guarantees a win!”</p>
<p>Song Ren braced himself, recalling the usual strategies for facing bosses in Dark Souls.</p>
<p>Just then, the Diablos in front roared, then charged straight at him, determined to eliminate the uninvited guest who had trespassed into its nest.</p>
<p>With a roar from the Diablos, even from a considerable distance, the hunter in the game instinctively covered his ears and entered a state of paralysis.</p>
<p>After roaring, the Diablos paused for a second, then charged towards Song Ren with heavy thuds.</p>
<p>“Oh my god, it started with a Dragon Charge right away! And the damage!” Missing a dodge, Song Ren was stunned as he watched his hunter get launched into the air.</p>
<p>The so-called Dragon Charges he had encountered from other dragons before actually didn't have much destructive power.</p>
<p>For example, the Barroth that the Diablos had just killed—its Dragon Charge was all bark and no bite.</p>
<p>But the Diablos' Dragon Charge before him was completely different.</p>
<p>It truly made Song Ren understand what savagery felt like.</p>
<p>One hit and half his health was gone!</p>
<p>Fortunately, his companion Palico triggered a skill, and very kindly and thoughtfully brought a Vigorwasp for healing from who knew where.</p>
<p>Hastily getting up, Song Ren walked forward, pressed the interaction key, pulled out a dagger from his pocket, cut it open, and fully restored his health.</p>
<p>At the same time, the distant Diablos began pawing at the ground again, then charged fiercely towards him.</p>
<p>This time, however, Song Ren was experienced.</p>
<p>With a nimble roll, he evaded the Diablos' Dragon Charge. Simultaneously, he drew his Long Sword from his back and brutally slashed at the Diablos' tail.</p>
<p>Due to having maximum sharpness and being relatively lucky, this strike didn't weapon bounce, but the single-digit damage indicated just how thick its hide was.</p>
<p>With the second strike, Song Ren heard a crisp 'ding' as his weapon bounced off immediately.</p>
<p>But in the next moment, the Diablos flicked its thick tail, sweeping him away.</p>
<p>This health bar once again gave him the feeling he had when playing Dark Souls.</p>
<p>Through continuous attacks, Song Ren still managed to pinpoint the vulnerable hitzones on the Diablos' body that his Long Sword could damage.</p>
<p>But the key was that he didn't know if this Diablos' behavior was due to Nebula Games' AI implementation or if the monster was simply designed that way.</p>
<p>Song Ren just felt that the Diablos could attack from every part of its body.</p>
<p>There was no way to get close.</p>
<p>Tail whips, hind leg kicks, plus a Dragon Charge—it made him completely unable to find an opening.</p>
<p>When he was even slightly far away, Song Ren found that the Diablos would immediately launch a Dragon Charge.</p>
<p>Even a slight graze would make half his health bar disappear.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Diablos had another unique move: it could burrow underground, then charge and attack from below.</p>
<p>This move was incredibly difficult to dodge.</p>
<p>Even rolling wasn't a panacea.</p>
<p>One slight misstep and he'd be sent flying into the sky, and the damage was just as high, no less than a Dragon Charge, taking away half his health bar in one hit.</p>
<p>Occasionally, when he managed to get into the Diablos' blind spot, his Long Sword strikes still didn't hit a weak point or a normal damage zone.</p>
<p>Instead, they struck its hard armor, not only triggering the weapon bounce mechanic but also resulting in white, single-digit damage numbers.</p>
<p>The 'ding-ding-ding' sound was quite pleasant to hear, but the problem was, he didn't want to hear it!</p>
<p>After fighting continuously for about ten minutes, the Diablos was still full of vigor.</p>
<p>Song Ren estimated that the damage he had dealt to the Diablos was probably at most six or seven hundred points.</p>
<p>And most of that damage was likely from his companion Palico.</p>
<p>His entire contribution was dodging Dragon Charges and creating distance to drink potions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Diablos also had a move: its roar.</p>
<p>Compared to the Anjanath's roar from before, this Diablos' roar was incredibly powerful.</p>
<p>Looking at the ferocious Diablos before him, Song Ren took a deep breath.</p>
<p>He had to admit, he was in trouble again; this was the strongest opponent he had ever encountered.</p>
<p>High health, high attack, high defense, very aggressive, and a large attack range.</p>
<p>From every aspect, the Diablos before him was simply too powerful.</p>
<p>“Alright, Diablos, you big brute, all your moves have been seen through by me!”</p>
<p>“You just wait there, don't you dare run! I'll bring my teammates to settle the score later!”</p>
<p>“If you have the guts, stay right here and don't run!”</p>
<p>“Diablos! I'll be back!”</p>
<p>Looking at the Diablos, Song Ren spoke with the fiercest tone.</p>
<p>At the same time, four large characters appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>【EXHAUSTED AND FELL DOWN!】</p>
<p>The remaining two updates will be a bit later~</p>
