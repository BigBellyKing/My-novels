                <p>Chapter 449: Enthusiastic and Excited Players (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Zhang Yi wasn't the only one bewildered; many players who had logged into Huanyu VR, downloaded the Animus from the Nebula Games Platform, and experienced it were completely dumbfounded.</p>
<p>At first, everyone was startled, not understanding what this Animus thing was, but it sounded incredibly impressive.</p>
<p>However, with the introduction, players quickly realized that this device was merely a preview for Nebula Games' new title.</p>
<p>Using a machine called Animus to read ancestral memories and then re-experience magnificent history. It was made to seem like some genuine black technology.</p>
<p>Despite this, the Animus concept surprised many players, as it was quite astonishing.</p>
<p>But before they could finish being surprised, the twist immediately followed.</p>
<p>The final mechanical line, 'You have been chosen!', implied that things weren't as simple as they thought.</p>
<p>This machine seemed to have some mastermind behind it. And that mysterious symbol was clearly the mark of the mastermind.</p>
<p>But the crucial issue was, it just ended there!</p>
<p>Many players erupted in frustration over this.</p>
<p>"I'm utterly impressed! I initially thought it was some black technology, but I never imagined this thing was Nebula Games' promotional program!"</p>
<p>"+1, I didn't expect it either, but the key is, if it's a promotional program, then just promote it. Why do they have to make grand promises and keep us in suspense even for a promotion?"</p>
<p>"Exactly, it's too much! If it were a game demo teasing us, fine, but even a promotional video teasing us like this is just excessive!"</p>
<p>"Damn it, we can't encourage Mr. Chen's malicious practices. We must strongly resist, otherwise, Mr. Chen will turn into a Riddler-like figure for every game, and that's just going to drive us crazy!"</p>
<p>"Right! And I don't know if you noticed, but this promotional video seems to reveal a lot of content, but in reality, besides a background, it reveals nothing at all!"</p>
<p>As the Animus content was released, many players expressed their strong disapproval.</p>
<p>It revealed absolutely no specific information, yet it intentionally heightened their anticipation.</p>
<p>They had foolishly thought that Animus was some incredible program at first.</p>
<p>In the end, it turned out to be a promotion for a new game, and if you're promoting, just promote.</p>
<p>Why be a Riddler-like figure!</p>
<p>Aside from guessing that players might eventually experience history through this Animus machine, everything else was unknown, even the game's name.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>"Players are truly passionate! Thankfully, I anticipated their excitement and was well-prepared."</p>
<p>In Nebula Games, Mr. Chen looked at the comments below his official Weibo account and couldn't help but sigh with emotion.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, this player enthusiasm scares even us," Ruan Ningxue, who was beside him, couldn't help but grumble inwardly.</p>
<p>They were too enthusiastic; so much so that not only Mr. Chen's official Weibo account and Nebula Games' official Weibo account, but even their staff members' Weibo accounts were overrun by excited players.</p>
<p>They constantly threatened to send local specialties like razor blades and grenades. Who could handle that!</p>
<p>"Don't worry, we released Animus first because the promotional video wasn't ready. Now is the perfect time to satisfy their craving," Mr. Chen said with a smile.</p>
<p>As for the game content? He had only recently returned from Italy, so development certainly hadn't started yet!</p>
<p>And isn't it common sense to create promotional CG before developing a game?</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>The highly emotional Nebula Games players online immediately discovered Mr. Chen's Weibo post.</p>
<p>Seeing a video attachment on it, all the players instantly perked up.</p>
<p>Because they knew, this was what they wanted!</p>
<p>"Holy cow, it actually came!"</p>
<p>"What's this called? The squeaky wheel gets the grease?"</p>
<p>"Damn, who compares themselves to a child?"</p>
<p>"Stop it, hurry up and take a look!"</p>
<p>With excited hearts, players who had been tormented by the Animus for almost a week eagerly clicked on the video.</p>
<p>After a brief darkness,</p>
<p>The screen showed a cluttered room, surrounded by messy equipment.</p>
<p>Near the corner was an Animus machine.</p>
<p>On it lay a young man.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the young man sat up, and his internal monologue began.</p>
<p>'My name is Desmond Miles, a prisoner of this war.'</p>
<p>'It is a war I've known, waged by two factions I once believed were never real.'</p>
<p>'Assassins... and Templar Knights.'</p>
<p>'This is a war that has lasted for thousands of years, perhaps since the dawn of human civilization.'</p>
<p>Desmond sat on the bed, staring expressionlessly at the gleaming metal wall.</p>
<p>'Before this, I was forced by them to awaken the memories of my ancestors through the Animus.'</p>
<p>'And it showed me the truth of this war that has lasted countless years, something I never believed in, something I once wanted to forget.'</p>
<p>'Thousands of years of history flowing in my blood were presented by this machine.'</p>
<p>As Desmond's internal monologue continued, the screen's image suddenly shattered like a broken mirror.</p>
<p>Then, reassembling, the scene began to shift.</p>
<p>Armies bearing the Crusader emblem, and Assassins in white hoods.</p>
<p>Notre-Dame Cathedral, Egyptian Pyramids, ancient attire like that of Spartan warriors, ships and cannons from the modern era sailing across oceans.</p>
<p>Renaissance era Florence, the Sacred Land of Jerusalem... countless fragments of memory, finally settled in a dimly lit underground chamber.</p>
<p>In the center, something resembling an apple or a disc, shimmered with a golden glow.</p>
<p>'They are using the Animus and me, to find something by reading the memories of my ancestors, flowing in my DNA.'</p>
<p>'The Apple of Eden, one of the Pieces of Eden.'</p>
<p>'The Templar Knights collected it and showed me its terrifying power.'</p>
<p>'If they obtain all the Pieces of Eden, everything will change; they want to enslave all humanity.'</p>
<p>Innumerable images intertwined; the Assassin in a white hood stood atop the Florence Cathedral, overlooking the entire city.</p>
<p>The Assassin's memories mixed with Desmond's, making his gaze gradually firm.</p>
<p>'When they brought me here, I was afraid they would hurt me if I resisted.'</p>
<p>'But now... I worry that if I don't resist, something I don't want to see will eventually happen...'</p>
<p>'I can't do all of this alone...'</p>
<p>'But fortunately, I am not alone in this fight. I met a person named Lucy, and I think she is on my side.'</p>
<p>The memory screen switched to a blonde woman. She looked at Desmond, her right hand subtly placed on her chest.</p>
<p>At the same time, she slowly bent her right ring finger, concealing it within her clothes.</p>
<p>At a glance, it looked as if she was missing a finger.</p>
<p>'My time is running out, but thankfully, the Animus's miraculous power allows me to uncover the instincts buried in my DNA.'</p>
<p>'Though there are some hidden dangers, this is the fastest way for me to master Assassin techniques.'</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Desmond lay back down and slowly closed his eyes.</p>
<p>The video then faded to black.</p>
<p>After watching this video, players finally became truly excited, because unlike the previous Animus teaser, this video genuinely gave players a lot of information.</p>
<p>First, the main story content of the game was more or less confirmed for players.</p>
<p>It was about the Assassin and Templar Knight organizations, engaged in countless years of war, extending through various historical conflicts.</p>
<p>And in modern times, both the Assassin organization and the Templar Knight organization still exist.</p>
<p>Desmond is a member of the Assassins, and the Templar Knights found Desmond, using the Animus machine to activate the memories of Desmond's ancestors.</p>
<p>The purpose was to find the whereabouts of the Pieces of Eden, and players would clearly be playing as characters from the Assassin faction.</p>
<p>At the same time, the main gameplay of the game would likely involve experiencing various historical events.</p>
<p>The Crusades and the Renaissance were some of the contents already shown in the promotional video.</p>
<p>Innumerable players cheered and rejoiced, and the forums were filled with all sorts of player discussions.</p>
<p>But two consecutive rounds of promotion still left players unable to suppress their excitement.</p>
<p>In contrast, Zeus felt as if they'd been hit by a truck.</p>
<p>The hype was stolen again!</p>
<p>Nebula Games, why do you have so many flashy and gaudy tricks?</p>
<p>And you even made something called Animus!</p>
<p>And why are you players so excited?</p>
<p>Didn't you notice that while Nebula Games' promotion seems powerful, with two consecutive rounds within a week, you still know nothing?</p>
<p>You don't know the game's development progress, its genre, its gameplay, or even its name. Why are you so excited? Seeing the excited players, Zeus felt utterly exhausted.</p>
