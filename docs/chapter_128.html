                <p>Chapter 227: Subsequent Operations Arrangements (Fifth update, please subscribe and vote for monthly passes)</p>
<p>Day by day, the topic of <em>Minecraft</em> maintained an incredibly high level of popularity.
On all major websites, any content related to <em>Minecraft</em> consistently garnered high click-through rates.
Videos showcasing various builds within the game, a wide array of funny clips, and strategy guides for new players were all circulating.
It left many game designers in the industry feeling as if they had seen a ghost.</p>
<p>As the New Year's holiday drew to a close, employees across Nebula Games' various departments had successively returned to work.
At this moment, Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, and Yang Xin stood behind Chen Xu, their faces filled with curiosity as they watched the screen in front of Chen Xu.
Steve was sitting in a tank, facing a gigantic BOSS, which even had a health bar UI above its head.</p>
<p>The game content was very simple: players just needed to sit in the tank, continuously attack the colossal monster before them, and dodge the TNT bombs thrown by the monster.
It was very rudimentary, but what surprised everyone was that this MOD mode wasn't created by Chen Xu; it was made by <em>Minecraft</em> players.</p>
<p>After its release, this MOD instantly became the most downloaded MOD, second only to the building complex MODs previously released by Chen Xu.
In just one day, it reached 2 million downloads.</p>
<p>"You can actually drive a tank and fight a BOSS in <em>Minecraft</em>!" Ruan Ningxue exclaimed, her face full of surprise.</p>
<p>"It's not just about driving tanks and fighting BOSSes. Theoretically, any type of game – be it RPG, Racing, or FPS – can be implemented within <em>Minecraft</em> using its game rules," Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Of course, the actual experience would certainly lack the refined feel and rich content of a conventional FPS, RPG, or Racing game.
But the crucial point was: when players played these types of games within <em>Minecraft</em>, were they concerned about the 'feel' of the controls?
What they cared about was that <em>Minecraft</em> could be played in such a way.
They were experiencing the unique aspect of it.</p>
<p>It was just like many players who enjoyed doing GHS in regular games, yet preferred to study plot and life philosophy in adult games.
Did they truly want GHS and philosophical discussions?
No, they simply desired something unique and different.
This was human nature, inherent since birth.</p>
<p>Originally, Chen Xu had planned to secretly introduce some more unique modes for players,
such as Hide and Seek, Master Builder, and so on.
But now, it seemed he had somewhat underestimated the players' creativity.</p>
<p>The MOD before him, called 'Tank Battle Against Evil Little Monsters', though very simple in content, had clearly opened a new door for <em>Minecraft</em> players.
Chen Xu was confident that it wouldn't be long before more unique MODs emerged.</p>
<p>"We don't need to worry about the rest; we can leave it to the players. However, ensuring the maintenance of the community and the game environment is absolutely crucial!" Chen Xu said to the Operations team.</p>
<p>For the Operations team, their primary focus was not on game content operations.
Instead, it was mainly on maintaining the game environment.
For example, if players engaged in personal attacks, abusive language, and similar behaviors within the game, they would receive warnings, temporary mutes, temporary bans from online mode, or even permanent mutes or permanent bans from online mode.
Of course, unless someone was actively trying to get themselves banned, the permanent mute and permanent online ban packages would generally not be triggered.
At most, it would just be a temporary mute.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, the Operations team nodded.</p>
<p>"Also, Lin Rou's team should collect information about players across various online servers. Later, this can be compiled into a <em>Minecraft</em> Documentary Series, specifically documenting the history of <em>Minecraft</em>, including various memes within the player community. We can also create series, for example, featuring the first player to dig a 3x1 hole for shelter at night, or the first player to choose not to build a house but instead place their bed directly in an underground mine shaft or cave. All of these can be turned into a documentary, belonging to the history and memories of <em>Minecraft</em> players," Chen Xu said to Lin Rou.</p>
<p>Regarding <em>Minecraft</em>, Chen Xu was well aware of its incredibly long lifespan. Even ten years after its release, its player growth numbers remained positive each year, repeatedly setting new records for active player counts.
Moreover, in his previous life, its sales reached 230 million, making it the highest-selling game in the world, and it continued to break that record.
It could be said that this game was nothing short of a miracle.
Therefore, Chen Xu naturally wouldn't neglect the maintenance of the official community and the game's atmosphere.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, the mobile version of <em>Minecraft</em> and the VR version of <em>Minecraft</em> can also be put on the agenda," Chen Xu said, looking at Qin Yi and the others.</p>
<p>The mobile version, or phone version, would share data with the PC version.
Meaning, purchasing the PC version would grant access to the mobile version.
However, due to platform and hardware limitations, the mobile version would have considerably more content cut compared to the PC version.
Firstly, there would be graphical compromises; the mobile version certainly couldn't match the visuals of the PC version.
Secondly, controls would be more frustrating than on PC, as players would only be able to use virtual joysticks via a touchscreen.
Additionally, certain game modes, such as the exhibition mode and online mode found in the PC version, would clearly not be supported on mobile.</p>
<p>Moreover, there were all sorts of MODs. Although the core gameplay data content was the same, considering hardware performance, many MODs that ran on PC clearly couldn't be supported on mobile.
If there was an advantage, it was that virtually all players owned a mobile phone, allowing them to play <em>Minecraft</em> anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>As for the VR version, it would be much more convenient and easier.
The VR version could even present superior graphics compared to the PC version—this, of course, referred to the game's original configurations.
After all, if one were truly talking about maximum graphical performance, then both PC and VR allowed for unlimited DIY customization.
The ultimate performance ceiling of the machine depended on the thickness of one's wallet.
However, for mainstream configurations, VR currently held an edge over PC.</p>
<p>Therefore, the original content of <em>Minecraft</em> could be completely replicated in the VR version.
All that was needed was to adapt the controls for VR mode, as playing with sensors in a gaming pod was a different experience from playing on a PC.
However, unlike the shared data between the PC and mobile versions, the VR version would definitely require an additional purchase.</p>
