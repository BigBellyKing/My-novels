                <p>Chapter 288: Is Mr. Chen That Formidable? (7th update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>As he entered the game, Chen Xu became a little more serious. After all, his opponent was also a professional player, and a rather strong one at that.</p>
<p>For his race, Chen Xu chose the Night Elves, and the map was the relatively fair 'Twisted Meadows (TM)', which featured a Neutral Tavern in the middle where heroes could be directly recruited.</p>
<p>After checking his spawn point, Chen Xu found himself in the upper right corner. Since spawn points were random, mainly distributed along the four edges of the map, Chen Xu placed a Moon Well, then sent his newly created Wisps to scout in a clockwise direction. This was a standard tactical move.</p>
<p>In the live stream room, Huang Donglai and Sun Yixie were providing commentary. It had to be said that while their personal skill might not match that of professional players, their understanding and grasp of the game's mechanics were quite impressive.</p>
<p>“Hey... Mr. Chen's starting strategy seems a bit unconventional here. Building a Moon Well first, then a hero altar? Is he planning a neutral hero start?” Sun Yixie was the first to notice this detail.</p>
<p>In the game, summoning a hero required a population building – a Farm for Humans, an Orc Burrow for Orcs, and a Moon Well for Elves. Generally, when summoning a hero from one's own race, players would first place a hero altar and then a population building, as the latter had a shorter build time than the former, allowing for the fastest hero summon.</p>
<p>“And Brother Huang, look, Mr. Chen's micro-management truly has some skill!”</p>
<p>“Scouting clockwise, finding no one in the top-left, then continuing to scout downwards. He directly positioned the Wisp deep inside, allowing it to gather wood while also providing a bit of vision. Not bad!”</p>
<p>Sun Yixie was commentating very seriously. Originally, he had expected this to be a no-contest battle, but from the current operations, it seemed quite skillful! While controlling the Wisp to scout, the base operations hadn't stopped either. For now, he couldn't discern the full extent of the skill, but it was certainly not an ordinary player.</p>
<p>“Oh, Brother Sun, it's no use. You have to remember who Mr. Chen is facing.”</p>
<p>“Shu Ben, an incredibly powerful man! Two Ancients of War, one placed next to the mercenaries on the right—what kind of move is that?! Is he trying to mass Huntresses?” Huang Donglai, providing commentary, still didn't have high hopes for Chen Xu, but he did notice Chen Xu's little maneuver in the game.</p>
<p>“You can see Shu Ben still went with his best strategy: single Burrow, fast tech.”</p>
<p>“Though I hate to say it, in the face of absolute skill, tactics and macro-management are all fleeting clouds. Mr. Chen is in trouble now.” Huang Donglai bravely made his judgment.</p>
<p>Chen Xu in the game, however, wasn't overthinking it. One Ancient of War at home, and another placed at the mercenary camp to the right. This was because he had already decided on his strategy for this match.</p>
<p>The opponent hadn't scouted him immediately, which indicated they hadn't spawned in the bottom-right corner. He also hadn't scouted them in the top-left. Therefore, the opponent had a high probability of spawning in the far bottom-left position. Later Wisp scouting confirmed his suspicion. Of course, even if he guessed the wrong location, he could still cancel the Ancient of War at the mercenary camp in time.</p>
<p>Then, as time passed, the Mid-lane Tavern directly summoned a neutral unit, the Beastmaster. After summoning a Quillbeast, it immediately headed towards the Orc base in the bottom-right. Along the way, it encountered a Blademaster accompanied by an Orc Grunt, seemingly trying to level up. Clearly, the opponent was sticking to the traditional Orc strategy of starting with a Blademaster.</p>
<p>The Blademaster gave chase, and the Orc Grunt blocked. Although Chen Xu's control was decent, he was still blocked twice and took three free hits from the Blademaster.</p>
<p>The bullet comments in the live stream room were also very lively.</p>
<p>‘What's going on? Shouldn't Night Elves usually start with a Demon Hunter?’</p>
<p>‘Confirmed! Orcs are the strongest! Look, Mr. Chen is playing Night Elves but the first hero he recruits is still a Beastmaster!’</p>
<p>‘F*ck, your thought process is weird!’</p>
<p>‘I'm more curious why Mr. Chen built two Ancients of War at the start. Is he going for Huntresses? But Huntresses can't win!’</p>
<p>‘Shu Ben's two Burrows are still building, the Beastmaster took his piglets to demolish them, three piglets are so fierce!’</p>
<p>‘The Blademaster took some damage this round, didn't even have time to level up, but at least he got the piglets' experience.’</p>
<p>‘This harassment is quite well-played, Mr. Chen definitely has some skill!’</p>
<p>During the commentary, many players also noticed some unique insights.</p>
<p>This couldn't help but surprise many RTS players.</p>
<p>It seemed Chen Xu really had something up his sleeve!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the commentary channel, observing from the God's-eye view, Sun Yixie and Huang Donglai, as commentators, were also very surprised.</p>
<p>“Two production buildings massing Huntresses, a very good early game. But unfortunately, Mr. Chen is facing a professional player, Shu Ben. Look, the Orc base is already at Tier 2 tech, and Raiders are out. For his second hero, he directly chose a Shaman.”</p>
<p>“Moreover, Raiders have faster movement speed than Huntresses. This means only Raiders can surround and kill Huntresses, while Huntresses can't kill Raiders. How can he lose? Shu Ben, he's already in an invincible position!” Huang Donglai stated, as a professional commentator, he should be brave enough to make a judgment.</p>
<p>The situation on the field was still quite stalemated, but Chen Xu was smiling happily, as everything was under control.</p>
<p>Although he was still at Tier 1 tech, his second expansion was already mining, and his economy was in excellent shape.</p>
<p>‘Here they come, here they come, charging! Shu Ben's Raider wave! And everyone, note that Raiders have the Siege attribute, which gives them extra damage against buildings.’</p>
<p>‘Eh, Mr. Chen chose to base trade with the Beastmaster? A very clever move, but it didn't seem to help much, he directly lost two Huntresses.’</p>
<p>‘Shu Ben feels like he's already won, he wins no matter how he fights, he won the direct engagement, and he won the base trade too.’</p>
<p>The commentators performed very professionally, and Shu Ben in the game also felt he had a significant advantage.</p>
<p>After applying a big potion to a low-health Raider, Shu Ben was about to gather two more Raiders and move out, but he quickly noticed something wasn't right.</p>
<p>That was, the opponent hadn't chosen multiple heroes; they were still solely leveling up one Beastmaster, and only producing Huntresses throughout the game. Furthermore, this Beastmaster's level had already reached a terrifying Level 5. And even though he had clearly wiped out almost a whole squad of the opponent's Huntresses earlier, how was there another squad now!?</p>
<p>Did he open an expansion? How many did he open?!</p>
<p>Having been constantly harassed by the Beastmaster in the early game, coupled with his single Burrow fast tech followed by Raider production, Shu Ben had absolutely no time to open an expansion. He had been on a single base the entire time, and now his main mine was almost depleted. Yet, despite his opponent's main base being thoroughly dismantled by him, why did they still have so many troops?!</p>
<p>Not just Shu Ben, but the viewers and commentators in the live stream room also noticed this scene through the God's-eye view.</p>
<p>It seemed like Chen Xu lost every engagement, suffering heavy losses, and even his main base buildings were dismantled into disarray. But he hadn't taken any fatal damage!</p>
<p>Instead, with the appearance of a third expansion, money was absolutely no issue.</p>
<p>Expansion? Base? As long as I have money, anywhere can be my main base!</p>
<p>As for Huntresses, four Ancients of War were massing them. I'd send you one squad, and by the time you replenished your forces, my new squad would be ready again.</p>
<p>I just won't engage you in a frontal assault. If you come to dismantle my home, I'll go base trade yours. If you're so brave, don't use a Town Portal Scroll.</p>
<p>The longer the game went on, the worse Shu Ben's economy became, while Chen Xu's economy only improved.</p>
<p>Finally, as the Beastmaster reached Level 6, he led a vast number of Huntresses directly into Shu Ben's base and unleashed his ultimate ability.</p>
<p>Watching countless Thunder Lizards rampage through his base, Shu Ben, whose mentality was finally starting to crack, typed out “GG”.</p>
<p>“What just happened?! Shu Ben actually lost? Night Elves... no, is Mr. Chen really that formidable?” Huang Donglai on the commentary desk had an incredulous look, still feeling a bit bewildered.</p>
<p>At this moment, the bullet comments in the live stream room completely erupted.</p>
