                <p>Chapter 750: People Must Not Forget Their Roots, Or At Least, They Shouldn’t</p>
<p>Returning to the office from the lounge area, Chen Xu stretched and sat down in front of his computer.</p>
<p>The traditional horror activities of Nebula Games, along with the science program he had discussed with Yang Xin and the others, had sparked some thoughts in Chen Xu.</p>
<p>On the surface, this program segment looked like a mystery, but after the truth was revealed, it left people somewhat dumbfounded, unable to resist saying, “Is that all there is to it?”</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu understood clearly that this program was not entertainment; it was a serious popular science program.</p>
<p>Its purpose was for those with backward and feudal ideologies.</p>
<p>It aimed to make them understand that the so-called 'bizarre' events they witnessed were, in fact, quite ordinary, with no supernatural involvement. The essence and goal of the program were to dispel feudal superstition.</p>
<p>If one only watched the program content, it would seem rather comical, especially seeing citizens and villagers solemnly recounting what seemed like true events.</p>
<p>But then, it would also make one feel truly pathetic.</p>
<p>Feudal superstition and traditional customs are two completely different concepts, and has feudal superstition truly been eradicated throughout history?</p>
<p>Not to mention rural villages with underdeveloped economies and technology, even in big cities, many people are deceived by so-called pseudoscience, and new superstitions like computer fortune-telling emerge endlessly, with people still falling victim.</p>
<p>Influenced by these points, and combined with Nebula Games' consistent tradition, Chen Xu also prepared to develop a game as a gift to players.</p>
<p>Of course, theme is theme, and Nebula Games' consistent tradition couldn't be abandoned either. As for the genre, Chen Xu had a rather suitable candidate.</p>
<p>A Chinese-style horror game with a funeral background: <em>Firework (Game)</em>.</p>
<p>In terms of game mechanics and content, this game actually had many shortcomings.</p>
<p>The most direct point was the repetitive use of scene assets within the game.</p>
<p>However, the game's script and story could be said to be exceptionally good.</p>
<p>It possessed a profound meaning that was truly worth pondering.</p>
<p>Chen Xu sat in front of his computer, working on refining some basic content settings.</p>
<p>As for horror games, Chen Xu had certainly made them before, for many players.</p>
<p>The asylum in <em>Outlast</em>, the Infinite Corridor in <em>PT</em>, and Jack Baker's farm in <em>Resident Evil</em> were all unforgettable experiences for them.</p>
<p>But these games actually leaned more towards Western horror, meaning they used grotesque visuals, gore, and dark scenes to instill fear in players.</p>
<p>The manifestation of these horror games was through visual impact, making players feel fear, and simultaneously bringing more of a physical discomfort.</p>
<p>If one were to truly say one leaned towards an Eastern style, that would be <em>PT</em>.</p>
<p><em>Firework (Game)</em>, however, was different. It was a very pure Eastern horror style, or rather, Chinese-style horror.</p>
<p>It didn't rely on visual effects to physically impact players, but rather on a cognitive mode to make players feel horror.</p>
<p>Because in the game, players faced traditional elements like Gold Paper Ingots, Paper Effigies—things related to Funeral Culture—which created a psychological oppression.</p>
<p>But if one wasn't aware of these cultural elements, the sense of fear would be greatly diminished.</p>
<p>The true horror of this Chinese-style horror was not in its appearance, but in the ideological core it presented—the horror within human hearts.</p>
<p>The frightening thing was not ghosts and deities, but the human heart.</p>
<p>The entire game content was not long; a normal playthrough would take about three to five hours.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu didn't plan to make it a 2D-style game like in his previous life.</p>
<p>After all, Nebula Games certainly wasn't short on money now. Moreover, unlike horror games like <em>Resident Evil</em> and <em>Outlast</em> which constantly had monsters chasing you, <em>Firework (Game)</em> focused more on an atmosphere, yet it didn't create the same life-or-death urgency as <em>PT</em>.</p>
<p>If he had to describe it, in the early stages, players would feel the fear emanating from within themselves, while in the middle stages, they would experience the horror of human nature.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, this story…” Yang Xin looked at the detailed script in her hand with a pained expression.</p>
<p>The scale of <em>Firework (Game)</em> was not very large, and the number of team members involved in this game was also not many.</p>
<p>Of course, despite this, everyone internally was very eager to be transferred to this project team, as Chen Xu was leading it, and everyone was genuinely curious about this new game.</p>
<p>“People must not forget their roots, or at least, they shouldn’t forget them. Players haven't felt heartwarming love for a long time; it’s time to let them relive it,” Chen Xu said solemnly.</p>
<p>“This is clearly your wicked sense of humor, Mr. Chen!” Ruan Ningxue couldn't help but complain from the side.</p>
<p>What the heck with not forgetting their roots!</p>
<p>However, no one said much more, after all, when one has many debts, one stops worrying.</p>
<p>Anyway, given Mr. Chen's current image in the players' minds, the probability of him clearing his name was practically zero.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>In early November, Chen Xu’s official Weibo account and Nebula Games’ official website simultaneously updated with the latest event announcement.</p>
<p>Many players had long been eagerly anticipating this.</p>
<p>After all these years, Nebula Games’ discount event schedule had basically become fixed.</p>
<p>Every time a big sale came around, players would prepare their wallets early, ready to embark on their “It’s so good!” spending spree.</p>
<p>Various games offering different discounts were a given.</p>
<p>This was essentially a staple of every big sale.</p>
<p>But what truly made many players curious was the surprise Chen Xu had prepared for them this year.</p>
<p>Compared to the previously announced blockbuster, <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, what appeared on the Nebula Games Platform for pre-load this year was a game called <em>Firework (Game)</em>.</p>
<p>Since it wasn't Nebula Games' first time doing this, many players clearly understood that this game was one of their 'shenanigans' horror games.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Nebula Games wouldn't have offered a limited-time 90% discount on the price. For a VR game of its scale, this was clearly a bargain-basement price.</p>
<p>It was almost overtly telling players: we're giving you a high-quality game at a dirt-cheap price, but whether you dare to play it is your business.</p>
<p>At the same time, the game's background also surprised many players because it was a Chinese-style horror-themed game.</p>
<p>This sparked a strong curiosity in many players about what kind of game <em>Firework (Game)</em> actually was.</p>
<p>After all, the name sounded quite artistic!</p>
<p>Due to these reasons, even though many players knew that Mr. Chen was trying to mess with them this time, a strong sense of curiosity led quite a few players to prepare to buy and play it. After all, at a dirt-cheap price, adding one more to their collection was no loss.</p>
<p>Of course, there were also some players with very firm attitudes: horror games?</p>
<p>Playing them themselves was impossible, but wouldn't it be wonderful to watch a video or livestream of someone else completing it?</p>
<p>After all, for a VR horror game, with the livestream screen showing it and countless bullet comments accompanying them, how could they possibly get scared?</p>
<p>However, these players soon realized just how incredibly wrong they were.
