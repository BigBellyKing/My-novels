                <h1>Chapter 10: Who Could Resist a Bishōjo Match-3 Game?</h1>
<p>"Whew, this is unexpected!"</p>
<p>Inside his rented apartment, Chen Xu looked at the sales statistics in the backend of his official platform, feeling a bit surprised.</p>
<p>Because the overall growth in the data had truly exceeded his expectations.</p>
<p>On the first day, sales were 162 copies, a number neither high nor low.</p>
<p>On the second day, sales directly quadrupled, reaching a full 610 copies.</p>
<p>The main reason for this was his promotion.</p>
<p>With a budget of twenty thousand yuan, a normal advertisement certainly couldn't have been run.</p>
<p>On one hand, the money wasn't enough; on the other hand, the game had a slight peculiarity.</p>
<p>So Chen Xu's gaze immediately turned overseas, to a forum frequently visited by gentlemen.</p>
<p>After all, for Chen Xu, what he wanted was exposure.</p>
<p>As for the method, it was a relatively primitive approach of elite astroturfing posts.</p>
<p>Chen Xu hadn't considered large-scale astroturfing bombardment.</p>
<p>Because that wouldn't achieve a good effect, and might even backfire.</p>
<p>So the method Chen Xu adopted was to buy accounts and go for an elite approach.</p>
<p>Buying some older accounts on the forums, then publishing review posts.</p>
<p>After posting, astroturfers from other platforms would then bump the posts' content.</p>
<p>Of course, the most crucial point here was that the game's quality had to be up to standard.</p>
<p>Otherwise, this promotion method would not be as effective as large-scale astroturfing.</p>
<p>The most crucial point for this model's success was to convert players who learned about the game into allies, making them spontaneously recommend it to their friends and fellow gentlemen.</p>
<p>And as a professional Game Planner and an honest and simple player in his previous life, Chen Xu naturally understood a principle very well.</p>
<p>That is, what are players interested in?</p>
<p>A very simple theory: as players, most of them like to do one thing.</p>
<p>That is, to do some risqué things in normal games; and to do some normal things in risqué games.</p>
<p>This sense of contrast could be said to make these players addicted.</p>
<p>Just like a teasing remark made by players online: Men have two major hobbies, leading respectable women astray, and urging women of the night to reform.</p>
<p>Players are the same.</p>
<p>There are always some players who like to pull off some tricky moves in games.</p>
<p>Of course, relying solely on this is clearly not enough to make a game successful; ultimately, it relies on the game's quality.</p>
<p>But at least this characteristic can attract players, and that's already enough.</p>
<p>Judging by the current sales of <em>Mirror (Game)</em>, such a promotional strategy has so far proven to be entirely successful.</p>
<p>After all, choosing <em>Mirror (Game)</em> was a decision Chen Xu made after careful consideration, not on a whim.</p>
<p>How similar competing products performed in the market, whether gentlemen's preferences differed from his previous life, including release platforms and the feasibility of promotion – all these aspects were investigated beforehand.</p>
<p>Everything, Chen Xu had already calculated.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the success of <em>Mirror (Game)</em> could be said to be entirely within Chen Xu's control.</p>
<p>The only thing he hadn't anticipated was that the enthusiasm of gentlemen was far higher than Chen Xu had imagined.</p>
<p>With 610 copies sold on the second day, Chen Xu believed this increase was just the beginning.</p>
<p>As time progressed, word-of-mouth among players would definitely boost <em>Mirror (Game)</em>'s sales little by little.</p>
<p>"Hmm, at this rate, I'll be able to pay back the money owed to the payment app next week."</p>
<p>"Fortunately, the settlement method of the overseas official platform is real-time deposit; as long as players pass the refund period, the funds are immediately transferred to the account."</p>
<p>"But just like in my previous life, the commission from these third-party platform channels is really a bit hard to bear."</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Chen Xu couldn't help but click his tongue.</p>
<p>The official game platform takes a 30% commission, mainly for daily platform maintenance, as well as game engine upgrades and iterations, and the development of the latest technology.</p>
<p>As for other third-party game platforms, they are far more exploitative.</p>
<p>Especially when it comes to mobile channels, they typically start at 50%.</p>
<p>Some even go as far as a 70-30 split, where the developer gets 30% and the platform takes 70%.</p>
<p>This is comparable to the Goose Factory and major mobile app store channels in his previous life.</p>
<p>However, there are benefits, of course: these third-party platforms have a considerable user base, and the official platform offers fewer recommendations and its algorithms are not scientific.</p>
<p>So, even though these platforms have high revenue shares, game studios and companies can still make a profit.</p>
<p>It's just that they only get the broth, while the platforms take all the meat.</p>
<p>But for Chen Xu currently, these platforms were only briefly considered and held no interest at all.</p>
<p>It wasn't that he thought they were too exploitative and didn't want to get involved.</p>
<p>In fact, if he were to join them, it would definitely accelerate the accumulation of initial capital.</p>
<p>The main reason was that <em>Mirror (Game)</em> was a bit special; even if it were on those platforms, they wouldn't grant any recommendation slots.</p>
<p>Of course, this applies to domestic platforms, whereas overseas platforms have less strict restrictions.</p>
<p>But with the official platform available, there was no need to use third-party channels.</p>
<p>Because those domestic platform operators actually have no significant influence overseas.</p>
<p>Their main focus is domestically.</p>
<p>From afternoon to evening, Chen Xu was constantly monitoring the game's sales data.</p>
<p>This period was also the golden hour for sales growth.</p>
<p>Refreshing the backend data every hour, he could see <em>Mirror (Game)</em>'s sales steadily rising.</p>
<p>From an increase of over 100 in the previous hour, it had now climbed to over 200 during this golden period.</p>
<p>Clearly, through various information channels, the name <em>Mirror (Game)</em> was slowly reaching the ears of various gentlemen.</p>
<p>Each increment in sales represented the support of these amiable gentlemen for the game.</p>
<p>And with the lifting of the player review embargo, <em>Mirror (Game)</em>'s rating was successfully displayed.</p>
<p>A score of 9.7, a truly phenomenal score.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu wasn't overly excited.</p>
<p>The primary reason was that as an 18R game, players were incredibly tolerant of such games, and their tolerance level was much higher.</p>
<p>Compared to traditional games, this score actually had little reference value.</p>
<p>Just as some forums are filled with various curses and controversies, in forums frequently visited by gentlemen, it's different.</p>
<p>User comments were incredibly harmonious, either praising the OP as a good person with wishes for a safe life, or discussing their viewing experiences and their love for certain 'teachers'.</p>
<p>The only thing <em>Mirror (Game)</em>'s score could prove was that, in the eyes of players, this game was definitely worth buying and recommending.</p>
<p>After all, who could resist such an interesting Bishōjo Match-3 game?</p>
