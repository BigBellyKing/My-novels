<p>Chapter 241: No One Can Stop Me From Being the Azure Star! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>With Chen Xu's official Weibo account stepping forward, many Souls series players with masochistic tendencies, who had been looking forward to experiencing the long-lost dancing on the blade's edge and suffering in Monster Hunter: World, felt a pang of regret.</p>
<p>However, what more players cared about was the content revealed in Chen Xu's reply.</p>
<p>A pure cooperative hunting game, not a Souls-like game, and it features equipment collection and upgrade gameplay.</p>
<p>Many players were taken aback.</p>
<p>Because the few simple sentences on the official Weibo account revealed too much content.</p>
<p>In the Parallel World, co-op games were not a rare genre.</p>
<p>However, pure co-op games were relatively uncommon.</p>
<p>Most still adopted a setting where versus and co-op coexisted.</p>
<p>After all, in pure co-op, all content must revolve around map levels and BOSS design.</p>
<p>Content involving player versus player is simpler to create and can also better maintain a player's engagement time in the game.</p>
<p>So, pure co-op games were quite rare.</p>
<p>As for hunting games, although there were a few decent series, they were also very rare, usually releasing only one title every two or three years.</p>
<p>This was because it was difficult to establish a core gameplay loop.</p>
<p>Even some games originally centered on hunting either underwent reskinning or significant reforms.</p>
<p>More often, hunting was relegated to FPS games and ARPGs, serving as a system setting for bonus mini-games.</p>
<p>Making it a standalone genre was truly rare.</p>
<p>If there was any difference, it was that Chen Xu's Monster Hunter: World this time turned the hunting targets into dragons.</p>
<p>Similarly, countless attentive players were also animatedly discussing the fact that Monster Hunter: World was a hunting-themed game.</p>
<p>"Hunting games, come to think of it, don't seem that fun. Some hunting games I played before were really boring."</p>
<p>"Exactly, it felt like a Running Simulator."</p>
<p>"+1! Early on, you'd track the prey's movements, find it, and then <em>bang</em> – one shot and the prey was dead."</p>
<p>"Speaking of which, I wonder what the gameplay of this game will be like! With the ratio of characters to dragons, are the monsters going to abuse us in the end?"</p>
<p>"Probably not, didn't Mr. Chen say so? It won't be a Souls-like game, and it has grinding elements. It might be a satisfying action hunting game."</p>
<p>"When you put it that way, it's not impossible! Why else would Mr. Chen put a notice on the official Weibo account? Isn't it because he's afraid that players who think it's like Dark Souls will buy it, only to be disappointed when they find it's not what they expected?"</p>
<p>"If it really is a grinding game, then my only hope is that the dragons in this game will be tougher to fight; some previous hunting games weren't satisfying at all."</p>
<p>And as players engaged in heated discussion, with the development progress of Monster Hunter: World advancing.</p>
<p>Chen Xu also successively revealed more content on the official Weibo account and website.</p>
<p>Over a dozen usable weapons, each offering a different experience.</p>
<p>Clearly, in this game, there were no Class Divisions; all players shared the single identity of a Hunter.</p>
<p>And what weapon to use was entirely up to the players themselves.</p>
<p>One weapon was equivalent to one class; if you got tired of playing, you could simply switch to another weapon.</p>
<p>In addition, the game's environments — Ancient Forest, Wildspire Waste, Coral Highlands, Rotten Vale, Elder's Recess — were gradually revealed to players.</p>
<p>They were truly beautiful.</p>
<p>Besides these, there was also related game background information, such as simple introductions and explanations about the Hunter's Guild and the Azure Star.</p>
<p>Combined with these Scene Concept Art, plus the gameplay Chen Xu mentioned earlier, a general outline had already appeared in the minds of all players.</p>
<p>Players would take on the role of a Hunter, embarking on adventurous hunts in a lifelike world.</p>
<p>Their targets would be powerful dragon-like creatures, and ultimately, through repeated hunts, players would become a Miracle Legend in the Hunter world, guiding the way for future Hunters as the legendary Azure Star.</p>
<p>Simply perfect!</p>
<p>Using various weapons to hunt different types of dragons, and collecting corresponding materials to forge equipment.</p>
<p>Ultimately becoming the great Azure Star.</p>
<p>And with the release of this information, countless players became increasingly excited.</p>
<p>I'm going to be a Hunter!</p>
<p>I'm going to hunt Elder Dragons!</p>
<p>No one can stop me from being the Azure Star!</p>
<p>Especially from the promotional materials, the game would apply the latest AI technology.</p>
<p>It would showcase a vibrant ecological chain in the game.</p>
<p>Although it was still unclear what this so-called AI technology and the game itself truly entailed.</p>
<p>There was no doubt that the grand promises made, even through the screen, exuded a fragrant aroma.</p>
<p>This was also thanks to Nebula Games, as every game released so far had given players great surprises.</p>
