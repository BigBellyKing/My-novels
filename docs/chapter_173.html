                <p>Chapter 272: Is Your Game Made of Gold? (Fifth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Regarding the two crossovers between <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> and <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>
<p>Basically, everyone in the gaming industry, be it players or designers, already had a guess.</p>
<p>That is, Nebula Games must be developing a new game.</p>
<p>What remained was determining what type of game it would be.</p>
<p>As for the theme, there was no need to overthink it.</p>
<p>From the Lordaeron Kingdom, combined with the Frost Dragon and Chimera monsters, and the weapon models created through cosmetic transformations from the crossover.</p>
<p>Clearly, this would be a fantasy-setting game.</p>
<p>As for the genre, there were actually only a few possibilities.</p>
<p>First, FPS was ruled out, as it seemed implausible no matter how one looked at it.</p>
<p>What remained, both industry designers and players believed, was either an RPG or an action-adventure game.</p>
<p>Meaning it would either be like <em>Dark Souls</em> or like <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>.</p>
<p>After all, judging from the major titles released so far, Nebula Games was highly proficient in both these areas.</p>
<p>And whether it was <em>Dark Souls</em> or <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, Nebula Games had demonstrated extraordinary strength in the action game and RPG genres.</p>
<p>What worried players more was whether Chen Xu would pour his 'love' into the game.</p>
<p>After all, Chen Xu's past performances were truly devastating.</p>
<p>And very conflicted.</p>
<p>Because with ordinary games, if you pulled these shenanigans, at worst, you just wouldn't play it.</p>
<p>But Chen Xu's games were different.</p>
<p>They made you suffer while also making you immensely satisfied.</p>
<p>This conflicted experience left players both afraid and in love.</p>
<p>They'd say 'Get lost!', 'Won't buy!', 'Won't play!', but their hand reaching for their wallet just couldn't seem to stop!</p>
<p>During this period, Chen Xu hadn't been idle either.</p>
<p>The development plan was steadily advancing.</p>
<p>Regarding the CGI, Chen Xu still sought out the company that previously produced the <em>Dark Souls</em> cutscene promotional animations.</p>
<p>Their technical skills had also received Chen Xu's approval, and CGI, in essence, was a matter of how much money you were willing to burn.</p>
<p>Domestically, as long as they were willing to invest heavily, the results could even surpass those produced abroad.</p>
<p>And for <em>Warcraft</em>, Chen Xu was naturally very generous.</p>
<p>After several rounds of talks, Nebula Games' investment in <em>Warcraft</em>'s CGI animations amounted to a nine-digit figure starting with '4'.</p>
<p>Of course, the settlement currency was definitely RMB.</p>
<p>Besides these, Ruan Ningxue's side, responsible for model assets, had largely completed production from the outsourcing team.</p>
<p>One could say they were extremely detailed. At the same time, Chen Xu also added a rather special setting.</p>
<p>That was the Close-up Setting. The in-game camera would be set to default. Of course, after the Map Editor was opened in the future, players could adjust it according to their needs, and even adjust the camera for the built-in campaigns.</p>
<p>However, in the RTS multiplayer part, the camera was fixed, only zoomable in and not out, mainly for fairness.</p>
<p>With the added close-up camera, players could switch to it after clicking to view the in-game models in detail.</p>
<p>As an RTS game, there wasn't strictly a need to make the models so exquisite, unlike an RPG.</p>
<p>But Chen Xu still decided to strive for perfection. Not to mention comparing it to traditional RPGs or some Linear Game-Type Games.</p>
<p>But at least in the RTS genre, Chen Xu dared to say that globally, there was currently no other game that could compete with <em>Warcraft</em>'s graphics and models.</p>
<p>In this situation, it was only natural to give players a better direct sensory experience.</p>
<p>Of course, units with slightly bold and revealing attire, such as the Human Sorceress and Elf Archer, all had modesty shorts.</p>
<p>In addition, Chen Xu also made some modifications to the campaign.</p>
<p>Because the original campaign was quite difficult for players with poor dexterity; many even used invincibility cheat codes like 'whosyourdaddy' to basic attack their way through.</p>
<p>Of course, Chen Xu also retained these cheat codes, as they were an essential need for some players.</p>
<p>When facing 'maddening enemies,' sometimes cheat codes were needed to regain pride.</p>
<p>Using 'whosyourdaddy' might be a bit excessive, but giving oneself a bit of wood and gold with 'greedisgood 99999' – reasonably speaking, that shouldn't be too much, right?</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Days passed, and just as the buzz around the content in <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> began to gradually cool down,</p>
<p>Chen Xu and Nebula Games' official Weibo account finally made a move.</p>
<p>The content left countless players and industry designers utterly shocked and bewildered.</p>
<p>'Redefining RTS, production cost exceeding 700 million, brand new fantasy blockbuster <em>Warcraft</em> coming soon!'</p>
<p>A simple sentence, accompanied by several pieces of concept art.</p>
<p>Tyrande Whisperwind riding a White Tiger, Arthas as a Paladin, Cairne Bloodhoof the Tauren Chieftain wielding a runic spear and carrying a totem, and a Frost Dragon with outstretched wings.</p>
<p>As Chen Xu's official Weibo post went live, it instantly grabbed a lot of attention.</p>
<p>After all, the previous content in <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> and <em>Minecraft</em> had kept many players very interested and concerned.</p>
<p>Many had also speculated about Chen Xu's new work, wondering if there would be one, and what it might be.</p>
<p>But at this very moment, the content revealed in this announcement instantly bewildered countless players.</p>
<p>Redefining, RTS, production cost exceeding 700 million?</p>
<p>What! ?</p>
<p>The combination of these keywords instantly caused its popularity to explode.</p>
<p>"Holy crap! Mr. Chen released a new game again?!"</p>
<p>"It's actually RTS, I didn't see wrong, did I?!"</p>
<p>"This concept art has something! This elf girl riding a White Tiger is so beautiful, I could drool!"</p>
<p>"Redefining RTS? 700 million cost, you must be bragging!"</p>
<p>"I didn't see wrong, did I? RTS, and the cost exceeds 700 million?"</p>
<p>Following Chen Xu's official Weibo post, the entire gaming community, players and designers alike, immediately erupted in excitement.</p>
<p>Chen Xu's new game actually became the less critical point.</p>
<p>The truly critical points were those keywords that followed.</p>
<p>Redefining RTS—Chen Xu actually dared to say that!?</p>
<p>You have to know that while RTS isn't exactly niche, and its basic concept is simple, it's definitely not easy to do well.</p>
<p>Players' reactions weren't as strong, mainly because of the accumulated reputation of Nebula Games and Chen Xu, which made players quite trusting.</p>
<p>Although Chen Xu always gave them 'shocks', there was no shortage of joy.</p>
<p>And as for the cost, players didn't care too much; what they cared about was whether the game was fun or not.</p>
<p>But judging from the current situation, players had clearly gotten used to it; this was another one of Chen Xu's 'making grand promises' phases.</p>
<p>For players, they were more concerned about why Chen Xu would make an RTS game, as they had thought it would be an RPG or action game.</p>
<p>But for the gaming industry, it felt a bit absurd.</p>
<p>It wasn't that Chen Xu was making an RTS game, but rather the publicity around the cost.</p>
<p>Generally, in game development, sometimes costs would indeed be disclosed for promotional purposes; of course, some were true and some were false.</p>
<p>But the cost of your <em>Warcraft</em> from Nebula Games, isn't that a bit excessive?</p>
<p>An RTS game, and you publicly announce a development cost of 700 million? If you said project cost, that would be acceptable, as subsequent promotion and everything else would be added in.</p>
<p>But just for development, you spent over 700 million?</p>
<p>Is your game made of gold?</p>
<p>However, some perceptive designers did notice the deeper implication of Chen Xu's RTS game.</p>
