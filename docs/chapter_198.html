                <h1>Chapter 298: Entertainment-filled RPG Maps (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h1>
<p>Just like when they first encountered <em>Warcraft</em>, many players were filled with novelty upon entering the RPG maps.</p>
<p>The same scene unfolded for other players.</p>
<p>After experiencing these <em>Warcraft</em> maps with different attributes, players quickly discovered their unique fun.</p>
<p>Each map had its own characteristics, but they shared one common feature.</p>
<p>Unlike <em>Warcraft</em>'s inherent RTS gameplay, players essentially only needed to control one unit.</p>
<p>They didn't have to worry about anything else.</p>
<p>This greatly reduced the game's operations.</p>
<p>In particular, some players who couldn't fully appreciate the fun of RTS in <em>Warcraft</em> instead found enjoyment in these distinct RPG maps.</p>
<p>Especially when playing <em>Warcraft</em> before, they basically valued every unit highly. Faced with low-health units, they often wouldn't send them to their deaths directly, but would instead preserve them or restore their health with healing potions.</p>
<p>Because units were truly precious in <em>Warcraft</em>; what died wasn't common soldiers but money.</p>
<p>However, in RPG maps, the hero's existence is primarily emphasized, with one skill often wiping out a large group of common soldiers.</p>
<p>This gave players an indescribable sense of exhilaration.</p>
<p>Before this, <em>Warcraft</em> had given them the impression of a hardcore RTS.</p>
<p>But now, they felt the same sensation as playing a story campaign, only even more exhilarating.</p>
<p>After all, the story campaign itself was also responsible for familiarizing players with the basic concepts of <em>Warcraft</em>'s RTS gameplay, so it couldn't be completely unrestrained.</p>
<p>But now?</p>
<p>These RPG maps had no such concerns at all.</p>
<p>The sense of exhilaration from cultivation and growth was instantly unleashed, getting players addicted to these maps.</p>
