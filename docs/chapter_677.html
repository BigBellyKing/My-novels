                <p>Chapter 676 Elizabeth is Dead!? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>At this moment, Song Ren finally understood what was going on.</p>
<p>From the moment he entered Rapture, Atlas's every request to Jack included the phrase 'would you kindly'.</p>
<p>Even more terrifying, Song Ren remembered the sticky note on the gift box Jack saw on the plane when he first started the game, which also began with the same phrase: would you kindly.</p>
<p>So the plane crash was no accident at all.</p>
<p>It was a premeditated event.</p>
<p>Jack's arrival in Rapture was predetermined; he was under control when he hijacked the plane, leading to its crash.</p>
<p>This also explained why only Jack survived on the plane.</p>
<p>This truth struck Song Ren like a thunderbolt.</p>
<p>He had originally thought he had absolute control over the protagonist.</p>
<p>But in the end, he discovered that it was all just an illusion created by the game.</p>
<p>Scalp-numbing, that was the first feeling for all players who reached this point.</p>
<p>“I can't believe such a reversal! So Jack was a tool-man from beginning to end?” Song Ren was utterly shocked.</p>
<p>What kind of divine twist was this?</p>
<p>Players had always joked that the protagonist they played was just a tool-man.</p>
<p>In the world of Dark Souls, they hunted Lords of Cinder to Link the Fire.</p>
<p>In Red Dead Redemption, they risked life and limb for Dutch's Tahiti.</p>
<p>In the Monster Hunter world, on the surface, we were the Azure Star guiding the way, the White Wind of the New World, but in reality, we did all the dirty and hard work ourselves.</p>
<p>But in the story of BioShock: Rapture.</p>
<p>Jack truly was a bona fide tool-man!</p>
<p>But the story was far from over, because the truth had yet to be fully uncovered.</p>
<p>The entire content flow of BioShock: Rapture was relatively long.</p>
<p>During this process, Song Ren, besides Jack, also experienced the stories of Booker and Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Before, Song Ren had many questions, and now, with Andrew Ryan revealing the massive secret of the command 'would you kindly,' the plot fully unravelled the complete content and secrets of BioShock: Rapture for Song Ren.</p>
<p>After killing Andrew Ryan, Atlas ordered Jack to shut down the city's self-destruct system.</p>
<p>At the same time, Atlas's true identity surfaced.</p>
<p>“Well done, little guy! It's time to end this masquerade.”</p>
<p>“There never was an Atlas, kid. Never. My line of work required all sorts of disguises.”</p>
<p>“You've been a good puppet, and I suppose I should tell you the truth: I am Frank Fontaine!”</p>
<p>“Now that machine has temporarily destroyed your genetic key, but you've also killed Ryan. Now I will take over every inch of this place.”</p>
<p>“And kid, when you see Ryan, don't forget to thank him for me.”</p>
<p>The scene switched to Elizabeth's side.</p>
<p>Combined with the various clues gathered by Atlas and from two different timelines, all the truth was revealed.</p>
<p>Atlas and Fontaine were the same person!</p>
<p>The King of Crime in Rapture!</p>
<p>Years before the unrest in Rapture, a big-shot showgirl in Rapture, pregnant with the city's leader Ryan's child, wanted to secretly abort it.</p>
<p>But this news was discovered by Fontaine, who had always wanted to overthrow Ryan. So he paid a hefty price for the child in her womb, because this child had Ryan's DNA.</p>
<p>And most facilities in Rapture required Ryan's DNA command to operate smoothly.</p>
<p>This child could become the ace up his sleeve to take over Rapture in the future.</p>
<p>Thus, under Fontaine's orders, Dr. Yi used emotional linkage and mind control technology, learned from the sky city Columbia, to brainwash and modify the boy.</p>
<p>Large amounts of genetic drugs made Jack grow rapidly, just like Booker, who aged from frequently using the space machine. In just a few years, he transformed from an infant into an adult, and with great effort, Fontaine sent Jack out of Rapture, having arranged everything.</p>
<p>As for the key to controlling the boy's mind, it was that short phrase: would you kindly.</p>
<p>However, before this plan could be implemented, Fontaine was cornered by Ryan and imprisoned in a building.</p>
<p>Until Elizabeth appeared.</p>
<p>To kill the last Booker and end Comstock's fate line, Elizabeth entered Rapture, guiding Booker to recover his memories.</p>
<p>At the same time, to save Sally, who had become a Little Sister and fallen into Fontaine's hands, Elizabeth, having glimpsed the future, helped Fontaine retrieve Dr. Yi's trump card.</p>
<p>The next moment, Song Ren's perspective switched to Elizabeth's story.</p>
<p>Having successfully obtained the trump card, Elizabeth, with a piece of paper, handed it to Fontaine.</p>
<p>“You know what? Andrew Ryan said I was a fool, but he was wrong. I'm not a fool, you are.”</p>
<p>“Now what? We both know what's going to happen next, so let it come.”</p>
<p>At this moment, Elizabeth looked directly at Fontaine in front of her. She had remembered her lost memories, and even a smile appeared on her face.</p>
<p>In Fontaine's brutal torture with a wrench, Elizabeth's vision showed the plane and Jack on the plane.</p>
<p>Facing Fontaine, who was furious at not understanding the code in the cipher, Elizabeth, lying in a pool of blood, chose not to conceal it, but directly told Fontaine the password key.</p>
<p>“It says… would you kindly.”</p>
<p>Fontaine, ecstatic at receiving the final password, left Elizabeth and Sally behind.</p>
<p>“We have the activation code. Now all we have to do is put that freak on the plane, and then Rapture is ours… hahaha!” Fontaine left ecstatically with the password.</p>
<p>The camera in the game blurred with bloodstains, and Elizabeth's eyes showed the scenes she had once seen.</p>
<p>“Man chooses, slave obeys.” The scene of Andrew Ryan making Jack kill him with a golf club appeared.</p>
<p>“To save one person is to save the whole world, and you are their savior.” Dr. Tennen's plea to Jack to save the Little Sisters in Rapture appeared.</p>
<p>“I saw the doors and the future behind them. Behind one of them, unbelievably, I saw him!”</p>
<p>As Elizabeth whispered, Booker appeared in the frame at the coastal port.</p>
<p>Booker gently grasped Sally, whom she had adopted.</p>
<p>The next moment, the camera returned to Rapture, where Sally, now a Little Sister, gently grasped Elizabeth's hand and stroked her own face.</p>
<p>But Elizabeth had closed her eyes forever.</p>
<p>All of this was part of the plan, just as the resistance leader Daisy's death had fostered Elizabeth's mental growth, thus truly resolving Comstock's fate from the source.</p>
<p>Now it was Elizabeth's turn, guiding destiny back to the path she had foreseen, to save the Little Sisters in Rapture through Jack's hand, and to abolish this seemingly beautiful but incredibly sinful underwater city.</p>
<p>But at this moment, Song Ren in the game, or rather, all players, were dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Dead… she died!</p>
<p>Elizabeth died!?</p>
