                <p>Chapter 220: Is This the Game We Were Playing? (Please subscribe and vote monthly)</p>
<p>After this official Weibo post, the comment section under the video and the player community forums instantly erupted.</p>
<p>Innumerable players frantically reposted and left messages to express their inner excitement.</p>
<p>“Tell me, this isn’t real! This must be a CG animation!”</p>
<p>“So this was actually made in Minecraft?”</p>
<p>“Holy crap, this is too damn amazing! If that’s the case, can other buildings and structures be replicated in Minecraft too?”</p>
<p>“I’m impressed! This is completely different from the game I’m playing!”</p>
<p>“I suddenly want to log on and try my hand at it. Why didn’t they release this before the trial?”</p>
<p>“Exactly! Suddenly I’m interested in this game again! I think if they had released this before the trial, I definitely wouldn’t have just made a dark room!”</p>
<p>“Heh heh, it’s nothing special. Give us a hundred years, and we can definitely build it too!”</p>
<p>“Please don’t use the word ‘us,’ because I definitely don’t think I can build it!”</p>
<p>“I can only describe it with two words: Holy cow!”</p>
<p>“Awesome, that’s all! But this shouldn’t have been built by just one person, right?”</p>
<p>“Definitely more than one person! If it were just one, the workload would be enormous. Didn’t you see the fast-edited video at the end? It’s clearly a collaboration of many people!”</p>
<p>“This workload is too big and requires many people, but what about smaller-scale projects?!”</p>
<p>“Is this still the pixel game I know? It feels even better than some AAA-tier games!”</p>
<p>“Exactly!”</p>
<p>Despite Minecraft itself being a pixel game, this doesn't mean Minecraft is ugly.</p>
<p>On the contrary, unlike its previous incarnation, the Minecraft developed by Chen Xu had absolutely no cut corners in its art direction. There was no cost control; pixels were merely an artistic adjustment made for the sake of the game's gameplay. The in-game modeling, lighting, and shadows were all top-notch. If you looked at a single block, it might be hard to perceive. But when used to create large buildings and architectural complexes, that feeling immediately came to life.</p>
<p>This also stunned countless online players after watching the video.</p>
<p>Originally, in everyone's impression, Minecraft should have been a simple block-building game, at most with added survival elements. For instance, these points were experienced by everyone in the previous early access trial. There was nothing too surprising.</p>
<p>Although some players had already built some relatively nice ordinary small houses during that early access trial, it didn't bring players much shock or anticipation. After all, the time was too short, and it was difficult to see the game's full potential. But what was shown in this wave of videos was completely different.</p>
<p>What the heck is this?! They actually recreated the Along the River During the Qingming Festival in the game?</p>
<p>Was this still the game they knew?!</p>
<p>It wasn't just the curious players; even some game designers in the gaming industry were shocked after seeing the Minecraft promotional video. A block-building game could be like this?</p>
<p>Chen Xu already had a complete promotion and marketing strategy for Minecraft. Everything before could only be considered a warm-up; now was the true promotion of Minecraft. Amidst the players' astonishment and Nebula Games' various distribution channels, many industry designers noticed Minecraft's popularity skyrocketing. It even broke out of its niche and topped the trending topics on the official Weibo account. Even the official account of the Game Department reposted it that day.</p>
<p>And besides various gaming media reposting it, even many non-gaming media outlets also reposted it. The viewership of the promotional video rapidly increased, reaching 15 million views in just one day.</p>
<p>Before this, it wasn't that no games had broken out of their niche, but those games' breakouts didn't have much to do with the games themselves. But Minecraft was completely different.</p>
<p>Recreating the Along the River During the Qingming Festival in the game was the main focus of media reports. It mainly took the angle of promoting traditional culture, but the key point was that this recreation itself was a gameplay feature of Minecraft. As a result, many people who hadn't even played the game knew there was a game that could reproduce the Along the River During the Qingming Festival from a thousand years ago. This also sparked people's imagination: if the Along the River During the Qingming Festival could be recreated, what about other buildings and scenes?</p>
<p>In fact, they didn't have to wait too long. Because just three days after this promotional video was released, Chen Xu uploaded another video on the official Weibo account.</p>
<p>And this time, the scene displayed was the famous Forbidden City. With their previous experience of the Along the River During the Qingming Festival, countless players were even more excited this time. They clicked into it almost impatiently.</p>
<p>And the video's display did not disappoint them. Raindrops fell from the gloomy sky, sparsely landing on the walls of the Forbidden City. The camera slowly moved towards the Forbidden City's gates, revealing tranquil groves of trees and pavilions, magnificent glazed roof tiles, white jade stairs, and Nine-Dragon relief sculptures. The backyard pond and stone bridge, red pillars, golden glazed tiles... Piece by piece, it showed players what this incredibly grand architecture looked like in Minecraft.</p>
<p>The popularity of the Along the River During the Qingming Festival hadn't fully subsided, not even cooled down. This time, the release of the 'Forbidden City' was like adding fuel to the fire. It caused Minecraft's popularity to surge instantly.</p>
<p>All the designers in the entire gaming industry were dumbfounded. Undoubtedly, this was the promotional tactic Chen Xu employed. More crucially, they had absolutely no way to replicate this promotion. Because this was entirely a characteristic of Minecraft! And it also came with a BUFF of promoting traditional culture, allowing it to break out of its niche even further.</p>
<p>Meng Zuo, who had been following Minecraft, finally understood what Chen Xu meant by his previous words when he saw this situation. With a move like this, who could possibly compete with you for popularity?!</p>
<p>In the Voyage project room, Zhu Yi was now in a dilemma. If he went ahead, Minecraft's popularity was simply heaven-defying. The upcoming Voyage's popularity had been completely crushed; apart from players who had been following it previously, it essentially couldn't make a ripple. But if he retreated, being embarrassed wasn't really the issue. After all, if they could achieve good sales, then embarrassment didn't matter. The key was that the promotion had already been done to this extent. If they retreated, it would be a huge loss, and they basically wouldn't get any decent recommendation resources afterward.</p>
<p>“It’s not necessarily over. After all, even though Minecraft’s Along the River During the Qingming Festival and Forbidden City are indeed stunning, isn't it still just block-building gameplay? Relying solely on this gameplay, even if its popularity is high now, Voyage’s content might not necessarily lose!” Zhu Yi comforted himself internally.</p>
<p>However, three days later, Chen Xu once again released a video on the official Weibo account, thoroughly shattering his illusion.</p>
<p>First two updates, the rest later.</p>
