                <p>Chapter 881: Collective Bewilderment</p>
<p>Yang Xin, emerging from the gaming pod, had yet to calm her emotions. Instead, she looked at Chen Xu with a rather resentful expression.</p>
<p>Evidently, her recent gaming experience had left her feeling a bit hurt. She had initially expected an exhilarating, showing off experience, but only the first few minutes were like that. The rest of the time, she was brutally beaten. Although it was just a game and couldn't convey physical pain to the player, the key was that the psychological contrast was difficult to bear!</p>
<p>“Ahem! Don’t look like that. Tell me about your experience,” Chen Xu said, clearing his throat and changing the subject as he looked at Yang Xin’s expression.</p>
<p>“Compared to previous VR, the most direct point is comfort. First, the audio-visual effects are more stunning, and second, with the latest technology, playing VR games isn’t as tiring,” Yang Xin began, sharing her thoughts. In the past, VR games generally required significant mental concentration; even though the body was lying down, the mind would be exhausted.</p>
<p>However, the technology integrated into the latest VR allows players’ minds to relax, even entering a state similar to light sleep. Most people have experienced that hazy, half-awake feeling, especially middle and high school students who prop their chins on their hands during class, their eyes involuntarily drooping. Yet, they can still hear what the teacher is saying, and even remember some parts, but they might inadvertently snore. When they are woken up, they still feel like they haven't slept at all.</p>
<p>The latest VR gaming pod allows players to enter this mode, but it’s not a passive state caused by drowsiness. More simply put, it's like a computer's screensaver standby state.</p>
<p>“As for the rest, it’s not as important. It’s mainly about more comprehensive vibration feedback and such. As for the olfactory system, it's not really usable right now because it's all negative olfactory sensations,” Yang Xin said.</p>
<p>The olfactory system in the VR gaming pod certainly enhances immersion, but what kind of heavy-tasting player would want to experience the smell of feces, urine, or rotten meat? When playing Dark Souls and throwing Dung Pie at people from your inventory, would sniffing that pungent smell really be comfortable?</p>
<p>It will only truly be applicable when it can simulate the fragrance of various flowers or the oily aroma of roasting meat. Of course, this might turn many players into annoying teammates. For example, when playing Monster Hunter late at night, everyone eats a Felyne Canteen meal before fighting a dragon, but after eating, only the captain is left, and the rest of the team collectively logs off to eat out.</p>
<hr />
<p>May 1st, a Labor Day holiday.</p>
<p>Most people were contemplating whether to go out and play during the three-day holiday or stay at home playing games and binge-watching shows.</p>
<p>They thought it would be like any other holiday.</p>
<p>However, a piece of explosive news completely changed everything.</p>
<p>“Next-Gen VR Gaming Pod Press Conference Held! The True Next-Gen is Coming!”</p>
<p>Headlines of countless tech and game-related media websites were dominated by this single announcement. The news instantly caused an uproar across the internet.</p>
<p>“Holy crap! Is this real? A new round of next-gen gaming pod development is out? Hypnotic immersive experience?”</p>
<p>“It must be real! This wasn’t announced by some random company, but officially by the Game Department! How could it be fake?”</p>
<p>“This is a bombshell! Why was there no hint of it before?”</p>
<p>“Overseas, there were mentions of next-gen VR gaming pods, but no data was released. Are we already selling ours?”</p>
<p>The impact of this news was nuclear-level, spreading across the globe instantly.</p>
<p>What excited countless players even more was the lineup. A host of top domestic game developers, along with overseas developers from the Huanyu Faction, specifically developed escort masterpieces to build momentum for the next-gen VR gaming pod.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Nebula Games was the most prominent among them. Three escort masterpieces, tailor-made for the next-gen VR gaming pod, directly maximized the anticipation in countless players’ hearts.</p>
<p>Especially according to some leaked rumors, these three games chose their themes based on different game audience regions. This made players even more excited.</p>
<p>Amidst these players' anticipation, the fastest-developing Persona also unveiled its corresponding promotional trailer for the first time, coinciding with the next-gen VR gaming pod’s press conference.</p>
<p>But the content of this trailer left many bewildered.</p>
<hr />
<p>First to appear on screen was Ren Amamiya, incarcerated and holding a sign.</p>
<p>‘Is everything arranged this way?’</p>
<p>‘Before things get out of hand, it must be dealt with.’</p>
<p>The next second, in a prison interrogation room, Ren Amamiya, his face scarred from torture, sat with his hands clasped on a chair. Though heavily scarred, he maintained a composed demeanor, even crossing his legs.</p>
<p>‘When and where did you learn about that world?’</p>
<p>‘If you don't agree, then you will be sentenced to… death!’</p>
<p>As a mature female voice spoke, Ren Amamiya, who had been looking down, slowly raised his scarred face, revealing a surprisingly enigmatic smile.</p>
<p>The next moment, the scene shifted to a gigantic castle. Joker, transformed into a phantom thief, used a chain to grapple onto iron bars and leaped upwards.</p>
<p>‘Changing cognition… it can reach that extent?’</p>
<p>Inside the magnificent palace, countless mechanisms and demons and monsters from various mythologies were present.</p>
<p>‘I just said it, didn’t I? If you cause any problems, it’s expulsion!’</p>
<p>‘That scumbag is a demon, I absolutely don’t want to become an adult like that!’</p>
<p>Giant demons wielding wine glasses and swords engaged in combat with Joker and his companions.</p>
<p>‘If it’s us, we can definitely make him repent!’</p>
<p>The principal walked down the street, clutching his chest.</p>
<p>‘Humans have a peculiar ability: through self-hypnosis, they can gradually become the person they want to be!’</p>
<p>The next instant, the scene moved to a prison cell, where Ren Amamiya, in a school uniform and glasses, was pressed against a wall.</p>
<p>‘Good… I hear your resolve! Let us make a contract! I am thou, thou art I… Thou who art willing to commit any sacrilege for the sake of justice in which you believe! Release that rage and my name! Release the power of that unwavering will, which seeks to ascertain all truth, even if it means descending into hell!’</p>
<p>Following this was a series of quick cuts: working part-time in Shibuya and other cities, watching movies, eating burgers, and fishing. Then, attending classes at school and fighting monsters in various bizarre locations.</p>
<p>Finally, the screen went black.</p>
<p>‘The time has come. Your rehabilitation is about to begin… Welcome to…’</p>
<p>‘My Velvet Room!’</p>
<p>A bald monster with bloodshot eyes and a Pinocchio-like nose looked strangely at the player on the screen.</p>
<p>The voice faded, and the video ended.</p>
<p>The Persona and Nebula Games logos appeared at the end.</p>
<p>Players who watched this promotional trailer were collectively bewildered.</p>
<p>Because this short two-minute trailer left them completely unsure of what kind of game this actually was.</p>
