                <p>Chapter 25: Million Sales</p>
<p>'Thanks to the support of all players, Undertale's sales have surpassed 500,000.'</p>
<p>After Chen Xu's official Weibo account posted this, some independent game designers and media who followed Chen Xu were stunned.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they seemed to have seen a similar official Weibo message in the past. It broke 100,000 sales in three days after launch, and now, only a week later, sales have surpassed 500,000?</p>
<p>This growth is terrifying, isn't it?</p>
<p>As a result, a new batch of articles about Undertale appeared online.</p>
<p>'Sales Exceed 500,000 in 10 Days! Rating as High as 9.7!'</p>
<p>'A Must-Play Title for Gamers! An Independent Gaming Masterpiece!'</p>
<p>'Subverting Players' Perceptions of RPGs! A Unique RPG'</p>
<p>'An Incredibly Shocking Game!'</p>
<p>For independent game designers in the industry, some who hadn't paid much attention before now began to study Undertale.</p>
<p>If positive reviews weren't enough to convince them, the concrete sales figures for Undertale clearly showed that this model had market potential.</p>
<p>As for the media, since they had already published similar articles, they simply reused them, changed the titles, and were done.</p>
<p>These game media uniformly praised it, as Undertale was simply phenomenal.</p>
<p>It had both reputation and sales, and its overall quality was impeccable.</p>
<p>Coupled with its unique META game setting, it amazed countless players and designers.</p>
<p>With such a game, it was difficult to find an angle even if one wanted to criticize it.</p>
<p>Under the media's bombardment, Undertale's popularity began to soar.</p>
<p>Although the game's sales had already surpassed 500,000.</p>
<p>With such a reputation and unique hot topics, it was clear that 500,000 sales would not be the game's endpoint.</p>
<p>At the same time, such immense popularity led many players who had been watching the spectacle to visit Zhong Mei's official Weibo account.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, his previous Weibo messages had already been deleted.</p>
<p>Moreover, he had directly closed comments on his official Weibo.</p>
<p>It could be said that this guy's public image was truly poor.</p>
<p>Now Undertale was absolutely exploding in popularity, and players, whether they had opinions about it or were simply watching the show, naturally couldn't let it go.</p>
<p>Especially some players who had played Mirror (Game) previously were full of fighting spirit.</p>
<p>Although he deleted messages and closed comments, Chen Xu's official Weibo messages were still there.</p>
<p>So, many players rushed to Chen Xu's previous official Weibo post and started tagging Zhong Mei in various ways.</p>
<p>'@Zhong Mei, Teacher Zhong, hurry up and criticize Undertale! Games are art! How can such a game be allowed to show off its might?!'</p>
<p>'@Zhong Mei, Teacher Zhong, come out and say a few words! Blooming (Game) will definitely crush Undertale, right? What? Sales have only just exceeded 50,000? I don't believe it! Teacher Zhong's game is art, these players must not understand how to appreciate it, it's not that the game is bad, it's that these players are bad!'</p>
<p>'@Zhong Mei, Teacher Zhong, keep going! What you said back then was excellent!'</p>
<p>Under Chen Xu's few official Weibo messages, there were all sorts of messages tagging Zhong Mei, with some representative sarcastic replies receiving thousands of likes.</p>
<p>As for Zhong Mei now?</p>
<p>Two words: playing dead.</p>
<p>In reality, he really didn't want to.</p>
<p>But the key was that there was no way!</p>
<p>In his original concept, his ultimate skill was to leverage his strengths against his opponent's weaknesses.</p>
<p>'If your sales are higher than mine, I'll talk about reputation with you.'</p>
<p>'If your reputation is better than mine, I'll talk about art with you.'</p>
<p>'If you have more artistic merit than me, I'll talk about sales with you.'</p>
<p>'If all else fails, I can be a bit thick-skinned and compare game playtime with you.'</p>
<p>'In short, I'll compare what I'm better at with you.'</p>
<p>But now it wouldn't work!</p>
<p>Damn it, he was crushed in every aspect.</p>
<p>He couldn't possibly say that his Blooming (Game) sold for 40 Yuan, which was 4 Yuan more expensive than your Undertale, could he?</p>
<p>So, Zhong Mei decided to play dead!</p>
<p>He didn't believe that Chen Xu could make another excellent game in his next project.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>Under the attention of the entire gaming community, Undertale's various metrics continued to soar.</p>
<p>Thanks to Undertale's excellent reputation, the subsequent growth rate remained very stable.</p>
<p>When Chen Xu publicly announced that Undertale's sales had surpassed 500,000, the sales trend was still maintaining an upward trajectory.</p>
<p>On August 15th, exactly one month after Undertale's official launch.</p>
<p>Total sales finally broke through 1 million, achieving an accomplishment that Mirror (Game) had not reached before.</p>
<p>First-month sales of a million – this news instantly stunned countless independent game designers.</p>
<p>With Undertale priced at 36 Yuan, even if most sales came from third-party platforms within just one month, it was enough for Chen Xu's revenue to exceed ten million Yuan.</p>
<p>Not to mention that during this period, Mirror (Game)'s DLC was also released and sold quite a bit.</p>
<p>Putting Mirror (Game) aside, Undertale's sales could be said to stem entirely from its excellent story and design.</p>
<p>This led countless game designers to analyze Undertale's characteristics and points of success.</p>
<p>For Nebula Games, which was just starting, Undertale's success brought both fame and fortune.</p>
<p>Furthermore, compared to his previous life, the Undertale in this Parallel World achieved a million sales in its first month relying solely on the domestic market, which Chen Xu reflected upon.</p>
<p>Firstly, there was the environment of the Parallel World. Just as in his previous life, console platforms were relatively niche domestically, while PC and mobile game platforms were mainstream.</p>
<p>The Parallel World's game market was much larger than in his previous life. Although his previous life's domestic market boasted 700 million players, there was too much exaggeration in that number.</p>
<p>However, the Parallel World was different; even setting aside the overseas market, the domestic market alone was quite formidable.</p>
<p>After all, it was the world's most populous country.</p>
<p>Secondly, compared to his previous life, Chen Xu had greatly optimized the visual presentation.</p>
<p>After all, in his previous life, Undertale was just the work of a single independent game developer, created with crowdfunding.</p>
<p>Both manpower and funds were very limited.</p>
<p>For a game, good visual presentation is definitely a bonus, not a drawback.</p>
<p>After all, there are only players who can't get into a game because the graphics are too poor, but never players who don't want to play because the graphics are too good.</p>
<p>It could be said that Undertale's current sales performance had already made Chen Xu very satisfied.</p>
<p>As for the overseas market, because the policies in the Parallel World were different from his previous life, he hadn't considered it in the short term.</p>
<p>Mirror (Game) hadn't passed domestic review at all and was launched on an overseas official platform; although it was official, its nature was completely different from Undertale.</p>
<p>Undertale, on the other hand, had already been launched on domestic platforms.</p>
