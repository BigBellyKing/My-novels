                <p>Chapter 61: Overcooked</p>
<p>Unlike films, which have New Year's and summer release seasons, the gaming industry is different.</p>
<p>This is primarily because for movies, audiences need to go to cinemas. As for games, whether they are PC games or VR games, players only need to have the equipment.</p>
<p>The only thing to note is VR games, as their costs are high after all. Furthermore, for VR games that offer a good experience, like equipment such as gaming pods, individual users are still relatively few. More often, they are found in experience stores, similar to internet cafes. Therefore, this aspect of gaming is completely different from the so-called film release seasons.</p>
<p>However, despite this, it's not as frantic as the film industry. In reality, there's still a lot of competition. Many game developers and designers still pay close attention to this period. After all, excluding professions like teachers and students who haven't entered society, for ordinary players, this can be said to be the biggest holiday after the National Day holiday. At the same time, during the New Year, most people's wallets can be said to be a bit fatter than usual. Naturally, this period is highly valued by game developers, leading to fierce competition. Major game platforms offer discounts, some online multiplayer games run events, and some developers and designers release new titles, including VR blockbusters.</p>
<p>For Chen Xu, developing a large-scale game in the next two months would certainly be too late. But it's also impossible to do nothing. Although there were no internal projects after the completion of <em>Outlast</em>, in reality, the work for various departments was far from little. On the platform side, it goes without saying, there's various follow-ups and external information gathering, including feedback from platform users. Although the number of users is small, the corresponding data that should exist still does. While <em>Outlast</em> has been completed, it doesn't mean there's no work left. After development was complete, based on some experiences during <em>Outlast</em>'s development, such as various action parameters, the team was also conducting adjustments and tests on the Official Game Engine. Although it can be said that compared to the official game engine tools of his previous life, productivity has greatly increased, this thing isn't a panacea. It's like sculpting figures with modeling clay; some turn out beautifully, others are incredibly ugly. Therefore, Chen Xu would also develop a transitional project next, partly to allow the team to summarize and digest, and partly due to insufficient time. Moreover, judging from players' current online reviews, it seems there's some misunderstanding about him. Coupled with the fact that this year's Chinese New Year's Eve is much later than previous years, and there's a special holiday, 'Valentine's Day', falling right during the Spring Festival. According to current film schedules in the entertainment industry, many romance movies are lined up. However, there isn't a single one in the gaming sector. He would just fill this void. He needed to give those couples celebrating the Spring Festival a big surprise!</p>
<p>"A couple's game! And coincidentally, we can promote our own Nebula Games platform through player discount strategies. Kill two birds with one stone!" After chatting with Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue for a while, Chen Xu leaned back in his office chair, looking at the keywords he had marked earlier, and an idea began to form in his mind. Coincidentally, he also had a great game for cultivating harmonious relationships between couples, which could serve as this transitional work, and perhaps even reap quite a few Emotion Points from players. Opening his computer, Chen Xu created a new folder, then pulled out a sheet of drawing paper and a pencil from a nearby drawer to do some simple sketching. Soon, simple character designs appeared on the paper. Cartoon-style characters: the Onion King, the Crocodile Chef, the Dog Chef, and the Bearded Chef, as well as a dog named Kevin with a bell. After simply outlining some of the main characters, Chen Xu began writing the concept drafts for the new game's design. <em>Overcooked</em> (also known as <em>Hu Nao Chu Fang</em> in Chinese, literally "Noisy Kitchen") was the casual simulation game Chen Xu planned to develop next. For Chen Xu and the Nebula Games team, the development difficulty of <em>Overcooked</em> was not great.</p>
<p>It required far fewer resources than <em>Outlast</em>. However, the resources would obviously need to be remade. After all, the art style of <em>Overcooked</em> was different from the several games Chen Xu had made before. This was a cartoon-style game. It was also one of the best cooperative games. It was considered one of the typical representatives of this genre. Its cute and adorable art style gave the game a very wide audience; in terms of art style, whether people liked it or not, they probably wouldn't hate it. Moreover, the game's origin itself possessed significant characteristics of an Independent Game. Because the game was developed by only two people, and when the game was about to be released, the two of them only had enough money for a £13 lunch. Yet, after its release, the game quickly sold nearly 2 million copies in a short period. And it earned a nomination for Best Multiplayer Game at The Game Awards that year. Making it a unique series. As for the Parallel World, there were some related cooperative games, but they mostly lacked significant distinguishing features. Once the game genre was chosen, the next step was to decide which installment to make. <em>Overcooked 1</em>, as the series' debut, was a huge success, establishing the game's art and gameplay style. However, it still had quite a few flaws, such as no online multiplayer, fewer maps, and some operational issues. <em>Overcooked 2</em>, on the other hand, was a very successful title, fixing many problems based on the original and retaining its unique gameplay. As for <em>Overcooked! All You Can Eat</em>, apart from the graphics, there wasn't much innovation; it merely added some relatively appropriate new player tutorials and assistance. It could be said to be a collection, still containing content from 1 and 2. After a brief consideration, Chen Xu quickly made his decision. He would primarily base it on <em>Overcooked 2</em>, utilizing its fundamental settings, gameplay, and associated art style. With some adjustments to the UI and visual effects. At the same time, he would incorporate some excellent maps. As for the story, this part really wasn't crucial. After all, the story of the <em>Overcooked</em> series was essentially just a backdrop. Just like Nintendo's games in his previous life, whether it was Mario or Zelda, the goal was always to rescue the princess and defeat the Great Demon King. For these non-story-driven games, the levels were the main core. However, for now, the entire game framework still needed to be built first. At the same time, compared to the <em>Overcooked</em> of his previous life, Chen Xu was also preparing to make some new changes to the game's content. This could also be considered a test of the platform's features. <em>Undertale</em>, <em>Outlast</em>, and <em>To the Moon</em>—these three games had been launched on their own Nebula Games Platform. But there was one feature that hadn't been utilized yet. That was the Workshop feature within the platform. This was mainly because the characteristics of those three games were destined not to align with it. <em>Overcooked</em>, on the other hand, was an excellent experimental example. Because it was inherently a level-driven game. If it could be combined with the features of the Workshop, from the perspective of game content, it could be made even better than in his previous life. It just required a good deal of organization and planning in the interim.</p>
