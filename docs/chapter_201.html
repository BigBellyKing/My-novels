                <p>Chapter 301: Rainbow Six Siege (6th Update, Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu's words, Meng Zuo, sitting there, had a dumbfounded expression.</p>
<p>The game background and gameplay are already complete?</p>
<p>Although it was just a rough idea, hearing it filled him with a sense of immense excitement.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, this was a game completely different from ordinary FPS games.</p>
<p>This would definitely be a more hardcore game.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, so-called counter-terrorism games in the industry primarily revolve around firearms.</p>
<p>The 'tactics,' on the other hand, usually focus on throwable items.</p>
<p>Combining with the map's characteristics, throwable items like flashbangs, incendiary grenades, and smoke grenades are used.</p>
<p>But in essence, these games are still a competition of marksmanship.</p>
<p>However, judging from the game content Chen Xu had just described, Meng Zuo, as a Game Designer, could clearly grasp Chen Xu's intention.</p>
<p>That is, this still unnamed game would be a tactics-focused game.</p>
<p>"But balance will be a relatively important core point. After all, even though we're making it for specialized military use, we still need to consider the player market," Meng Zuo said to Chen Xu.</p>
<p>This was also a critical core point.</p>
<p>As a game marketed on its counter-terrorism process content, and judging by its gameplay, it would clearly be a multiplayer competitive game.</p>
<p>Thus, balance was an unavoidable core issue.</p>
<p>If provided to the military, it could lean towards unrestricted realism.</p>
<p>For example, getting hit by a single bullet would essentially incapacitate someone, or render them completely useless.</p>
<p>This was a consideration of real-world scenarios, and the version exclusively for the military obviously required realism.</p>
<p>But it couldn't be the same for players.</p>
<p>After all, players were experiencing a game, not 'reality.'</p>
<p>In fact, players were quite contradictory in this regard.</p>
<p>On one hand, players clamored for realism!</p>
<p>"I want enough realism!"</p>
<p>But if you truly listened to the players and made a game incredibly close to reality, you would essentially be met with only one outcome.</p>
<p>Either it would flop spectacularly, or it would become a very, very niche game.</p>
<p>Because in competitive games like this, players sought the positive feedback from kills and victories.</p>
<p>If the game were set so that a single bullet rendered a person useless, then what the heck would players be playing for?</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I've already considered this aspect. You'll understand when the time comes, Teacher Meng," Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Seeing Chen Xu's confident demeanor, Meng Zuo nodded.</p>
<p>"Regarding the relevant procedures, Mr. Chen, could you have someone brief me? I'll handle the Game Department directly," Meng Zuo said to Chen Xu.</p>
<p>It was clear that since Chen Xu spoke this way, he already had a general idea for this unnamed game.</p>
<p>He would just run errands, applying to the Game Department, and arranging for VR development machines and permissions.</p>
<p>As for the game design document, he would let Chen Xu complete it himself.</p>
<p>After all, Nebula Games was leading this game.</p>
<p>As for him leading it?</p>
<p>He wasn't sure if Nebula Games and Chen Xu would agree, but NetDragon certainly wouldn't.</p>
<p>He had a very clear understanding of his 'status in the industry.'</p>
<p>Moreover, Chen Xu was renowned in the gaming industry; truthfully, his games in recent years had seen both hits and misses.</p>
<p>If he could "lie down and win" this time, that would be excellent.</p>
<p>After their discussion, Meng Zuo left Nebula Games, and Chen Xu opened his computer, preparing to write the Concept Drafts.</p>
<p>For Chen Xu, there were quite a few options for FPS games. Many excellent FPS games from his previous life each had their own strengths.</p>
<p>For example, games like 'Battlefield,' 'Call of Duty,' and even 'PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds' and 'Arma.'</p>
<p>If realism was the goal, then Arma was clearly the most suitable among them.</p>
<p>As for entertainment, Battlefield, Call of Duty, and PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds each represented a unique gameplay style.</p>
<p>Large-scale battlefields, pure and exhilarating "pew-pew-pew" action, and battle royale.</p>
<p>But in the end, Chen Xu rejected all these games.</p>
<p>There were three main reasons.</p>
<p>The first reason was that they weren't very suitable for military training.</p>
<p>Among them, Call of Duty was the game that least fit the core requirement.</p>
<p>Next, Battlefield and PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. Battlefield tested the atmosphere of a battlefield and corresponding cooperation.</p>
<p>But crucially, in this era, even real wars wouldn't typically resemble those in Battlefield.</p>
<p>As for PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, it touched upon every aspect a little but wasn't particularly refined in any.</p>
<p>As for Arma, it was quite suitable in terms of realistic training.</p>
<p>But the key was that this game also had to face the player market. With Arma's gameplay experience of traveling for half an hour, potentially dying before even seeing an enemy, Chen Xu could only say that making it a VR version would be too risky.</p>
<p>On the other hand, whether it was Battlefield, Call of Duty, or PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, all were veritable sales monsters.</p>
<p>NetDragon was only a temporary partner, not an insider.</p>
<p>So for Chen Xu, a special game became the primary target.</p>
<p>In his previous life, it was Ubisoft's <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>.</p>
<p>It could be said that Siege's path to success was quite bumpy.</p>
<p>Initially, Rainbow Six Siege not only failed to become a massive hit but also garnered countless criticisms.</p>
<p>The main reasons, besides Ubisoft's distinctive "potato servers" and "bugs"—its two 'local specialties'—were other factors.</p>
<p>What displeased players most was that the Rainbow Six series itself originated from a Tom Clancy anti-terrorism novel, which, much like Call of Duty, naturally involved some blackening of the Russians.</p>
<p>Of course, that wasn't important. What was important was that early Rainbow Six wasn't a multiplayer competitive FPS game; it was a tactics-oriented game, more accurately described as a strategy game.</p>
<p>And concerning Siege, the early special operations were more of a gimmick. Coupled with the removal of single-player levels, it directly caused an uproar among players, ultimately leading to very dismal initial sales and almost resulting in the game flopping spectacularly for a time.</p>
<p>But in the end, Ubisoft, affectionately known by players as "my big brother forever," chose not to abandon the game. Instead, they spent three years patching it up, refining various settings, and even went a full year without updating any content, opting for a complete overhaul.</p>
<p>This greatly improved the quality of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, and that year was when many players in his previous life "got into the game."</p>
<p>Of course, Ubisoft's subsequent handling of Rainbow Six Siege wasn't without its points of criticism from players.</p>
<p>For instance, Ubisoft overly focused on esports-ification, and all changes were derived from this emphasis.</p>
<p>All realistic, common, and classic counter-terrorism operation maps were entirely redesigned into balanced layouts of rooms and corridors.</p>
<p>However, from a game design perspective, this was actually a beneficial change.</p>
<p>Because it made the game more balanced.</p>
<p>As for Chen Xu, he didn't need to overly concern himself with the game's setting.</p>
<p>Optimizing some details based on the settings of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> from his previous life would suffice, as the original version was already very mature.</p>
<p>What Chen Xu was more concerned about was how to better showcase the content of <em>Rainbow Six</em> in VR, and the performance of the specialized version.</p>
