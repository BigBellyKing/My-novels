                <p>Chapter 253: Official Launch (Seventh Update, Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Online, players were still very happy because of Chen Xu's official Weibo post. After all, Chen Xu had directly responded to their feedback. Moreover, many players also noticed a particular detail: a piece of information Chen Xu mentioned in the official Weibo post.</p>
<p>In the later stages of the game, there would be a brand new type of monster: Tempered monsters. According to the explanation, “Tempered” refers to monsters that have endured countless battles, perfectly leveraging Nebula Games' latest AI technology. This garnered considerable attention from many players.</p>
<p>Prior to this, players had already personally experienced the trial version of Monster Hunter: World, since it was free. And during the previous promotions, the AI performance effect that Nebula Games highlighted had also caught the attention of many players. Among them, common creatures like Aptonoth, Kestodon, and Jagras didn't elicit much of a reaction. However, many players felt a distinct difference when facing the Great Jagras.</p>
<p>Compared to low-intelligence creatures like Kestodon and Aptonoth, the Great Jagras genuinely gave people the illusion that it could think. It seemed to genuinely assess the danger posed by hunters or other animals, and then make decisions. Many observant players also discovered that every creature in Monster Hunter: World had its own unique ecological habits and patterns. In simple terms, the Ancient Forest was a self-sustaining world. For instance, the Great Jagras didn't just stay in one spot; although the trial version of Monster Hunter: World's quests only went up to the Great Jagras. Furthermore, the Ancient Forest area was not fully accessible to players. The only explorable area for players was the one provided in the demo. Yet, it was still explorable overall.</p>
<p>Many players also discovered that the Great Jagras in the game wasn't a fixed boss waiting for players to approach. All monsters in the game would roam freely, and they would also hunt. Moreover, their hunting methods varied depending on the creature. For example, when encountering the most docile and frequently hunted Aptonoths, the Great Jagras would typically charge directly, seizing and devouring them without hesitation. However, when facing Kestodons, its approach was different from how it dealt with Aptonoths. Instead, it would first observe from the side, waiting for an opportunity, and more often than not target smaller female Kestodons rather than larger male ones. It also prioritized devouring isolated Kestodons. Because compared to the virtually defenseless Aptonoths, Kestodons in groups and possessing some offensive capabilities posed a clearly greater threat than Aptonoths, and a rash attack could put the Great Jagras in danger.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many players observed that after being attacked, the Great Jagras would flee, but it wouldn't necessarily retreat to its nest every time. Instead, it would flee based on the current map environment. These behaviors were, in fact, mostly in the details. Many players didn't notice them when they first tried the game. Because these detailed AI behaviors weren't overly obvious, and upon first encounter, it was easy to mistake them for pre-scripted events. When many players first started playing, they were mostly focused on fighting monsters, completely overlooking these details. However, because the trial version's content was limited, many players, after finishing it, felt unsatisfied and replayed it, or chose a new weapon to continue hunting monsters. It was at this point that players started noticing some of the details they had previously missed. And these details made players even more excited.</p>
<p>After all, this was just a trial version, and the Great Jagras could only be considered a tutorial boss in the game. Monsters like Anjanath and Rathalos from earlier promotional videos hadn't been seen yet, nor had Nergigante, which was promoted from the very beginning. All of this made many players eagerly anticipate the game, and also held some expectations for the future Tempered monsters utilizing AI technology. For many players, they now felt that Monster Hunter: World was simply a game that couldn't be more perfect! Firstly, its unique worldview created a vivid New World. Secondly, the combat system was also superb, with each weapon possessing its own distinct characteristics.</p>
<p>The Hunting Horn, capable of moving one to tears, leaving no fellow hunter to be found far and wide. The Dual Blades, delivering precise slashes, with their Demon Dance being incredibly stylish. The Long Sword, with its Foresight Slash as swift as wind, never resulting in a 'Carting'. And the Great Hammer, a whirlwind top, along with the Lance's valiant thrusts. Each weapon had its unique gameplay and style. Before this, many players had even claimed the game was too easy. After all, they felt like they couldn't die, the monsters were too weak, and the Palico was too strong, so how could they possibly 'Cart'? But now, Chen Xu had stated on the official Weibo account that there would be brand new difficulties later on. Especially the description of the Tempered monsters, which made hardcore players, eager for more challenges, extremely excited. Suddenly, Monster Hunter: World seemed to have completely captivated players from all walks of life.</p>
<hr />
<p>On August 7th, amidst the players' eager anticipation, Monster Hunter: World officially launched. Players who had pre-ordered were eagerly awaiting the game's unlock. In major forums and chat groups, players were chatting enthusiastically.</p>
<p>“Only half an hour left, damn it, I'm genuinely experiencing time crawling by like a year!”</p>
<p>“Brothers, what weapons will you all choose then? Let's add each other as friends, I'm playing Long Sword!”</p>
<p>“Long Sword +1!”</p>
<p>“I think the Hammer is more dominant!”</p>
<p>“I still prefer the Bow, ranged output is incredibly fun!”</p>
<p>“Some masters have already tested it in the game. On paper, the Great Sword has the highest damage, and the Bow is also very powerful, but it requires precise kiting. The Charge Blade is also very brutal, but to deal super high damage, you need to use Super Amped Element Discharge, and charging phials can be a bit troublesome. As for the Heavy Bowgun and Light Bowgun, it seems to be related to ammo, so there probably won't be many resources in the early game.”</p>
<p>“Bro upstairs, your data is very convincing, but I'm still going to play Long Sword!”</p>
<p>“Exactly! You might be strong for a while, but I'll be stylish forever!”</p>
<p>Many players were discussing what weapons they would main. Among them, the Long Sword undoubtedly took the majority of votes. After all, it was simply too cool. Moreover, in the early game, any weapon could actually be played; it was just a matter of how fast or slow one could hunt monsters. Furthermore, although weapons had varying difficulties, everyone was still in an exploratory phase, and the demo itself only showcased up to the Great Jagras. Therefore, all players were very confident in their chosen weapons.</p>
<p>As for later? Well, only Long Sword players might feel a bit lonely then.</p>
