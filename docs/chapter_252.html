                <p>Chapter 251: That's it!? (Fifth Update)</p>
<p>Seeing the Great Jagras in front of him, Zhang Yi was starting to lose patience.</p>
<p>Because this BOSS was just like the BOSSes in Dark Souls' Death Mode, fully demonstrating what "If the enemy doesn't move, I don't move" meant. Taking out the Whetstone from his item pouch, Zhang Yi sharpened his Great Sword. After all, he had been harassed by a few Crown-crested Dragons on the way, and his Great Sword's sharpness had decreased. Looking at the Great Jagras in front of him, Zhang Yi shouldered his Great Sword and ran towards it. However, before Zhang Yi could initiate an attack, the Great Jagras saw him charging and attacked first.</p>
<p>Facing the Great Jagras's attack, which was like a giant lizard, Zhang Yi didn't choose to evade by rolling, but instead opted to directly tank some damage from the Great Jagras. His main intention was to observe the enemy's attack pattern to make a judgment. "This damage is indeed much higher than the Crown-crested Dragon's!" Watching the health bar's decreasing value, Zhang Yi was a little surprised. Because of this one hit from the Great Jagras, his entire health bar dropped by about a tenth. Clearly, this BOSS still posed some threat. Despite this, Zhang Yi felt no worry at all. After all, the margin for error was still very generous. Unlike Dark Souls where two hits left you crippled and three hits killed you. Seven or eight of these attacks were nothing! And the most crucial point was that, unlike Dark Souls where the arena was restricted. In Monster Hunter: World, he found that there was no area restriction during combat.</p>
<p>"I'll use this guy to test out my Great Sword!" Zhang Yi got excited. Previously, the Crown-crested Dragon and Jagras didn't have enough health, so he couldn't fully unleash his Charged Slashes, let alone a True Charged Slash. A strong charged slash would make them collapse in one hit. Now was the perfect time to have some fun with this Great Jagras! "One slash! Two slashes!" Accompanied by his Palico companion, Zhang Yi furiously attacked the Great Jagras. The routine was very simple: slash once, then immediately charge up in place. Facing the Great Jagras's attacks, he entered a hyper armor state during the charging animation, directly tanking hits to trade damage. "True! Charged Slash!" Looking at the Great Jagras, Zhang Yi had already struck his pose. The in-game character held the Great Sword with both hands, exerting force. 'Zheng!' The Great Sword's third charge in the game made a sound, giving a prompt. The Great Sword's highest damaging True Charged Slash was unleashed in an instant! Looking at the Great Jagras in front of him, Zhang Yi had already pictured the scene in his mind where the Great Jagras would be one-shot by his True Charged Slash, collapsing from exhaustion. But the next moment, the Great Jagras suddenly shifted its aggro, twisted its rear, and pounced towards the Palico next to him. At the same time, the hunter in the game, shouldering a Great Sword larger than himself, performed a spinning slash. Boom! Rumble! Two consecutive True Charged Slashes hit the ground directly. Stirring up a cloud of dust. After 'chopping the ground' with his Great Sword, the Great Jagras coincidentally shifted its aggro, turned around, and sent him flying a good distance with a charge. Zhang Yi looked bewildered: "???? What the heck? This works too?" Looking at his character getting up from the ground in the game, Zhang Yi in front of the computer was completely bewildered. Did that mean his skill missed!? However, this bewilderment was only momentary, as the fight against the Great Jagras was still relatively smooth. What Zhang Yi wanted to grumble about was that his Palico kept drawing the Great Jagras's aggro, and his charged attacks always hit the floor.</p>
<p>Despite this, Zhang Yi couldn't really scold his Palico. Because he hadn't turned off damage indicators, he noticed that the damage dealt by the Palico was quite considerable. And even though it turned his Great Sword into a 'hoe for tilling the earth', creating the 'true ground-chopping sword style'. It did make his combat much easier; when it drew the Great Jagras's aggro, he could deal damage freely, even if he often missed. Moreover, when his health was low, the Palico would even bring Vigorwasps; by separating the nectar sac of the Vigorwasp, it could instantly restore a lot of health. The battle with the Great Jagras was quite smooth. At first, not understanding its attack patterns, he was knocked over many times, but after a couple of hits, Zhang Yi realized that despite the Great Jagras's intimidating appearance. It was actually quite weak; not only were its movements slow, but its damage wasn't as high as he expected. The only commendable thing was that it was much tankier than the previous Crown-crested Dragon and Aptonoth. However, this actually became a satisfying point for Zhang Yi, as he could slash to his heart's content. Under the combined assault of Zhang Yi and his Palico, the Great Jagras quickly became covered in wounds. Clearly, the Great Jagras realized it was no match. After an enraged charge, this time the Great Jagras didn't continue its attack but fled directly into the depths of the forest. "This monster actually runs away!" Seeing the fleeing Great Jagras, Zhang Yi in front of the computer was surprised, clearly not expecting such a situation. However, he still chased it, following the green Scoutflies. And because it had just eaten a Crown-crested Dragon and hadn't fully digested it, it moved very slowly with its large belly, and Zhang Yi caught up to it in no time. At this moment, the Great Jagras was clearly at its last gasp, even limping as it walked, evidently severely wounded. Just like before, Zhang Yi, shouldering his Great Sword and accompanied by his Palico, charged straight at it. After just a few slashes, the roaring Great Jagras was quickly brought down. At the same time, a line of text popped up on the screen: [Main objective achieved].</p>
<p>"I still don't feel quite satisfied!" Walking over to carve materials from the fallen Great Jagras, Zhang Yi still felt a bit unfulfilled. Although the Great Jagras wasn't difficult, the key was that during the fight, his Great Sword's attacks, despite being high in damage, were a bit slow. So, half of his ten slashes missed. Especially that True Charged Slash, he only landed it once throughout the whole fight, but it had to be said the damage was indeed high. He also discovered that the Great Sword's hyper armor wasn't truly invincible. It could indeed withstand normal attacks, but attacks that could knock him airborne could still break his hyper armor state. "I wonder what new monsters there will be later!" Looking at the countdown, Zhang Yi sighed inwardly. Based on his experience so far, Zhang Yi felt he could give Monster Hunter: World nine out of ten points; as for the remaining point, he would save it for later. Mainly because he found the new player tutorial a bit illogical. While fighting the Great Jagras, this Investigation Leader kept telling him various controls, clearly acting as the tutorial NPC. But this guy just stood there watching. We're all hunters, why don't you come and help me fight! What's the point of just standing by and watching! Is being the Commander-in-Chief's grandson so great? The Hunter's Guild doesn't need nepotism! I despise princelings like you the most! Grumbling inwardly while humming a tune, Zhang Yi returned to Astera Base to turn in the quest, ready to pick up new quests for another round of hunting. However, at that moment, a notification pop-up appeared. [Demo content ends here. The game officially launches on August 7th. Stay tuned!]</p>
<p>Gone... it's gone!? Zhang Yi looked at the prompt in front of him, utterly bewildered.</p>
