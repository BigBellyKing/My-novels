                <p>Chapter 798: The Dovahkiin's Archaeological Legends</p>
<p>The rich content and story missions within The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim have become one of the main topics of discussion among players.</p>
<p>In The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, the main quest is to defeat Alduin.</p>
<p>However, this main quest only accounts for a small fraction of the game's total number of quests.</p>
<p>Aside from the Dragonborn quests and vampire quests,</p>
<p>there are also hundreds of different types of side quests.</p>
<p>These quests are, in terms of content, virtually all-encompassing.</p>
<p>They cover Civil War quests involving Skyrim's political situation, showcasing the various relationships and conflicts between the Stormcloaks and the Imperial Legion.</p>
<p>There are also the quite dark Dark Brotherhood quests.</p>
<p>Regarding the faith and honor of the Companions, joining the Circle unlocks the werewolf identity, allowing players to experience the resolve of the warriors within the Companions.</p>
<p>Additionally, there's a Dragon Language questline that Chen Xu previously promised.</p>
<p>Through the Dragon Language, players will gain a deeper understanding of ancient times, the Dragon Cult, and other Dragonborn-related content.</p>
<p>Of course, for this particular challenge quest, most players still need to consult strategy guides to trigger and complete it.</p>
<p>This is because many key points in this challenge quest require understanding the meaning of Dragon Language words within the game and knowing the corresponding keywords to trigger them.</p>
<p>And now, over a week since the game's release, this major quest has finally been completed.</p>
<p>However, the identity of the first solver came as a surprise to many players.</p>
<p>Because the individual was not an ordinary player, but a professor specializing in ancient languages, which made countless aware players unable to help but complain: "There are pro gamers for this too?!"</p>
<p>Of course, besides these major quests, the game also features many daily encounter quests.</p>
<p>Helping ordinary people oppressed by bandits, or exploring the various ancient tombs and dungeons hidden throughout Skyrim.</p>
<p>It can be said that these numerous quests, ranging from those greatly impacting Skyrim's political situation to simple tasks helping ordinary people, collectively created a panoramic view of life in Skyrim for players, showcasing all the local customs and conditions of Skyrim before their eyes.</p>
<p>In The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, players can always find their own enjoyment.</p>
<p>They can follow the main storyline, slowly learn the story of Skyrim, understand the origin of the Dragonborn, meet the Greybeards, and learn the power of Dragon Shouts.</p>
<p>Players uninterested in the main quest can travel around enjoying the scenery, encountering a seemingly ordinary NPC on the road who asks them to deliver a letter.</p>
<p>This can, however, lead to a series of events, provided you are willing to help and investigate the truth behind it.</p>
<p>After the initial awe, countless players did not grow bored with familiarity; instead, they felt there were many unknown things in the game waiting for them to uncover.</p>
<p>This also made many players experience a sense of realism and immersion when playing The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.</p>
<p>This sense of realism primarily stems from the perfect recreation of Skyrim within the game.</p>
<p>From the in-game textures, scenery, architectural styles of different cities, to the attire and behavior of different races, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was meticulously researched. It's not as if everything was cast from the same mold, with only the names being different.</p>
<p>Different maps feature different appearances, which players can tangibly experience in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.</p>
<p>The game also contains a vast number of books, fully presenting relevant information about Skyrim and Tamriel.</p>
<p>There are historical documents and books, books recording information on various races, and even some indescribable miscellaneous writings.</p>
<p>It can be said that this rich content collectively created a lifelike Skyrim, preventing any immersion-breaking feeling.</p>
<p>In Elder Scrolls (informal), players experience a unique personal adventure.</p>
<p>Becoming an Arch-Mage researching new magic, a Dawnguard slaying vampires, a Dragonborn saving the world, or even a thief, stealing from Riverwood villagers all the way to the Greybeards of High Hrothgar.</p>
<p>Even in the game, you can build your own house, set up a farm, marry, and raise children, living a retired pastoral life.</p>
<p>And this was an experience that other open-world games under Nebula Games had not previously offered to players.</p>
<p>............</p>
<p>"A chicken, an apple, is it really necessary?!"</p>
<p>Song Ren in the game returned to where the dream began.</p>
<p>Helgen Keep had become ruins, but Riverwood was still as it was.</p>
<p>The familiar Giant Inn, the familiar Lumber Mill and clear stream, and that still arrogant fat chicken.</p>
<p>Wearing what Song Ren considered the coolest Daedric armor set, his blade flashed, then fell, taking care of that fat chicken. The next moment, villagers rushed over, shouting and screaming, once again letting him experience Riverwood's 'hospitality.'</p>
<p>"That's outrageous!" Watching the villagers ganging up on him, Song Ren couldn't help but sigh with emotion.</p>
<p>He could only say that the Chicken God was indeed still the Chicken God.</p>
<p>As a Dragonborn who had defeated Alduin, shattered Miraak's conspiracy, and eliminated the Vampire Lord, couldn't he even kill a chicken?</p>
<p>He had served as an assassin for the Dark Brotherhood, become a Dragon Slayer for the Blades, transformed into a werewolf with the Companions, bragged with Daedric Princes, fought alongside Three Heroes, and resolved Skyrim's Civil War.</p>
<p>Such a legendary existence, couldn't he even kill a small chicken?</p>
<p>While sighing, Song Ren also paid the fine to the guards. Even though with his current equipment, level, and the easy difficulty, killing villagers was as easy as killing baby chicks, he still couldn't quite bring himself to do it.</p>
<p>Looking at the Lady follower beside him, Song Ren jumped in place twice, then entered her equipment interface through dialogue and stripped her of her equipment.</p>
<p>If he had to say what he was dissatisfied with up to this point, besides being praised by all as the Dragonborn but getting no real benefits, the most dissatisfying thing was that the Vampire Lady, the game's face of beauty, couldn't be married in the game in the end.</p>
<p>Why not?! Can't a player marry a pretty girl?!</p>
<p>So what if she's a vampire, he's the Dragonborn!</p>
<p>After running around with the Lady follower for a couple of laps, there were still some newly accepted quests in his quest log. However, he wasn't planning on doing them right now. After all, he had been playing The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim these past few days, and he was planning to call Old Zhang to play some multiplayer games to relax a bit.</p>
<p>"Old Zhang, what are you doing? Want to play some other multiplayer games together?" Song Ren asked, opening Zhang Yi's communication channel.</p>
<p>"Sure, but later. I'm tomb raiding right now," Zhang Yi's voice came through the voice channel.</p>
<p>"Tomb raiding?" Song Ren looked bewildered at Zhang Yi's words.</p>
<p>He glanced at the game Zhang Yi was playing. It was indeed The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.</p>
<p>Was there a tomb raiding gameplay in this game?</p>
<p>"Yeah, didn't you notice? Almost all of the main quests in the game are about finding things in tombs! Finding the Dragonstone, finding the horn, going to Ustengrav, and finally Sovngarde—aren't these all tombs? And the side quests in the game are uniformly about dungeons, ruins, and crypts, so isn't that just tomb raiding?" Zhang Yi said as a matter of course.</p>
<p>"You make a lot of sense..." Listening to Zhang Yi's words, Song Ren fell silent for a moment.</p>
<p>Thinking about it carefully, it really did make sense.</p>
<p>About seventy percent of the quests in the game seemed to be related to ruins and tombs.</p>
<p>Many key items were also unearthed relics dug out from tombs.</p>
<p>Originally, it was nothing, but thinking about it this way, the game's image in Song Ren's mind suddenly became a bit different.</p>
<p>This wasn't the Dovahkiin's legendary life; this was the Dovahkiin's tomb raiding legend!</p>
