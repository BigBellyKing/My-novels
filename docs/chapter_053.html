                <p>Chapter 53: My Heart Can't Take It Anymore</p>
<p>Sun Yixie, with his camera's night vision mode on, closed the wooden door and pulled down the switch.</p>
<p>Accompanied by a sound similar to a machine engine turning.</p>
<p>Sun Yixie cautiously hid in the corner.</p>
<p>After waiting for about six or seven seconds, it seemed nothing happened.</p>
<p>"Brother Sun, why are you still crouching here? Oh, listen to me, I'm right. Hurry and leave now while the insane person hasn't arrived. Don't wait around and end up letting them come to you," Huang Donglai next to him interjected.</p>
<p>"Wait a moment, I'm a bit panicked, let me calm down," Sun Yixie panted. However, he also started to act. After checking the room and finding no collectibles, Sun Yixie prepared to open the door.</p>
<p>At this moment, Huang Donglai next to him was also chatting with him: "Oh, what's there to panic about? That monster won't spawn at the door."</p>
<p>Following Huang Donglai's words, the doorknob slowly turned, pushing open the wooden door.</p>
<p>Just as the door was opened, the next moment a ghastly pale face came into view.</p>
<p>"Ahhh!"</p>
<p>A tenor voice that would make Pavarotti retreat in defeat erupted from Sun Yixie's mouth.</p>
<p>He leaned back and collapsed directly onto the chair.</p>
<p>The insane person from earlier was unexpectedly right in his face.</p>
<p>This truly caught him completely off guard, scaring him half to death, and even the nearby camera was knocked askew by him.</p>
<p>And in the game, the insane person swung the spiked wooden plank in his hand, taking a swipe at him.</p>
<p>"Not dead yet, I'm not dead yet!"</p>
<p>Although he had been scared out of his wits, Sun Yixie, noticing that he was still alive in the game, quickly moved his chair forward and controlled the character to begin his escape.</p>
<p>The background music in his headphones turned into sharp orchestral music, but its melody was extremely eerie. Coupled with the chase and night vision mode visuals, it made Sun Yixie's heart race and cold sweat break out on his back.</p>
<p>"Damn it, damn it, where do I run!"</p>
<p>"Come on! Damn it, if I had a weapon in my hand, I'd definitely kill you!"</p>
<p>Controlling the character in the game, Sun Yixie scurried around the dark basement like a headless fly.</p>
<p>Diving into any passage he saw, leaping over any box he spotted.</p>
<p>Sun Yixie, sitting in front of the computer, already had sweat pouring from his forehead, and his originally small eyes were now wide and round.</p>
<p>Even his hand holding the mouse was trembling a little.</p>
<p>Because this game was really too terrifying.</p>
<p>The scenes, background, and rhythm—how on earth could there be such a horror game!</p>
<p>Listening to the dull footsteps of the insane person behind him, Sun Yixie at this moment didn't dare to look back at all.</p>
<p>Right now, he had only one thought: to run.</p>
<p>As for anything else?</p>
<p>He couldn't care less.</p>
<p>Sun Yixie in the game was completely following his instincts; he didn't even know where he had ended up.</p>
<p>And just at this moment, after going around a corner and having just climbed over a stair-like obstacle, there was a crackle of static.</p>
<p>The red battery bar in the upper right corner of the camera flickered twice, then the night vision screen shook, and the screen plunged into darkness.</p>
<p>Before, he had always kept the night vision mode on and hadn't noticed the camera's battery level; at this moment, the battery had just run out.</p>
<p>"Damn it, damn it! How is it out of power!"</p>
<p>"What was the button for changing the battery!"</p>
<p>Sun Yixie completely panicked, for a moment he even forgot how to change the battery.</p>
<p>The passage was pitch black. In this situation, Sun Yixie himself had completely lost his sense of direction.</p>
<p>What was even worse, from his headphones, he could feel the insane person's growls and footsteps seemingly getting closer and closer.</p>
<p>Finally, with a click, Sun Yixie reloaded the battery.</p>
<p>But the next moment, Sun Yixie, who had just turned on night vision mode, let out another world-class high-pitched scream comparable to Pavarotti's.</p>
<p>Because in front of him, the insane person from just now had already rushed right in front of him. In night vision mode, the other person's face was like a ghost, directly almost scaring Sun Yixie's soul right out of him.</p>
<p>"You damn it, get out of my face! Get out of my face!"</p>
<p>In this situation, Sun Yixie didn't even know what he was saying.</p>
<p>He only knew to run in the opposite direction. He came to a corner and saw a wooden door, and without thinking, he rushed straight in.</p>
<p>Inside the wooden door was the last switch, but Sun Yixie's attention at this moment was completely not on the switch.</p>
<p>Because besides the switch, he also found two cabinets in this room.</p>
<p>Just like a traveler in the desert seeing an oasis, or a famished jackal seeing its prey.</p>
<p>Sun Yixie at this moment, seeing the cabinets in front of him, was practically ecstatic.</p>
<p>Rushing forward two steps, triggering the cabinet interaction, and then hiding inside.</p>
<p>Immediately after, 'Thump! Thump!' a series of banging sounds on the door rang out.</p>
<p>Accompanied by the sound of the wooden door being burst open, the insane person entered the room.</p>
<p>After circling the room like before and opening the cabinet next to Sun Yixie, he mumbled and left.</p>
<p>Sun Yixie at this moment let out a long breath, then leaned back in his chair, covering his heart with both hands.</p>
<p>Then he silently chose to save the game and exit.</p>
<p>"Alright, alright, that's enough for today, that's enough for today."</p>
<p>Sitting up from the chair again, Sun Yixie covered his face.</p>
<p>"My heart can't take it anymore... I've made a fool of myself, I've made a fool of myself."</p>
<p>These words were not an excuse, but rather he genuinely felt he couldn't take it anymore.</p>
<p>After all, his courage wasn't very great to begin with. Honestly, if you think about this game being scary, it's nothing more than door jump scares and monster chases.</p>
<p>These elements are not absent in other games.</p>
<p>But in <em>Outlast</em>, it was completely different; the entire game's sound effects and atmosphere were simply too perfectly executed.</p>
<p>Especially the setting of the camera's night vision function made the entire game practically intense throughout.</p>
<p>Binding the most uncomfortable darkness with the night vision function meant players always had a thorn in their hearts, and at the same time, to find more batteries, they inevitably had to explore unknown areas.</p>
<p>Secondly, the entire game wasn't completely dark throughout; in fact, many places were quite bright.</p>
<p>This dynamic shift in scenes constantly created psychological pressure on players, a hint of self-doubt.</p>
<p>These elements, combined with the atmosphere of fear brought by some scary scenes in the game, were what made <em>Outlast</em> truly terrifying.</p>
<p>And now, when Sun Yixie thought about potentially having to finish this game, he had only one thought: despair!</p>
<p>However, he wasn't the only one experiencing this feeling of despair.</p>
