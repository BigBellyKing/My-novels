                <p>Chapter 266: A Truly Legendary Game (Sixth Update, Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter: World</em> continued to sell well, and player enthusiasm remained quite high.</p>
<p>In fact, there was still a fair amount of work planned for <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> in the future.</p>
<p>Although essentially a single-player game, it was one with strong vitality.</p>
<p>Moreover, in Chen Xu's plans, several subsequent versions would be launched.</p>
<p>This included classic monsters from the previous life's Monster Hunter series, such as Tigrex, Zinogre, Brachydios, Ukanlos, and Bulldrome...</p>
<p>However, these were all contents to be released later. For the current version of <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, the content was already quite substantial.</p>
<p>Similar to the DLC for <em>Dark Souls</em>, Chen Xu also planned to establish a dedicated project team to slowly develop these subsequent contents.</p>
<p>As for what remained, it was the previously established strategy.</p>
<p>Further consolidating the advantages of the Nebula Games Platform. While <em>Minecraft</em> was a long-term game, for many players, it leaned more towards casual leisure.</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, on the other hand, currently had a very active player base.</p>
<p>However, as the content deepened, the rate of player churn would inevitably be faster than expected.</p>
<p>Therefore, for Chen Xu, he also needed a game that could later take on the role of <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> in boosting user stickiness for the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>For this new title, Chen Xu chose a game that could be called legendary.</p>
<p>An RTS competitive game: <em>Warcraft</em>.</p>
<p>Initially, Chen Xu had his sights set on MOBA games.</p>
<p>Whether it was DOTA from his previous life or LOL.</p>
<p>For Chen Xu now, both users and capital were sufficient.</p>
<p>And the development difficulty wasn't that high.</p>
<p>But after careful consideration and market research, Chen Xu decided to temporarily postpone the MOBA strategy.</p>
<p>There were two main reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, MOBA games had not yet emerged in this world, and even RTS was still in a developmental stage. Rashly releasing a MOBA game would likely make it difficult for most players to understand its gameplay mode.</p>
<p>In the Parallel World, RTS games were relatively prevalent.</p>
<p>Some settings that Chen Xu considered important had largely been perfected.</p>
<p>For example, the fog of war in games.</p>
<p>In his previous life, the concept of fog of war actually emerged due to game engine capabilities.</p>
<p>Its embryonic form first appeared in <em>Dune</em>, the perfected concept was in <em>Patton Versus Rommel</em>, but it was truly popularized by <em>Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, many classic game designs originally stemmed from compromises due to insufficient technical capabilities.</p>
<p>In the Parallel World, the appearance of the fog of war wasn't due to technical limitations, but designers still proposed and created corresponding concepts.</p>
<p>There were even many disputes, for example, designers sued each other for several years over who first proposed the fog of war design, with no definitive conclusion even now.</p>
<p>Secondly, what Chen Xu found more concerning was that the esports industry in the Parallel World was much more vibrant compared to his previous life.</p>
<p>This wasn't surprising, as the gaming industry in the Parallel World was larger and held a more esteemed status than in his previous life.</p>
<p>In such a situation, status, reputation, and attention were all abundant.</p>
<p>Naturally, a decent competitive game giving rise to professional leagues was a normal occurrence.</p>
<p>For instance, on the Channel Alliance side, the game with the highest concurrent player count was an RTS game called <em>Human Wars</em>.</p>
<p>This was also why Chen Xu chose <em>Warcraft</em>.</p>
<p>Judging by the various maneuvers from the Channel Alliance, NetDragon, and TengHua since the release of <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, they clearly wouldn't sit idly by.</p>
<p>Chen Xu also had no interest in waiting around.</p>
<p>When he announced a new game, it was highly probable that the Channel Alliance, NetDragon, and TengHua would immediately follow up to target it.</p>
<p>In that case, he might as well take the initiative.</p>
<p>When a potential enemy might threaten you, eliminate them before they can pose a danger.</p>
<p>How great would that be!</p>
<p>Therefore, after comprehensive consideration, Chen Xu decided to develop <em>Warcraft</em> first.</p>
<p>After making the decision, Chen Xu gazed at the computer monitor and pondered.</p>
<p>To plan the general framework.</p>
<p>Speaking of outstanding RTS games from his previous life.</p>
<p>There were many.</p>
<p>The early RTS pioneers like <em>Age of Empires</em> and <em>Red Alert</em>, and the competitive benchmark <em>StarCraft</em>. But if one were to name the RTS game with the most profound influence.</p>
<p>Then nine out of ten players who understood what an RTS game was would say <em>Warcraft</em>.</p>
<p>Because it was simply too classic, especially the third generation.</p>
<p>Setting aside the game's story content, purely in terms of game mechanics, <em>Warcraft</em> could truly be considered the magnum opus of the series, having genuinely forged its own style.</p>
<p>Population, and each unit having different tech trees and skills, forming combinations. Especially the introduction of hero units, which could be said to have revolutionized the entire RTS genre.</p>
<p>To some extent, it was precisely because of the introduction of heroes that MOBA games later rose to prominence.</p>
<p>Particularly with its final version, <em>The Frozen Throne</em>, <em>Warcraft</em> truly ascended to godhood.</p>
<p>Perhaps many players weren't clear on <em>Warcraft</em>'s story, but they certainly knew the two main characters in <em>The Frozen Throne</em> storyline.</p>
<p>Illidan and Arthas.</p>
<p>Even when <em>World of Warcraft</em> was later released, many <em>Warcraft</em> players were drawn in because of these two characters.</p>
<p>Although these two characters didn't appear until <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em> and <em>The Burning Crusade</em>, and were merely content for players to grind in dungeons.</p>
<p>However, for Chen Xu, he currently only planned to incorporate the storylines of <em>Reign of Chaos</em> and <em>The Frozen Throne</em> from <em>Warcraft III</em> into the main game content.</p>
<p>As for the earlier stories like <em>Orcs &amp; Humans</em>, <em>Tides of Darkness</em>, and <em>Beyond the Dark Portal</em>, Chen Xu planned to gauge player feedback.</p>
<p>If enthusiasm was high, then he would release corresponding single-player campaigns as DLC.</p>
<p>If the response was lukewarm, then he would follow the old tradition of Blizzard Entertainment from his previous life and release animated shorts.</p>
<p>Besides, there was another crucial point: the Map Editor.</p>
<p>"One game, ten thousand ways to play" was the praise players gave to <em>Minecraft</em> before its emergence.</p>
<p>But before that, this title belonged to <em>Warcraft</em>.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the reason <em>Warcraft</em> had such immense vitality in his previous life, besides its excellent quality, was largely due to the Map Editor feature.</p>
<p>Including DOTA and LOL, both had intricate connections to it.</p>
<p>After roughly outlining a few directions, Chen Xu stretched and walked out of his office.</p>
<p>Although it was an RTS game, <em>Warcraft</em> was definitely not small in scope. And for Chen Xu, he wasn't planning to treat it as a small-scale RTS.</p>
<p>If he was going to do it, he would bring this legendary game from his previous life to the pinnacle that Nebula Games could achieve.</p>
<p>A quick note: I won't be writing about LOL and DOTA after War3 for now, even though it's currently the season for World Championships and TI.</p>
