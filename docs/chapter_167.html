                <p>Chapter 166: I Thank You on Behalf of the Players! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Originally, all the designers came today prepared to inquire about the new VR equipment, its related parameters, and various features under development.</p>
<p>However, the <em>Silent Hill PT</em> DEMO submitted by Chen Xu completely disrupted their schedule.</p>
<p>As for the Research Park, it welcomed a special theme today.</p>
<p>That was 'screams'.</p>
<p>When emotionally unstable and feeling scared, what's the most effective way to express those emotions?</p>
<p>The answer is very simple: screams!</p>
<p>These were tough guys, battle-hardened testers at that.</p>
<p>Being scared into screaming by a test DEMO was, for them, a rather shameful thing.</p>
<p>So, at first, although Li Yue was incredibly frightened, even when he first encountered Lisa (the female ghost) by the restroom door and was startled, he only subconsciously gasped.</p>
<p>It wasn't until his subsequent terrifying close encounter with Lisa's alluring figure that, under the surging emotional impact, he finally let go of himself, giving in to his body's instincts and screaming loudly.</p>
<p>By the time Ye Xun and Tao Fa participated in the experience, they finally understood what kind of game this truly was.</p>
<p>This game shouldn't even exist in the mortal world!</p>
<p>The only thing that made them feel a little better was that Li Yue had already released his inhibitions earlier, which alleviated their pressure.</p>
<p>They could express their inner fear through shouts.</p>
<p>For a time, the entire Research Park was filled with screams like pigs being slaughtered.</p>
<p>After resting for quite a while, Li Yue, who was back in action, originally thought he could face all of this more strongly.</p>
<p>After all, to put it plainly, it was still a horror game.</p>
<p>Once a player becomes familiar with a horror game and adapts, the sense of fear it brings gradually diminishes.</p>
<p>But after re-entering the game, Li Yue realized he had thought too much, or rather, he was only half right.</p>
<p>Indeed, once players become familiar with it, the fear from a horror game will decrease.</p>
<p>But the most crucial question now was that he wasn't completely familiar with it yet!</p>
<p>The only thing he knew was what the female ghost looked like.</p>
<p>As for the rest?</p>
<p>Everything was unknown!</p>
<p>He even didn't know if there were other monsters in this game.</p>
<p>He thought he had played very far, but reality taught him a harsh lesson.</p>
<p>Because once the game entered the otherworld, after passing through the door again, faint sounds of water would reach his ears. The original lighting turned into a scarlet red glow.</p>
<p>Even the chandelier that had hung from the ceiling earlier was replaced by a large refrigerator.</p>
<p>The refrigerator swung back and forth in the air, and the so-called red glow was the reflection of countless bloodstains inside the refrigerator.</p>
<p>In this segment, the game would also feature eerie music for the first time, and the loud crying of a baby would emanate from inside the refrigerator.</p>
<p>Combined with the noisy radio, a message could be faintly heard: 'After killing his family, the father hung himself with a rubber hose (umbilical cord) in the garage.'</p>
<p>At this point, looking up at the refrigerator hanging from the ceiling, scarlet blood would directly stream down from inside it, splattering all over the player's face.</p>
<p>Coupled with the sudden sound of high heels appearing behind them, it pushed the game's atmosphere to its extreme oppressive limit.</p>
<p>It was in such an atmosphere, combined with Lisa's alluring figure giving a terrifying face-to-face scare, that the testers in the Research Park put on an impromptu high-pitched scream competition.</p>
<p>Leaving the Research Park, Chen Xu also felt quite relaxed.</p>
<p>He figured the <em>Silent Hill PT</em> DEMO should help these testers provide better feedback for improving the VR equipment.</p>
<p>And judging by the testers' performance so far, he estimated they wouldn't be able to complete this DEMO anytime soon.</p>
<p>As for the new VR equipment, Chen Xu was quite interested.</p>
<p>Because in terms of experience, it was indeed a step above the old VR equipment.</p>
<p>However, unfortunately, it would be difficult to bring it to market in the short term.</p>
<p>As Chen Xu was contemplating, his phone rang. It was Yang Chen, the Minister of the Game Department.</p>
<p>"Minister Yang, is there something?" Chen Xu asked after answering the call.</p>
<p>"Nothing in particular. Just letting you know, Chen Xu, that the subsidy should be credited before next Monday. Also, this DEMO you made has great testing value. However, in the future, if you're making VR games, especially horror types that are aimed at the player market, Chen Xu, you still need to go easy!" Yang Chen's expression on the other end of the phone was very complex.</p>
<p>He had also learned about the content related to this <em>Silent Hill PT</em>.</p>
<p>How should he put it?</p>
<p>It was a bit too special.</p>
<p>And the most crucial point was that this game had no particularly bloody scenes throughout.</p>
<p>The only somewhat uncomfortable content could only be said to be the baby embryo in the toilet.</p>
<p>This meant that even if it wasn't for DEMO testing,</p>
<p>The content of <em>Silent Hill PT</em> would completely pass review standards.</p>
<p>But if this game were released, and then combined with VR equipment, it would be unthinkable!</p>
<p>After all, by then, it would be ordinary players experiencing the game, not their specialized testers.</p>
<p>Is this making games <em>for</em> players? This is specifically <em>sending players away</em> (scaring them off)!</p>
<p>How many players could withstand this?</p>
<p>"I think what Minister Yang said is absolutely right. Mr. Chen, if your <em>Silent Hill PT</em> were truly released to the market, more than half of the players would be sent away (scared off) by you," Meng Zuo, who was accompanying Chen Xu, said jokingly after Chen Xu hung up the phone and understood.</p>
<p>"It's not that exaggerated. It's mainly because the new version VR's sense of immersion is too strong; both the visuals and sound effects are too realistic," Chen Xu said with emotion.</p>
<p>The reason a horror game is scary, besides the terrifying visuals that frighten players, is that sound effects are also paramount.</p>
<p>Taking <em>Outlast</em>'s Mount Massive Asylum as an example, if players stood before the gloomy asylum's main gate, with the distant building appearing like a giant beast in the darkness, looking very oppressive.</p>
<p>But if at that moment, Teacher Guo's crosstalk began to play in their ears, accompanied by Teacher Yu's comic foil, the effect would be nonexistent.</p>
<p>Conversely, if there were gloomy sound effects, but the Mount Massive Asylum in front of them turned into a sunny Bikini Bottom, it would be difficult for anyone to feel scared.</p>
<p>"That's true," Meng Zuo nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>"However, horror games still find it difficult to achieve explosive sales," Meng Zuo sighed.</p>
<p>"Indeed," Chen Xu nodded.</p>
<p>This was also why horror games had always been a niche category.</p>
<p>Being too terrifying led to critical acclaim but poor sales; players simply didn't dare to play alone, so sales naturally couldn't go up.</p>
<p>And if it wasn't scary, then what the heck kind of horror game would it be?</p>
<p>"But the design of <em>Silent Hill PT</em> really taught us designers a lesson, especially the supernatural loop of the looping corridor and the design of narrow spaces, combined with Lisa's turn-around jump scare. Even recalling it now still leaves me with a lingering fear!" Meng Zuo exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Mainly because it's just a DEMO, so we could really exercise our creativity," Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>"It's a shame it can only be played on the new version VR. Otherwise, I would also like to study your DEMO more, Mr. Chen," Meng Zuo said with a smile.</p>
<p>"No problem, Teacher Meng. If you want to play it, it's just a DEMO. The Game Department also said there's no need for confidentiality or anything. I'll develop it when I get back, and then, Teacher Meng, we can delve into it and you can give me some suggestions," Chen Xu replied.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, Meng Zuo was taken aback.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>He didn't mean that; he was just engaging in habitual commercial flattery!</p>
<p>Who wants to play it?! He didn't mean that!</p>
<p>Meng Zuo was stunned. He wanted to speak, but he was too embarrassed to say it out loud.</p>
<p>He couldn't possibly say that he was a little scared, could he?</p>
<p>"No need, Mr. Chen, there's really no need," Meng Zuo pleaded.</p>
<p>"Teacher Meng, don't be so polite. It's easy to release a PC version. After all, the assets are already made, it'll only take two days. Plus, it can be considered a small gift for the players, to give them some surprise," Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, Meng Zuo fell silent.</p>
<p>As for the 'surprise' part, he could confirm that players would indeed be quite 'surprised'.</p>
<p>But you call this 'joy'?</p>
<p>I thank you on behalf of the players!</p>
