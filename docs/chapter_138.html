                <p>Chapter 237: It makes a lot of sense, but something feels off! (Seventh update, seeking subscriptions and monthly passes)</p>
<p>It wasn't just Qin Yi; others like Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin were also looking at Chen Xu with the same gaze.</p>
<p>After all, the sense of déjà vu was simply too strong!</p>
<p>As everyone knows, up to now, Nebula Games' two major titles were none other than <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em>.</p>
<p>As for <em>Minecraft</em>, although it was creating sales miracles every day, in terms of sheer scope, it clearly couldn't be called a major title.</p>
<p>But this game before them, named <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> – just look at its cold weapon setting, then look at these gigantic Ancient Dragons.</p>
<p>One must know that in <em>Dark Souls</em>, BOSSes are generally massive in size.</p>
<p>This is meant to give players a sufficient sense of oppression.</p>
<p>And coupled with the so-called unique action system,</p>
<p>The more everyone looked, the more they thought of it as a Souls-like game.</p>
<p>"Don't talk nonsense, how could this be a Souls-like game?" Chen Xu shook his head, denying it.</p>
<p>"This is a very special game. Players will quickly become familiar with its gameplay mode. It's safe to say that <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> will be much easier for players to get started with than <em>Dark Souls</em>."</p>
<p>"Furthermore, in <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, players have a variety of weapon choices and can craft stronger armor and equipment, and these can also be upgraded."</p>
<p>"And unlike in the <em>Dark Souls</em> series, where armor is virtually useless against BOSSes, in <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, players can reinforce and craft superior defensive armor, and use the armor's properties to counter monsters. They can even continue to strengthen the armor."</p>
<p>"In the game, players can also use various items to make hunting much easier. They even have a racial companion called a Palico to assist in combat." Chen Xu explained, one point at a time.</p>
<p>"In addition to that, there will be a relatively unique setting in the game: Hitzone determination based on cut and blunt damage." Chen Xu introduced the relevant settings of <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> to everyone.</p>
<p>Simply put, the so-called hitzone refers to weak spots. For different hitzones, players need to choose attack methods with various elemental properties.</p>
<p>The same applies to body parts. By attacking different parts of the BOSS, players can achieve feats like breaking horns or severing tails, thereby obtaining corresponding materials.</p>
<p>"Another point is the application of the AI system. In the game, we need to create a complete ecosystem, not just a simple background image, but a truly interactive world."</p>
<p>"Paralysis Toads, Vigorwasps, Flashflies in the forest... various creatures, plants, and the environment will all affect the hunt. This is a real fantasy world." Chen Xu gave a brief conceptual explanation to everyone.</p>
<p>Everyone was filled with excitement and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>From the perspective of game scale, <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> would clearly be the largest game they had developed to date in terms of scope.</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu's detailed explanation of the game systems, Qin Yi and the others finally understood why Chen Xu said <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> was easier to get into than <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>Because there seemed to be very little malicious content!</p>
<p>From Chen Xu's current explanation, it could be said that <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> was completely different from Souls-like games.</p>
<p>Because the difficulty of Souls-like games, besides the BOSSes, largely lies in the maps and various regular enemies.</p>
<p>Various traps, environmental kills, and enemy combinations drove players to frustration.</p>
<p>However, in <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, there wouldn't be so many malicious traps on the map.</p>
<p>What players needed to do was outsmart and outfight the BOSSes.</p>
<p>Even the traps on the map would become powerful tools for players to deal with BOSSes.</p>
<p>At the same time, to optimize the player experience, Hunters in <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> would not take damage no matter how high they fell from.</p>
<p>This was much more incredible compared to the Undead.</p>
<p>Moreover, AI technology was utilized to make the BOSSes in the game more agile and lifelike.</p>
<p>This meant that each combat location could be in a different geographical environment.</p>
<p>More importantly, players needed to figure out the monsters' attack patterns and then solve them with their own skill and wisdom.</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu's words, everyone showed expressions of sudden realization.</p>
<p>Looked at this way, <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> was indeed much more user-friendly than the previous <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>However, as Chen Xu continued his explanation later on, everyone's expressions slowly changed.</p>
<p>Initially, Chen Xu simply introduced some monsters in the game: the docile Aptonoth that wouldn't actively attack, the Great Jagras, and the Kulu-Ya-Ku that held rocks like an ostrich.</p>
<p>These were nothing particularly special, but what was happening later?</p>
<p>The Tobi-Kadachi with electrical powers, the enormously massive and ferocious Anjanath, and the incredibly agile and poisonous Odogaron.</p>
<p>The vibe suddenly felt wrong!</p>
<p>Not to mention the later Diablos, Rathalos, Rathian, and Nergigante.</p>
<p>Even without seeing the corresponding stats, just looking at the descriptions was enough to make one shudder.</p>
<p>After Chen Xu finished explaining the concept design art, everyone in the conference room fell silent.</p>
<p>Now everyone understood the characteristics of <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>.</p>
<p>Indeed, this game was truly completely different from <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p><em>Dark Souls</em> was like going to a foot massage parlor, and the attendant brought you a basin of scalding hot water. You dipped your foot in.</p>
<p>"Oh! So hot! I'm not washing!"</p>
<p>As for <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, it was a basin of warm water. You dipped your foot in.</p>
<p>"Oh, so comfortable! Technician No. 13 it is! This number is good! Give me a good massage then. Where's the QR code? Scan it!"</p>
<p>But as players encountered the Anjanath, met the Odogaron, and faced the Diablos...</p>
<p>The overall difficulty suddenly jumped up a notch. It was like adding scalding hot water to warm water.</p>
<p>The water temperature unconsciously heated up.</p>
<p>And when they later encountered the Rathian, the first encounter with Nergigante, Teostra, and other Ancient Dragons...</p>
<p>All the scalding hot water had been poured in. Scorching hot for the feet! At the same time, Technician No. 13 also came in, completely different from the young lady you imagined; instead, it was a big, burly man.</p>
<p>"Foot massage, huh? Close your eyes and feel it!"</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, isn't this difficulty too high?" Qin Yi subtly offered a suggestion.</p>
<p>"How could it be? The difficulty curve is quite reasonable. And didn't players often say they hoped <em>Dark Souls</em> would be more gradual? See, I've learned my lesson. Look at the monster arrangement: from the Aptonoth and Great Jagras at the beginning to the Anjanath and Diablos later, it's all gradual."</p>
<p>"Plus, players have three chances in the game. Only after three 'cartings' is a hunt considered a failure. There's even a Palico companion. How player-friendly is that setting!"</p>
<p>"It's all for the players!" Chen Xu exclaimed with deep emotion.</p>
<p>"Moreover, if you encounter a monster you can't defeat, you can call upon friends in the game, and everyone can tackle the monster together. Doesn't that instantly lower the difficulty?"</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu's words, everyone remained silent.</p>
<p>What he said made so much sense, they had no idea how to refute it.</p>
