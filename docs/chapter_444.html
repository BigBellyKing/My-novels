                <h2>Chapter 443: Exploding Popularity (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h2>
<p>Chapter 443: Exploding Popularity (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>The standard playtime for completing <em>Uncharted 4: A Thief's End</em> is generally around 15 hours.</p>
<p>Of course, if players opt for the lowest difficulty and aren't interested in collecting all the optional elements, this time can be further reduced.</p>
<p>Chen Xu spent a full two days experiencing the game before he initially cleared the main story of <em>Uncharted 4: A Thief's End</em>.</p>
<p>And for Song Ren, these two days of adventure were incredibly exciting.</p>
<p>From Scotland to Madagascar, then to the Island Utopia, this journey, spanning almost half the globe, gave Song Ren an indescribable feeling.</p>
<p>The environments within ranged from cities, forests, and wilderness to the ocean.</p>
<p>Gunfights, car chases, explosions, and puzzles were all present.</p>
<p>Each segment of the story's narrative was perfectly paced.</p>
<p>Every part had its meaning; nothing felt superfluous.</p>
<p>The marital relationship between Nathan and Elena, and Sam's obsession with Henry Every's treasure.</p>
<p>And finally, the mercenary leader, the dark-skinned woman, chose not to take all the treasure, but only a portion.</p>
<p>This also served as an allegory: excessive greed ultimately leads to ruin.</p>
<p>Three hundred years ago, the great pirate Henry Every and other renowned pirates.</p>
<p>Killed each other over the treasure, leading to their demise.</p>
<p>Rafe, resorting to any means to find the treasure, also met his end.</p>
<p>But fortunately, Sam finally saw the light.</p>
<p>Although the game's story followed the typical blockbuster movie formula, its narrative was exceptionally well-executed.</p>
<p>Especially the ultimate happy ending, which thrilled many players.</p>
<p>“Oh no! Mr. Chen is actually full of love this time!”</p>
<p>“Though I ate a lot of dog food in between, it’s great that Nathan Drake and Elena are together!”</p>
<p>“233333, suddenly looking forward to the DLC! Sam, Sully, Nathan, and Elena are all there, no need to worry about protagonists or important characters suddenly disappearing mid-game.”</p>
<p>“Haha, is this Mr. Chen’s mercy?”</p>
<p>“Enough talk, I’m going to play it again, the scenery in Madagascar is so beautiful!”</p>
<p>“Same here, I’m going to play the car chase again!”</p>
<p>Online, almost without exception, all players who had played <em>Uncharted</em> were conquered by its quality.</p>
<p>Although the story of <em>Uncharted</em> wasn't astonishing, the key was how exhilarating it was.</p>
<p>Everything in the game was designed to enhance this feeling.</p>
<p>Grand and majestic, complemented by the in-game scenery of Madagascar, Pirate's Haven, and the ocean vistas, set to the soundtrack 'A Thief's End'.</p>
<p>The tension-filled battles and spectacular views during the treasure hunt constantly stimulated players' adrenaline.</p>
<p>But it wasn't an endless escalation of excitement; after each peak, it interspersed transitional plot points that allowed players to relax, letting them catch their breath and rest after the thrilling moments.</p>
<p>The consequence of this was that the game's flow felt addictive, a relentless wave without a hint of fatigue.</p>
<p>At the same time, although it was a linear game, it also included some collectible elements, allowing players to better understand the stories behind the treasure.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games, Chen Xu smiled: “Indeed, the public’s eyes are sharp!”</p>
<p>He was looking at a hot post from an anonymous player, with a concise and clear title: ‘Warrior of Love Who Warms Hearts with Stories’. The content, naturally, was related to this <em>Uncharted</em> game.</p>
<p>The article was well-reasoned and convincing.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, are you sure this anonymous post wasn't sent by you?” Yang Xin raised her hand and asked.</p>
<p>“Absolutely not me, how could I do such a thing!” Chen Xu said righteously.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, look, Atari also announced that <em>Element World</em> is launching soon!” Ruan Ningxue said to Chen Xu.</p>
<p>“Atari must be anxious,” Meng Zuo chuckled.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry too much, <em>Uncharted</em> has already succeeded. The priority now is to do a good job with the subsequent <em>Uncharted</em> trilogy DLCs,” Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>‘Drake's Fortune’, ‘Among Thieves’, and ‘Drake's Deception’ – Chen Xu had actually laid many groundwork in the game.</p>
<p>At the same time, Chen Xu also made some adjustments to certain plot elements.</p>
<p>For example, Nathan’s brother Sam was only briefly mentioned in <em>Among Thieves</em>, but he had no role in the first and third installments.</p>
<p>The reason Sam, who was only mentioned in the second game, was brought out as the main character in the fourth game, was primarily to give Nathan a reason to return to the world of adventure, as Nathan’s personality is simply like that.</p>
<p>These three installments will also be released separately, similar to the previous <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, the price will be slightly cheaper, as these three are older games and their playtime is not long, roughly half that of <em>A Thief's End</em>.</p>
<p>Additionally, Chen Xu will make minor improvements to some levels in terms of controls and actions, such as ropes and the auto-aim system.</p>
<p>However, it will definitely not be ready in the short term.</p>
<p>After all, while the action system and other elements are already in place, the art assets still need to be completely redone, and the importance of art assets for the <em>Uncharted</em> series is self-evident.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>While Chen Xu was planning the subsequent work for <em>Uncharted</em> within Nebula Games,</p>
<p>The media reviews were successively released, and like the players, they were overwhelmingly positive.</p>
<p>Although no perfect scores were given, they were generally high ratings around 9-9.5.</p>
<p>And the comments spared no praise.</p>
<p>【Incredible visual presentation, <em>Uncharted</em> has shown epoch-making excellence!】</p>
<p>【Before <em>Uncharted</em>, what action-adventure and treasure-hunting games were like isn't important, but one thing is certain: in the coming years after <em>Uncharted</em>, its template will become the textbook for all action-adventure games.】</p>
<p>【A perfect work, but this only makes people more curious, because everyone wants to know what other crazy adventures Nathan Drake has experienced.】</p>
<p>Facing such reviews, all players who had played the game basically had no differing opinions.</p>
<p>Many players felt like they had become <em>Uncharted</em> fanboys/fangirls.</p>
<p>Because from a gameplay experience perspective, they felt that <em>Uncharted</em> pushed the action-adventure and treasure-hunting genres to their limits.</p>
<p>However, although <em>Uncharted</em> continued to have very high popularity online,</p>
<p>Atari had restarted various promotions for <em>Element World</em>, directly announcing its launch date.</p>
<p>There was no choice; seeing the exploding popularity of <em>Uncharted</em>, Zeus became anxious.</p>
<p>Facing the current booming popularity of <em>Uncharted</em>, the best option would be to wait half a month or a month for the hype to cool down.</p>
<p>After all, this is a linear game, and its popularity cannot be maintained indefinitely.</p>
<p>But the key was that Zeus couldn't wait, as <em>Element World</em> was their platform's exclusive blockbuster.</p>
<p>The increase in Huanyu VR's market share due to <em>Uncharted</em> was significant.</p>
<p>If they didn't take action, who knew how many more users Huanyu VR would snatch away.</p>
<p>One must know that in the VR platform sector, it's not just about games.</p>
<p>Buying one copy doesn't necessarily mean buying a second.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, once a player purchases a VR platform, unless there's an update, iteration, or they're truly wealthy and capricious, they rarely buy a second platform.</p>
<p>After all, the price is high!</p>
<p>If they really covet games on the opposing platform, they can always go to a VR internet cafe to experience them.</p>
<p>So, Zeus was anxious watching <em>Uncharted</em> dominate the market.</p>
<p>As for Atari, although they knew it wasn't the best timing, they bravely pushed forward.</p>
<p>Because they themselves were very confident in <em>Element World</em>, otherwise, they wouldn't have challenged Nebula Games before.</p>
<p>Now, even after such a long delay and having seen the quality of <em>Uncharted</em>,</p>
<p>Atari's confidence remained undiminished, especially Antorini, the designer of <em>Element World</em>, was even more confident this time.</p>
