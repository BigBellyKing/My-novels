                <p>Chapter 224: Characteristics of Different Modes (Please Subscribe, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>The group continued their tour.</p>
<p>After admiring Along the River During the Qingming Festival with a sense of wonder, the group arrived at the end, all with astonished expressions. They found a waiting area at the end, with a railway track on the ground, indicating "A train every 5 minutes". Beside it, there was also a countdown and the next stop's destination: the Forbidden City.</p>
<p>“This game can even build high-speed rail!?” Wang Han exclaimed, surprised.</p>
<p>“Now, even if you told me this game could build mechs, I wouldn't be surprised at all,” Zhang Yi said with emotion. “Building a train in a game? What's the big deal now?”</p>
<p>“I’m a bit conflicted now. I really want to try building something myself, but I also want to finish the tour,” Song Ren said, sharing his feelings.</p>
<p>After seeing the exhibition of Along the River During the Qingming Festival, Song Ren's hands were truly itching. He desperately wanted to try his hand at some artistic creation. As he toured, he had already taken pictures of the in-game scenes with his phone, planning to recreate them later.</p>
<p>Hearing Song Ren’s words, the others nearby couldn't help but nod.</p>
<p>As they chatted, a series of 'woo-woo' whistles echoed. A small black dot in the distance slowly grew larger. It really was a train! And there were even seats available to board.</p>
<p>Filled with wonder, Zhang Yi and the others boarded the train, curiously walking from one end to the other. Meanwhile, many players activated their flight mode, circling the train back and forth, seemingly trying to figure out how it moved. However, it was clear that for them at the moment, it was quite baffling. But the only feeling they could grasp was astonishment. What else could this game possibly achieve? While some players expressed skepticism about the videos Chen Xu had previously released officially, after truly entering the game and seeing these creations, all players had only one thought: To what extent could this game called Minecraft go, or what else could it not do? All players were filled with intense curiosity and a desire to explore.</p>
<p>“My goodness, the scenery on both sides of the road has been naturally landscaped!” Wang Han exclaimed in the voice chat.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi and the others looked out through the train's deliberately designed windows. The train moved at an unhurried pace, and outside the window, it was clear that the scenery had been specifically cultivated. Trees were neatly arranged, and along the way, she even saw some wild farms. NPCs, acting as farmers, were tilling fields and working.</p>
<p>Finally, as the train entered a deep tunnel, about ten seconds later, accompanied by a 'woo-woo' whistle. After the brief darkness of the tunnel, the game's lighting and shadows first appeared as a white screen, then slowly, the entire game's picture gradually revealed itself. A magnificent city appeared before all the players' eyes: the Forbidden City.</p>
<p>It was completely different from the previous Along the River During the Qingming Festival. That scene offered more of a detailed experience, a dense scene within a small space. Various buildings were tightly packed within that small scene.</p>
<p>The Forbidden City before them, however, was a grand scene. The entire complex was arranged along a central axis, from south to north, majestic and imposing. However, compared to Along the River During the Qingming Festival with its NPCs, the Forbidden City possessed a solemnity but lacked a bit of human touch.</p>
<p>After admiring it from beginning to end, Wang Han and Zhang Yi continued onward. Playing the piano from 'To Liva', and a functional calculator – a group of players even queued up to personally experience doing calculations with a calculator made within the game. “It can even do this!”</p>
<p>This was the most frequent phrase Zhang Yi and the others uttered throughout their tour. Of course, what left the deepest impression on them was the final amusement park. There were many mini-games to play inside. One could clear levels like in Fall Guys, navigate mazes, and even sit on a rail cart to shoot targets with a bow and arrow.</p>
<p>“And look, it seems this server will also update with new building complexes later!” Wang Han remarked with some emotion.</p>
<p>The amusement park was the last large scene displayed by the official server. However, they also noticed something: the railway track still extended forward, though beyond it lay vast mountains, open land, and forests – all in Minecraft's natural appearance. But from the extended tracks, one could infer that Nebula Games likely had corresponding plans for later. They just hadn't acted on them yet; otherwise, there would be no need to extend the tracks, especially through mountain tunnels.</p>
<p>“I don't care about the future plans. We still have a bit of time, why don't we go build houses?” Zhang Yi suggested.</p>
<p>This suggestion immediately received Song Ren’s support. After all, having seen so much, he was already impatient. His hands were simply too itchy!</p>
<p>“So, shall we play Survival or Creative?” Joey asked from the crowd.</p>
<p>“Let’s do Survival. Creative feels less fulfilling, and I think we can rent a server!” Wang Han said.</p>
<p>“We can talk about that later. Anyway, the description says self-built servers can transfer save data, so let’s just play Survival for now,” Zhang Yi said.</p>
<p>“Alright, but I wonder if these buildings can be moved into our own worlds.” Wang Han looked at the amusement park before her with a hint of longing.</p>
<p>“Don't you read the descriptions? These can all be downloaded from the Workshop! However, they can only be directly generated in Creative Mode. For Survival Mode, you need to collect a certain amount of materials according to MOD blueprints to generate them out of thin air,” Zhang Yi explained.</p>
<p>This was also a special setting made by Chen Xu. In Creative Mode, with infinite materials, it naturally didn't matter. But in Survival Mode, players still needed to collect a certain amount of materials before they could build.</p>
<p>Of course, players didn't have to collect <em>all</em> the materials to build something. Instead, a regional division was adopted. For example, for an amusement park theme, assuming a 1000x1000 block area, players would need to select a 1000x1000 area beforehand.</p>
<p>Then, the amusement park's buildings were also divided into different zones, such as the Ferris wheel, ground, and roller coaster. Each zone had specific material requirements. Once players collected a certain amount of materials, they could choose to automatically generate the construction. Of course, even if not all materials were collected, it didn't matter; whatever was collected would be built automatically. After all, building a house in reality doesn't happen all at once. As for players who didn't want to collect anymore, that was also fine; the project would just become an unfinished building, a '烂尾楼'.</p>
<p>The same applied to private servers set up by players.</p>
<p>Of course, Minecraft itself is an extremely free-form game. There was no absolute rule forcing players to do certain things. 'If I just want to build nice houses easily in Survival Mode, and it doesn't affect other players, is that okay?' 'Of course it is! Provided that when you create the World Seed, you enable cheat mode, and then by entering the corresponding command codes in the game, players can play in any way they desire.'</p>
<p>However, these were only players' private servers and personal console World Seeds. For the official pure servers operated by Nebula Games, the corresponding buildings could only be constructed by the players themselves. Whether it was the Survival Mode, allowing players free rein, or the peaceful Creative Mode, players could only achieve their dreams with their own hands.</p>
<p>First two updates.</p>
