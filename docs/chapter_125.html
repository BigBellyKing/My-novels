                <p>Chapter 125: Reputation Reversal</p>
<p>On the day <em>Dark Souls</em> launched and the day after, players who entered the game primarily discussed how exaggeratedly difficult and maliciously designed it was. These players also protested on Chen Xu's official Weibo account and the Official Game Platform.</p>
<p>Although some players spoke in favor of the game, the majority were negative. As a result, the ratings plummeted.</p>
<p>But now two days have passed, and although many new players who got into the game during this period are still being discouraged online, joining the topic to protest and curse, more and more players are defending <em>Dark Souls</em>. This can be most directly felt from the game's rating. From an initial drop to 8.3, the player rating has now climbed back to 8.5. Game ratings usually fall from high to low, but <em>Dark Souls</em> is rising against the trend. This can only mean one thing: players who previously left negative reviews have started changing them.</p>
<p>At the same time, on the Official Game Forum, many players who have been playing since day one have written reviews of their <em>Dark Souls</em> experience. One long review, in particular, attracted over a thousand replies, becoming a hot post on the forum. In this post, the player recounted their mental journey playing <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>‘At first, like most new players, I encountered the brutal beating of the Crystal Lizard and was discouraged by Gundyr the Ash upon entering the game.’</p>
<p>‘Extremely angry, I immediately gave it a 1-star rating. But now I've changed it back to 9 stars. I don't know if I'll change this score again later, but based on my current experience with <em>Dark Souls</em>, I feel it's absolutely worth this score.’</p>
<p>‘Just as Chen Xu said before, this is a unique ARPG game. What is the core of an ARPG? Character stat increase, better equipment.’</p>
<p>‘Dark Souls also has this setting, but it's unique because attributes and equipment are only aids; the true core is us, the players.’</p>
<p>‘When I first faced Gundyr the Ash, I was constantly getting crushed; I couldn't even trigger his second phase. At that time, I felt it was impossible to defeat this monster.’</p>
<p>‘But after two, three times, I suddenly realized that Gundyr the Ash's health was getting lower and lower each time. The moment I finally defeated him, an extreme sense of accomplishment instantly overwhelmed me. I never thought defeating a Newbie Village BOSS would feel so satisfying.’</p>
<p>‘Looking back, I found that this so-called Gundyr the Ash was just... that. My stats and equipment were still the same as before. I had become stronger, but this strength wasn't about the character's stats in the game; it was about <em>me</em> as a player!’</p>
<p>‘This is a feeling no ARPG has ever given me before.’</p>
<p>‘And the mini-map setting! At first, I was completely bewildered when I realized there was no mini-map, especially after arriving at the High Wall of Lothric and encountering its maliciously designed traps.’</p>
<p>‘But after countless runs and deaths, I found myself, unconsciously, remembering every corner of the High Wall of Lothric. The entire map was interconnected with specially provided shortcuts; advancing and opening them allowed quick access to other areas. This made me appreciate the intricate design of the game's map. Just think, how many maps in previous ARPGs could we remember so clearly?’</p>
<p>‘Overcoming myself, surpassing myself – this is the charm I felt in Dark Souls.’</p>
<p>‘And upon closer inspection, the map and level design in <em>Dark Souls</em> isn't endlessly malicious, because there are bonfires for saving within the map. What we need to do is use our limited Estus Flasks to reach the next bonfire, and then slowly make our way to the BOSS's room.’</p>
<p>‘Persevering to the next bonfire, defeating seemingly unconquerable powerful BOSSes, and breaking through monster encirclements—this utterly captivated me.’</p>
<p>‘There’s nothing more fulfilling in this world than surpassing yourself, and Dark Souls delivers on that!’</p>
<p>‘This might not be a game that satisfies everyone, but it is absolutely not a trash game as some have claimed! Finally, I hope all players can calm down and experience this excellent game!’</p>
<p>After the first batch of players reached the High Wall of Lothric, and some players with action game talent had largely figured out the mechanics of <em>Dark Souls</em>, these players, who had fully awakened a certain attribute, became unstoppable.</p>
<p>These players, who had died countless times in Dark Souls and were still dying, began to post related advice.</p>
<p>On the forum and official Weibo, such posts became increasingly frequent. They were very detailed, and uniformly, everyone praised <em>Dark Souls</em> to the heavens. As more and more people discussed what attracted them to <em>Dark Souls</em> and its advantages, many players re-evaluated the game.</p>
<p>After all, herd mentality is something most people possess. It's not that if others say a game is fun, you'll automatically agree it's fun. But it will at least make players approach it more objectively before voicing their own opinions.</p>
<p>This also led some players who had originally intended to quit to persevere. And once they defeated Gundyr the Ash, they too fully experienced the unique charm of <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>It can be said that <em>Dark Souls</em> is a very special game. Because it can intuitively give players the feeling of "I am slowly becoming stronger."</p>
<p><em>Dark Souls</em> itself is designed as a level-driven game. The BOSSes' attack methods and the hidden traps on the map are all traceable.</p>
<p>Just like monsters such as Gundyr the Ash and the Uchigatana Guy, they have a wind-up animation before attacking, giving players time to react.</p>
<p>All monster designs in <em>Dark Souls</em> are like this, which is why some say <em>Dark Souls</em> is a memorization game.</p>
<p>Unlike pure ACT or fighting games, Dark Souls doesn't demand extremely high reaction times or on-the-spot responses from players.</p>
<p>It's more about familiarity and understanding of the BOSS's move patterns. Once players understand them, defeating the BOSS won't be a difficult task.</p>
<p>This also allows players to fully experience an obvious sense of progression within the game.</p>
<p>At first, they'd encounter a monster and be instantly killed repeatedly, unable to even touch the opponent. But after dying again and again, they'd find themselves capable of defeating the opponent.</p>
<p>This is one of the core pleasures of <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>And after passing Teacher Gundyr's trial and traversing the High Wall of Lothric, the vast worldview of the Dark Souls world gradually unfolded before the players.</p>
<p>The living dragon on Fire Dragon Bridge, the Fire Keeper whom countless players called their "wife," and the legendary Lords of Cinder—these elements continuously captivated players.</p>
