                <p>Chapter 247: The First Hunt (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>As Zhang Yi finished his selection, Song Ren unmuted his mic in the voice channel.</p>
<p>Although they had previously agreed to mute their mics and experience the game individually, it was clear that Song Ren could no longer suppress his inner excitement. Even though they hadn't started the game's combat content yet, from the appearance of Zorah Magdaros at the start, to entering the New World, and the magnificent Astera, he had a belly full of words. How uncomfortable would it be not to say them?</p>
<p>“Folks, what's your progress? Have you chosen your weapons?” Song Ren’s loud voice boomed in the voice channel.</p>
<p>Someone spoke up, and instantly, others replied.</p>
<p>“Not yet! I'm still looking at the introductions, this game has so many weapons!” Joey replied.</p>
<p>At this moment, like Zhang Yi earlier, she was suffering from decision paralysis, mainly because there were simply too many weapons for players to choose from in <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>.</p>
<p>And each one was quite unique. In <em>Dark Souls</em>, for instance, even though there were various classes right from the start, and each class had different early-game weapons, such as the Knight's Longsword or the Deprived's Small Club...</p>
<p>But looking at the appearance of those weapons... never mind, let's not mention it.</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter: World</em> was different. Each weapon was like a class in itself, with designs that were either imposing, cool, or elegant.</p>
<p>There were also corresponding move demonstration videos embedded in the game. Players could intuitively feel the characteristics of these weapons.</p>
<p>For rookie players, whether watching or experiencing, every weapon felt incredibly strong, unless they had a particularly favorite one. Otherwise, it was genuinely difficult to decide.</p>
<p>Following Joey's words, Wang Yifan and Wang Han also agreed.</p>
<p>“Yeah! I feel like I want every single one of these weapons!”</p>
<p>“But even though it’s a trial version, I think we should pick one weapon to get familiar with, and then when the official version comes out, our squad will be set!”</p>
<p>The few of them were very conflicted, completely unsure which weapon to choose.</p>
<p>It was then that Old Song, who had been the first to unmute his mic, spoke up.</p>
<p>“What's there to think about? Long Sword! Such a cool weapon! And look at the beginning of the promotional video, those Wingdrakes carrying three Longsword Heroes assisting the Hunter who was overwhelmed by Anjanath. What does that tell you? It means most Hunters play Long Sword, it’s definitely strong!”</p>
<p>“And the Long Sword is especially cool! Foresight Slash swift as wind, circular thrust; Helm Breaker, a divine sword cutting in two; skilled turns and confident sheathing – it’s truly so cool it's mind-blowing! One person with one Long Sword is a magnificent performance!” Song Ren's voice suddenly became a little deeper.</p>
<p>Because at that moment, in his mind, just like Zhang Yi earlier, he had mentally pictured the magnificent scenes of the Long Sword in the upcoming battles. Just like the Hunter demonstrated in the video when he watched the weapon introduction: two words: Invincible!</p>
<p>Without waiting for Wang Han and the others to interject, Zhang Yi became displeased. He had chosen the Great Sword, after all!</p>
<p>While he admitted that in terms of coolness, the Long Sword might indeed have an edge, that didn’t mean they could belittle the Great Sword!</p>
<p>“Old Song, don’t talk nonsense! The three Longsword Heroes in that promotional video are clearly just sidekicks, and the Great Sword is the sole protagonist! What was the Research Team Leader carrying on his back in the cutscene? And when was the Great Sword overwhelmed? He was leisurely roasting meat! He was clearly calling his sidekicks over to show them the ropes!”</p>
<p>“Listen to me! The Great Sword is incredibly strong! Small hit 50, big hit 100, with built-in Super Armor and powerful charge attacks. One Great Sword is a legend in the New World!” Zhang Yi heavily hyped up the Great Sword.</p>
<p>Song Ren and Zhang Yi were engrossed in their debate about whether the Great Sword or Long Sword was superior.</p>
<p>In the voice channel, Wang Han and the others ignored these two comic duo and quickly made their decisions.</p>
<p>“I’ll just play Bow, I feel like the Bow should be quite safe to use and very cool. Arc Shot, Power Shot, Dragon Piercer, every step solid and steady, every arrow from the string pierces the heart!” Wang Yifan made her choice.</p>
<p>“I’ll go with Dual Blades. That Demon Mode looks really powerful, and I saw in the video that you can even spin around on the monster’s body. Red demon, blossoming like a flower, leaves no one within ten steps!” After much deliberation, Joey finally locked her weapon choice on the Dual Blades.</p>
<p>“I think the Hammer is pretty good. Don’t let its weight fool you, when you hold it and walk, I feel like the speed is quite fast and agile. Plus, spinning like a small top on flat ground, jumping like a fire wheel down a slope, and a charged headshot all in one go!”</p>
<p>Wang Han looked at the Hammer, recalling the demonstration in the video: a Hunter wielding a Hammer directly bashed in the Anjanath's head in the promotional video, truly unparalleled violence. She decided then and there that it would be the Hammer!</p>
<p>With the three of them having confirmed their weapons, the argument between the Long Sword and Great Sword over which was superior was still ongoing.</p>
<p>“Stop arguing, you two. Even though the trial version doesn’t have online multiplayer yet, when the official version comes out and we team up to hunt monsters, we’ll see which weapon is stronger, won't we?” Wang Han interrupted Song Ren and Zhang Yi’s debate.</p>
<p>After a bit more bickering in the voice channel, Zhang Yi also muted his mic. His heart full of excitement, he looked at the Great Sword on the Hunter's back in the game.</p>
<p>It was time to get some practice and verify his ideas through actual combat!</p>
<p>Zhang Yi took the cable car to the dining area on the second floor.</p>
<p>After a conversation with the bun-haired receptionist, who was also his partner, he successfully accepted his first mission in his hunting career: Great Jagras and Ancient Forest.</p>
<p>mission requirements didn't seem difficult, only requiring the defeat of 7 Great Jagras. The time limit was also very ample, a full 50 minutes, which pretty much rounded up to an hour.</p>
<p>In addition, the receptionist also introduced some other related content.</p>
<p>For example, before starting the hunt, one could enjoy a good meal.</p>
<p>Food prepared by the Palico Chef could increase various stats.</p>
<p>At the dining table, Zhang Yi enjoyed a gourmet meal. Unlike his previous life, where Felyne Canteen meals basically consisted of a few ingredients used repeatedly, Chen Xu had thoughtfully visually optimized the presentation of the Felyne Canteen meals.</p>
<p>Each Felyne Canteen meal, composed of different ingredients, had a unique corresponding presentation. Coupled with the high-definition models, watching the in-game character heartily eat the delicious Felyne Canteen meal made Zhang Yi feel a bit hungry himself.</p>
<p>Soon, after eating and drinking to his fill, a Wingdrake, seemingly flying from nowhere, appeared. The Hunter grabbed the Wingdrake's leg and flew into the clouds.</p>
<p>After about two or three seconds, through the clouds, the Wingdrake brought him to the expedition camp in the Ancient Forest.</p>
<p>The receptionist and the Research Team Leader were already waiting there in advance. After a brief conversation, the receptionist stayed in the camp, while the action missions were to be undertaken with the Research Team Leader.</p>
<p>Following the guidance, Zhang Yi took some free supplies from the item box next to him.</p>
<p>Then, he followed the Research Team Leader's figure and began his first hunting journey.</p>
