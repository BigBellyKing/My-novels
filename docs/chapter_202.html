                <h1>Chapter 302: Some Content Changes (7th update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)</h1>
<p>In terms of game mechanics, the modes in <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> are actually quite straightforward.</p>
<p>They are mainly divided into attackers and defenders.</p>
<p>Among these, there are three different modes:</p>
<p>Hostage Mode, Bomb Mode, and Secure Area Mode.</p>
<p>Hostage Mode and Bomb Mode are generally present in previous FPS games, with the main differences lying in some mechanical adjustments.</p>
<p>As for Secure Area Mode, it is essentially a point-capture mode where victory is declared when either team's players occupy a specific area.</p>
<p>Besides these, there's also a rather special mode called Terrorist Hunt Mode.</p>
<p>This mode is mainly for new players to train, allowing them to single-handedly or team up against AI terrorist personnel of varying difficulty levels.</p>
<p>Of course, this mode was later renamed Training Grounds, and the suicide bombers within it also disappeared.</p>
<p>Regarding this mode, Chen Xu still decided to retain the earlier Terrorist Hunt Mode. Furthermore, by utilizing AI technology, players could experience a more realistic counter-terrorism feel when facing the White Masks in PVE.</p>
<p>The rest concerns the recreation of maps. For <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, maps are arguably the most crucial core element.</p>
<p>In his previous life, many players claimed "500 hours to get started," which made many rookies tremble, but in reality, it was a rather exaggerated statement.</p>
<p>Because unlike other FPS games, <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> doesn't demand as high a level of marksmanship as others.</p>
<p>More importantly, it's about familiarity with the operators' skill mechanisms, gadget usage, and the maps themselves.</p>
<p>If one isn't familiar with the maps, a common situation arises:</p>
<p>Who am I?</p>
<p>Where am I?</p>
<p>Who's shooting me?</p>
<p>Who killed me again?</p>
<p>How did someone get behind me?</p>
<p><em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> is practically turned into a horror game by sheer unfamiliarity with the maps.</p>
<p>This is precisely what results from a lack of map familiarity.</p>
<p>Because in <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, walls, wooden panels, and other elements are destructible. Once destroyed, a new attack route emerges.</p>
<p>Attackers can use their gadgets to forcibly destroy obstacles, launching unexpected attacks to catch opponents off guard.</p>
<p>Similarly, defenders can exploit this feature to create passages first, expanding their line of sight, or they can fortify themselves in a small room. Of course, this is strongly discouraged unless it's for specific maps.</p>
<p>Additionally, attackers possess two drones that can enter the building through gaps beneath wooden boards and ventilation ducts to observe the situation and gather intelligence.</p>
<p>Defenders, on the other hand, gain access to the building's camera feeds, allowing them to monitor information from various areas.</p>
<p>It can be said that from the very beginning, both sides of the game will enter a phase of information gathering and psychological warfare.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of action, because it's a VR game, Chen Xu also considered making it more realistic.</p>
<p>Of course, there will be two versions: one for ordinary players and a military version.</p>
<p>However, the two versions will have some differences.</p>
<p>The military version will include more detailed operational content.</p>
<p>For instance, enabling hostages in Hostage Mode to move.</p>
<p>After all, in a real counter-terrorism operation, hostages wouldn't just be crouched on the ground, immobile with their hands over their heads.</p>
<p>Secondly, there's the more realistic operation of being able to step over tripwires, including more destructible environments and interactive items.</p>
<p>Also, character jumping in the game.</p>
<p>In his previous life, some players also raised questions about this, and the official answer was that it was for realism; after all, how could counter-terrorism personnel jump while carrying tens of pounds of equipment?</p>
<p>This answer seemed relatively reasonable, but in reality, it was simply to reduce workload and bugs.</p>
<p>Chen Xu, however, plans to incorporate jumping into the military version.</p>
<p>Because compared to the civilian version, the military version can focus more on realism rather than balance.</p>
<p>After all, isn't the direction given by the Game Department for training purposes?</p>
<p>And honestly, jumping doesn't have much significance in <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>.</p>
<p>The imagined scenario of a jumping Fuze deploying a 'thump-thump-thump' on the ceiling is entirely non-existent.</p>
<p>After all, carrying such heavy equipment, even if one could jump, it wouldn't be very high, at most just a small hop.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the version provided to players will also have many changes in minor details.</p>
<p>For example, rope climbing. Camera angle switching in VR is also a critical core point; otherwise, <em>Rainbow Six</em> might very well turn into <em>Vertigo Six</em>.</p>
<p>..................</p>
<p>Chen Xu was gradually perfecting the design concept document for <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>.</p>
<p>He kept a relatively low profile, but NetDragon, having already confirmed its cooperation with Nebula Games, became very high-profile after their discussions.</p>
<p>They specifically held a news conference to announce the latest news about co-developing a VR blockbuster with Nebula Games.</p>
<p>[The new game will be co-developed by Nebula Games and NetDragon! The codename is temporarily set as 'R6']</p>
<p>[This will be a game utilizing the latest VR technology, bringing an unprecedented new experience to all players]</p>
<p>[Nebula Games Platform and NetDragon Platform will engage in deep strategic cooperation]</p>
<p>Instantly, news flew everywhere.</p>
<p>There was official news revealed by NetDragon, various unofficial news, and wild guesses from players.</p>
<p>As for Chen Xu, he kept a much lower profile, only posting on the official Weibo account to confirm that the game codenamed 'R6' was indeed real.</p>
<p>In an instant, the gaming industry experienced a major upheaval, with countless industry designers and developers looking bewildered.</p>
<p>NetDragon cooperated with Nebula Games!?</p>
<p>Didn't NetDragon seem to be making overtures to the Channel Alliance before?</p>
<p>How did they suddenly turn around and get together with Nebula Games?</p>
<p>The Channel Alliance, in particular, was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>NetDragon's attitude had initially been vague, unlike TengHua, but they had assumed NetDragon was "one of their own," and that with a little effort, they could win them over.</p>
<p>But now, they'd turned around and run off to the competitor?</p>
<p>And it seemed like NetDragon had even initiated the move?</p>
<p>But compared to the industry's deep shock over NetDragon and Nebula Games entering into a strategic partnership...</p>
<p>Ordinary players clearly didn't care about any of that; what truly concerned them was that NetDragon and Nebula Games were actually jointly developing a VR blockbuster!?</p>
<p>As soon as this news was announced, players of both NetDragon and Nebula Games instantly erupted in excitement.</p>
<p>After all, while NetDragon hasn't been doing so well in recent years, it's still a giant in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>And Nebula Games, needless to say, has released nothing but quality titles so far.</p>
<p>The recently popular <em>Warcraft</em> hadn't even lost its momentum yet!</p>
<p>The remaining question was, what type and theme would this game, codenamed R6, actually be?</p>
