                <p>Chapter 825: What Are We Getting Emotional About!</p>
<p>To be honest, the so-called easter egg Mr. Chen gave to the players was nothing short of surprising.</p>
<p>No one expected that Mr. Chen would actually construct an illusory dream for them. And it seemed to hold a great many secrets. Especially the scene where the Phira Incarnation was defeated, which directly showed glimpses of Tifa, Cloud, Barret, and Red XIII's future.</p>
<p>This also proved that destiny had been rewritten. Coupled with Sephiroth's early appearance, even if it wasn't his true form but Jenova cells within Cloud's body, it made countless players realize that this wasn't such a simple story.</p>
<p>As for the setting of Zack and the Parallel World at the end, it sent shivers down countless players' spines with excitement. Some players with wild imaginations had even started envisioning what scenes might appear later. Would Zack and Cloud, from different worlds and timelines, collectively face the final BOSS Sephiroth, or rather, the planet's true enemy: Jenova?</p>
<p>And would they ultimately defeat it?</p>
<p>Just like the story in <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>, although currently only Rex's story has been staged. In reality, as a master of foreshadowing, Chen Xu had buried many plot holes and easter eggs in the game. Players initially didn't know about these, but as high-level <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em> players researched the game, many subtle details were revealed.</p>
<p>That is, there's a high probability that in a world outside of Rex's, another group of humans, created by a god, jointly defeated the evil incarnated by that god. Although they were different worlds, they influenced each other, ultimately leading to the defeat of the final BOSS. It really feels like that now!</p>
<p>But the crucial thing is, why did it stop there?!</p>
<p>Related game communities and forums were filled with countless exasperated players.</p>
<p>'Holy cow! I really want to beat Mr. Chen up. Is this even allowed? You called it an easter egg, is this what an easter egg is?!'</p>
<p>'Don't say anything, I've already renamed my husky 'Mr. Chen,' and I've decided not to feed my husky tonight!'</p>
<p>'Nice one, bro!'</p>
<p>'Everyone gather under Mr. Chen's official Weibo account, let's blow Mr. Chen up!'</p>
<p>'This is frustrating! How can there be such a Game Designer? How dare he?!”</p>
<p>Numerous players grumbled and cursed across various channels. Of course, some players, who had been fans of Nebula Games since before it grew into the behemoth it is today, calmed down after the reveal. Then, watching the players still complaining online, they couldn't help but sigh.</p>
<p>These people are clearly new players. How dare he? Mr. Chen, of course, dares! For so many years, he’s walked this path almost every single year. Which loyal old fan of Nebula Games doesn’t have dozens of scars on their body?</p>
<p>Although the scars from this <em>Final Fantasy</em> are indeed deeper and more numerous. Dead protagonist (Aerith), dead supporting character (Jessie), dead mentor (Angeal), dead brother (Zack), and even the Netorare Warrior (Vincent) that enraged the Pure Love Warrior players – it's fair to say that this <em>Final Fantasy</em> is a magnum opus that makes players' negative emotions explode!</p>
<p>It encompassed all the elements that Nebula Games previously used to make players miserable. But that wasn't enough; this last easter egg, seemingly changing the ending, gave players another lesson beyond the game content.</p>
<p>Regardless, the popularity of <em>Final Fantasy</em> once again soared to a new peak. Many players had previously wondered if there could be a happy ending. Now, with the Phira and multiverse setting, although it was a bit different from what players imagined and an incomplete version, it still satisfied the fantasies of various players.</p>
<p>However, this fantasy also brought some controversy among players.</p>
<p>In addition, a small number of players were discussing the content of this new version's story, specifically the topic of 'whether a perfect ending is necessary.' Within this discussion, some players expressed their views.</p>
<p>'Seeing Aerith return to the Lifestream and trigger the Holy White magic, and Zack passing the Buster Sword to Cloud, was actually very moving.'</p>
<p>'But why introduce the multiverse setting, allowing Aerith and Zack to be resurrected? The original <em>Final Fantasy</em> gave me a sense of growth and friendship, but now it feels completely lacking in depth, like a fairy tale where no matter how much hardship comes before, it’s always a happy ending.'</p>
<p>'The only commendable aspect might be that Sephiroth's image is more perfected; besides his power, his cunning side is also more evident. Although he ultimately failed, Chen Xu's previous games, whether it was the deaths of Arthur Morgan and John Marston in <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, or the Trolley Problem in <em>The Witcher: Wild Hunt</em>, were full of artistic flair. But now, it seems a bit cliché.'</p>
<p>This topic sparked controversy among some players.</p>
<p>'Here we go again, here we go again, the art critic is back with his superiority complex!'</p>
<p>'Honestly, weren't people complaining under Mr. Chen's official Weibo account because of the tragedies before? Now that there's a perfect direction, they're complaining again?'</p>
<p>'Why can't there be a perfect ending? I just want to see Aerith, Zack, and Jessie alive and well! I just want to see Cloud and Tifa alive and well!'</p>
<p>Originally, this was just a discussion among a small group of players, but to everyone's surprise, Chen Xu actually responded on his official Weibo account, which instantly made it a hot topic among many <em>Final Fantasy</em> players.</p>
<p>'Does tragedy necessarily equate to art?'</p>
<p>'In movies, novels, and even games, why must art be linked with tragedy?'</p>
<p>'Indeed, compared to a perfect story, tragedy can be more touching and memorable. But why must a story always end tragically?'</p>
<p>'Some people think a perfect storyline is like a fairy tale. But is 'fairy tale' a derogatory term? A game is a work of art, a form of entertainment, but why can't it also be a fairy tale? For players, isn't a game exactly a fairy tale?'</p>
<p>'To experience stories brought by different fantasies, just like the game's title, this is inherently a world full of fantasy.'</p>
<p>'I believe everyone yearns for the beautiful side of things.'</p>
<p>'If not... well, my previous official Weibo account wouldn't have been 'blown up.'' </p>
<p>Chen Xu's response on his official Weibo also excited the players. Many players felt that Mr. Chen's words resonated deeply with them, and they applauded loudly. Despite the numerous arguments, the desire for better things is an inherent human nature.</p>
<p>'Exactly! Games are art, and also fairy tales. Why can't they have perfect endings!'</p>
<p>'With countless timelines and countless multiverses, why can't Cloud, Zack, Tifa, and Aerith live happily ever after in some multiverse?'</p>
<p>Innumerable players left messages of support, though these were mostly younger players. Following Chen Xu’s words, the older players, who had mostly been just watching the show, suddenly couldn't sit still.</p>
<p>One by one, Nebula Games veterans who had registered five, six, seven, or eight years ago jumped out.</p>
<p>“Bah! Mr. Chen is shameless!”</p>
<p>“Exactly, exactly! Fairy tale, he says! What about Arthur Morgan in <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, or Elizabeth in <em>BioShock</em>? Where’s their fairy tale?!”</p>
<p>“And rookie players, wasn’t there something very important that you overlooked? The so-called perfect ending is just your wishful thinking; this is still a 'will take a lifetime' series!”</p>
<p>“Let’s count all the plot holes Mr. Chen has dug over the years!”</p>
<p>“Don’t be fooled by Mr. Chen! He’s more misleading than Sephiroth!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, he’s clearly changing the subject! Making us forget that this damn content only covers Midgar!”</p>
<p>One by one, the old players, who were fully aware of Chen Xu's tactics, jumped out. And the players who had been discussing whether a perfect ending was worthwhile suddenly came to their senses.</p>
<p>That's right!</p>
<p>What are we getting emotional about?!</p>
<p>Wasn't the main topic before about criticizing Mr. Chen for pulling some new trick?!</p>
<p>How did it turn into a discussion about whether a happy ending or a tragedy is more artistic?</p>
