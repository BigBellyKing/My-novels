<p>Chapter 203: Industry Discussions (Seeking Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Initially, the META game concept in Undertale, developed by Chen Xu, opened up a new line of thinking for many Game Designers in the industry.</p>
<p>Following this, the independent game scene also saw an explosion of META game fever.</p>
<p>The second time was with the release of Overcooked and Fall Guys. Their cooperative and variety show-style gameplay similarly inspired many Game Designers.</p>
<p>However, subsequent titles like Dark Souls and It Takes Two, despite also providing inspiration to many designers, revealed different insights.</p>
<p>They highlighted the lack of excellent two-player cooperative games and that players' acceptance of hardcore games was higher than imagined.</p>
<p>But in terms of the games' actual gameplay and settings, they generally offered little practical reference for many Game Designers.</p>
<p>This was because the improvement came from overall quality, and many small studios and independent game designer teams simply couldn't bear the cost risks.</p>
<p>Now, the emergence of Don't Starve and its so-called sandbox game genre, has brightened the eyes of many Game Designers.</p>
<p>Though, as of now, all Game Designers have yet to fully grasp the core concept of Don't Starve or the concept of sandbox games.</p>
<p>For instance, what exactly is the success factor of Don't Starve? Is it the survival gameplay, the collection and building elements within the game, or other hidden reasons?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it's undeniable that this type of game, Don't Starve, is completely worth trying.</p>
<p>Because it has a fundamental element: Don't Starve is not a big-budget production.</p>
<p>Judging by Don't Starve's art assets and its finished scale, it's clearly a standard independent team game.</p>
<p>And small-scale production means low trial-and-error costs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the overall external framework, many designers feel that replicating the success of Don't Starve is much easier than that of Dark Souls.</p>
<p>Because the theme of Don't Starve is very clear: it simulates a rich sandbox world and allows players to survive better within it.</p>
<p>The only question is how to achieve this in other sandbox games.</p>
<p>On a certain industry forum, many renowned independent Game Designers, as well as designers from second and third-tier companies, were discussing the pros, cons, and direction of Don't Starve.</p>
