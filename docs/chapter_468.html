                <p>Chapter 467: If this game isn't heartwarming, then what game is? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>While Assassin's Creed was selling well, the Uncharted trilogy DLC, which had been long-awaited by players, was finally released.</p>
<p>After all, with the popularity base of the previous Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, players were curious about what other stories Nathan Drake had experienced in these three Uncharted installments.</p>
<p>'Drake's Fortune', 'Among Thieves', 'Drake's Deception'</p>
<p>These three trilogy DLCs could be purchased as a collection, or separately.</p>
<p>This time, the three trilogy DLCs mainly recounted Nathan Drake's youthful adventures.</p>
<p>How he met Sully, who was both a mentor and a father figure, and how he met Elena Fisher – all these stories were presented within these three installments.</p>
<p>This also gave players a more complete understanding of Nathan Drake.</p>
<p>From his youth to his maturity, Nathan Drake's early life experiences were fully displayed before players.</p>
<p>These stories completed Nathan Drake's image, making his life richer.</p>
<p>Just like Ezio, Arthur Morgan, and other characters, the reason they enjoy immense popularity among players is primarily due to the sense of immersion.</p>
<p>These characters' entire lives are presented before players, making them feel that these characters are not fictional but truly exist.</p>
<p>Similarly, these three Uncharted DLCs, combined with the already released A Thief's End, complete Drake's life.</p>
<p>And while these three DLCs are called DLCs, as independently released titles, each one's content is actually no less than that of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End.</p>
<p>The various exciting plot segments within them still had players cheering, especially the game's explosive scenes.</p>
<p>Facing an island attack in the Caribbean, the incredibly classic train level in Among Thieves, and the extremely thrilling plane level and desert crossing, all made countless players incredibly excited.</p>
<p>'LOL, so that's how Nathan Drake and Elena Fisher met! Using archaeology as an excuse for Elena to cover his travel expenses!'</p>
<p>'So Elena was already this awesome back then, directly finding Drake with her wilderness survival skills?'</p>
<p>'I can guarantee that Drake's married life, he won't be able to hide a single penny!'</p>
<p>'So Sully saved Nathan's life, and most of the exploration knowledge was taught to him by Sully, huh!'</p>
<p>'Oh my god, Nathan actually broke up with Elena midway, also because of adventuring! No wonder Elena was so angry at Nathan for lying in A Thief's End!'</p>
<p>'This train chase scene is too classic! Absolutely amazing!'</p>
<p>'I think the plane level was even more exciting! I almost peed myself from fear of heights!'</p>
<p>'Isn't there a clear mind mode?'</p>
<p>'What? Clear mind mode means I won't pee anymore?'</p>
<p>'Shambhala Kingdom, El Dorado, City of a Thousand Pillars, holy crap, they really discover an ruin and then destroy it!'</p>
<p>'Drake, wherever he goes, it collapses! No wonder they're the strongest demolition couple in the industry!'</p>
<p>'But Drake really is different from those treasure-obsessed people; each time, Drake isn't looking for treasure for his own selfish desires!'</p>
<p>'Exactly! In the first one, Drake wanted to make a quick exit with the treasure, but continued the adventure because of Elena Fisher. In the second, he didn't want the warlord to gain power from the treasure. The third was to save Sully, and the final A Thief's End was because his brother Sam re-entered the world!'</p>
<p>'But honestly, Nathan Drake and Elena Fisher, this couple, have taken down thousands of mercenaries!'</p>
<p>'LOL, and countless destroyed roads, vehicles, and ruins.'</p>
<p>The entire Uncharted trilogy DLC still had that familiar feeling, that hormone-exploding excitement and thrill.</p>
<p>And the Drake couple's title as the Captains of the Demolition Squad, before they went there,</p>
<p>The City of a Thousand Pillars, El Dorado, and Shambhala Kingdom were all well and good. After they left, these ruins truly only remained as legends.</p>
<p>This included countless damaged vehicles and collapsed ordinary buildings.</p>
<p>Of course, jokes aside, with the conclusion of Drake's adventure journey, countless players couldn't help but feel a deep sense of emotion after completing the game.</p>
<p>From embarking on his adventure to finally living an ordinary life with Elena, and eventually recounting old stories to his daughter at sea.</p>
<p>Nathan Drake's life clearly concluded perfectly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zeus's acquired first-party title, Medieval: Deliverance, was completely overshadowed by the buzz of Assassin's Creed and the Uncharted trilogy.</p>
<p>In reality, Medieval: Deliverance performed quite well. Even its subsequent media scores, though not as high as Assassin's Creed, still reached a high score of 9.3.</p>
<p>However, due to its extremely hardcore learning curve, coupled with its inability to compare to Assassin's Creed in terms of visual presentation and satisfaction, the game was largely overshadowed.</p>
<p>Despite this slight setback, Zeus was not particularly upset this time.</p>
<p>After all, this was their own first-party title now; it was their 'own son,' one of their own.</p>
<p>Atari before was adopted.</p>
<p>Could an adopted child be treated the same as one's own child?</p>
<p>And to be fair, in actuality, the previous Element World and Medieval: Deliverance had also significantly increased Zeus's market share, as there were quite a few players who enjoyed hardcore games and high-difficulty puzzles.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Outside, players were still discussing Assassin's Creed and the Uncharted trilogy. Inside Nebula Games, Chen Xu was already working on the Halloween and Double Eleven events.</p>
<p>Firstly, for all currently operating games like Rainbow Six Siege, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, and Red Dead Redemption, corresponding Halloween events would be updated.</p>
<p>At the same time, some other single-player games would also have skin content replacements in conjunction with Halloween.</p>
<p>Chen Xu had also been continuously updating the VR themes, trying to optimize various VR themes and then adding them to the backend port of the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>Much like the concept of the metaverse, he aimed to build the Nebula Gameverse. Of course, progress was still relatively slow, mainly handled by the technical and AI teams, and it wouldn't be seen in the short term.</p>
<p>However, from the previous Uncharted to Assassin's Creed, Chen Xu had consistently added various easter eggs to the VR themes.</p>
<p>The main purpose was to indirectly promote it, and this time, for the Double Eleven and Halloween events,</p>
<p>Chen Xu was preparing to let players participate more actively in the VR themes.</p>
<p>Of course, to fit the characteristics of Halloween, a game with holiday features was indispensable.</p>
<p>Players always complained that Assassin's Creed 'cut deep' again, or that Chen Xu was being a 'Warrior of Love'.</p>
<p>This time, he truly wanted players to experience what a 'Warrior of Love' was, and what 'heartwarming' truly meant.</p>
<p>Sitting in front of his computer, Chen Xu opened a document and briefly drafted the main direction of the game.</p>
<p>'A warm family, collectively welcoming a son-in-law they haven't seen in three years…' Recalling the relevant details and content, Chen Xu was filled with emotion.</p>
<p>If this isn't heartwarming, if this isn't love, then what game can be considered love?</p>
