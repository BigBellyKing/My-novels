                <p>Chapter 274: Are You Making CGI Animations or Games? (7th update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)</p>
<p>Chen Xu himself wasn't affected by the outside world's situation, as he generally wouldn't pay attention to such doubts. Whether a game is good or not, you only know after it's made.</p>
<p>Warcraft's production was progressing steadily, and concurrently, Zhang Yida's side also began warming up the promotion.</p>
<p>After Chen Xu released a Weibo post announcing the trial play date, players and the gaming industry actively discussed Warcraft.</p>
<p>However, there wasn't much more explosive news. Chen Xu's official Weibo account had been handed over to his assistant, Lin Rou, during this period, and Nebula Games' official Weibo was also currently managed by Lin Rou.</p>
<p>Every day, these two Weibo accounts would drip-feed information, precisely releasing a concept art image at a set time.</p>
<p>Dwarves, Humans, Night Elves, Undead — one by one, the familiar races from Western fantasy settings were revealed by Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Players' anticipation also grew day by day.</p>
<p>Overseas, Target Software, as before, slowly started its promotional warm-up.</p>
<p>After Dark Souls and Monster Hunter: World, Overseas Nebula Games had already accumulated many loyal fans.</p>
<p>Regarding Warcraft, most of these overseas players expressed their anticipation.</p>
<p>If there was anything that dissatisfied players, it was that they had absolutely no idea about the development progress or the actual situation of Warcraft.</p>
<p>And there were still nearly two months until the trial play date!</p>
<p>How were they going to endure these days?</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Online, players felt like a year passed with each day.</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games' project room, it was very lively.</p>
