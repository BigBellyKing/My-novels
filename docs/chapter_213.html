                <p>Chapter 212: The Quintessential Sandbox Game (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>In Nebula Games' Project Room.</p>
<p>Chen Xu was currently working on building game models. For promotion, the promotional video had already been released. However, player feedback varied; after all, it's extremely difficult to guess a game's gameplay from just one video. Otherwise, there wouldn't be so many misleading trailers. Many game promotional videos are made to look like the greatest masterpieces of all time, but once you enter the game, wow, even instant noodle commercials don't shrink the actual product as much as yours.</p>
<p>Although Chen Xu was criticized by many players as a big bluffer, and some players, whose scalps were numb from being tormented in <em>Dark Souls</em>, even angrily denounced him as an Old Geezer, the anecdotes about him proclaiming himself a 'Warrior of Love' have become an unavoidable meme for Chen Xu's fans.</p>
<p>But one thing everyone agreed on was that Chen Xu generally wouldn't pull any tricks in his promotional trailers. However, this time, <em>Minecraft</em> truly left many players scratching their heads. A pixel game, could it really play any new tricks?</p>
<p>Chen Xu saw the players' confusion online and the debates within the gaming industry. But he didn't explain anything; he knew that once the Early Access trial began and subsequent promotions rolled out, players would naturally understand. Anything said now wouldn't be as convincing or as shocking as directly showcasing it to players then.</p>
<p>In front of the computer in the Project Room, Chen Xu's screen switched rapidly. Repeating blocks were directly constructed by creation tools and AI. Chen Xu, on the other hand, was building more complex scenes. With his current ability, building structures in the game was a piece of cake. Moreover, Chen Xu had already replicated various templates through his Memory Capsule beforehand. Now, it was essentially copying like tracing a gourd.</p>
<p>Soon, buildings appeared one after another in <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>
