                <h1>Chapter 313: Give them a Big Surprise! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h1>
<p>The Black Eye, which the defenders had been using to gather information through its cameras, watched Song Ren and the others at the door and excitedly reported their position: "They're here, they're here! The same lineup as last round, all five of them are still back here!"</p>
<p>Song Ren, who had only shot down the camera on the streetlight, completely failed to notice a pitch-black, prototype-like object tucked away at the corner of the stairs.</p>
<p>This position was quite inconspicuous; if you weren't paying attention, you wouldn't see it at all.</p>
<p>Moreover, knowing that scanning enemies would reveal their presence, Valkyrie Black Eye on the defending team didn't use her scan. She didn't even place a regular marker, opting instead to describe the location via voice.</p>
<p>Black Eye felt that this move of hers was going to be a major contribution!</p>
<p>Black Eye's gadget was to throw cameras that could rotate freely. She had previously thrown one near the stairs of the Central Kitchen.</p>
<p>Next up were the stairs behind the warehouse.</p>
<p>On a whim, he had breached the door, but at first, it showed a red invisible wall, causing him to waste one for nothing, which he then had to shoot down himself.</p>
<p>But when the game officially started, he found that the camera could indeed be thrown out, and then he re-barricaded the door.</p>
<p>He felt it was seamless, and judging by the opponent's reaction, they really hadn't noticed anything amiss!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Song Ren and his team were still very cautious and careful, as they weren't sure if the defenders had heard them breaching the door.</p>
<p>At the same time, his IQ had put away her scanner, because when using the scanner, IQ could only use her pistol.</p>
<p>Among the whole team, only Sledge and he had long-barreled weapons, making them important firepower output points in the game.</p>
<p>"The door's barricaded? Joey, it's your turn! Everyone get into position. After Sledge smashes, Montagne and Blitz will rush out instantly, then Blitz will activate his flash."</p>
<p>"Swift and fast! Show our Rainbow Team's professionalism!" Song Ren briefly emphasized, then Sledge breached the door.</p>
<p>With a crack, the wooden barricade was instantly smashed, just as planned.</p>
<p>Montagne was the first to rush out, but right at that moment, a dark object landed at their doorway.</p>
<p>Remote Charge!</p>
<p>With a bang!</p>
<p>Wang Yifan, holding the Montagne shield, was fine; after all, the Montagne shield was very sturdy.</p>
<p>But the Blitz shield used by Wang Han, who came out second, was directly blasted away.</p>
<p>Before Song Ren and the others, who were following behind, could react to what was happening, two more dark Remote Charges flew over.</p>
<p>Then, with another bang!</p>
<p>Although one of them became a single explosion instead of a double due to a defender's mistake, and even accidentally killed a teammate, in the confined space, coupled with Zhang Yi and the others rushing in recklessly, by the time they realized what was happening, it was already too late to stop.</p>
<p>Accompanied by booming sounds.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, Song Ren, and Joey, who were following behind, were directly blasted into the air.</p>
<p>Only Wang Yifan, dumbfounded and still holding his shield up, retreated to a corner, trembling.</p>
<p>At this moment, the Recruit on the other side chuckled, pulled a black block from his pants, and threw it towards Wang Yifan's head.</p>
<p>The Remote Charge landed perfectly on the ground, detonating with the press of a button.</p>
<p>Another bang.</p>
<p>The shield was very sturdy, but the person behind it was much more fragile.</p>
<p>"What the heck is this! Why are there so many bombs!" Song Ren was completely numb.</p>
<p>"Holy crap, this counter-terrorism game is too damn realistic, isn't it?!" Zhang Yi was also shocked.</p>
<p>"This 'train-style' tactic is underperforming!" Wang Han said, a little frustrated.</p>
<p>Outside the internet cafe, the regular players watching were all amused.</p>
<p>They even felt it was more interesting than watching those streamers live.</p>
<p>The streaming effect was just too good.</p>
<p>"Haha, I'm impressed! You can play this game like this? Choosing 5 Operators with Remote Charges!?"</p>
<p>"To be fair, this is what a real counter-terrorism game should be, right? Terrorist personnel are a bunch of deranged individuals. Isn't it logical for such individuals to each have a Remote Charge?"</p>
<p>"But I feel that information and understanding the map are really too important in this game. Those 'train-style' guys could totally have used a remote-controlled drone to scout behind the door first, and only advanced once they confirmed it was really safe."</p>
<p>"Yeah! The defenders knew their positions directly through Black Eye, and had prepared a trap in advance, just waiting for them to step into it."</p>
<p>"This game truly feels like instant death upon encountering an enemy. Marksmanship might be useful, but compared to other FPS games where marksmanship is supreme, this game can completely hold down a position by gathering information and understanding the map!"</p>
<p>"Exactly! And the different Operators' gadgets are also very important. If it weren't for Black Eye's camera this round, seeing them gather beforehand, they might have trapped and killed one, but it's hard to say what would have happened once they rushed into the larger training room."</p>
<p>Compared to Song Ren and his team who were playing, the players at the internet cafe who couldn't play due to lack of machines and could only spectate, also more deeply felt the unique core of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> through the God's-eye view.</p>
<p>"Ahem, that was just an accident. Next up is a defensive map. I think this defense should be relatively simple," Song Ren coughed.</p>
<p>Although they had already lost two consecutive rounds and reached match point.</p>
<p>It wasn't as if there was no hope.</p>
<p>"I strongly express my doubts!" Zhang Yi voiced his opinion.</p>
<p>"Concurred!" Wang Han quickly followed, standing on a unified front with Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>"This round, we're changing positions!" Song Ren quickly changed the subject.</p>
<p>The map was still Chicago Mansion. The previous location was the underground garage area.</p>
<p>Now, the bomb sites had moved to the Kids' Bedroom on the second floor and the Workshop opposite it.</p>
<p>"What Operators should we pick?" Zhang Yi sighed, asking.</p>
<p>After all, they were already two points behind. From start to finish, he had only managed to 'bang bang bang' kill one at the beginning, with Song Ren finishing off another.</p>
<p>As for the last round, although the opponents lost one, it was also a team kill by their own teammate.</p>
<p>That red triangle was currently glowing.</p>
<p>"Everyone play to your strengths!" After the 'train-style' tactic failed two consecutive times, Song Ren was a bit lost at this point.</p>
<p>Entering the game, several people also felt the difference between defense and offense.</p>
<p>Many doorways could be barricaded with wooden planks, and some plaster walls could also be reinforced with metal plates.</p>
<p>"This feels a bit like renovation! We defenders are diligent renovators, and the attackers are the demolition crew," Joey chuckled, having thought of something.</p>
<p>"Stop talking and hurry up with the renovation. But the opponents seem lost too! They haven't found the bomb after all this time." Zhang Yi reinforced all the walls in the Kids' Bedroom that could be reinforced with metal plates.</p>
<p>He also replaced the three wooden windows with his Dragon Scale Panels, as the Operator Castle.</p>
<p>"Holy crap, this Kids' Bedroom feels absolutely invincible!"</p>
<p>Only then did Song Ren notice the unique aspects of this Kids' Bedroom.</p>
<p>All the walls were covered with steel plates, and the windows were reinforced with bulletproof Dragon Scale Panels; it could practically be called an impregnable fortress.</p>
<p>Let alone people, probably not even a single fly could get in.</p>
<p>"That's right, how could what I sealed not be awesome!" Zhang Yi also smiled.</p>
<p>"I have a bold idea! What if all five of us stay in here?" Song Ren thought of something and proposed a suggestion.</p>
<p>"All of us crouch inside? Not defend the other bomb site?" Zhang Yi questioned.</p>
<p>"How about we just give up on this round and humble the opponents? The last round was too infuriating!" Wang Han also suggested, as the last round had really annoyed her.</p>
<p>"Let's give them a surprise! Five guns aimed at them when they open the door!" Wang Yifan also chuckled.</p>
<p>"I've placed cameras in the room, and Sister Han... look what I have in my hand!" Joey, who had chosen Black Eye this round, pulled out a dark Remote Charge from his pocket.</p>
<p>"It's settled then! Let's be professional. Wang Han, Joey, you two lie prone in front. The three of us will crouch in the back. Strike a pose and give them a big surprise!"</p>
