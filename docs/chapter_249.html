                <p>Chapter 248: This Game is So Easy! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>After passing through a forest path, Zhang Yi couldn't help but sigh with emotion.</p>
<p>In the distance, there was a beach, and the lush Ancient Forest. On the beach, there were also many Aptonoth.</p>
<p>These Aptonoth gathered in small groups, each with a long, hammer-like tail.</p>
<p>Ignoring the Squad Leader who was waving at him ahead, Zhang Yi ran directly towards an Aptonoth drinking water in the distance.</p>
<p>“I'll start by getting some practice with you!”</p>
<p>Looking at the Aptonoth before him, Zhang Yi was still a little excited.</p>
<p>After all, this was his first real hunt; all his previous moves were practiced on wooden dummies.</p>
<p>As Zhang Yi approached, the Aptonoth drinking water in front of him seemed unaware of the impending danger.</p>
<p>And through previous introductions to Monster Hunter: World, Zhang Yi also knew that these Aptonoth would not actively attack; they were docile creatures.</p>
<p>Clearly, the purpose of these creatures was for players to practice.</p>
<p>Looking at the Aptonoth in front of him, Zhang Yi swung his Great Sword down, then charged it. As a damage number flew out, the Aptonoth let out a cry of pain, counterattacked with its tail hammer, and tried to flee.</p>
<p>The other Aptonoth not far away immediately fled in terror.</p>
<p>Although hit by the Aptonoth's tail, the Great Sword's charged attack hyper armor kept the hunter from flinching, and the damage was negligible.</p>
<p>Next, with a second strong charged swing, the Aptonoth let out another wail and was immediately defeated.</p>
<p>“Indeed, the Great Sword is truly divine! I haven't even tried hard, and you're already down!”</p>
<p>Zhang Yi was filled with excitement and exhilaration.</p>
<p>The Aptonoth in front of him, judging by its size, was as stout as two oxen.</p>
<p>But he never expected it to be so fragile; the Great Sword's damage was simply explosive!</p>
<p>Even though he knew this monster was meant for players to test their weapons on, the kind that won't fight back or talk back when insulted.</p>
<p>But Zhang Yi still felt a rush of excitement.</p>
<p>Especially the Great Sword in his hand; its damage far exceeded his expectations.</p>
<p>After two or three swings, the Aptonoth in front of him was down.</p>
<p>With every swing, the in-game sound effects and action feedback felt as if the Great Sword had truly cut into a slab of meat.</p>
<p>It was incredibly satisfying.</p>
<p>As for wounds, Monster Hunter: World didn't display much gore.</p>
<p>Although it was a hunting game, having players hack monsters to bloody bits and then dismember them would be too much.</p>
<p>Therefore, there were appropriate wounds during the hunt, primarily to enhance player immersion.</p>
<p>But it didn't pursue so-called realism.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game had a damage system where players could see the damage they inflicted.</p>
<p>This system was enabled by default, but it could be turned off to enhance immersion.</p>
<p>It was enabled by default primarily to help players become more familiar with the game.</p>
<p>Because in Monster Hunter: World, there were Hitzones and weaknesses in different body parts.</p>
<p>With damage indicators, players could better distinguish these differences.</p>
<p>Of course, for most hunter players currently, this was completely useless.</p>
<p>After all, what good was it to tell players about weaknesses?</p>
<p>They might not even be able to hit them.</p>
<p>They'd still be 'foot massage masters' and 'back scrubbers'.</p>
<p>Which veteran hunter didn't evolve from being a 'foot massage master' and 'back scrubber'?</p>
<p>As for Hitzones? Weaknesses?</p>
<p>Completely clueless!</p>
<p>One word: Just go for it first!</p>
<p>After a brief moment of excitement, Zhang Yi sheathed his Great Sword to collect his spoils.</p>
<p>At the same time, he took out his Whetstone and sharpened his Great Sword, restoring its Sharpness.</p>
<p>Although he had defeated the first monster of his hunting career.</p>
<p>But after the brief excitement, Zhang Yi's mood quickly returned to normal.</p>
<p>After all, he knew very well that the Aptonoth was specifically for players to practice on.</p>
<p>There was virtually no chance of failing to defeat it.</p>
<p>In such a situation, there was naturally no sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>It was like defeating Gundyr the Ash BOSS at the beginning of Dark Souls; that sense of accomplishment was off the charts, primarily because he knew that BOSS was a huge challenge for him at the time.</p>
<p>And he had painstakingly honed his skills through countless hardships to defeat that BOSS.</p>
<p>Or in some RPGs, where players painstakingly grind levels and craft equipment to clear BOSSes due to insufficient level attributes, it also brings a sense of joy and accomplishment.</p>
<p>But now, having defeated an Aptonoth that wouldn't fight back or talk back, and was only slightly stronger than a training dummy, if that could bring a sense of accomplishment, then nobody could be blamed.</p>
<p>So now, Zhang Yi mostly just felt that he hadn't chosen the wrong weapon.</p>
<p>This Great Sword was simply too powerful.</p>
<p>Charged attack hyper armor, explosive damage.</p>
<p>Truly worthy of being the main hunter's weapon in the promotional video.</p>
<p>Like the three Longsword Heroes at the end of the previous promotional video, they clearly belonged to the minor character level of hunters.</p>
<p>“It's just that this Aptonoth is really too fragile!”</p>
<p>Carrying his Great Sword, he didn't immediately follow the green Scoutflies to find the Squad Leader to complete the main quest, as fifty minutes still seemed ample.</p>
<p>With the Great Sword on his back, Zhang Yi found and eliminated two more Aptonoth one by one.</p>
<p>At the same time, he wandered around the outskirts of the Ancient Forest, and he discovered some very interesting things.</p>
<p>That is, on the game's large map, there were many interactive elements.</p>
<p>Various fruits and food items could be gathered, and even insects and animals on the ground could be captured.</p>
<p>Just now, he used the net on him to catch a grey Detour Rabbit.</p>
<p>After wandering for a long time, Zhang Yi finally followed the green Scoutflies through a small path and reached the quest location: Jagras's Den.</p>
<p>As soon as he peeked out, Zhang Yi saw a group of Small Jagras, with some larger ones nearby.</p>
<p>“So many!”</p>
<p>Seeing a pile of Jagras in front of him, Zhang Yi instinctively felt a little panic.</p>
<p>This was all a lingering effect from playing Dark Souls.</p>
<p>You know, the scariest thing in Dark Souls wasn't seeing a BOSS, but seeing a group of mobs.</p>
<p>However, once Zhang Yi actually started fighting, he realized he had completely overthought it.</p>
<p>“My health bar isn't Photoshopped anymore! It's so sturdy!”</p>
<p>Accustomed to the easily shattered health bar in Dark Souls, Zhang Yi instantly became excited seeing only a tiny bit of his health bar drop after these Small Jagras attacked him in Monster Hunter: World.</p>
<p>What did this mean? It meant that Monster Hunter: World was indeed not a high-difficulty game like Dark Souls!</p>
<p>Next, the feedback Zhang Yi got from striking the Jagras with his Great Sword further proved this point.</p>
<p>With a charged swing, the Jagras was immediately knocked down. He followed up with two more hits and successfully took one down.</p>
<p>Monsters barely hurt him, but he could defeat them in two or three hits; he had practically turned into a BOSS!</p>
<p>Moreover, inside the cave, there were some firefly-like entities that, when interacted with, acted like Flashfly, temporarily blinding the Jagras.</p>
<p>At this point, the Great Sword could be mindlessly charged, taking down enemies 'one hit, one kid'.</p>
<p>And his Palico companion even helped him; invincible!</p>
<p>He had never felt so exhilarated.</p>
<p>This game is so easy!</p>
<p>It's actually a Hack-and-Slash Game!</p>
