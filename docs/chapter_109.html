                <p>Inside the office, only Chen Xu and Qin Yi were present. Chen Xu closed the initial DEMO of Minecraft, then opened the previous Design concept document.</p>
<p>This part belonged to the Crafting and tech system in Minecraft.</p>
<p>Thanks to the technology of the Parallel World, content that was relatively difficult to achieve in his previous life could now be resolved.</p>
<p>It was directly integrated into the game itself, rather than being achieved through clever use of MODs.</p>
<p>Just like Redstone technology, various materials and tools could be assembled into components and control units, combined with corresponding model shells, to make them move within the game.</p>
<p>The most intuitive manifestation in the game was the ability to truly build cars, instead of just using Redstone to make minecarts on tracks.</p>
<p>“But Mr. Chen, isn't this too complicated? Can players really handle this part of the content?”</p>
<p>“And these simple components and control units are quite limited; isn't this Redstone technology too complex?” Qin Yi said, scratching his head.</p>
<p>Just looking at it made his scalp tingle a bit.</p>
<p>“Don't underestimate players; their capabilities are far stronger than you imagine.” Hearing Qin Yi's words, Chen Xu couldn't help but smile faintly.</p>
<p>“Moreover, I'm not planning to throw everything at players all at once. We're just developing this feature for now; the first version released to players won't include it yet,” Chen Xu explained.</p>
<p>Rich content is good, but it shouldn't be dumped on players all at once, as if desperate to let them know how extensive the content is.</p>
<p>It's like when you play a game and initially want to clear all the side quests, but right at the start, you open the map and find the Game developers telling you how difficult it is to complete them because the map is riddled with countless question marks.</p>
<p>This actually becomes a different kind of deterrent, meant to tell players how rich the game's content is, but instead it scares them away.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for Minecraft, the game doesn't just rely on official new content releases; it's the countless passionate players who collectively shape the game's community environment, creating its unique miracle and splendor.</p>
<p>So, for Chen Xu, subsequent promotions and content disclosures were more about inspiring players, making them understand what else was possible, and then encouraging them to experiment.</p>
<p>Prepare raw materials like sand, cement, and rebar.</p>
<p>As for what kind of buildings could actually be created.</p>
<p>That would be up to the players themselves.</p>
<p>Whether it was the modding system extended from these features, or the content of the game itself.</p>
<p>After all, 'creation' was the core of Minecraft.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>The development of Minecraft was progressing very smoothly. There were no difficulties with the game's content itself, as in his previous life, this game was developed independently by an individual, making its production entirely straightforward.</p>
<p>For Chen Xu, the main challenge was how to make it easier and more open for players to create MODs.</p>
<p>This aspect was slowly being overcome through continuous testing.</p>
<p>By late November, the main content of Minecraft was largely complete, though it was still some distance from being a true finished game.</p>
<p>Chen Xu was also discussing with Zhang Yida's Operations team what kind of model should be used for the subsequent promotion and marketing of Minecraft.</p>
<p>After all, unlike the previous Don't Starve, Minecraft's strategic importance was entirely on par with Dark Souls.</p>
<p>However, it was currently still in the discussion phase, and there was still some time before it would be truly finalized and promoted.</p>
<p>In the office, Chen Xu glanced at the time, shut down his computer, and walked out.</p>
<p>Arriving at the break area, he saw a group of people gathered, experiencing Minecraft.</p>
<p>Currently in development, the company's internal staff served as the current testers.</p>
<p>“Haha, Sister Xin, is this your house? Haha!”</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue let out a burst of laughter from the crowd.</p>
<p>Following this, Qin Yi, Lin Tao, and others burst into laughter, and the atmosphere in the crowd was filled with cheerfulness.</p>
<p>“Haha, Sister Xin, that's amazing!”</p>
<p>“I wouldn't even respect walls, but I respect you, Sister Xin!”</p>
<p>Hearing the commotion, Chen Xu also went over for a look.</p>
<p>On the computer screen in front of Yang Xin, he saw a house enclosed by wood, which looked like a giant cube from a distance. The most crucial part was that it was completely airtight, with just a wooden door at the entrance and torches stuck on both sides for illumination.</p>
<p>Walking inside, he saw a log-cabin-style interior, very much in tune with nature.</p>
<p>As for the interior layout, it clearly adopted a minimalist style.</p>
<p>There was a crafting table for making items, a storage chest, and a bed placed in the corner. Besides these, there was nothing else.</p>
<p>No, wait, on the walls on both sides of the house, there were also four torches, fully responding to the call for energy conservation and emission reduction.</p>
<p>Yang Xin, who had initially felt quite good about her house when building it.</p>
<p>Hearing everyone's comments, she now walked out of the house herself, carefully circled it twice, and suddenly felt a bit speechless.</p>
<p>The more she looked, the more it felt like a matchbox.</p>
<p>Coupled with those few candles, it had a distinct vibe of a prison dark room.</p>
<p>The design was indeed a bit awkward.</p>
<p>Of course, although she thought this inwardly, outwardly she remained calm.</p>
<p>“How good can a house under construction be? It's just like how we make games. The game I'm playing now is still an unfinished, test-phase version, so naturally, my house is also a test-version house!” Looking at everyone's gazes, Yang Xin forced out a wave of logic.</p>
<p>Then, probably feeling that the convincing power might be a bit lacking, Yang Xin continued: “And to be honest, my house isn't that bad. It doesn't leak in the rain, and it's not drafty in winter. Although it looks a bit shabby, its strength lies in being sturdy and durable.”</p>
<p>Watching Yang Xin still defending herself, Chen Xu, who had been silent beside her, finally couldn't help but interject: “Honestly, the test version of the game doesn't take the blame for this! After all, this 'pot' is really too dark.”</p>
<p>“Originally, my plan was for us all to participate in building some structures for later use, to guide players in understanding some of the game's unique selling points. However, I think it will be difficult for you to take on this task now.”</p>
<p>Chen Xu's original plan was for team members to collectively build some classic structures and character sculptures.</p>
<p>For example, classic buildings from Dark Souls, such as Firelink Shrine and other distinctive landmarks.</p>
<p>Although Chen Xu could eventually create a specialized building tool for most of the work, there were still many parts that would require manual effort.</p>
<p>At that time, it could serve as a good promotional piece for the game.</p>
<p>However, looking at Yang Xin's building, which resembled a prison dark room, Chen Xu felt that the number of employees participating in this construction project could probably be reduced by one.</p>
<p>“Ahem, so, Mr. Chen, when are we going to launch the game?”</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu's words, and glancing at the dark room on the computer, Yang Xin, with lightning speed, closed the game on her desktop, also clicking 'don't save' casually, then changed the subject and asked.</p>
<p>“There's still some content to add, but it's almost done. However, unlike before, we'll conduct a small-scale test after New Year's Day, mainly to observe player feedback and identify any experiential flaws that need correction,” Chen Xu said after some thought.</p>
