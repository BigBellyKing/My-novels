                <p>Chapter 241: No One Can Stop Me From Becoming the Azure Star! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Following Chen Xu's official Weibo post, many masochistic players of the Souls series, who had been eagerly anticipating the long-lost dance on a knife's edge and suffering in Monster Hunter: World, felt a wave of disappointment.</p>
<p>However, what more players were concerned about was the content revealed in Chen Xu's reply.</p>
<p>A pure Hunting Co-op Game, not a Souls-like game, and it also features equipment collection and enhancement gameplay.</p>
<p>Many players were taken aback.</p>
<p>Because the few simple sentences on the official Weibo account revealed far too much.</p>
<p>In the Parallel World, Co-op games were no longer a rare genre.</p>
<p>However, purely Co-op games were still relatively uncommon.</p>
<p>Most still adopted a setting where competitive and co-op play coexisted.</p>
<p>After all, for purely co-op games, all content had to revolve around map levels and BOSS design.</p>
<p>Content involving player versus player combat, on the other hand, was simpler to create and could better maintain a player's engagement time in the game.</p>
<p>Thus, purely Co-op games were quite rare.</p>
<p>As for hunting games, while there were a few decent series, they were also quite rare, with releases typically every two or three years.</p>
<p>Because it was difficult to establish a core gameplay loop.</p>
<p>Even some games originally centered on hunting either underwent reskins or significant reforms.</p>
<p>More often, hunting was integrated into FPS and ARPGs as a system setting for bonus mini-games.</p>
<p>Making it a standalone genre was simply too rare.</p>
<p>If there was any difference to be noted, it was that in Monster Hunter: World, Chen Xu's latest development, the hunting targets were dragons.</p>
<p>Similarly, countless attentive players were discussing animatedly that Monster Hunter: World was a hunting-themed game.</p>
<p>“Hunting games, now that I think about it, don't seem like much fun. Some hunting games I played before were really boring.”</p>
<p>“Exactly, it felt like a running simulator.”</p>
<p>“+1! In the early stages, you track the prey, find it, and then bam, one shot, and the prey dies instantly.”</p>
<p>“Speaking of which, I wonder what the gameplay is like! With the character-to-dragon ratio, are we sure the monsters aren't going to be stomping us?”</p>
<p>“Probably not, didn't Mr. Chen say so? It won't be a Souls-like game, and it has grindy elements. It might even be an exhilarating action hunting game.”</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, that's not impossible! Why would Mr. Chen give a hint on the official Weibo if not to prevent players who thought it was like Dark Souls from buying it, only to be disappointed when they found it wasn't what they expected?”</p>
<p>“If it really is a grindy game, then my only hope is that the dragons in it will be tough to beat. Some previous hunting games just weren't satisfying.”</p>
<p>As players engaged in heated discussions, the development of Monster Hunter: World continued to advance.</p>
<p>Chen Xu also successively revealed more content on the official Weibo and website.</p>
<p>Over a dozen types of usable weapons, each offering a different experience.</p>
<p>Clearly, there was no 'class division' in this game; all players had only one identity: hunter.</p>
<p>And what weapon to use was entirely up to the players themselves.</p>
<p>One weapon was equivalent to one class. If you got tired of one, you could just switch to another weapon.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game's environments, such as the Ancient Forest, Wildspire Waste, Coral Highlands, Rotten Vale, and Elder's Recess, were gradually unveiled to players.</p>
<p>They were truly breathtakingly beautiful.</p>
<p>Besides these, there was also related game lore, such as simple introductions and explanations of the Hunter's Guild and the Azure Star.</p>
<p>Combined with this environment concept art and the gameplay Chen Xu had previously mentioned, a rough outline had already formed in the minds of all players.</p>
<p>Players would take on the role of a hunter, embarking on adventurous hunts in a vivid and lifelike world.</p>
<p>The targets of these hunts would be powerful dragon-like creatures, and ultimately, through repeated hunts, players would become legendary marvels of the hunting world, guided by the still-legendary Azure Star, who would show the way for future hunters.</p>
<p>Simply perfect!</p>
<p>Using a variety of weapons to hunt different types of dragons and collecting corresponding materials to craft equipment.</p>
<p>Ultimately becoming the great Azure Star.</p>
<p>And with the release of this information, countless players grew increasingly excited.</p>
<p>“I'm going to be a hunter!”</p>
<p>“I'm going to hunt Elder Dragons!”</p>
<p>“No one can stop me from becoming the Azure Star!”</p>
<p>Especially from the promotional materials, it appeared that the latest AI technology would be applied in the game.</p>
<p>It would showcase a vibrant ecological chain within the game.</p>
<p>Although it was still unclear what this so-called AI technology truly entailed, or what the game was actually like.</p>
<p>But there was no doubt that the grand promises being made smelled delicious even through the screen.</p>
<p>This was also thanks to Nebula Games, as every game they had released so far had given players significant surprises.</p>
<p>Although sometimes the element of 'shock' was too much, one thing was undeniable: they were all high-quality masterpieces.</p>
<p>So this time, there was no reason for players not to look forward to Monster Hunter: World.</p>
<p>Of course, during this period, many players remained less optimistic.</p>
<p>After all, considering the sheer size of the dragons compared to the tiny hunters, it always gave players some uneasy thoughts.</p>
<p>“Seriously, why do you guys think this is an easy game? What if it's a hardcore game like Dark Souls?”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on, how could it be? Mr. Chen already explicitly said it's not a Souls-like game, and it has grindy elements. Even if it's difficult, how hard could it possibly be?”</p>
<p>“Exactly! Even though Mr. Chen has always been tricking us, saying that 'The one with the big hammer' is a very philosophical game, and while talking about 'Warrior of Love' he then made Outlast and Silent Hill PT, since he said on the official Weibo that it's not a Souls-like game, then Monster Hunter: World definitely cannot be a Souls-like game!”</p>
<p>“And based on the content revealed so far, we are organized people! I think we should also be able to recruit NPC hunter teammates to collectively hunt monsters!”</p>
<p>“Yeah! Just thinking about it is exciting, plus there's online multiplayer! Up to 4 people can hunt together. Any game with multiplayer usually isn't too difficult, and even if it is, so what? Can it be harder than Dark Souls? An eight-playthrough Dark Souls player, reporting for duty!”</p>
<p>“Bro upstairs, while what you said is very passionate, I really don't want to expose your bragging, but can you please turn off your Nebula Games Platform verification? A total of 8 hours of playtime across two Dark Souls games, and you're already on your eighth playthrough?”</p>
<p>Regarding the various promotional contents for Monster Hunter: World online, players entered into fierce discussions.</p>
<p>Essentially, most players expressed great anticipation.</p>
<p>Even though there hadn't been any particularly fun hunting games before this.</p>
<p>But this was produced by Nebula Games, and while Chen Xu had inexplicably accumulated many memes over the past few years.</p>
<p>The reputation that 'Nebula-produced must be a masterpiece' was increasingly trusted by players.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Monster Hunter: World itself was completely different from ordinary hunting games.</p>
<p>After all, typical hunting games usually involved hunting lions, tigers, and the like.</p>
<p>However, even though Monster Hunter: World had only shown one monster called Nergigante.</p>
<p>The oppressive feeling conveyed in its concept art already made many players eagerly want to battle it out for three hundred rounds.</p>
<p>Not to mention the magnificent and beautiful environment maps like the Ancient Forest and Coral Highlands.</p>
