                <h2>Chapter 300: Anti-Terrorism Game (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h2>
<p>Two days later, inside the Nebula Games reception room.</p>
<p>Chen Xu looked at Meng Zuo and couldn't help but sigh with emotion: "I thought your NetDragon, Channel Alliance, and TengHua were all on the same side."</p>
<p>"Please remove 'you guys'. I'm just a hired hand, responsible for acting as a lubricant and building a bridge for communication between you, Mr. Chen, and NetDragon," Meng Zuo said, sitting in his chair.</p>
<p>"But Teacher Meng, this will be our first collaboration!" Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>This time, NetDragon approaching them was indeed beyond Chen Xu's expectations.</p>
<p>According to NetDragon's idea, Nebula Games and NetDragon could form a strategic cooperation.</p>
<p>Some third-party games under NetDragon, including first-party games, could be launched on the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>Similarly, Nebula Games Platform's first-party and third-party games would also need to be launched on NetDragon's platforms.</p>
<p>Chen Xu didn't have much objection to this.</p>
<p>Because fundamentally, launching these games still required installing the Nebula Games Platform, and the same applied to NetDragon's side.</p>
<p>In terms of user numbers, there wasn't really a case of anyone taking advantage of anyone else.</p>
<p>The reason NetDragon approached Nebula Games was mainly because in the VR field, NetDragon had been consistently suppressed by TengHua in recent years.</p>
<p>Starting from "Star God" two years ago, it was only slightly inferior in terms of awards, but sales were still considerable. However, in these two years, Nebula Games had risen sharply in the PC domain, while TengHua had been pressing hard in the VR sector. NetDragon was a large and powerful company, but even so, a sense of crisis had already emerged.</p>
<p>At the same time, due to the rise of the Nebula Games Platform, the Channel Alliance also united, and TengHua was now in cahoots with the Channel Alliance.</p>
<p>For this VR Game Design Competition, NetDragon also wanted to make a move, which was to join hands with Nebula Games and establish a foothold in the VR sector together.</p>
<p>Both parties were pursuing their own interests, but NetDragon's terms were indeed quite sincere.</p>
<p>Chen Xu had no reason to refuse.</p>
<p>Both parties would jointly invest in the new game, and profit-sharing had also been agreed upon. However, regarding copyright, it would belong to Nebula Games.</p>
<p>This was also Chen Xu's bottom line.</p>
<p>He could share the money with them, but copyright was non-negotiable.</p>
<p>"However, regarding the new game, Mr. Chen, what are your thoughts?" Meng Zuo didn't continue discussing this matter with Chen Xu, but shifted the topic to games.</p>
<p>He wasn't particularly interested in the specific interests involved or any strategic goals.</p>
<p>For him, what he wanted to know more was how Chen Xu planned to approach the new VR game.</p>
<p>In the past, he still wanted to compete with Chen Xu, but now that thought was completely gone, replaced by curiosity about how Chen Xu would proceed.</p>
<p>"FPS and first-person, these two entry points are considered the best," Chen Xu said.</p>
<p>Meng Zuo, sitting there, nodded.</p>
<p>Actually, this was probably the direction other interested parties participating in this VR Game Design Competition were also prepared to venture into.</p>
<p>After all, it involved military training. No matter what it was ultimately for, at least the Game Department stated this externally, so they definitely had to work in this direction.</p>
<p>"However, regarding the theme, it cannot be the same as traditional themes like cops and robbers battles, where you purchase corresponding weapons and firearms and play around defusing bombs. There isn't much of a problem with that gameplay itself; the key lies in the game's expressive content," Chen Xu said, looking at Meng Zuo.</p>
<p>Similar to CS:GO-like games in his previous life, the embryonic form of such games had long emerged in this Parallel World.</p>
<p>They basically all revolved around planting and defusing bombs, and of course, there was also hostage rescue.</p>
<p>But the gameplay was similar to Counter-Strike from his previous life.</p>
<p>"If counter-terrorism operations were really like such games, where soldiers held guns and flashbangs, or just rushed in to kill terrorists and defuse bombs, or rescue hostages, then soldiers from any country would likely suffer heavy casualties."</p>
<p>"Completely different from traditional field battles and jungle warfare, with the advancement of times, the continuously spreading terrorist activities, crime, and special operations environments have moved into confined indoor environments like buildings, residential houses, and alleys. Thus, tactics derived from these scenarios are called indoor close-quarters combat, also known as CQB. Of course, not all combat occurring indoors is called CQB."</p>
<p>"And nowadays, typical counter-terrorism units will appropriately group personnel according to mission characteristics, such as: assault, support, sniping, demolition, containment, etc."</p>
<p>"Furthermore, with the advancement of times, counter-terrorism equipment is no longer limited to combat with just a single gun, but involves high-tech combat that considers overall tactics."</p>
<p>"Flash shields, unmanned reconnaissance vehicles, heartbeat scanners, concussion grenades, breaching rams, shotgun-spread explosives, breaching charges..."</p>
<p>All sorts of professional terms came out of Chen Xu's mouth.</p>
<p>Meng Zuo, sitting opposite, was directly stunned by this combination of punches.</p>
<p>Some he had heard of, some he had no idea about.</p>
<p>But even though he didn't understand, he was greatly shocked!</p>
<p>Chen Xu's narration did not stop, but became more enthusiastic the more he spoke.</p>
<p>"Facing an unfamiliar building, inside which are hostages we need to rescue or bombs to defuse, but at the same time, there are heinous terrorist personnel inside. Under such circumstances, do you think a normal counter-terrorism operation is just to directly go in with guns and 'bang bang bang'?"</p>
<p>"Of course not! When it's decided to enter the building where the terrorists are located to carry out operations, this means negotiations have broken down. And when performing missions in a complex building, you never know where the enemy will be hiding, whether they will suddenly appear and shoot at you. At this time, all effective tools need to be utilized."</p>
<p>"Through unmanned reconnaissance vehicles, to collect information about the indoor environment and the general location of enemies. Through breaching rams and breaching charges, to blow open doors, windows, and walls, providing a brand new attack route."</p>
<p>"Using ropes to infiltrate and rescue from second- and third-floor windows."</p>
<p>"True counter-terrorism isn't about marksmanship, but tactics, relying on information gathering and psychological warfare!"</p>
<p>"And this will be the content we need to showcase in the new game."</p>
<p>"As for the game's background, this aspect is not very important, but the setting can be made a bit grander."</p>
<p>"With the increasing number of terrorist attacks worldwide and the emergence of international terrorist attacks, for this, the World United Nations decided to select elite special forces personnel from various countries to jointly form a counter-terrorism special force named 'Rainbow' to combat the threat of terrorism to the world."</p>
<p>"Similar to the heroes in Warcraft, different operators in the game all possess their own unique abilities. Coupled with backgrounds of different nationalities, it just so happens to allow the game to sell better in various countries."</p>
