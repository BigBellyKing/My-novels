                <p>Chapter 12: Sales of Mirror (Game)</p>
<p>Compared to the conversation between Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin, Chen Xu at this time had been continuously monitoring the performance of <em>Mirror (Game)</em>.</p>
<p>In reality, many people had already taken notice of <em>Mirror (Game)</em>.</p>
<p>Even though it was launched on an overseas platform, and it was a rather unique game.</p>
<p>However, the sales were evident. While official platforms wouldn't disclose sales figures, game designers and industry media could generally estimate sales by analyzing various data points.</p>
<p>Although there might be some discrepancies, they wouldn't be too far-fetched.</p>
<p>Although <em>Mirror (Game)</em> didn't appear on any sales charts, it incredibly dominated the top spot on the positive reviews list.</p>
<p>An 18R game suddenly ascended to the number one position on the positive reviews list.</p>
<p>It must be said, this truly astonished many game designers.</p>
<p>Many also wanted to see just how magical this game was.</p>
<p>Especially in the game's comment section.</p>
<p>Many found that player comments were fundamentally different from those of traditional Gentleman's Games, to the point where they were a little hard to understand.</p>
<p>‘An exceptionally good Match-3 game!’</p>
<p>‘Women, get out! Don't hinder my Match-3 game!’</p>
<p>‘I can't tell if this is a Match-3 game or a galgame, but one thing is for sure, my little brother is very satisfied.’</p>
<p>‘Initially, I thought this was just an ordinary Gentleman's Game, but I have to say I'm shocked. This isn't some shoddy Gentleman's Game; it's a high-quality Independent Game!’</p>
<p>‘As a professional hater, the only point I can complain about is this: why the hell is a Gentleman's Game so touching and so refined?!’</p>
<p>‘Ten minutes have clearly passed, and I've entered sage mode, so this game should be closed. But why am I still playing it incessantly!? This Match-3 is quite interesting!’</p>
<p>‘In this game, I saw the good, evil, beauty, and ugliness of human nature. A truly unique game!’</p>
<p>‘When a Gentleman's Game moves me, does it matter whether I indulge or not?’</p>
<p>‘I opened this game with excitement and thrill, but when I left, I didn't feel relieved, but rather a sense of wistfulness.’</p>
<p>These comments left many bewildered. Had they opened the wrong game?</p>
<p>Of course, besides the many players who gave positive reviews, there were also some who, after pulling up their pants, spoke with great resolve.</p>
<p>Unlike the initial strategy of spending twenty thousand yuan to post advertorials on forums frequently visited by gentlemen on overseas websites.</p>
<p>Now, it relied solely on word-of-mouth among the gentlemen.</p>
<p>So, for Chen Xu, all he had to do was wait to collect the money.</p>
<p>“Hmm, the first round of funding is secured. Next, I'll first change my workspace, then register a company.”</p>
<p>“Also, I need to properly plan my future development path and accumulate more points along the way.”</p>
<p>Inside the rented apartment, Chen Xu leaned against the bed, laying out his next plan.</p>
<p>Regarding the points, Chen Xu had also noticed something.</p>
<p>Although there was an increase, it was still quite limited, just enough for two single draws.</p>
<p>As Chen Xu was thinking, the phone placed beside him rang. He picked it up and saw that the caller was Ruan Ningxue.</p>
<p>“Hello, Senior Sister Ruan, is there something you need?” Chen Xu answered.</p>
<p>“Nothing much, just wanted to congratulate you. I previously thought...” Ruan Ningxue on the other end of the line sounded a bit embarrassed.</p>
<p>Chen Xu probably knew what Ruan Ningxue wanted to say, so he smiled immediately: “It's alright, Senior Sister, that's normal. Honestly, I'm a bit surprised by <em>Mirror (Game)</em>'s sales myself.”</p>
<p>This statement was half-true, half-false. The false part was that the success of <em>Mirror (Game)</em> was entirely within Chen Xu's expectations.</p>
<p>Whether it was the quality of the game itself, the subsequent marketing plan, or even the decision to make <em>Mirror (Game)</em> the first game, all were planned by Chen Xu after prior investigation, not just decided on a whim.</p>
<p>As for the truth, the popularity of <em>Mirror (Game)</em> indeed exceeded Chen Xu's imagination a bit.</p>
<p>Although it was launched on an official overseas version platform, that was just a name. The primary target audience was still domestic players.</p>
<p>But even so, <em>Mirror (Game)</em>'s sales performance surprised Chen Xu.</p>
<p>At the same time, this reminded Chen Xu of another point: the prosperity of the gaming industry in this world was far greater than in his previous life.</p>
<p>“Oh, by the way, Chen Xu, do you have time tonight? Let's have a celebration dinner for you. Also, I have a friend who wants to meet you.” Ruan Ningxue asked from the other end of the line.</p>
<p>“No problem. Actually, I wanted to treat you to a meal too, Senior Sister. After all, if it weren't for your help, the development of <em>Mirror (Game)</em> wouldn't have been so smooth.” Chen Xu said sincerely.</p>
<p>Afterward, the two chatted casually for a bit more before hanging up the phone.</p>
<p>Putting his phone aside, Chen Xu went to the backend to check <em>Mirror (Game)</em>'s sales again.</p>
<p>Cumulative sales in 6 days: 58,121 copies.</p>
<p>Its growth curve was completely explosive; clearly, the gentlemen's combat power was extraordinary.</p>
<p>And judging by <em>Mirror (Game)</em>'s current potential, this was just the beginning.</p>
<p>Bear in mind, some third-party platforms had just started listing it.</p>
<p>While Chen Xu was basking in the pleasing data of <em>Mirror (Game)</em>.</p>
<p>The Independent Game community, however, was far from calm.</p>
<p>Media outlets that noticed the game also began compiling its relevant data.</p>
<p>After all, to climb to the top of the positive reviews list with an 18R theme was truly astounding.</p>
<p>Concurrently, topics related to <em>Mirror (Game)</em> quickly began to ferment.</p>
<p>For ordinary players, relevant sales data was difficult to track.</p>
<p>Initially, media and some industry professionals who paid attention might have estimated sales of ten to twenty thousand.</p>
<p>But with the release of data from third-party statistical agencies, those who followed the game felt a surge of disbelief.</p>
<p>Because the data provided by the third-party agencies was surprisingly 50,000.</p>
<p>Compared to the actual sales, it was actually eight thousand lower, but even so, this figure still stunned many designers.</p>
<p>Especially some designers who also created Gentleman's Games felt their worldview had been completely overturned.</p>
<p>A Gentleman's Game selling this many copies? What a joke!</p>
<p>Was this number high?</p>
<p>No, it wasn't. Top-tier blockbusters could achieve millions in sales on their launch day, and some globally renowned overseas blockbusters could even reach tens of millions in sales on day one.</p>
<p>Of course, these games couldn't be compared to <em>Mirror (Game)</em>.</p>
<p>As an 18R game without recommendations, and also an Independent Producer's game—no, it should be said, one made by a non-Game Designer.</p>
<p>This data was absolutely mind-blowing!</p>
<p>It had even broken records in the Gentleman's Game genre.</p>
<p>Not to say there'd be no one after, but at least there was no one before. Prior to this, no Gentleman's Game had achieved such explosive success as <em>Mirror (Game)</em>.</p>
<p>And this was just the beginning.</p>
<p>Many Gentleman's Game designers had a premonition that they were about to witness history!</p>
<p>Regardless of how significant this history was, and regardless of <em>Mirror (Game)</em> being a Gentleman's Game, it was history nonetheless.</p>
