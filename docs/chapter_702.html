                <h2>Chapter 701: Hesitation Is Defeat (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h2>
<p>It was still that same expanse of white reed field.</p>
<p>Isshin Ashina was dead, and Ashina was under full invasion.</p>
<p>Gyoubu Masataka Oniwa guarding the gate, the Chained Ogre blocking enemies with Regenerative Water, the Blazing Bull rampaging across the battlefield, and the Tengu along with the Lone Shadow — most had been dismantled by 'Wolf', now known as the Sword Saint.</p>
<p>In this final crisis, Genichiro would stop at nothing to protect Ashina.</p>
<p>The Iai Swordsman of the Ashina style beneath Ashina Castle, when the Interior Ministry launched its full invasion, had already transformed into a Red-Eyed Iai Swordsman using a Red Tassel upon Wolf's return.</p>
<p>But even after committing everything, there was still no way to resist the formidable enemy.</p>
<p>At this moment, Ashina Genichiro had only one path left: to harness the Power of the Dragon's Heritage.</p>
<p>By the time Wolf arrived, Young Lord Kuro was already gravely wounded.</p>
<p>'It has been a long time… Shinobi.'</p>
<p>'You see, another Mortal Blade.'</p>
<p>Genichiro, holding a Mortal Blade in his hand, spoke to Wolf.</p>
<p>This was his last reliance to save Ashina, to use the Mortal Blade to obtain Kuro's Dragon's Heritage.</p>
<p>Hearing Genichiro's words, Zhang Yi wasn't particularly surprised.</p>
<p>Because in the previous game's story, he had already received a lot of information.</p>
<p>There were two Mortal Blades in total. One was called 'Open Gate', the blade for the sacrificial ritual.</p>
<p>The other was called 'Bestowment', the blade for the ritual of taking the Divine Dragon's Tears.</p>
<p>According to Tomoe and Takeru's notes, it was known that Tomoe and Takeru had not obtained Bestowent back then; they had likely only acquired Open Gate.</p>
<p>As for the beautiful priestess seen when traveling to the Divine Dragon's former location, many players believed that person was Tomoe.</p>
<p>Because from the state of the Burial Mounds, Tomoe probably didn't die back then, and Emma's dialogue also confirmed this point.</p>
<p>Coupled with Isshin's earlier remark that Tomoe was a woman who fascinated him, many subconsciously assumed this.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Yi had a different view. Initially, he thought the same, but later, when he idly explored a bit more, he found a prompt appearing upon interaction, stating it was merely a 'sleeping miko'.</p>
<p>The two words 'sleeping' could mean either death or literal slumber, but Zhang Yi believed it should be the literal meaning.</p>
<p>Because he thought this miko was very likely the true empress of the Fountainhead Palace and the only person in the game to achieve eternal life.</p>
<p>And the price for achieving eternal life was to forever guard the Divine Dragon's mansion.</p>
<p>The prototype could refer to Empress Saimei (Kōgyoku) from the Asuka period, who once played the role of a miko praying to the heavens for rain, corresponding to the theocratic politics of witch-rule she practiced.</p>
<p>This also perfectly matched the point that there were no clues about a ruler in the Fountainhead Palace.</p>
<p>Of course, this was just a small guess of his, because beyond these, there were many other places in the game that left him feeling uncertain.</p>
<p>And this was the greatest characteristic of Souls-like games: a narrative and worldview with deliberate gaps, making players feel that every point is possible, without a completely accurate answer.</p>
<p>However, these were issues for Sekiro scholars to discuss, and Zhang Yi had absolutely no mind to delve into them now.</p>
<p>Because at this very moment, his gaze was entirely fixed on the formidable foe that was Ashina Genichiro.</p>
<p>Right from the start, it was Way of Tomoe Genichiro in his third phase.</p>
<p>Even though before, atop Ashina Castle, the third phase of Way of Tomoe Genichiro, using the 'Free Lightning,' was quite easy.</p>
<p>But it was also undeniable that the third phase of Way of Tomoe Genichiro's attack speed was indeed much faster.</p>
<p>Also, the low sweep attack no longer had the 'Perilous Attack' warning, and if one wasn't careful enough to notice it, they could suddenly die.</p>
<p>And in the white reed field, Zhang Yi discovered that Genichiro had also learned completely new moves.</p>
<p>Two consecutive slashes, creating a wave-like sword aura, instantly took away half his health if he didn't react quickly enough.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the rest of his techniques were largely no different from the Ashina Genichiro he encountered before at Ashina Castle.</p>
