                <p>Chapter 200: Life's Getting Better (Sixth update, please subscribe for monthly passes)</p>
<p>As the second day dawned, Wang Han used the materials she had to craft an axe and a pickaxe, then began searching for resources to make a campfire and torches.</p>
<p>She had more or less figured out some of the settings during that first night.</p>
<p>Having a campfire and torches at night meant safety.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was quite unsettling, with limited visibility and somewhat eerie background sounds.</p>
<p>Without torches, the glowing-eyed monsters she had seen the previous night could become deadly threats.</p>
<p>So, for safety, it was better for her to gather more materials for crafting torches.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the safest method was to quickly gather resources and arm herself.</p>
<p>A large patch of forest nearby had turned into black branches due to her setting it on fire.</p>
<p>Chopping them down with the axe would yield charcoal, a collectible material, though she wasn't sure what it was for.</p>
<p>Glancing at the materials in her backpack, Wang Han then realized she could now craft a Science Machine.</p>
<p>Returning to the spot where she had lit the campfire the previous night, Wang Han chose to build.</p>
<p>Then, a green, windmill-like machine was manually crafted by Wilson, the character in the game.</p>
<p>With the appearance of the Science Machine, Wang Han also discovered that new functions had been unlocked.</p>
<p>For example, crafting lists for magic, equipment, and items like wooden planks.</p>
<p>“So many resources needed!” Wang Han felt a bit overwhelmed by the dazzling array of items in the list.</p>
<p>Aside from the axe and pickaxe, she couldn't craft anything else at the moment.</p>
<p>Moreover, there were many materials she had never seen before, such as manure, spider silk, and so on.</p>
<p>“Never mind, I should find something to eat first.” Glancing at the supplies in her backpack, Wang Han decided to temporarily ignore the machine and at least gather enough provisions to survive the day and night.</p>
<p>Before, she had relied on berries to satisfy her hunger, but now she had very few left.</p>
<p>Although her hunger value was still more than half full, she had no berries left.</p>
<p>And more crucially, last night she had played a round of setting the forest ablaze.</p>
<p>She had directly set many of the surrounding trees and berry bushes on fire, and she hadn't even harvested the berries from many of the bushes beforehand, so now she had no berries to eat at all.</p>
<p>Opening the map for a look, Wang Han arbitrarily picked a direction and began exploring.</p>
<p>Along the way, she chopped trees, picked up stones, mined ore, and dug for carrots, quickly filling her inventory.</p>
<p>As evening approached, just as Wang Han was preparing to return to the Science Machine to see what she could make with her current materials, she suddenly heard the howl of a wild boar and a strange roar.</p>
<p>Driven by curiosity, Wang Han followed the sound and then witnessed a surprising sight.</p>
<p>A group of bipedal Pigmen were fiercely fighting a group of green Merms, shouting at the top of their lungs as they fought.</p>
<p>‘Argh! Argh!’</p>
<p>‘Pigmen are going on a rampage now!’</p>
<p>‘Wurtglug!’</p>
<p>‘Gulp! Glug-gargle-splat!’</p>
<p>‘Argh!’</p>
<p>She could understand what the Pigmen were saying.</p>
<p>But she couldn't understand anything the Merms were shouting.</p>
<p>The two factions seemed to be having a brawl, with about eight or nine of them wildly swinging their fists at each other.</p>
<p>Looking at their large bodies, and then at Wilson's small arms and legs, Wang Han decided it was better not to get involved.</p>
<p>However, just as she was about to leave, she suddenly noticed something with surprise.</p>
<p>As the two groups fought, the dying monsters were actually dropping meat chunks.</p>
<p>“Meat dropped! I can finally improve my diet!” Seeing the meat chunks ahead, Wang Han’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Up until then, her diet in the game had been mostly vegetarian.</p>
<p>Berries, carrots, and flower petals, and of course, some mushrooms.</p>
<p>It seemed that eating flower petals increased her health, while some mushrooms she ate inexplicably lowered her health.</p>
<p>In any case, her main food source was still berries.</p>
<p>As for meat, she had tried hunting rabbits during this time.</p>
<p>But those rabbits were simply too fast; she couldn't catch them at all.</p>
<p>Now, she had actually stumbled upon ready-made meat chunks.</p>
<p>While the two groups of monsters were fighting, Wang Han stealthily ran over and snatched a piece of meat from the ground.</p>
<p>However, she accidentally drew the aggro of a Merm, which scared her into quickly making a getaway.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this Merm was exceptionally foolish, completely unlike the previous monsters like bees.</p>
<p>It would actually pause before attacking, so as long as she ran without looking back, she didn't have to worry about getting hit.</p>
<p>Once the Merm's aggro disappeared, Wang Han stealthily returned. After the two factions finished fighting, she collected all the fish and meat that had dropped on the ground.</p>
<p>“This life, these small days, they're getting better every day! I even have meat to eat now!”</p>
<p>After clearing the battlefield, it was quickly nightfall. There was still some distance to get home, so Wang Han decided not to travel further and simply made a campfire on the spot, preparing to make do for the night.</p>
<p>This time, Wang Han didn't set the forest ablaze, as she realized these trees would eventually become her property.</p>
<p>If she burned them all now, she would have to run who-knows-how-far later just to chop wood.</p>
<p>At the same time, her Sanity would decrease if she moved too far from the campfire. Although she didn't know what bad things would happen if her Sanity dropped, Wang Han decided not to wander around for now.</p>
<p>Because obtaining Sanity, Wang Han found, was quite difficult. So far, she had only discovered that picking flowers increased Sanity, and only by a small amount.</p>
<p>It was nothing like Hunger, which could be easily satisfied by eating a bit of food.</p>
<p>After successfully surviving the second night, Wang Han returned to her base, looking at her inventory full of materials, and felt she had become quite rich.</p>
<p>“This game is actually quite interesting!”</p>
<p>Checking the required materials, Wang Han then crafted two more axes and pickaxes, continuing her new journey as a lumberjack and miner, while also exploring new areas of the map.</p>
<p>As she explored further, Wang Han discovered some more interesting spots.</p>
<p>Specifically, in some areas of the map, there would be something called a Wormhole.</p>
<p>When players approached a Wormhole and jumped in, they could travel to another area of the map.</p>
<p>After jumping down the Wormhole, she also saw a creature called a Tallbird. However, other than its tall legs, Wang Han couldn't see anything bird-like about its large, beady eyes.</p>
<p>The big white egg next to it, however, caught her attention; it looked very appetizing.</p>
<p>As Wang Han continued her exploration in the game, time quickly reached the seventh day.</p>
<p>During this period, Wang Han also discovered many small tricks. For example, she found that food in the game could actually be cooked.</p>
<p>All she had to do was drag it from her backpack into the campfire.</p>
<p>This discovery left her somewhat amazed.</p>
<p>She had never imagined such a mechanic existed before.</p>
<p>“Okay, I'll gather a few more resources, craft a Grass Suit and a Spear, and then I can explore the outside world,” Wang Han summarized, glancing at her current resources.</p>
<p>Although she had spent seven days in the game and was now on the eighth.</p>
<p>In reality, she had been a bit lax during this time and hadn't collected many materials.</p>
<p>Sometimes she would just wander around outside for an entire day.</p>
<p>Now, she felt she had more or less grasped the general gameplay, and it was time to embark on new adventures.</p>
