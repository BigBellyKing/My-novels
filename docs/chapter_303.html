                <p>Chapter 302: Some Content Changes (7th update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)</p>
<p>From a game mechanism perspective, the modes in Rainbow Six Siege are actually quite simple.</p>
<p>They are mainly divided into attackers and defenders.</p>
<p>Among these, there are three different modes.</p>
<p>Hostage Mode, Bomb Mode, and Secure Area Mode.</p>
<p>Hostage Mode and Bomb Mode are generally present in previous FPS games, with the main differences being some mechanism changes.</p>
<p>As for Secure Area Mode, it's essentially a point-capture mode, where victory is determined when players from one side occupy an area.</p>
<p>Besides these, there's also a rather special mode, which is Terrorist Hunt Mode.</p>
<p>This is mainly for new players to use for training, allowing them to solo or team up against AI terrorist personnel of different difficulty levels.</p>
<p>Of course, this mode was later renamed Training Grounds, and the suicide bombers inside also disappeared.</p>
<p>For this mode, Chen Xu decided to retain the earlier Terrorist Hunt Mode, and through the performance of AI technology, players can experience a more realistic counter-terrorism feel when facing the White Masks in PVE.</p>
<p>The rest concerns the recreation of maps; for Rainbow Six Siege, maps can be said to be the most crucial core.</p>
<p>In his previous life, many players would say '500 hours to get started,' which made many rookies tremble, but it was actually a somewhat exaggerated statement.</p>
<p>Because in Rainbow Six Siege, unlike other FPS games, the requirement for marksmanship is not as high as in other FPS titles.</p>
<p>More importantly, it's about familiarity with Operator skill mechanisms, gadget usage, and the maps themselves.</p>
<p>If one isn't familiar with the maps, a common situation will arise.</p>
<p>Who am I?</p>
<p>Where am I?</p>
<p>Who's shooting me?</p>
<p>And who killed me?</p>
<p>How did someone get behind me?</p>
<p>It would literally turn Rainbow Six Siege into a horror game.</p>
<p>This is precisely what happens due to unfamiliarity with the maps.</p>
<p>Because in Rainbow Six Siege, walls, wooden panels, and other elements are destructible, and once destroyed, a new attack route emerges.</p>
<p>Attackers can use their gadgets to forcibly destroy obstacles, launching unexpected attacks from surprising locations to catch opponents off guard.</p>
<p>Similarly, defenders can also utilize this feature to open up passages first, expanding their line of sight, or hide in a small room and fortify it—though this is strongly not recommended unless on specific maps.</p>
<p>Additionally, attackers possess two unmanned reconnaissance vehicles that can enter rooms through gaps beneath wooden panels and ventilation ducts to observe the situation and gather intelligence.</p>
<p>Defenders, on the other hand, can access the cameras within the building to observe information about various areas.</p>
<p>It can be said that from the very beginning of the game, both sides will be engaged in a phase of information gathering and psychological warfare.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of action, because it's a VR game, Chen Xu also considered making it more realistic.</p>
<p>Of course, there will be two versions: one for players and a military version.</p>
<p>However, the two versions will have some differences.</p>
<p>The military version, for instance, will feature more detailed operational content.</p>
<p>For example, allowing hostages in Hostage Mode to move.</p>
<p>After all, in a real counter-terrorism operation, hostages would clearly not be squatting on the ground, hands over their heads, completely motionless.</p>
<p>Secondly, there's the ability to step over Kapkan traps, a more realistic operation, including more destructible environments and interactive items.</p>
<p>And also, character jumping in the game.</p>
<p>In his previous life, some players also raised questions about this, and the official answer was that it was for realism; after all, how could counter-terrorism personnel jump while carrying dozens of pounds of equipment?</p>
<p>This answer seemed quite reasonable, but in reality, it was simply to reduce workload and bugs.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu planned to add jumping to the military version.</p>
<p>Because compared to the standard edition, the military version could prioritize realism more than balance.</p>
<p>After all, wasn't the direction given by the Game Department for training purposes?</p>
<p>And honestly, jumping doesn't hold much significance in Rainbow Six Siege.</p>
<p>The imagined scenario of Fuze jumping up and deploying his cluster charge against the ceiling with a 'thump-thump-thump' is completely non-existent.</p>
<p>After all, carrying such heavy equipment, even if one could jump, it wouldn't be very high; at most, it would be a simple small hop.</p>
<p>Besides this, the version provided to players also features many detailed content changes.</p>
<p>For example, rope climbing; camera angle switching in VR is also a crucial core point, otherwise, Rainbow Six might very well turn into Vertigo Six.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>Chen Xu was gradually refining the design concept document for Rainbow Six Siege.</p>
<p>He was relatively low-key, but NetDragon, which had already confirmed its cooperation with Nebula Games, became very high-profile after their discussions.</p>
<p>They specifically held a news conference to announce the latest news about their collaboration with Nebula Games to develop a VR blockbuster.</p>
<p>【The new game will be jointly developed by Nebula Games and NetDragon! The codename is temporarily set as 'R6'】</p>
<p>【This will be a game utilizing the latest VR technology, bringing an unprecedented new experience to all players】</p>
<p>【Nebula Games Platform and NetDragon Platform will engage in deep strategic cooperation】</p>
<p>Instantly, news was flying everywhere.</p>
<p>There was official news revealed by NetDragon, various unofficial news, and wild guesses from players.</p>
<p>As for Chen Xu, he was much more low-key, only posting an official Weibo update confirming that the game codenamed 'R6' was indeed real.</p>
<p>In an instant, the gaming industry experienced a major upheaval, and countless industry designers and developers were bewildered.</p>
<p>NetDragon is cooperating with Nebula Games!?</p>
<p>Didn't NetDragon seem to be making overtures to the Channel Alliance before?</p>
<p>How did they suddenly turn around and get involved with Nebula Games?</p>
<p>Even the Channel Alliance was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Originally, NetDragon's attitude was rather ambiguous, not like TengHua's, but they thought NetDragon was one of their own, and with a little effort, they could make connections.</p>
<p>But then, in a flash, they ran off to the competitor's side?</p>
<p>And it even seemed like they initiated the move themselves?</p>
<p>However, compared to the news of NetDragon and Nebula Games entering a strategic partnership that deeply impacted the industry.</p>
<p>Ordinary players, on the other hand, clearly didn't care about any of that; what they truly cared about was that NetDragon and Nebula Games were actually jointly developing a VR blockbuster!?</p>
<p>As soon as this news was announced, players of both NetDragon and Nebula Games instantly erupted in excitement.</p>
<p>After all, even though NetDragon hasn't been doing so well in recent years, it's still a giant in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>And Nebula Games, needless to say, all of its games so far have been quality titles.</p>
<p>The immense popularity of the recently released Warcraft hasn't even faded yet!</p>
<p>The remaining question was what type and theme this game, codenamed R6, would actually be.</p>
