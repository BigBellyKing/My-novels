                <p>Chapter 653: Onyxia, the Black Dragon Princess (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Listening to Marshal Reginald Windsor's words, the players gathered in Stormwind waited quietly for the subsequent developments.</p>
<p>Most Alliance players who had come to Stormwind had seen the Countess before. With her shapely figure and exceptional beauty, many players speculated that she would be a rather important character later on. Now, it was confirmed: she was indeed a very important character, but a traitor.</p>
<p>As Marshal Reginald Windsor prepared to enter Stormwind Keep, the Countess loudly commanded the soldiers to stop him.</p>
<p>“Seize him, seize this vile criminal and his accomplices!”</p>
<p>General Marcus Jonathan, the supreme commander of the Stormwind Defense Force, appeared with his guards. “Marshal Windsor, you know I cannot let you pass!”</p>
<p>But Windsor continued to press forward without hesitation.</p>
<p>“You must do what you believe is right, Marcus! We served together under General Turalyon; he made us who we are today. Was he wrong about me? Do you truly believe my intention is to destroy our Alliance? Have I brought shame upon our heroes?”</p>
<p>“Imprisoning me here is not a wise decision, Marcus.”</p>
<p>Listening to Marshal Windsor's words, Marcus Jonathan was convinced.</p>
<p>“I am ashamed, old friend. I do not know what I should do. It is not you who shames the legendary heroes… it is I. It is I and the other fallen nobles who have filled our lives with hollow promises… endless lies. We shame our ancestors, we shame our fallen comrades… Forgive me…”</p>
<p>Marcus looked at the surrounding soldiers and dismissed them.</p>
<p>“Stand down, and let them pass safely! Go, Reginald, may the Holy Light guide you.”</p>
<p>As Marcus and the surrounding soldiers made way, Marshal Windsor proceeded towards Stormwind's Grand Hall. The nearby soldiers saluted, giving him honorable treatment.</p>
<p>“You are an inspiration to us all, Your Excellency!”</p>
<p>“You are a living legend…”</p>
<p>“May the Light be with you, Your Excellency!”</p>
<p>Listening to the various admiring praises from the NPC soldiers, Song Ren felt a bit stunned.</p>
<p>This background seems a bit too grand, doesn't it?</p>
<p>Upon arriving in the hall, before the Countess, Marshal Windsor shouted, “You cannot escape your fate, Onyxia. Prophecy has long foretold all of this—the visions that surfaced in the halls of Karazhan have already revealed your end. Now, let us conclude this!”</p>
<p>The Countess, too, burst out laughing. “Conclusion? Hahahahaha… You will be imprisoned and tried, and I will be delighted to see them declare you guilty and send you to the gallows!”</p>
<p>“As your limp corpse sways on the gallows, I will rejoice that a madman's life has finally ended.”</p>
<p>“After all, what proof do you have? Are you going to provoke a noble here and walk away unharmed?”</p>
<p>Facing the Countess's arrogant words, Marshal Windsor showed no panic. “The Dark Iron Dwarves believed these tablets were encrypted, but it's not a cipher—it's merely ancient Dragonkin… Now, let the truth be revealed!”</p>
<p>As Windsor chanted the final spell, the Countess let out a cry of pain and transformed into a gigantic dragon.</p>
<p>“Dragonkin soldiers, tear them apart! Quickly!”</p>
<p>Onyxia, brought back to her true form by the spell, finally dropped her disguise. With her command, her surrounding guards transformed into elite Dragonkin guards.</p>
<p>Onyxia glared furiously at Windsor. “I wonder… Windsor, did you survive that vision? I ask because I will ensure you die today, right now!”</p>
<p>Years of infiltration had corrupted most of Stormwind's nobles and upper echelons, but now, because of Windsor's appearance, all her efforts were in vain.</p>
<p>The immensely enraged Black Dragon Princess's claws tore through Marshal Reginald Windsor's body, and then she flapped her wings, rapidly departing Stormwind.</p>
<p>Thousands of players gasped in astonishment. The oppressive aura emanating from the colossal dragon was simply too overwhelming; many players, let alone such a massive dragon, had never even seen an ordinary Dragonkin creature.</p>
<p>Duke Bolvar cried out for guards, trying to save the severely wounded Marshal Windsor.</p>
<p>Other players who had entered also rushed to help. This part was not difficult; the Duke and his guards could handle these elite Dragonkin guards. However, a few unlucky players, acting heroically, were slapped to death by the high-level Dragonkin elites, dying in vain.</p>
<p>After all the Dragonkin guards were eliminated, the Duke embraced the Marshal, sobbing uncontrollably. “Marshal Windsor… you will forever be Stormwind's Marshal Reginald Windsor…”</p>
<p>The Marshal's dying words were still concerned with Stormwind's safety.</p>
<p>“Duke… use it… the medal… you can find…”</p>
<p>But before he could finish, Marshal Windsor closed his eyes forever.</p>
<p>All the players who had witnessed the entire event in Stormwind exclaimed in awe.</p>
<p>“Holy crap, this quest is amazing! How was it even triggered? Is there a follow-up?”</p>
<p>“Definitely! The Marshal mentioned a medal at the end, didn't he? And we definitely need to get revenge on that Black Dragon Princess!”</p>
<p>“The question is, can we still trigger this quest?”</p>
<p>“Check online! The team that triggered this quest has released a guide! And it's not just the Alliance; the Horde has it too! Though it seems quite tedious.”</p>
<p>Listening to the surrounding players' discussions, Song Ren and Zhang Yi quickly exited their VR gaming pods and opened their browsers to search.</p>
<p>“Old Zhang, how about we do this quest first?” Song Ren asked Zhang Yi in the party.</p>
<p>“Same here, I'm pretty curious about the Marshal's story,” Zhang Yi nodded.</p>
<p>After all, they had only participated in this one event in Stormwind and knew nothing about what had happened before.</p>
<p>Many players, like Song Ren, shared this sentiment. Both Horde and Alliance players were extremely curious. Although the processes differed, the ultimate character involved was the same: the Black Dragon Princess.</p>
<p>This was clearly a major main storyline!</p>
<p>However, once players actually got started, they collectively vomited blood.</p>
<p>It was simply too tedious, running all over the map.</p>
<p>But all the players who completed the quest and learned about the Marshal's deeds were filled with immense emotion. According to the clues, the Marshal clearly knew that his journey was a one-way trip, but for Stormwind and the Alliance, he unhesitatingly exposed the Black Dragon Princess's conspiracy before everyone.</p>
<p>As for the Horde side, countless players had already protested. Why could Alliance players watch a grand movie in Stormwind while they had to run around looking for Rexxar?</p>
<p>Many Alliance players initially found the quest very cumbersome, but after hearing about the Horde players' experiences, they all chuckled. Not to mention the constant running, they had to fight through Lower Blackrock Spire, then Upper Blackrock Spire, Desolace, Plaguelands, then circle back to Upper Blackrock Spire, and then Western Plaguelands, Winterspring, Gadgetzan, Stonard, Dustwallow Marsh, and Desolace again, before returning to Upper Blackrock Spire.</p>
<p>This series of traversing the map left many Horde players completely bewildered. Furthermore, the quest required killing Dragonkin and looting their eyeballs, which was incredibly unfriendly to unlucky players.</p>
<p>Many Horde players broke down while doing the quest.</p>
<p>Of course, regardless of whether they were Alliance or Horde, players who accepted this quest got a perfect taste of the 'splendor' of the Blackrock Depths map.</p>
