                <p>Chapter 321: Ten Years Making Games, Nine Years Making CG (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>The development progress of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was very smooth. Although this was the team's second large-scale VR game, they had previous experience with Rainbow Six Siege, and NetDragon provided considerable technical assistance due to their strategic partnership. Consequently, they encountered no particularly difficult issues.</p>
<p>What remained was the art resources. Currently, Nebula Games had only developed Rainbow Six Siege, so the accumulated resources were not extensive. Moreover, in terms of actual gameplay experience, the two games were completely different. All action systems, including shooting modes, were entirely incompatible. After all, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare needed to deliver an explosive, swift, and exciting fast-paced experience to players. For the vast amount of art resources, apart from core designs, the rest could be fully outsourced to external vendors. In game development, outsourcing content, especially art assets, is a common practice, as it can save the team a lot of time.</p>
<p>While Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was quietly in development, NetDragon was also making significant moves. First, the PC version of Rainbow Six Siege was announced, and related esports events would also be held. Chen Xu didn't pay much attention to this aspect. After all, NetDragon had considerable experience in organizing competitions, with many competitive games under its belt. Furthermore, Nebula Games was largely responsible for the subsequent content operations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, information about Atrai's 'Storm Action' was continuously being disseminated domestically through the channel alliance. After all, this was also a popular IP and a flagship title for Zeus. It was clear that Atrai had a meticulous plan. Concurrently with the announcement of the 'Storm Action' game, the film's previous producers also released news about a sequel to 'Storm Action'. This was clearly an attempt to create a strong alliance and generate hype. The domestic channel alliance also held high hopes for this major title. After all, Nebula Games Platform's market share was continuously expanding, and more and more third-party game developers were choosing to launch their games first on the Nebula Games Platform. Although the channel alliance had successively lowered its revenue share, it was ultimately futile. With games like Warcraft, Minecraft, and Rainbow Six Siege continuously solidifying Nebula Games' player base, it could be said that they were slowly encroaching upon them. Therefore, the channel alliance also placed great expectations on 'Storm Action', this blockbuster.</p>
<p>In addition to offline exhibitions and press conferences, more and more news about 'Storm Action' was revealed. First, the actors playing the male and female leads would participate in the game's motion capture to ensure the authenticity of the characters. Following that, some related game content and materials were shown, along with scenes and easter eggs from the movie. This excited many fan players. After all, several years had passed, and many players who had seen 'Storm Action' still felt nostalgic for it. Now, the news of a new movie, coupled with the game adaptation news and those familiar scenes, immediately resonated with them.</p>
<p>"The fidelity is so high! And it feels like the graphics are even better than in the movie!"</p>
<p>"Indeed, I just don't know what stage the timeline and plot are in."</p>
<p>"I'm more concerned about the gameplay!"</p>
<p>"There's no doubt about that, Atrai certainly has the strength!"</p>
<p>"I wonder if they can recreate the big scenes from the original movie, especially the part where the protagonist escapes the building and the entire building is blown up – that was truly spectacular."</p>
<p>"I think there should be even bigger scenes, right?"</p>
<p>Players expressed great anticipation for the content news conveyed by 'Storm Action'. After all, for this kind of adapted IP game, the first impression given to players would definitely be about the quality of the graphics and the game's fidelity to the original work. Atrai was clearly aware of this; otherwise, there would have been no need to spend so much money on purchasing the copyright. All the information released externally revolved around this point, instantly giving these fan players a shot in the arm. The gameplay might still be unclear, but in terms of graphics and fidelity, it was already maxed out. It could be said that this was a very conventional IP warm-up.</p>
<p>However, just as Atrai and the domestic channel alliance were continuously promoting and warming up 'Storm Action', Chen Xu's official Weibo account also updated with a long-awaited post. The accompanying image showed a wasteland. Heavy machine guns, shoulder-fired rocket launchers... various weapons were displayed. There were also group photos of some staff members. The accompanying text was just a simple sentence: "'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare,' a game that defines the modern warfare genre, will be available on the Cosmic VR Platform!"</p>
<p>With the release of this official Weibo post, all players instantly erupted. Because this official Weibo post was a clear indication! Mr. Chen had been silent for a while, and now he was making a new game again! And it was a modern warfare-themed game. Moreover, looking at the accompanying images, Mr. Chen's scale of work this time was unprecedentedly grand! Heavy machine guns, shoulder-fired rocket launchers, and so on – would the game actually feature these real-world weapons? All players immediately became restless.</p>
<p>"Though I am uncultured, a single 'Holy cow!' suffices for all occasions!"</p>
<p>"As expected, Mr. Chen, the Quick Shooter, won't be content with idleness; he's about to stir up something big!"</p>
<p>"The surprise came too fast, catching me off guard!"</p>
<p>"So, this is a direct confrontation with Atrai!"</p>
<p>"A game that defines modern warfare, Mr. Chen's tone is so arrogant! But I like it!"</p>
<p>"Looking at this, it's almost finished developing!?"</p>
<p>Countless players were extremely excited and thrilled. Although they didn't know what the game looked like, only a theme and a name had been announced so far. But over the years, Nebula Games had accumulated enough popularity and reputation to make them anticipate it.</p>
<p>While countless players cheered online, Nebula Games was discussing with Qin Yi how to better showcase the action and VR pod force feedback system in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare when Yang Chen from the Game Department called. "Mr. Chen? How is the development progress of your Call of Duty: Modern Warfare? You must ensure the quality of the game, and don't worry about time constraints. Zeus's progress overseas is similar to ours, perhaps even slower, so the development of 'Storm Action,' which is escorting Zeus, isn't as fast as imagined." Yang Chen was quite nervous. Although Nebula Games wasn't the only developer making escort games for Cosmic VR, the initial impression given to players was quite important. Therefore, Yang Chen was worried that Chen Xu might rush the progress, trying to preempt Atrai and seize popularity, thereby affecting the game's content.</p>
<p>Hearing Yang Chen's words, Chen Xu smiled knowingly: "Don't worry, Minister Yang, I wouldn't joke with Nebula Games' reputation. The development of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is very smooth, and the quality is absolutely guaranteed. As for racing for speed? We haven't considered it at all."</p>
<p>After a few words with Yang Chen and a brief chat, Chen Xu put down the phone and smiled. Chen Xu naturally wouldn't neglect game content just to rush progress. After all, it comes back to that old saying: no one remembers a garbage game released on time. Whether released on time or delayed, as long as it delivers satisfactory quality to players, there's nothing to worry about. Otherwise, whether you release on time, delay, or even release early with a reverse delay, players will roast you so hard your own mother wouldn't recognize you. As for now? We can only say, "it's being made, it's being made."</p>
<p>For Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, although the game's overall progress was only about one-sixth complete, while the game was still a long way from being finished, the progress in CG was like a calf riding a rocket. After all, in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Chen Xu chose to use CG to cover most loading transitions to ensure sufficiently excellent visual effects. And adding to the various Operator CGs from Rainbow Six Siege and the CGs from Warcraft, Chen Xu could only say that Nebula Games was absolutely professional in this area!</p>
<p>Ten years making games, nine years making CG. This was the online evaluation of Nebula Games previously, and Chen Xu stated that it definitely had to be implemented. Otherwise, how disappointed would players be? After all, Chen Xu was a game developer who never lied and never disappointed players.</p>
