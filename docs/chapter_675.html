                <p>Chapter 674: Cerebellum Overloaded (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Song Ren felt a little strange in the game.</p>
<p>After all, as a player who had just experienced BioShock Infinite, he was still very concerned about Elizabeth's whereabouts.</p>
<p>But now, he was controlling a character named Jack?</p>
<p>And judging from the surrounding Rapture scenes, they seemed a little different from the previous preview.</p>
<p>The Rapture before Song Ren gave him a very gloomy feeling. It was completely unlike the content of the preview video he had seen before.</p>
<p>Rapture, a deep-sea metropolis, was empty, filled with ruins everywhere. And mutated maniacs kept jumping out to attack people.</p>
<p>Temporarily putting aside his obsession with Elizabeth, Song Ren cautiously moved forward, exploring. Guided by an unfamiliar man named Atlas via radio, Song Ren began to explore Rapture.</p>
<p>"This guy is quite polite, using honorifics throughout the conversation."</p>
<p>Song Ren explored Rapture, feeling a little emotional at the same time. This was probably the most respectful NPC he had encountered since he started playing games. Despite giving directions, every sentence included an honorific like, "Would it trouble you?", which made Song Ren a little uncomfortable. They were all on the same side; why be so polite?</p>
<p>As Song Ren explored Rapture, he felt an increasingly strong contrast. The architecture of Rapture, a deep-sea metropolis, was exquisitely beautiful, yet it was dilapidated and riddled with leaks everywhere. The dreamy neon signs on the streets formed a stark contrast with the corpses and bloodstains nearby.</p>
<p>The lazy singing from the jukebox in the bar was beautiful, while the clown sound effects from the vending machines were extremely eerie, startling Song Ren the first time he heard them. These combined elements made Song Ren feel that Rapture was like a dream that was both beautiful and ugly, both mad and real.</p>
<p>Of course, what interested Song Ren more was the combat style in the game. Similar to the superhuman powers in BioShock Infinite, the superpowers in Rapture were called Adam Plasmids. And just like the powers in Columbia, Adam Plasmids formed from Adam were openly sold. Fire, lightning – players could unleash different elemental powers through various Plasmids.</p>
<p>What truly amazed Song Ren was that, just like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the game allowed players to interact with the environment using different elemental powers. For example, if the ground was covered in water, and the player used an electric attack, the monsters in the water would be electrocuted. Ice-covered paths could be melted with fire.</p>
<p>Of course, what Song Ren focused on most was the story of Rapture. In Rapture, besides him, there were many fanatics addicted to Adam, as well as Little Sisters who collected Adam, and Big Daddies who protected the Little Sisters. The Big Daddy was a huge monster wearing a metal diving suit and wielding a drill. The relationship between the two was just like Elizabeth and the Songbird.</p>
<p>But the difference was that the Big Daddy was just a bodyguard, and the Little Sisters seemed to be able to move freely. After playing for a while, Song Ren's heart was filled with curiosity and confusion. When would he see Elizabeth, and what had happened to Rapture? All these questions lingered in his mind.</p>
<p>However, Song Ren didn't have to wait long; he finally met Elizabeth. Chen Xu used a dual-narrative approach in the game, which was slightly different from the previous life. After all, BioShock 1 and the Burial at Sea DLC in the previous life could be considered independently related. Here, Chen Xu cut some time-wasting level processes.</p>
<p>Of course, he also added some transitional shots to make the character switching more fluid. After all, Elizabeth's storyline and Jack's storyline were parallel, much like Geralt of Rivia and Ciri in The Witcher: Wild Hunt. The main storyline was from Jack's perspective, which was the visible thread.</p>
<p>The hidden thread was from Elizabeth's perspective. In the previous life's BioShock, there were indeed two threads, but due to the scale and budget of the production, the hidden thread was mostly presented as data files. So here, Chen Xu combined some of the hidden content with Elizabeth's Burial at Sea storyline, such as Rapture's rise and fall, and the backstory of characters like Dr. Yi, all described through Elizabeth's thread.</p>
<p>Elizabeth and the surviving Booker belonged to the past. The Rapture where Jack was situated was the future.</p>
<p>Through Elizabeth's perspective, Song Ren finally saw the once prosperous Rapture, at its peak. Unlike the later time point where Jack was, Rapture at this time had not yet experienced civil strife and war. Its prosperity was in no way inferior to Columbia, the Sky City. And unlike Columbia's strong religious atmosphere, Rapture was full of artistic flair.</p>
<p>Performance posters, sculptures, and movies were ubiquitous throughout Rapture's streets and alleys. At this point in time, Song Ren could also watch Elizabeth embarking on adventures with Booker. At the same time, based on clues and collectibles, he could deduce the connection between Rapture and Columbia.</p>
<p>The Big Daddy and Little Sister concept originated from the bond between Elizabeth and the Songbird in Columbia. Similarly, Columbia's magic came from Rapture's Adam. As the game progressed, more and more truths were gradually revealed, and he was completely stunned.</p>
<p>Compared to BioShock Infinite, this concluding work named Rapture was even bolder in its storyline. Why was Elizabeth still alive? What was the origin of Rapture's Booker? As Booker was attacked by a Big Daddy along the way, under Elizabeth's guidance, he finally recalled everything.</p>
<p>It turned out that Booker in this timeline first became Comstock, choosing to be baptized after Wounded Knee. What happened after that was the same as Comstock in BioShock Infinite. By funding Lutece, he built Columbia, the Sky City, and then created a machine that could open parallel worlds. Using everything he saw in parallel worlds, he became a prophet, becoming Comstock.</p>
<p>He then lost his fertility, so he searched for his daughter, Elizabeth, through parallel worlds. But a variable appeared: Elizabeth's existence was constant, but Elizabeth's life or death became a variable. Because in this Booker's timeline, Elizabeth's finger was not cut off, but her head.</p>
<p>Killing his own daughter with his own hands, even if this daughter was his daughter from a parallel world. This made Booker suddenly realize, but he chose not to face it, but to escape reality once again, just like the Battle of Wounded Knee. He asked the Lutece siblings to transport him to a place in another world that no one knew. This place was Rapture, and it was precisely because Comstock was transported that Rapture and Columbia became connected.</p>
<p>Here, Booker also adopted a foster daughter named Sally, who was the Little Sister. Elizabeth helped Booker search for the so-called foster daughter Sally all along, just to make him remember his sins. The game had progressed to this point.</p>
<p>Song Ren was dumbfounded. Elizabeth sought out Booker just to guide him to restore his memory and then kill him! If this part surprised Song Ren, the later part left him bewildered.</p>
<p>"Booker died again!? What the heck is going on? Is Elizabeth related to Jack? And Elizabeth and Jack's timelines are only a few short years apart!"</p>
<p>Watching the sudden appearance of the Big Daddy not only kill Booker but also Elizabeth, Song Ren felt his head spin, his cerebellum overloaded—that's how he felt now. And what made him even stranger was Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Although she also died under the Big Daddy's drill, unlike Booker, due to Elizabeth's unique abilities, at the moment before her death, Elizabeth, like Lutece, became quantum entangled. She existed in any timeline but did not truly exist.</p>
<p>And there was still a slight difference from the Lutece siblings: Elizabeth could only observe the development of fate, but could not interfere with it. From a physiological standpoint, Elizabeth was already in a state of eternal life. But what Song Ren did not expect was that Elizabeth, after seeing the future, chose to give up her observer form and voluntarily became a mortal.</p>
<p>At the same time, this also caused Elizabeth to lose some memories, and her subconscious transformed into Booker's thoughts, accompanying Elizabeth on her adventure. Furthermore, Elizabeth made a deal with a leader of the rebel army to save the Little Sister Sally. Why did Elizabeth do this? What future did she see?</p>
