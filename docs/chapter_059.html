                <p>Chapter 59: <em>Outlast</em>'s Sales</p>
<p>On live streaming platforms, video platforms, and major player communities, the popularity of <em>Outlast</em> continued to soar.</p>
<p>Even some media websites progressively released score reviews for <em>Outlast</em>.</p>
<p>From the media's perspective, they uniformly gave scores around 8.5, while players' comprehensive score for this title was around 9.1.</p>
<p>This was considered the lowest score among the three games currently developed by Nebula Games.</p>
<p>Of course, <em>Mirror (Game)</em> was not included in this.</p>
<p>However, in terms of popularity, <em>Outlast</em> was completely different from the other two games.</p>
<p><em>Undertale</em> had the credit for opening up the META game genre, barely qualifying as a pioneering ancestor.</p>
<p>Such immense popularity was understandable.</p>
<p><em>To the Moon</em>, on the other hand, gained significant attention due to the Sci-Fi Game Design Competition.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Chen Xu's online literary disputes regarding those previous two games also attracted a lot of eyeballs.</p>
<p>Comparatively, setting aside these factors, <em>Outlast</em> actually had higher topic popularity, and it was also the fastest-growing game among the few titles.</p>
<p>Of course, <em>Mirror (Game)</em> was still excluded, as the fighting power of gentlemen is always unknown.</p>
<p>But compared to the popularity of <em>Outlast</em>.</p>
<p>Regarding sales, however, it only sparked discussion among many game industry designers.</p>
<p>Only Chen Xu knew the true sales of <em>Outlast</em>, but there were also third-party agencies collecting statistics.</p>
<p>According to data released by third-party agencies, <em>Outlast</em>, which had been online for a week, had sales of around 250,000.</p>
<p>Simply looking at the sales figure, it could be said that it was already quite high.</p>
<p>Before <em>Outlast</em>, the horror game with the highest weekly sales was an old IP, selling 120,000 units weekly.</p>
<p>Of course, that game was priced at a high 149 Yuan.</p>
<p>It also had the support of series fans and nostalgia.</p>
<p>But the key was that <em>Outlast</em>'s popularity was too high; it was considered the most sensational horror game in recent years.</p>
<p>Yet, it achieved such a sales figure.</p>
<p>This also led to widespread discussion among industry designers.</p>
<p>'Chen Xu really messed up this time, what a pity! <em>Outlast</em>'s popularity is so high, but its sales are surprisingly low.'</p>
<p>'Yeah, it can't compare to <em>Undertale</em> and <em>To the Moon</em> from back then.'</p>
<p>'No choice, the horror game market is too small.'</p>
<p>'I really can't figure out why Chen Xu chose to make <em>Outlast</em>.'</p>
<p>'Yeah, I can't figure it out, why Chen Xu chose to enter the horror game genre.'</p>
<p>'Exactly, making horror games is thankless work. I thought Chen Xu would continue making games like <em>To the Moon</em> and <em>Undertale</em>.'</p>
<p>'He probably wanted to challenge a high-budget game, but the competition in traditional fields like RPGs is too fierce, so he had no choice but to opt for the horror game genre, right?'</p>
<p>In a certain industry game forum, a group of designers posted and discussed, with Chen Xu and <em>Outlast</em> as their topic.</p>
<p>Just as they were discussing vigorously, a piece of information instantly left them choked.</p>
<p>'Weekly sales of 250,000, and priced at 65 Yuan, <em>Outlast</em>'s development costs have already been fully recovered! And based on its current popularity and player reviews, achieving a million sales for <em>Outlast</em> shouldn't be difficult, right? If so, this game's gross revenue for Nebula Games might even exceed 100 million Yuan!'</p>
<p>The designers who were still discussing the topic immediately fell silent.</p>
<p>Where did this person come from?</p>
<p>Do they have any situational awareness?</p>
<p>As game designers, could they not know that <em>Outlast</em> was a very successful horror game?</p>
<p>They simply wanted to brag a bit and imply that Chen Xu and Nebula Games were just mediocre.</p>
<p>Who is this!?</p>
<p>So lacking in situational awareness?</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>In the Nebula Games office, Chen Xu leaned back on the sofa, put down his phone, and looked at the UI interface in front of him with a regretful expression.</p>
<p>The effect of the special item obtained earlier was confirmed; the 6 million points marked on it referred to the converted number, not the original number.</p>
<p>Of course, even so, 6 million points, enough for fifty-pulls, was still a fruitful gain.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, once the points converted from the cards reached their limit, the accumulation speed immediately slowed down.</p>
<p>It was even a bit less effective than <em>To the Moon</em>.</p>
<p>After providing the converted 6 million, he hadn't even gathered enough for a single ten-pull yet, despite the continuous contributions from the previous <em>To the Moon</em> and <em>Undertale</em>.</p>
<p>And this was why Chen Xu only managed sixty-pulls.</p>
<p>Underperforming!</p>
<p>For this, Chen Xu also reflected and summarized.</p>
<p>He finally came to a conclusion.</p>
<p>He was harvesting leeks too vigorously.</p>
<p>Although fear emotion was very effective.</p>
<p>But the key was also for players to dare to play.</p>
<p>And now?</p>
<p>Among the players who bought the game, a large number requested refunds, and another large number entered, walked around the asylum entrance, and then exited.</p>
<p>How could this provide fear?</p>
<p>Ultimately, <em>Outlast</em> was just too scary.</p>
<p>“A miscalculation!” Chen Xu couldn't help but sigh.</p>
<p>He had originally thought that relying on <em>Outlast</em> and the [Fear Converter] would, if not make him rich in one go, at least bring a wave of sudden wealth.</p>
<p>But looking at this trend, it was a bit difficult to yield results!</p>
<p>Never mind, he might as well use all these points for draws first.</p>
<p>Getting up from his chair, Chen Xu first went to the restroom and then returned.</p>
<p>First, he drew the curtains, then turned off the computer monitor.</p>
<p>Drawing lots still required a sense of ritual.</p>
<p>As the points were consumed, golden light shimmered before Chen Xu.</p>
<p>After a while, having used up all the points, Chen Xu fell silent.</p>
<p>The luck was terrible!</p>
<p>Fifty-pulls, but no special items like the [Fear Converter] appeared, though quite a few Memory Capsules did.</p>
<p>As for skill books, only two rare skill books appeared: one for Level Design and one for Numerical Design.</p>
<p>He clearly washed his hands after going to the restroom.</p>
<p>Final haul: Art Concept Art: 17 books, Level Design: 11 books, System and Numerical Planning: 9 books, Story Interaction: 3 books, Music and Sound Effects: 3 books, Camera Work: 4 books.</p>
<p>The rest were all Memory Capsules.</p>
<p>Chen Xu temporarily stored the Memory Capsules in his item inventory.</p>
<p>He'd talk about it later when developing new games required their use.</p>
<p>After all, Chen Xu had used these quite a bit, and he had to admit, they were really effective.</p>
<p>As for the remaining skill books, he would just use them all.</p>
<p>They couldn't bear offspring and earn interest anyway, otherwise, he could save them.</p>
<p>“However, next, it's time to consider a new direction.”</p>
<p>Chen Xu, leaning back in his chair, was also contemplating in his mind.</p>
<p>As for money, <em>Outlast</em> also yielded a rich harvest.</p>
<p>Although the available capital wasn't much currently, it was sufficient.</p>
<p>Instead, the focus was on the company's future planning, time, and the operation of new projects and platforms.</p>
<p>Scrolling through some recent news from the game industry on his phone, Chen Xu pondered in his mind.</p>
