                <p>Chapter 206: Basic Settings and Partial Changes (Fifth Update, Please Subscribe and Vote for Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>After Chen Xu finished explaining the preliminary concept design for Minecraft, everyone quickly began preparing for their respective tasks.</p>
<p>A portion of the team was responsible for the subsequent operations of Don't Starve and the release of DLC content.</p>
<p>As for Minecraft, the allocated development cycle was more than half a year.</p>
<p>For Chen Xu, at this stage, it was mainly about letting Qin Yi and his team understand some of Minecraft's gameplay philosophies, and then starting the production of the game's art assets.</p>
<p>For the entire game, Chen Xu still needed to meticulously finalize Minecraft's basic rule document.</p>
<p>Moreover, unlike the Minecraft in his previous life, Chen Xu planned to implement multi-faceted optimizations during Minecraft's development.</p>
<p>First and foremost was the game's mode.</p>
<p>In Chen Xu's plan, the initial version of Minecraft released to players would temporarily feature three different modes.</p>
<p>The pure single-player mode, which goes without saying, would encompass both Creative and Survival.</p>
<p>Players would create a world, and the entire world would then generate corresponding terrain. As players explored, the world would infinitely expand, with no supposed boundaries. Theoretically, the map of Minecraft could be as large as a player's hard drive allowed.</p>
<p>Next was the multiplayer mode, featuring local servers created by players' machines, or dedicated servers set up by players themselves.</p>
<p>Within these servers, players could establish various corresponding rules, and the server owner could also add various MOD modules to the server.</p>
<p>Simply put, the power to set rules would be in the players' hands.</p>
<p>Finally, there would be official servers, which are essentially vanilla servers.</p>
<p>These would be divided into Creative and Survival types, with each server using a fixed world, segmented into different server regions, accommodating a maximum of 2,000 players distributed across a colossal map.</p>
<p>Of course, after this, as more MOD modules become available, specialized official mini-game mode servers would be introduced, such as Bed Wars, Hide and Seek, Build Battle, and so on.</p>
<p>There were also matters related to individual player experience, such as the most vexing issue for Minecraft players in his previous life.</p>
<p>That was when, after opening a server, all the painstaking constructions and large-scale projects were destroyed by incoming troublemaking players/griefers. Many players' hearts would shatter watching Trinitrotoluene (TNT) explode.</p>
<p>Therefore, in his previous life, many server owners would install plugins to prevent explosions, prohibit high-altitude fluids, prohibit lava flow, and claim territory to prevent troublemaking players/griefers from destroying their hard work. Chen Xu would specifically create a corresponding setting for this. Players' own servers could set special buildings as indestructible, or restrict certain permissions for others, thereby preventing the appearance of troublemaking players/griefers.</p>
<p>Naturally, this part of the player experience content would only be tested incrementally by the testing team after the initial version of the game was completed, and then modified based on actual experience.</p>
<p>The remaining task involved the basic materials of the entire world, following the Minecraft model from his previous life.</p>
<p>Dirt, sand, stone, water, lava, trees, and various minerals, among others. For creatures, there would be pigs, cows, sheep, etc.</p>
<p>Based on different materials, and using tools like the crafting table, these could also be combined to form other materials.</p>
<p>In Nebula Games' office, Chen Xu meticulously refined Minecraft's basic concept draft.</p>
<p>Compared to the original content from his previous life, Chen Xu also considered integrating settings from some excellent MODs into Minecraft's system.</p>
<p>After all, Minecraft's core philosophy itself was openness.</p>
<p>What it became depended on the players themselves, allowing them to create more things directly in the game, and providing clearer, richer crafting recipe charts. At the very least, players wouldn't have to search for recipes on a search engine while playing the game, as they did in his previous life without a recipe MOD.</p>
<p>It's no exaggeration to say that without a recipe chart, most players wouldn't be able to be self-sufficient in Minecraft.</p>
<p>After all, there are simply too many things and contents that can be crafted and combined. Even many veteran players might not be able to remember all of them clearly.</p>
<p>At the same time, Chen Xu also had another idea for Minecraft: to incorporate some heavily modified content.</p>
<p>For example, richer tech-based crafting content, providing the game with a relatively complete technological development path.</p>
<p>In fact, in his previous life's Minecraft, many MODs already formed similar structures.</p>
<p>For instance, initially in Minecraft, players constructed cars and firearms using various materials. But these items were static objects in the game and wouldn't move at all.</p>
<p>To address these shortcomings, many MOD masters created corresponding MODs, allowing cars to drive and firearms to shoot, enabling players to engage in FPS and racing within Minecraft. If they wished, they could even pilot Gundams.</p>
<p>Chen Xu, on the other hand, considered adding these contents directly into the game itself.</p>
<p>He would set them as an integral part of the game's content.</p>
<p>If players met the conditions to craft a car, why shouldn't that car be able to move?</p>
<p>If players met the requirements to build planes and rockets, why shouldn't they be able to fly?</p>
<p>Moreover, from a technical standpoint, Chen Xu had carefully considered it, and it wasn't overly difficult.</p>
<p>As for whether players could understand advanced Redstone technology, like in his previous life, it was a rhetorical question.</p>
<p>It's well known that Minecraft players are categorized into several different civilization stages.</p>
<p>The first stage: primitive cave dwellers, raw meat eaters. The second stage: entering primitive society and understanding the importance of animal husbandry. The third stage: the nascent stages of the industrial age, where you finally grasp some basic concepts of Redstone technology.</p>
<p>After that, it's the domain of the experts, with various high-end Redstone technology, even building entire computers within the game capable of simple calculations, Chinese character input, Snake, and Minesweeper.</p>
<p>Of course, for most ordinary players, the situation would likely be this: they are still using command blocks to copy structures, while other experts have already completed industrialization.</p>
<p>In addition to these changes, there was another challenging task for Chen Xu.</p>
<p>That was the specialized optimization for Minecraft's MODs.</p>
<p>Similar to how Overcooked and Fall Guys were designed with modular, splittable elements using existing assets for assembly, to allow players to design maps and levels, Minecraft clearly couldn't follow suit.</p>
<p>In his previous life, Minecraft had many versions.</p>
<p>Initially, there was the Java version, developed in Java language. This version was notably open-ended but suffered from poor optimization. It was precisely thanks to Java that early Minecraft had such a rich variety of MOD content, enriching its game ecosystem.</p>
<p>And it consistently remained the preferred version for many players and MOD creators.</p>
<p>Later came the Bedrock Edition, which offered better optimization but significantly reduced openness. It provided less freedom for MOD developers, and its MOD content was far less abundant than the Java version.</p>
<p>For Chen Xu, Minecraft would directly utilize the official game engine, naturally eliminating the version issue.</p>
<p>This presented a rather challenging task.</p>
<p>Chen Xu needed to specifically create various open ports and corresponding tools for Minecraft, to provide players with more convenient ways to create content.</p>
