                <p>Chapter 410: My Name Is Link! Not Zelda! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Along with the conclusion of the entire promotional video, many players were also stirred with excitement.</p>
<p>Because there was finally something to look forward to. Although it was still early until the launch of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, at least they clearly knew when the game would be released.</p>
<p>And from this promotional trailer, players also felt more. After all, before this, the only thing players knew was a single Concept Art image released by Chen Xu. Everything could only be imagined by players, but now there was finally something concrete to reference.</p>
<p>Previously, many players felt that the game's art style was too cartoonish and childish, but from this promotional video, it actually looked quite good! This cartoon-rendered style, judging from the promotional video, had a unique charm, looking exceptionally beautiful, like a fairy tale world.</p>
<p>In terms of detail and material Modeling, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild certainly couldn't compare with those realistic AAA-tier games. However, the game excelled at playing to its strengths and avoiding its weaknesses in its presentation; if it couldn't compete in intricate detail, then it simply didn't. A large amount of warm lighting effects, combined with striking color schemes, gave the entire game's visuals extremely high saturation.</p>
<p>The overall game also leaned towards bright, warm tones, which made players feel very comfortable. In addition, the promotional video also showcased some Gameplay content. For example, Link using various peculiar abilities: bombs, time-freezing, Magnets, and creating ice blocks.</p>
<p>This gave many players, who initially didn't have high expectations, a sense of pleasant surprise. Because from this content, the Combat System seemed incredibly rich, and players who had already been following and anticipating the game due to Nebula Games' and Chen Xu's reputation were now even more excited. After all, from the trailer, they felt the game's quality had already exceeded their expectations!</p>
<p>As for the possibility of it being a misleading trailer?</p>
<p>If it were a typical game developers, they would genuinely be quite concerned. After all, in the gaming industry, the 'seller's showcase versus buyer's reality' is a very common occurrence.</p>
<p>But Nebula Games was an exception. The game's quality wouldn't have even a tiny problem; if a problem arose, it was definitely <em>your</em> problem as a player. Hmm... for example, Dark Souls, Monster Hunter: World, and 'Others' World'.</p>
<p>Following this official promotional video, players enthusiastically began discussing it.</p>
<p>"Although it's a cartoon style, I feel like I'm good with it now. The visuals feel great!"</p>
<p>"I agree. Actually, Super Mario Odyssey's visual presentation, especially in some unique scenes, was already beautiful, but this The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild feels even better!"</p>
<p>"I just wonder if it's a misleading trailer."</p>
<p>"Don't worry about that, Mr. Chen never does that kind of thing. If there's any deception, it'll be in the Gameplay!"</p>
<p>"Damn, that hits home, bro!"</p>
<p>"Oh, come on! Don't worry, this game shouldn't be too difficult. Look at the monsters in the game; even the Skeleton Soldier looks adorable. It's clearly aiming for an all-ages audience."</p>
<p>"Ahem, my friend above, don't underestimate Super Mario Odyssey! Try turning off Assist Mode and then challenging the levels unlocked after 500 Power Moons!"</p>
<p>"By the way, doesn't anyone else feel the story is a bit simple? It's just a hero saving a princess, similar in tone to Super Mario Odyssey."</p>
<p>"Right, it should be a pretty traditional story. I just wonder what the actual Gameplay will be like. It looks like you control Zelda to defeat that calamity called Ganon and rescue the princess, right?"</p>
<p>"My friends above, did you even seriously watch the trailer? The protagonist is Link, the protagonist is LINK! Zelda is the princess!"</p>
<p>"Link: I'll say it again, my name is Link! Not Zelda!"</p>
<p>"Holy cow, I really didn't notice! What the heck, if the protagonist isn't named Zelda, then why is it called 'The Legend of Zelda'?!"</p>
<p>"Haha, I went back and watched it. The protagonist really is named Link, not Zelda!"</p>
<p>With the launch of the promotional video, players quickly began discussing it heatedly. As for the topic of discussion, it was naturally The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</p>
<p>Regarding the art style, many players didn't have strong feelings. Because this style inherently couldn't be linked to realism, but under cartoon rendering, it was quite beautiful.</p>
<p>Another aspect that concerned players was the game's story and Gameplay. As for the Gameplay, it wasn't entirely clear yet, but Link could be seen using various peculiar abilities in the trailer. So it was definitely action-oriented Gameplay. Regarding the story, very little had been revealed so far, making it impossible to judge.</p>
<p>The only thing many players found interesting was that the game's protagonist was named Link, not Zelda. After all, many players had previously assumed the protagonist was named Zelda. But now, this sudden turn of events also left many players bewildered.</p>
<p>Days passed one by one. NetDragon's Shadow Operations: The Wilderness and TengHua's Chaotic Heroes, two highly anticipated blockbusters, also launched successively towards the end of October and in November.</p>
<p>Initially, they indeed received high praise, but soon, as players experienced the games, the reviews began to become mixed.</p>
<p>Among them, TengHua's Chaotic Heroes, which had previously been an ACT game, was changed to an open world this time. The most unbearable aspect for players was the unreasonable Level Design. It was unclear if TengHua intended this for players to experience freedom, or if the design simply wasn't well-executed. Players often inadvertently stumbled into high-level monsters in the early game, but this game was different from Souls-like games such as Dark Souls, where early-game players could take on late-game BOSSes. The RPG Numerical Design values in the game were also quite high, which often resulted in players getting severely beaten by late-game monsters in the early stages.</p>
<p>As for NetDragon's Shadow Operations: The Wilderness, in the words of players, the first ten hours gave them the astonishing feeling of Red Dead Redemption. But after ten hours, the entire game's flavor changed. There were endless outposts to clear and an unending stream of side quests, and upon closer inspection, these side quests were the kind that players easily complained about. For example, going to a certain area to deliver a message, telling someone they were safe, or delivering some item.</p>
<p>Many players were speechless. "What the heck, they're an elite squad, can't they be a bit more serious about combating criminal gangs?!" "And what era is this? Weapons use infrared scanning, Drones for reconnaissance. Don't you guys have cell phones?"</p>
<p>However, due to the mixed reviews of these two games, many players shifted their attention to the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, as many still remembered the shock Red Dead Redemption had delivered last year.</p>
<p>Besides players, many Gaming Industry Professionals were also paying attention. From the promotional video, Nebula Games had certainly taken a unique approach with its Art style. But what about the content? Creating an open-world game on the limited hardware of the Switch platform.</p>
<p>Everyone wanted to see the actual performance of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
