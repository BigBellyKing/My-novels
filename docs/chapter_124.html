                <p>Chapter 223: Are You Guys the Insightful Ones? (Seeking Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Before entering the game, new players needed to customize their appearance.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Yi had already played the early access trial after New Year's Day, so his character was already created. He just needed to load his previous save.</p>
<p>Luck was on his side; there happened to be someone leaving the server. Zhang Yi waited outside for about ten seconds, and as the game screen plunged into darkness, he entered.</p>
<p>As the game screen appeared on the monitor, Zhang Yi was first startled by the sheer multitude of people.</p>
<p>There were simply too many players, with all sorts of diverse appearances and outfits, their messy IDs floating above their heads.</p>
<p>It made Zhang Yi a little dizzy. Then, in the options, Zhang Yi shielded the IDs above players' heads, and instantly felt much better.</p>
<p>“Old Zhang, you’re here!”</p>
<p>“This is amazing! Perfect timing to give you a full tour from the beginning.”</p>
<p>In the voice channel, Song Ren and Wang Han’s voices could be heard.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the game, Zhang Yi also saw Song Ren’s character appear next to him.</p>
<p>In the public viewing server, all players had no physical collision volume with each other. They could also fly freely as in Creative Mode, including inputting specific commands to adjust their flight speed.</p>
<p>“If I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn’t have believed it! This Firelink Shrine is exactly the same!” Hearing Song Ren and the others, Zhang Yi now noticed his location.</p>
<p>At first, he hadn’t quite registered it.</p>
<p>But looking closely now, good heavens, wasn’t this the Firelink Shrine from Dark Souls?</p>
<p>Of course, not the open-air one from the Age of First Fire, but the one from the end of the Age of Fire.</p>
<p>Almost everything had been faithfully recreated!</p>
<p>There was even a bonfire, and next to it, a Fire Keeper made of blocky pixels was also present!</p>
<p>The Crestfallen Warrior sitting on the steps, Ludleth of Courland with no legs, as well as the Shrine Handmaid and the Blacksmith.</p>
<p>“Right? We were all startled when we first came in too!” Song Ren said with emotion.</p>
<p>“Who would believe this thing is a pixel game!” Wang Yifan also exclaimed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, many players in the Firelink Shrine were excitedly discussing the current Firelink Shrine over the in-game public microphone.</p>
<p>“By the way, have you finished your tour yet?” Zhang Yi asked.</p>
<p>“Not yet, we only toured a part of Along the River During the Qingming Festival. You came online before we finished, so we’ll show you the rest together,” Wang Han replied.</p>
<p>“Let’s go, let’s set off!” Zhang Yi was a little impatient.</p>
<p>He knew how to tour, as there was a line of floating instructions in the sky.</p>
<p>He came to the bonfire in the central area, ignoring the group of players surrounding the Fire Keeper.</p>
<p>It was one thing for players to try and view the Fire Keeper from various angles in <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>After all, he had seen it too; she was indeed incredibly beautiful.</p>
<p>But here in <em>Minecraft</em>, facing a pixelated block character, you players still want to peek at the Fire Keeper from special angles? Are you even human?!</p>
<p>Upon interacting with the bonfire for teleportation, there was first a black screen, then the image appeared on Zhang Yi’s screen.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi finally saw that dreamlike scene.</p>
<p>He was born directly onto the streets of Bianliang.</p>
<p>The NPCs, wearing special ancient costumes, were all around, while the other blocky figures were clearly all normal players.</p>
<p>In the chat box at the bottom left, chat messages were scrolling frantically.</p>
<p>At this moment, Zhang Yi’s eyes widened as he gazed at the pixelated, prosperous scene from a thousand years ago.</p>
<p>The bustling market, wine shops, painted boats, multi-storied buildings, merchants and tourists in every street and alley.</p>
<p>It made Zhang Yi feel as if he had traveled to another world.</p>
<p>His mind recalled the small darkroom he and Wang Han had built.</p>
<p>Then he looked at this bustling Kaifeng Prefecture.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi instantly felt like, was he playing the same game as what he was seeing now?</p>
<p>The difference was too vast!</p>
<p>At this point, Wang Han and the others also teleported over.</p>
<p>“This is absolutely amazing! What do you guys think if we build a similar architectural complex someday?” Song Ren exclaimed, looking at the beautiful scenery before him.</p>
<p>The voice channel fell silent. Everyone just silently controlled their characters to fly forward.</p>
<p>Build a similar architectural complex?</p>
<p>Zhang Yi silently glanced at the Along the River During the Qingming Festival scene before him.</p>
<p>Sunlight shone, and white steam could even be seen on the Bian River.</p>
<p>Lanterns hanging from eaves gently swayed in the wind.</p>
<p>Centered around the tall city gate tower, buildings on both sides were closely packed.</p>
<p>Tea houses, wine shops, inns, butcher shops, temples, government offices...</p>
<p>Even in the shops, there were various silks and satins, jewels and spices, all represented by items from <em>Minecraft</em>. For example, silks and satins were replaced by wool, and jewels by emeralds.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there were services like large cart repair, fortune-telling, shaving and grooming; residents from all walks of life were present.</p>
<p>Pedestrians in the market rubbed shoulders, flowing endlessly. There were merchants doing business, gentry observing the streetscape, men and women, young and old, scholars, farmers, artisans, merchants, and people from all social strata, fully represented.</p>
<p>Transportation vehicles were also numerous: sedan chairs, camels, ox carts, rickshaws, all sorts and varieties, vividly depicting the prosperous scene of a commercial city before their eyes.</p>
<p>Such a massive existence, and you say you want to build something similar?</p>
<p>Excuse me!</p>
<p>Although it was a game, the group of people did not use flight mode but walked together on the streets along both banks of the Bian River.</p>
<p>They enjoyed the beautiful scenery in the game, just like tourists.</p>
<p>Many other players did the same.</p>
<p>Through the public microphone voice channel, even strangers began chatting with each other.</p>
<p>“It’s too breathtaking! Nebula Games is incredible! Have you noticed, even though it’s pixel art style, it’s really so authentic!”</p>
<p>“Exactly, it’s not just similar in form, but also in spirit, vividly portraying the hidden dangers beneath the prosperity!”</p>
<p>“Right, right, did you notice the street we just passed? There’s a fire watchtower. Because most buildings during the Northern Song Dynasty were brick and wood structures and easily caught fire, each district would have a dedicated fire watchtower to observe for fires. But the fire watchtower we just saw was empty on the upper floor, which was clearly intentional.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, and before that, there wasn’t a single guard on the city walls, nor any fortifications on the earthen walls, not even battlements for archers. There wasn’t even a nominal defense.”</p>
<p>“Did you notice the boats coming and going on the Bian River? Because at that time, Emperor Huizong of Song used a large number of official grain transport boats to transport the Flower and Rock Tribute, causing problems with grain transportation. Private boats seized the opportunity to enter and gradually took control of the city’s grain market, thereby manipulating grain prices.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, and these events involving NPCs, look ahead!”</p>
<p>At a corner ahead, a tax official pointed at a burlap sack and demanded a certain amount, immediately provoking dissatisfaction from the surrounding merchants. A cart driver anxiously shouted with an open mouth, the noise so loud it startled the watchman on the city gate tower to look down.</p>
<p>At the same time, two four-horse carriages on the street suddenly sped around, crashing recklessly, with passersby having no time to dodge.</p>
<p>These phenomena, of course, were applications of AI technology. Various feedback events would randomly appear during the players’ visits. To ensure the uniqueness of the streets for the Along the River During the Qingming Festival map, Chen Xu also put in a lot of effort, creating a large number of random events.</p>
<p>“It’s perfect! It fully depicts the customs and daily lives of the common people, and even reveals the hidden complexities beneath the surface of commercial prosperity. This is a prosperous era’s crisis painting with a sense of apprehension!”</p>
<p>Listening to the various conversations of other players around, Zhang Yi, along with Wang Han and Song Ren, fell silent.</p>
<p>Are you guys the Insightful Ones?</p>
<p>Everyone was playing the game, everyone was admiring it.</p>
<p>But why could you guys be so insightful, saying so much stuff?</p>
<p>While he was just ‘Holy crap, awesome!’ and ‘Holy crap, so pretty.’</p>
<p>Listening to the conversations of these nearby players made him feel a bit too ‘common’ or ‘vulgar’.</p>
<p>So Zhang Yi made a decision: he would turn off the voice chat.</p>
<p>As long as he couldn’t hear them, he wouldn’t feel so common.</p>
<p>The world instantly quieted down!</p>
<p>Closing the voice chat and enjoying the quiet world, Zhang Yi smiled.</p>
<p>Different locations, same action.</p>
<p>Wang Han, Song Ren, they all silently turned off the public voice channel as well.</p>
