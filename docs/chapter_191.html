                <p>Chapter 291: Fire Demon Tower (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>As the defensive towers entered an upgrade phase, Satellite, who was in the game, was utterly stunned.</p>
<p>In the early game, he employed a Single Burrows Fast Tech strategy. For Orcs, the biggest feature of this playstyle is that it's much faster than a normal opening. By roughly 17 population, they can usually reach Tier 2.</p>
<p>Coupled with early Wolf Riders, they can quickly start harassing.</p>
<p>This is considered one of the mainstream tactics developed by Orc players.</p>
<p>The main reason Orcs can play this way is that their Orc Footman is the tankiest infantry unit in the early game. One main hero paired with an Orc Footman is usually enough for leveling, and the Orc shop is also the most suitable for the race; after taking heavy damage, one Great Potion makes them a good warrior again in no time.</p>
<p>Currently, Satellite found himself in a very awkward situation. Five Peons were directly repairing the Arrow Towers. Although they are very vulnerable during construction and upgrade, the opponent was building them outside the Burrow's defensive range. At this point, even if the Peons entered the Burrow, they couldn't defend.</p>
<p>His Blademaster and current Orc Footman seemed completely outmatched. In a direct fight, the Fire Demon definitely couldn't beat the Blademaster, but the opponent wasn't fighting him directly! His Blademaster and Orc Footman attacked the Fire Demon, while the Arrow Towers continued to build and upgrade. The Fire Demon didn't engage in a direct fight either, just circled around.</p>
<p>If he attacked the Peons, the Peons would just run away. The Arrow Towers were already upgrading, and the Fire Demon, Lesser Fire Demon, and Orc Footman were attacking his units. If he turned back to attack the Arrow Towers while facing five Peons, he currently only had one Blademaster and two Orc Footmen, with the third Orc Footman still building.</p>
<p>It felt like being on the back of a tiger, unable to dismount.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Burrow was utterly shoddy work; at least before upgrading with Cement, Burrows were too easily destroyed. This was one of the reasons he built it so far back, because it was too prone to harassment. But now, he felt like he had eaten poop, completely unprepared for Humans to play like this.</p>
<p>At this moment, Chen Xu was also highly focused.</p>
<p>Human TR, or Tower Rush, is a rather extreme tactic. If executed well, the opponent can be completely suppressed in the early game. But if it doesn't immediately kill them, then you've essentially sealed your own fate.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there weren't many units to control in the early game, so his hand speed was sufficient to handle it.</p>
<p>The situation on the field was very tense, and with the completion of the Arcane Tower, which drains magic, it basically signaled the success of the first step of the TR tactic: the Humans had established a foothold in the Orc base.</p>
<p>Satellite, at this point, actually figured out how to counter it. That was to upgrade to Tier 2, build a Workshop, and use Catapults to break through.</p>
<p>But the crucial problem was that he couldn't hold on much longer! He had to choose between economy and wood. Building Orc Footmen to stall for time would inevitably slow down the production of Catapults and the Workshop. And the opponent's defensive towers wouldn't take any longer to build. But if he didn't build Orc Footmen, he wouldn't be able to stall at all!</p>
<p>It was a complete dead end. Looking at the two new defensive towers that had just been erected, Satellite struggled to kill the Fire Demon in front of him, then immediately typed GG in the public chat.</p>
<p>As soon as those two GGs appeared, the players watching the live stream instantly erupted.</p>
<p>If his previous victory against Sookbn's Orc with Night Elves could be attributed to the opponent underestimating him or something similar, then this game, played with Humans, could only mean one thing: Orcs were indeed not invincible!</p>
<p>'No! What about Orc Supremacy? Why do I feel like Orcs have become the weakest race?'</p>
<p>'Holy crap, they said the game balance demonstration was good. What if Chen Xu suddenly thinks Orcs are too weak and buffs them after this?'</p>
<p>'I'm completely floored. Who's the professional player here?!'</p>
<p>'To be fair, Chen Xu made some mistakes in his operations, but more importantly, the other players completely didn't expect Humans and Night Elves to be played this way, catching them off guard.'</p>
<p>'That's what they say, but RTS still relies heavily on skill. Chen Xu's operations crush at least 90% of players, right? If an ordinary player tried this against a professional, they'd probably still get hard-countered.'</p>
<p>'Be more confident, it should be 99%. But what's most striking to me is that he adapts based on the characteristics of the units and races!'</p>
<p>'Exactly! It's absolutely brilliant!'</p>
<p>Even in the professional RTS circles, many players who hadn't joined the matches yet were now eager to try. The inspiration they received was simply too immense. Before this, no one had ever thought of this strategy. It wasn't that no one knew Humans could group build structures.</p>
<p>But the main point was that many people previously thought it was a chicken rib. Because it would consume extra wood and gold, but they never imagined that they could utilize this fast building feature to directly build defensive towers into the opponent's base, essentially turning RTS into a tower defense game.</p>
<p>......</p>
<p>Satellite was also a bit helpless. He hadn't thought of this playstyle at all. Who would have thought that in less than three minutes, the opponent would bring their entire family to his doorstep and start building houses?</p>
<p>He also checked the group chat, where everyone was discussing.</p>
