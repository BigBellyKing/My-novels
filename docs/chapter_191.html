<p>Chapter 190: That's Not How the Script Is Written! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>After confirming his selection, Song Ren saw the game screen plunge into darkness, followed by the loading interface skipping.</p>
<p>At this moment, he appeared before a Fog Gate.</p>
<p>Not rushing to initiate the BOSS battle, Song Ren first checked his equipment. Currently, he was single-wielding the Guandao with a Silver Knight Shield. Previously, he always had the Grass Crest Shield on his back for stamina recovery and dual-wielded the Guandao.</p>
<p>But for Death Mode, he opted for a single-wield setup with a shield to maintain his fault tolerance. After all, according to previous update descriptions, not only was the BOSS's AI enhanced in Death Mode, but some numerical values were also strengthened. The reason he dual-wielded the Guandao before was primarily to achieve better poise-breaking effects.</p>
<p>While not explicitly stated for Death Mode BOSSes, Song Ren felt that the BOSSes' corresponding poise would likely be increased. So, he chose a more conservative playstyle.</p>
<p>Standing before the white Fog Gate, having made all preparations, Song Ren took a deep breath and stepped through the entrance.</p>
<p>At this moment, he felt a slight thrill. What if he really managed to defeat Artorias in Death Mode on his very first encounter? It wasn't entirely impossible! Song Ren mentally pictured the battle scene.</p>
<p>As the white mist in front of him dispersed, Song Ren fell silent for a moment as he saw Artorias.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, just as the Death Mode description stated, the player faced the character at their peak. The Artorias he had fought before was completely corrupted by the Abyss, his left arm rotten and utterly crippled, his shield gone, his greatsword battered, his armor tattered. His mind was crazed, fighting purely on instinctual swordplay. But even then, he was incredibly fierce, and one wrong move would lead to a brutal beating.</p>
<p>But what about the current Artorias? Song Ren paused slightly. With a blue cape and knight armor, he looked majestic and domineering, wielding a greatsword in one hand and a shield in the other. This was the Four Knights of Gwyn at his prime – the Blue Knight: Artorias!</p>
<p>The BOSS's health bar UI and name hadn't appeared. Artorias simply stood there silently, accompanied by the suddenly swelling background music. This instantly made Song Ren nervous. A feeling called Sense of Oppression filled Song Ren's heart.</p>
<p>The battle Arena was still the same Artorias Arena from before, but whether it was an illusion or not, Song Ren felt that this Arena was considerably larger than the original. Taking a deep breath, Song Ren looked at Artorias before him and performed the Praise the Sun gesture. To his surprise, after he completed the gesture, Artorias returned a Knight's Bow.</p>
<p>“I'm about to aggro the BOSS!” Song Ren said, gripping his mouse nervously, glancing at Zhang Yi beside him.</p>
<p>Hearing Song Ren, Zhang Yi couldn't help but show an exasperated expression: “I'm not the one fighting the BOSS, why are you asking me when you're the only one initiating? Go ahead, you definitely can't beat Artorias anyway.”</p>
<p>“Damn it!” Song Ren cursed, then controlled his in-game character to approach. At the same time, Artorias's health bar and name appeared at the bottom of the screen. However, even though they had entered the battle phase, and the background music had become stirring, Artorias on the opposite side merely circled Song Ren unhurriedly.</p>
<p>He recalled that when fighting Artorias in the original game, the BOSS's aggression was incredibly strong, constantly using thrusts and jumping attacks without a moment's pause. Now, he was just standing still? It was as if two normal players were engaged in PVP, as defensive counter-attacks often held an advantage over aggressive attacks in Dark Souls.</p>
<p>“Alright, I'll make the first move!” Seeing Artorias move as cautiously as an old lady crossing the street, Song Ren couldn't hold back anymore. He walked forward and swung his Guandao, landing a hit on Artorias. He glanced at Artorias's health bar below, which clearly dropped by one segment. Evidently, the Guandao's damage was quite respectable. Estimating from Artorias's total health bar, this one hit took about one twenty-fifth of his health. So, theoretically, he would only need to land 25 hits to defeat the Artorias in front of him. Based on the damage, the Death Mode version of Artorias likely had around 10,000 HP.</p>
<p>After landing one hit, Song Ren didn't get greedy but rolled away to create distance. But the very instant he rolled, Artorias suddenly leaped into the air, his greatsword crashing heavily down on Song Ren's previous position. Seeing Artorias's move, Song Ren, mid-roll, wasn't flustered, as he had already stood up. He continued with another roll to evade Artorias's attack, but this time, Artorias also rolled in place, seemingly using the roll to cancel the recovery frames of his jumping attack, directly chaining into a horizontal sweep.</p>
<p>This time, Song Ren's roll was too slow because he hadn't anticipated this situation at all. Because in the original version, Artorias had a clear animation recovery after performing a jumping attack. But now? What the heck, he can roll!? Isn't that the Undead's signature move! When did you learn it, kid!</p>
<p>This time, Song Ren had no time to dodge at all and was severely hit by the greatsword, losing a chunk of his health. Frightened, he quickly pulled out his Estus Flask and took a swig.</p>
<p>“Holy cow, can this BOSS even be played??”</p>
<p>Although he confirmed that the BOSS's damage couldn't instantly kill him, the key was that the BOSS's reactions were completely different! It gave him a feeling of being 'enlightened' or 'sentient.' These attack methods were essentially the same as Artorias's previous moves. However, they were now much more fluid, like the jumping attack followed by a horizontal sweep. In the original version, there was a brief moment of recovery after each attack. But now, it was simply seamless. Furthermore, this BOSS could even roll to dodge, and the great barrier shield in its hand wasn't just for show; it could effectively block his attacks.</p>
<p>The moves were still the same old moves, and besides rolling and blocking, Song Ren hadn't discovered any new ones. But old moves or not, when the attack frequency changed, and the moves combined with actions like rolling, the difficulty immediately skyrocketed. Before, whenever Artorias charged a thrust or performed a jumping attack, it was basically a formulaic dodge, then a counter-attack. It felt like a turn-based game.</p>
<p>But now? It felt like a real-person PVP, and this BOSS could even roll and pursue.</p>
<p>“I refuse to believe it! This BOSS can't be that godly!”</p>
<p>Having replenished his status, Song Ren patiently observed the BOSS's movements. Soon, Song Ren also noticed a pattern: the BOSS's attack moves were still the same few, repeated over and over. It was just more adaptable to on-the-spot judgments. For example, the original Artorias would have a moment of stiffness after a thrust, but now, he would immediately roll after a thrust to cancel the recovery animation. The same applied to skills like the jumping attack.</p>
<p>“Be cautious, now's the time!”</p>
<p>Song Ren maintained his steady approach, dodging attacks with rolls whenever possible. If he absolutely couldn't dodge, he would block with his shield, as long as his stamina bar wasn't completely depleted. He chipped away at Artorias's health, refusing to get greedy with extra hits. Slowly, he managed to deplete about one-fifth of Artorias's health.</p>
<p>At this point, Song Ren keenly felt the pressure intensify. Artorias's attack frequency seemed to quicken, and his aggression grew stronger. Although the force of his attacks remained the same, dealing the same amount of damage, the pace seemed to have accelerated even further!</p>
<p>Watching the BOSS execute a move, Song Ren raised his shield, recognizing it as a thrust Artorias had used before. He could block it directly with his shield, which would then be followed by a horizontal sweep. However, he couldn't block the sweep and had to roll to dodge it, otherwise, his stamina bar would be completely emptied.</p>
<p>But in the next moment, to Song Ren's bewildered gaze, Artorias executed a direct roll, appearing behind him. Then, his greatsword scraped a shower of sparks on the ground and struck him, completely unprepared.</p>
<p>[YOU DIED!] The familiar three words appeared again. However, he didn't lose the souls he was carrying. Clearly, this mode didn't incur any losses except for used items.</p>
<p>“What the heck kind of BOSS is this?!”</p>
<p>Song Ren, revived at the Firelink Shrine, was completely dumbfounded. This BOSS could change its moves? He defended, so the BOSS should have hit his shield, and then he would roll to dodge the second attack, right? Why did the BOSS just roll past his front and attack him from behind!? That's not how the script is written!</p>
<p>Remaining chapters to continue tonight. Also, I played Mahjong this afternoon and actually hit Nine Gates in five turns. I feel like all my luck for the month has been used up~</p>
