                <p>Chapter 246: A Great Sword, A Legend (Eighth Update, Please Subscribe for Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Inside the Hunter's Lodge, Zhang Yi was utterly spoilt for choice, gazing at the array of weapons before him.</p>
<p>Just like the previously revealed information, there are no distinct classes in <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>. Players can choose any weapon as their own and switch between them at any time.</p>
<p>However, while switching is free, much like <em>Dark Souls</em>, later-game weapons require materials for crafting and enhancement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it's currently unknown if the game has a system for disassembling items to recover materials. If not, it's clear that for a period, one would have to stick with a single chosen weapon.</p>
<p>After all, in the early stages, there wouldn't be enough materials to craft and upgrade every weapon.</p>
<p>And if you don't craft or upgrade, you'd be stuck with low-level weapons, and your hunting damage would be negligible.</p>
<p>Therefore, it's crucial to carefully select a weapon you're comfortable with.</p>
<p>“Are there descriptions and introductions for the weapons, and maybe some videos? Let's check those out first.”</p>
<p>Looking at the descriptions for each weapon in the game, Zhang Yi also opted to watch the demonstrations to make a better judgment.</p>
<p>After watching for several minutes, Zhang Yi realized that each weapon had its unique characteristics, and he wanted to try them all!</p>
<p>The Great Sword, Switch Axe, and Charge Blade looked incredibly imposing, while the Dual Blades and Sword &amp; Shield seemed exceptionally nimble and graceful. The Long Sword, in particular, felt impossibly cool.</p>
<p>At the same time, weapons like the Bow, Light Bowgun, Heavy Bowgun, and Lance each had a distinct feel that appealed to him!</p>
<p>The Insect Glaive felt like playing <em>Ace Combat</em>, while a Heavy Bowgun in hand rattled away like a Maxim machine gun.</p>
<p>Not to mention the Long Sword's Foresight Slash and Helm Breaker, which were so Mom-explodingly cool.</p>
<p>The Dual Blades' Demon Dance, the Charge Blade's Super Amped Element Discharge.</p>
<p>The Lance, moreover, could both attack and defend, with its Guard Dash being incredibly imposing, and its great shield standing firm as Mount Tai.</p>
<p>The Bow also offered a hundred variations with its Hundred-Pace Piercing Arrow, Arc Shot, Power Shot, Dragon Piercer, and Draw Dragon Piercer.</p>
<p>It's so hard to choose!</p>
<p>Zhang Yi's face was a picture of indecision.</p>
<p>After much hesitation, Zhang Yi decided to first try out various weapons to see how they felt in combat.</p>
<p>“Let me check this out first…” Zhang Yi drew the Long Sword from his back and walked to the training dummy. As for why he chose the Long Sword first…</p>
<p>After all, this weapon was just Mom-explodingly cool.</p>
<p>On the left side, there was something resembling a move list, and after attacking, follow-up combo guides would appear in the upper right corner.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi quickly realized that, compared to <em>Dark Souls</em>, the combat mode and system in <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> were completely different.</p>
<p>The entire action system was relatively much more complex, and the game also featured two distinct states: combat and non-combat.</p>
<p>In combat state, players hold their weapons and cannot sprint, only dodge by rolling.</p>
<p>When entering the non-combat state, players put away their weapons, and then they can sprint.</p>
<p>Next were the attack combinations, which felt somewhat like inputting commands in a fighting game.</p>
<p>It required players to string together various skills through attacks to deal damage to monsters.</p>
<p>And to fulfill specific prerequisites before certain moves could be activated.</p>
<p>Taking the Long Sword in his hand as an example, the basic ordinary attack methods were just a few.</p>
<p>There were regular Slashes, Thrusts, and after accumulating the Spirit Gauge through these ordinary attacks, one could use the more flashy Spirit Blade.</p>
<p>For higher-level moves, such as Helm Breaker, one needed to maintain the Spirit Gauge State during a Spirit Thrust. To fill the Spirit Gauge, players could choose to use the Foresight Slash (also known as a Parry) at the very moment of receiving an attack to parry the monster's attack.</p>
<p>If successful, it would rapidly fill the Spirit Gauge, or one could diligently use Slashes and Thrusts to accumulate the Spirit Gauge, then use Spirit Blade III combined with the final Spirit Roundslash to fill the gauge.</p>
<p>After trying the Long Sword, Zhang Yi then tried other weapons.</p>
<p>Among them, the Charge Blade was the weapon he found the most complex.</p>
<p>For a regular Amped Element Discharge, players first needed to accumulate phials in Sword Mode. Once the phials were full, they could unleash the 'Amped Element Discharge' which carried lightning.</p>
<p>However, to unleash the even more explosive Super Amped Element Discharge, players needed to interrupt the 'Amped Element Discharge' by charging power into the shield, and only then could they unleash the world-destroying 'Super Amped Element Discharge'.</p>
<p>Although the damage was high and it looked cool, Zhang Yi felt that he would likely forget these steps when actually fighting.</p>
<p>Every weapon has very unique characteristics.</p>
<p>After careful consideration, Zhang Yi ultimately chose the Great Sword.</p>
<p>As for the reason?</p>
<p>Initially, he had indeed intended to pick the Long Sword, as it was simply too cool.</p>
<p>But after some thought, he gave it up.</p>
<p>As an experienced gamer, Zhang Yi understood game design quite well.</p>
<p>That is, when a weapon is incredibly cool, it's almost certainly not the strongest.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>The Long Sword was already so stylish; its appearance, design, and moves alone could attract a huge number of players.</p>
<p>So, if the Long Sword was also very powerful in actual combat, what would be the point of all the other weapons?</p>
<p>Nebula Games had designed so many weapons; wouldn't they all become useless?</p>
<p>Therefore, the Long Sword might not be the weakest weapon, but it definitely wouldn't be considered strong.</p>
<p>But the Great Sword was different!</p>
<p>Seemingly unadorned, yet boundless in its majesty.</p>
<p>Moreover, during testing, the description mentioned 'Super Armor'.</p>
<p>As is well known, in any action game, as long as there's Super Armor, it won't be particularly weak.</p>
<p>When he tested its damage, the Great Sword was also top-tier, with a single True Charged Slash dealing over a hundred damage.</p>
<p>Only the Long Sword's Helm Breaker and the Charge Blade's Super Amped Element Discharge could rival such brutal performance.</p>
<p>But he felt that the Great Sword's charging was a bit simpler.</p>
<p>As for skills like Blocking and Tackle, he ignored them.</p>
<p>Defense?</p>
<p>Who needs defense!</p>
<p>The best offense is defense!</p>
<p>“All those other weapons are just inferior, the Great Sword is the one true god! No wonder the hunter in the promotional video carried a Great Sword!”</p>
<p>“A Great Sword, a legend!”</p>
<p>Watching the Great Sword in his hands, Zhang Yi was filled with excitement. In his mind, he could already see himself, wielding a Great Sword, charging through everything and earning the glory of the Azure Star.</p>
<p>However, despite his excitement, Zhang Yi didn't immediately leave the training grounds. Instead, he decided to practice a bit more.</p>
<p>So he could better understand the Great Sword's playstyle.</p>
<p>“Simple, got it, understood, I know how to play now, this is too easy! I got it!”</p>
<p>Watching the massive damage numbers pop up as his Charged Slash hit the training dummy, Zhang Yi nodded gently.</p>
<p>Nothing more to say, it's a cinch!</p>
<p>This is the unpretentious Great Sword.</p>
<p>Wide Slash, Charged Slash!</p>
<p>Uppercut, Charged Slash!</p>
<p>Side Slash, Charged Slash!</p>
<p>No need for fancy tricks; just charge and unleash!</p>
