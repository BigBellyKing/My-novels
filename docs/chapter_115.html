                <p>Chapter 214: Hopes for a Beautiful Future (Sixth Update, Please Subscribe and Vote)</p>
<p>After choosing single-player mode, the first thing that appeared before Wang Han was character selection.</p>
<p>The male default was a character named Steve, and the female default was a character named Alex.</p>
<p>However, custom character creation was possible.</p>
<p>Wang Han took a look. Although it was a pixel-style game, and the character's head was also a block.</p>
<p>But the eyes, eyebrows, mouth, and nose were quite finely distinguished.</p>
<p>Instead of using the original Steve and Alex character models.</p>
<p>Wang Han created a new character for herself, named it 'Build Battle', and entered the game.</p>
<p>After all, she had seen some promotional content for Minecraft before, and it seemed to involve building houses.</p>
<p>Although she wasn't sure how to play, she figured she'd name it first.</p>
<p>After all, having a good name was half the battle.</p>
<p>She even had a name in mind for Zhang Yi: Foreman.</p>
<p>Once her master builder designed the house, someone else would be needed for construction.</p>
<p>With that thought, after entering the game, a pop-up window appeared, prompting her to choose a game mode.</p>
<p>It was divided into 'Creative Mode' and 'Survival Mode'.</p>
<p>However, after seeing that the so-called Creative Mode was essentially 'Invincible Mode', Wang Han quickly made a decision: "I'll try Survival Mode first. That sounds like it would be more challenging."</p>
<p>'Detecting your first entry into Survival Mode. Would you like to learn some essential basic knowledge?'</p>
<p>As Wang Han confirmed her choice and a world seed was generated, she entered Minecraft, and a prompt pop-up appeared.</p>
<p>This was triggered for every new account entering the game, mainly providing some basic explanations about Minecraft, helping players understand how to play in Survival Mode, and covering some basic operations.</p>
<p>For example, how materials are collected and how tools are crafted.</p>
<p>Although Minecraft is a sandbox game, it's considered the most free sandbox game.</p>
<p>But freedom doesn't mean there's no need for a new player tutorial; it doesn't have to be long, but at least some basic concepts and operations still need to be introduced to players.</p>
<p>Wang Han thought for a moment and selected yes.</p>
<p>Next came the actual gameplay. Following the system's instructions, Wang Han performed some simple operations.</p>
<p>Forward, backward, left, right, jumping, and running.</p>
<p>It was very simple, with nothing particularly special.</p>
<p>At the same time, the UI in the game was not very complex.</p>
<p>It was mainly concentrated at the bottom center of the screen, with the item inventory at the very bottom.</p>
<p>It was currently empty.</p>
<p>Above the item inventory, on the left, were red hearts, representing the in-game health bar.</p>
<p>On the right was a large chicken leg, representing the in-game hunger level.</p>
<p>There was also something resembling an experience bar, but the game didn't seem to have any content for leveling up or adding attributes, which left Wang Han a bit confused.</p>
<p>But if she didn't get it, she wouldn't overthink it; she'd just play first.</p>
<p>"Next up is chopping down trees to collect wood. Sure enough, no matter the game, 'to get rich, chop trees first' is always a golden rule."</p>
<p>Wang Han sighed with emotion, preparing to follow the prompt and chop down a couple of trees.</p>
<p>She surveyed her surroundings. She was currently standing on a hill, and the entire hill was made up of countless stacked blocks.</p>
<p>There were many trees on the hill and in the plains, and in the distance, she could see a vast ocean.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Wang Han ran towards the trees.</p>
<p>Arriving in front of a tree, she pressed the left mouse button, and then she saw the pixelated character's right hand repeatedly 'chopping' the tree at a ridiculously fast speed.</p>
<p>The right hand kept moving back and forth, and simultaneously, the block being 'chopped' quickly showed a network of cracks, then suddenly shattered and scattered, turning into very small blocks.</p>
<p>Controlling the character to walk over it, the small block then entered its inventory.</p>
<p>And in the item bar below, a wood icon option automatically appeared.</p>
<p>From the item bar, Wang Han selected the wood, then tried clicking the right mouse button on the ground, and a standard cube appeared before her.</p>
<p>"So that's how building things works in this game!"</p>
<p>"Each of these grids is a unit of building space."</p>
<p>Looking at the cubic wood that appeared before her, Wang Han instantly understood the basic building rules in Minecraft.</p>
<p>"The rest is turning wood into planks, then making a crafting table."</p>
<p>"After that, I can begin my building journey. What's so special about building in Creative Mode? Watch me build Lothric Castle in Survival Mode!"</p>
<p>She processed the wood she had into four planks, then crafted a crafting table and placed it down. Wang Han was full of fantasies about her future building journey.</p>
<p>"Hmm, now I can craft more things. Sticks combined with planks can make more tools."</p>
<p>Wang Han looked at the system's prompt and suddenly realized.</p>
<p>She wasn't entirely unfamiliar with this.</p>
<p>Just like in Don't Starve, many things need to be crafted.</p>
<p>For example, chopping trees requires an axe, and while you can 'chop' trees and dig dirt with bare hands in Minecraft, it's limited to trees, dirt, and gravel.</p>
<p>As for stone and coal, it's possible but takes a much longer time.</p>
<p>Using the wood she had, she crafted a crafting table, and then through the crafting table, she made tools like a wooden axe and a wooden pickaxe.</p>
<p>Immediately, another pop-up window appeared in the game.</p>
<p>"Eh! The new player tutorial is over already? Is this game that simple?"</p>
<p>Looking at the pop-up window, Wang Han was surprised to find that the game's new player guide had already finished.</p>
<p>It wasn't exactly over, as it still prompted her on what to do next.</p>
<p>And there were some text hints.</p>
<p>In reality, these were also Chen Xu's deliberate design.</p>
<p>To make players understand how Minecraft is played, and also to realize that various items needed to be crafted.</p>
<p>This was pretty much enough.</p>
<p>Additionally, there was an in-game crafting recipe book.</p>
<p>Of course, Chen Xu didn't just place all the items directly in front of players within the crafting recipe book.</p>
<p>It mostly contained recipes needed for the early game.</p>
<p>For example, torches, beds, and doors.</p>
<p>As for more advanced items, players would still need to gradually discover and unlock them in the game.</p>
<p>"When night falls, monsters will appear in the game, so you need a house and a bed. Lying on a bed at night allows you to instantly skip the night; if you don't have a bed, you'll have to wait slowly."</p>
<p>"Health and hunger work like in Don't Starve: you eat food."</p>
<p>Combining this with the recently appeared pop-up prompts, Wang Han quickly understood a basic rule of Minecraft.</p>
<p>"Let's chop some wood first and build a house before night comes."</p>
<p>Wang Han quickly made a decision.</p>
<p>As for a bed, she saw it required wool and planks to make.</p>
<p>Wool, naturally, comes from sheep.</p>
<p>But she looked around and didn't see any sheep creatures besides trees.</p>
<p>She did see some pigs, so she swiftly killed several pink little piglets with her axe and harvested some meat, at least ensuring she wouldn't starve.</p>
<p>Of course, it might also be because she hadn't ventured too far.</p>
<p>However, for Wang Han, the top priority was still chopping trees and building a house.</p>
<p>Lothric Castle was too ambitious a goal; she'd start with a cozy home.</p>
<p>After all, grand goals start with small steps.</p>
<p>With hopeful anticipation, Wang Han took her axe and began chopping trees.</p>
<p>Once she gathered a hundred or two hundred pieces of wood, she could find a good spot to build her cozy little nest.</p>
<p>Watching the increasing amount of wood in her item inventory and the decreasing durability of her wooden axe, Wang Han's lips curved into a joyful smile.</p>
<p>She didn't even think about why she wasn't digging for some stone to make a stone axe first to improve efficiency.</p>
<p>Because right now, only one thought occupied her mind: what kind of house she was going to build.</p>
<p>Would it be simple European style, classical European style, or traditional Chinese style and postmodern style?</p>
