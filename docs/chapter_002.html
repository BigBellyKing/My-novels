                <p>Chapter 2 Wow, Golden Legendary</p>
<p>Chen Xu looked at the virtual screen in front of him; the content displayed on it was very concise and clear.</p>
<p>A description button, something like a Gashapon machine filled with Gashapon, and a reward list next to it, detailing the rewards: 【Common Professional Skill Book】, 【Rare Professional Skill Book】, 【Special Item】.</p>
<p>Below that, there was also a line of numbers: 473451.</p>
<p>First, he clicked on the description, and Chen Xu quickly got the information he wanted.</p>
<p>Obviously, this system was his Golden Finger, no doubt about it.</p>
<p>A very simple gacha pull system, which of course required points.</p>
<p>The source of points was also very simple: when his works allowed players, audiences, readers, listeners, etc., to become immersed and feel happiness, joy, excitement, sadness, anger, fear, etc., they would gain corresponding Emotion Points.</p>
<p>Converting them into points allowed for gacha pulls, and currently, he had over 400,000 Emotion Points.</p>
<p>These were accumulated by Chen Xu in his previous life.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Chen Xu felt a bit of regret.</p>
<p>“If I had known this, why did I bother with Level Design and Plot Design back then? Event Planning would have been so much better,” Chen Xu said with a hint of regret.</p>
<p>Unlike in the Parallel World, where players directly cursed Game Designers when they were unhappy.</p>
<p>In his previous life, planners were just Scapegoats.</p>
<p>Favorite character's Numerical Design nerfed? Dog Planner!</p>
<p>Favorite character got written out (of the story)? Dog Planner!</p>
<p>Favorite game server crashed? Dog Planner!</p>
<p>Anyway, whether it was the planner's fault or not, cursing them was always safe.</p>
<p>“100,000 for one pull? A ten-pull for 1,000,000 with no discount is bad enough, but they don't even give a free pull anymore? Even Pig Factory games aren't as exploitative as you!” Chen Xu had originally thought he had quite a lot of points, but he fell silent when he saw the gacha pull numbers.</p>
<p>So, with over 400,000 points, he could only do four single pulls in total?</p>
<p>Although he complained verbally, Chen Xu's hands didn't stop; he immediately started pulling.</p>
<p>He cleanly pulled the joystick four times, and Chen Xu watched as the Gashapon machine rattled, dropping four Gashapon.</p>
<p>Then, a burst of golden light erupted from the four eggs.</p>
<p>Originally, Chen Xu hadn't expected to get anything good, after all, he only had four chances.</p>
<p>And there were only three possible items from the Gashapon.</p>
<p>But now?</p>
<p>‘Wow! Golden Legendary!’</p>
<p>Chen Xu added a voiceover in his mind, his face full of anticipation.</p>
<p>And then...</p>
<p>Common Professional Skill Book <em>2, Rare Professional Skill Book </em>1, Memory Capsule *1.</p>
<p>Looking at the four items in front of him, Chen Xu was utterly speechless.</p>
<p>This damn golden light was just a simple unboxing... no, it should be an egg-opening effect?</p>
<p>System, you're really something!</p>
<p>Chen Xu grumbled inwardly, but his hand still moved to tap the Common Professional Skill Book.</p>
<p>Next, Chen Xu saw the skill book transform into a cluster of purple, star-like light points that merged into his body, along with a prompt.</p>
<p>‘Plot Design +1’</p>
<p>As the purple light surged in, Chen Xu felt his thoughts become incredibly clear, and he seemed to understand some of his previous arrangements for story pacing.</p>
<p>This feeling was quite strange, just like when he used to do math problems in school, racking his brains over a question without success.</p>
<p>But upon seeing a relevant mathematical formula, he would suddenly be enlightened.</p>
<p>Then Chen Xu tapped the other two books.</p>
<p>‘Music +1, Painting Skill +5’</p>
<p>Music was a Common Professional Skill Book, while Painting Skill was a Rare Professional Skill Book.</p>
<p>The degree of increase was different; as for whether it was due to different categories or simply numerical values, he didn't know.</p>
<p>After all, he didn't have that many points to experiment and conclude.</p>
<p>Finally, Chen Xu looked at the last item he had obtained.</p>
<p>‘Memory Capsule: After use, can excavate deep-seated memories within 1 hour.’</p>
<p>Looking at the Memory Capsule, Chen Xu showed a surprised expression.</p>
<p>This is good!</p>
<p>This was equivalent to a temporary Photographic Memory.</p>
<p>In his previous life, as a Gaming Industry Professional, Chen Xu had played countless games, and not just played, but also researched them.</p>
<p>Taking the renowned game The Last of Us as an example, ordinary players would exclaim 'Wow, awesome!' 'Ah, scary!' 'No, I'm dead!'</p>
<p>But for a Gaming Industry Professional like Chen Xu, it required multi-faceted thinking and research.</p>
<p>For example, why was the story told in this manner, whether the monster distribution was reasonable, why the map and related cover were placed in a certain way, and how to subtly hint at hidden details for players to discover.</p>
<p>So with this Memory Capsule, Chen Xu could now reconstruct some past games in his mind to the greatest extent.</p>
<p>The Memory Capsule was temporarily placed in his item inventory; Chen Xu planned to save it for later.</p>
<p>Before starting the development of his first game, there was still some preparatory work to be done.</p>
<p>For instance, understanding the use of the Official Game Engine, researching the relevant game market, identifying mainstream game types at the current stage, and deciding which platform to release the game on when it launched.</p>
<p>All of these required advance preparation.</p>
<p>“Hmm, let me take a look!” Closing the system, Chen Xu sat in front of his computer, typing on the keyboard, searching for the content he wanted.</p>
<p>First, he checked out the game engine tools in the Parallel World.</p>
<p>Because he had previously helped game companies with outsourced Concept Art Production.</p>
<p>Chen Xu also had the Official Game Engine software on his own computer and had already registered an account.</p>
<p>In the Parallel World, this area was relatively mature.</p>
<p>For example, Concept Art, modeling, Music, and even Voice Actors could all be found through the platform within the game engine.</p>
<p>“Hmm, it's not very difficult, nor is it complicated, it's just that the resources are too scarce.”</p>
<p>Chen Xu browsed through the introduction video in fast-forward mode, and at the same time, he searched online for corresponding text introductions.</p>
<p>He now had a general understanding of game engines; they weren't too difficult to get started with.</p>
<p>Next was the platform aspect. The flourishing development of the Cultural Industry also brought about a crackdown on piracy, and games developed using game engines technically eliminated piracy entirely.</p>
<p>Of course, no piracy was good, but industry competition was also quite intense.</p>
<p>As for game platforms, they weren't much different from his previous life, with both domestic and international ones.</p>
<p>However, unlike his previous life where foreign platforms dominated, in the Parallel World, foreign platforms didn't have such a huge influence; instead, domestic game platforms were mainstream.</p>
<p>This was mainly because, unlike in his previous life where game blood in domestic games was either green or gray and skeletons had to have flesh, Real-Name Authentication was fully widespread in the Parallel World, and cultural products also had a corresponding Rating System.</p>
<p>For example, games like The Witcher 3 and GTA from his previous life would have essentially a 0% chance of passing review, but in the Parallel World, they could be fully approved, though they would definitely be rated 18R.</p>
