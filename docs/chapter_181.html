                <p>Chapter 280: Official Release (6th update, requesting subscriptions and monthly passes)</p>
<p>Online discussions like 'Death to Cliffhanger Authors' and other various opinions weren't given much attention by Chen Xu or the Nebula Games team.</p>
<p>This was already somewhat of a habit for Nebula Games.</p>
<p>That is, to focus solely on making games.</p>
<p>As for the various comments from players online, they weren't to be overly concerned with; they would only be addressed after the game's release.</p>
<p>During the game development phase, the main focus was on actual game development.</p>
<p>Of course, at this stage, <em>Warcraft</em> still hadn't integrated its map editor or the subsequent map editor community.</p>
<p>However, all relevant settings for the entire game were essentially complete.</p>
<p>Various servers for multiplayer mode had already been set up.</p>
<p>At the same time, the corresponding RANK score matching system had also been perfected.</p>
<p>Regarding maps, matchmaking and ranked play were divided into two modes.</p>
<p>The matchmaking maps were relatively numerous; Chen Xu had currently created about 15 of them.</p>
<p>As for ranked maps, because team composition balance had to be considered, Chen Xu only selected some classic tournament maps from his previous life, such as Twisted Meadows (TM), Turtle Rock (TR), Lost Temple (LT), King's Realm (TS), Echo Isles (EI), and Gnoll Wood (GW).</p>
<p>And in fact, even these maps weren't perfectly balanced.</p>
<p>For example, Turtle Rock (TR) could be said to be the Night Elves' home turf, because on this map, most neutral monsters were sea turtles, and sea turtles had a passive skill: melee units would take a certain amount of reflected damage when attacking them. The Orcs' main firepower came from melee units, which put them at a significant disadvantage when expanding, joining online games, or farming treasures. In contrast, the Night Elves mostly used ranged units, supplemented by the Druids of the Talon's Faerie Fire skill (armor reduction), giving them a natural advantage.</p>
<p>However, on the Lost Temple (LT) map, it would become the Orcs' home turf, as the map featured a structure called the Fountain of Life. Approaching it would continuously restore health, and Orc footmen had the highest health among all races, acting as robust tanks. Therefore, fighting near the fountain would give them an advantage, and they could clear the fountain early to gain generous experience and valuable treasures.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this map lacked a tavern, meaning certain Human tactics couldn't be implemented against Orcs, allowing Orcs to better leverage their prime advantage period.</p>
<p>It could be said that each map had its own unique characteristics, which gave players in Chen Xu's previous life a very distinct perspective on <em>Warcraft</em>: there were no unbalanced races, only unbalanced maps.</p>
<p>This was also an inevitable situation, as each of the four races had its own distinct features.</p>
<p>Therefore, for ranked play, Chen Xu also implemented a BAN/PICK function.</p>
<p>Before the game, both players would select their respective races, then proceed to BAN/PICK maps. They could BAN one map they didn't want to play, and then a map would be drawn from the remaining map pool.</p>
<p>After finishing some subsequent planning, Chen Xu stretched and walked out of his office.</p>
<p>In the break area, since the game's development work was temporarily finished, everyone in the team was relatively relaxed.</p>
<p>And the team members had also entered a 'new love, old forget' mode, no longer incessantly playing <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> but instead starting to play <em>Warcraft</em>.</p>
<p>"Oh no, pull your Peasants!"</p>
<p>"Don't block the choke point!"</p>
<p>"Throw down Dust of Appearance!"</p>
<p>"How can I help you with this!"</p>
<p>Yang Xin, Ruan Ningxue, Qin Yi, and Lin Tao sat side-by-side.</p>
<p>Human, Orc, Night Elf, and Undead, each person took one race, leaving none out.</p>
<p>Their opponent, however, was an Orc player.</p>
<p>At this very moment, a Level 6 Blademaster was using Bladestorm to slaughter them.</p>
<p>And after the Blademaster finished Bladestorm, without waiting for the Mountain King's hammer to strike, it immediately activated Wind Walk and vanished.</p>
<p>"Oh, Sister Xin, with your operation, that Blademaster has already run who knows how far away after reappearing, and you only now threw down Dust of Appearance."</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah, we've been fighting for so long, Sister Xin, how is it that your entire fortune is only one Mountain King and eight Riflemen and two Knights!"</p>
<p>"Indeed, Sister Xin, aren't you already Tier 3? You could even recruit two heroes, why aren't you doing that?"</p>
<p>Listening to her colleagues, Yang Xin's face flushed red at the computer.</p>
<p>"Honestly, I definitely can't recruit those heroes; I can't control them all, and they split experience when leveling up!"</p>
<p>"As for why I have so few units, haven't you seen my base? So many Guard Towers, whoever comes will die!"</p>
<p>Ruan Ningxue glanced at Yang Xin's screen, a little speechless: "Sister Xin, these heroes have high attack and many powerful skills! I'm telling you, it doesn't have to be that complicated. Select all your units and A-move, then just control the hero you want to play most. The regular units will attack automatically anyway."</p>
<p>As a seasoned <em>Warcraft</em> player, Ruan Ningxue imparted her A-move secret technique.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, do you think I'm right?" At this moment, Ruan Ningxue also noticed Chen Xu walking over and asked.</p>
<p>"Hmm... for beginners, it's probably best to start by mastering one hero, then moving on to heroes and units, then multiple units, and finally focusing on macro." Chen Xu thought for a moment and said something that sounded useful yet also somewhat unhelpful.</p>
<p>After all, if he played himself, he knew how, but when it came to teaching others, he was completely at a loss.</p>
<p>And the fact that these four people were fighting one maddening AI opponent for so long, and from the state of the battle, it seemed they might not even win, was a bit surprising to him.</p>
<p>"By the way, Mr. Chen, how are the pre-order sales for <em>Warcraft</em>?" Qin Yi asked, thinking of something.</p>
<p>Hearing Qin Yi's words, the others also looked at Chen Xu with concern.</p>
<p>Everyone was quite interested in this aspect.</p>
<p>Because <em>Warcraft</em> was arguably Nebula Games' biggest investment to date.</p>
<p>Mainly because the CGs were incredibly expensive.</p>
<p>And the modeling was even done to the standard of a general RPG.</p>
<p>How could it not be a money sink?</p>
<p>"You're all aware of the game's quality, why worry about sales?" Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>But he still revealed some information to them.</p>
<p>"Overseas, we didn't adopt a pre-order model because there are still some issues with approvals, so it will probably launch about a week after the domestic release. But domestic pre-order sales have already exceeded 3 million. Achieving the goal of recouping costs on the first day might be a bit difficult, but making a profit within the first week isn't a problem, and that's even excluding overseas sales." Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Hearing this number, everyone was elated.</p>
<p>This figure wasn't Nebula Games' best; <em>Minecraft</em> still held that record, followed by <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>.</p>
<p>But it was clearly a huge success.</p>
<p>The game's inherent quality, content, and now its sales also gave them a strong morale boost.</p>
<p>This time, everyone in the team was full of confidence, believing that <em>Warcraft</em> would undoubtedly become a game that was both critically acclaimed and commercially successful, and would redefine the concept of RTS games!</p>
<hr />
<p>November 15th, <em>Warcraft</em> officially released!</p>
<p>After the previous trial demo, the popularity of <em>Warcraft</em> was unmatched.</p>
<p>On the official Weibo account, 'Fall of Lordaeron' and 'Arthas' even became trending topics.</p>
<p>On video platforms, many streamers created mixed edits of <em>Warcraft</em>'s CG cinematics, also garnering very high view counts.</p>
<p>For players, whether they were drawn in by the story or by the unique gameplay.</p>
<p>They were clearly already eager to experience this true RTS masterpiece.</p>
