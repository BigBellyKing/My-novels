                <p>Chapter 55: Matryoshka-Style Spread</p>
<p>“Is it really that exaggerated? I'd like to see what magic this <em>Outlast</em> possesses!”</p>
<p>In a residential community in the Imperial Capital, a muscular tough guy, 1.92 meters tall, bare-chested with a crew cut, sat in front of his computer. The tough guy was named Song Ren, and at this moment, he was looking at information in a certain forum with a skeptical expression.</p>
<p>Uniformly, everyone was saying how terrifying <em>Outlast</em> was. He had always been uninterested in horror games. It was just that knowing this horror game was made by the designer of the previous <em>To the Moon</em> sparked some curiosity in him.</p>
<p>After all, despite his imposing appearance, as the saying goes: a tiger in the heart, yet smelling roses with care. On the outside, he was a pure tough guy, but even tough guys have moments of tears; previously, when he played <em>To the Moon</em>, he shed a copious amount of tears. Therefore, he still paid some attention to Nebula Games and the designer Chen Xu.</p>
<p>In addition, recently, this game called <em>Outlast</em> seemed quite popular, so he decided to give it a try. A horror game, could it really be that scary?</p>
<p>Driven by curiosity, Song Ren purchased and installed the game, then launched it.</p>
<p>“Heh… just a show?”</p>
<p>In front of Mount Massive Asylum, Song Ren was brimming with confidence.</p>
<p>“Heh… that's it?!”</p>
<p>From climbing the shelves to the lights in the room going out, Song Ren's face showed disdain.</p>
<p>“Hiss… just a door jump scare, nothing to be afraid of.”</p>
<p>As the door opened, a corpse lunged out, giving Song Ren a slight fright.</p>
<p>“Wait… don't come any closer!!”</p>
<p>When the patient in the wheelchair in the lobby wanted a 'hug of love,' Song Ren's face turned ashen.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>An hour later, Song Ren leaned back in his chair, breathing heavily. At this moment, he clearly felt his heart pounding. Thump-thump, strong and powerful, all due to the fright from the recent scenes. Looking at the curtains next to him, he silently got up and pulled them open, letting the sun into the room.</p>
<p>“Sunshine… it's so good!”</p>
<p>Looking at the sunlight outside, and at the monitor displaying the store interface after he had exited the game, Song Ren slowly exhaled. He had to admit one thing: he had lost, completely and utterly. Thinking of his recent game experience, Song Ren, leaning in his chair and gazing at the bright sun outside, still felt his legs a little weak.</p>
<p>However, Song Ren suddenly thought of something. After recovering from the recent fear, he silently opened his phone, found his friend's account, and sent a message.</p>
<p>“Old Zhang, I found a super fun game, it's really exciting! It's incredibly thrilling to play, I strongly recommend you try it too.”</p>
<p>“It's <em>Outlast</em>, the new work by the designer of <em>To the Moon</em>. What type? Parkour and puzzle-solving, I must say it’s super stimulating!”</p>
<p>After sending it, Song Ren took a deep breath, then gazed out at the scenery beyond the window. Thank goodness, thank goodness he played this game in broad daylight!</p>
<p>Leaning back in the chair in his room, about half an hour passed. Then, his phone on the desk rang. A person named Old Zhang in his contacts sent a message. A simple sentence, along with three exclamation marks expressing his inner excitement—‘Holy shit, you bastard!!!’</p>
<p>Seeing this message, Song Ren, leaning in his chair, laughed out loud. The previous fear completely faded away at this moment. Because in his mind, he had already imagined how the other party must have been startled.</p>
<p>After laughing, he saw his monitor screen still lit up; his account on the game platform was still on <em>Outlast</em>'s entry interface. After a moment of silence, Song Ren quietly closed the platform.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>There were many, many more players like Song Ren. Initially, these players learned about <em>Outlast</em> because of <em>To the Moon</em>. But more often, they found out about the game through forums in various gaming communities.</p>
<p>Just like Song Ren, these players, after seeing comments from other players, were filled with a sense of curiosity and a competitive spirit. How scary could a horror game possibly be? Is it really that big a deal? Aren't these just advertising trolls?</p>
<p>With such thoughts, these players all planned to play the game themselves and then post screenshots of their completed game to the forums to show off. After all, many players, especially when it comes to courage, aside from those who truly know their limits, quite a few have an enigmatic confidence in themselves.</p>
<p>However, once they entered the game, they quickly understood what kind of game it truly was. Not to mention the later content, just the initial parts had already scared away a large number of players.</p>
<p>Some players, full of ambition, entered the game only to be deterred at the very entrance of Mount Massive Asylum. Others were deterred during the first door jump scare or when they encountered the Fat Guy.</p>
<p>Of course, even more players were deterred in the basement, facing the pitch-black environment where they couldn't see their own hand, and being chased by a madman wielding a spiked plank.</p>
<p>Naturally, a portion of players gritted their teeth and persevered. However, after they repaired the generator and the Priest gave them an injection, entering the prison section, they realized that what came before was merely an appetizer!</p>
<p>Of course, within the game, they were deterred at different stages. But after playing, one action they all took was common. That was, their posts appeared on game forums, either recommending or warning other players.</p>
<p>It was like a matryoshka doll, one nested inside another. After all, if I got scared, then I might as well trick as many as I can. Others should feel the same way I do!</p>
<p>The barrage of information left some later players completely bewildered, unable to comprehend what kind of horror game <em>Outlast</em> truly was. Because some, to make their claims more convincing, deliberately took screenshots of less horrifying scenes.</p>
<p>However, others spoke in great detail, stating that <em>Outlast</em> was extremely terrifying. More and more accounts also attracted subsequent players who learned about <em>Outlast</em>, who then eagerly plunged into the game one after another.</p>
<p>Just like a relay race, where the person ahead reaches the finish line and then passes the baton to the next athlete. But the spread among <em>Outlast</em>'s player base was even wider.</p>
<p>Because the player community was continuously expanding, this meant that the dissemination of information was also constantly growing. Initially, for relevant directions and topic content, Chen Xu's side still needed to subtly guide and appropriately create memes for the players.</p>
<p>But as more and more players peed their pants in Mount Massive Asylum, Nebula Games' capital no longer needed to provide guidance. The players' spontaneous discussions were already enough to create hot topics, fermenting little by little like a prairie fire and continuing to expand its influence.</p>
