                <p>Chapter 43: I Think I'm a 'Warrior of Love'</p>
<p>The awards ceremony for the Game Department's Sci-Fi Game Design Competition was held at the Game Department in Modu.</p>
<p>Specifically, the venue was the conference hall of the Modu Game Department building.</p>
<p>Though called an awards ceremony, it didn't truly live up to the word 'ceremony' at all.</p>
<p>Even during the National Day holiday, there were still quite a few staff members inside the Game Department.</p>
<p>It was unclear whether they were permanent employees or regular contract workers.</p>
<p>There was no fancy setting; the Game Department staff taking photos and samples primarily used their phones.</p>
<p>However, at the entrance of the Game Department, there were quite a few gaming media outlets with signs and cameras on their shoulders.</p>
<p>But these gaming media outlets mostly just took photos from a distance; no one stepped forward to interview.</p>
<p>After all, it was just starting. Even if they wanted to interview, they would wait until the designers had finished participating in the official event inside the Game Department.</p>
<p>Although it was quite simple, Chen Xu, participating in this event for the first time, found it quite interesting.</p>
<p>It was only half past one now; he had been informed earlier that it wouldn't officially start until two o'clock.</p>
<p>Following the staff, he arrived at the temporarily converted conference hall, which was quite spacious.</p>
<p>The entire conference room was decorated in a reddish-brown and white style, tiered like an amphitheater.</p>
<p>The chairs were arranged in two main sections, with a large horizontal table serving as the main podium. On either side of the background were vibrant red national flags, and directly above the center was the national emblem.</p>
<p>At each seat in the conference room, there was a plastic stand-up card with the names of the various Game Designers written on it.</p>
<p>Soon, Chen Xu saw his seat, a spot in the first row against the wall, and someone was already seated next to it.</p>
<p>“You must be Chen Xu? 'To the Moon' truly deserved to win first place.” Meng Zuo, making space for Chen Xu to enter, had a faint smile on his face, but his heart was incredibly conflicted.</p>
<p>To say he wasn't resentful would be a lie.</p>
<p>But to speak of hatred, that was out of the question.</p>
<p>In fact, he even admired Chen Xu a little; after all, he had played 'To the Moon' himself and had been deeply moved by it.</p>
<p>“Teacher Meng? I've long admired your reputation. I'm also a big fan of 'Galaxy Heroes,' especially the level design in Chapter Three—it's truly outstanding.” Hearing the other party speak and glancing at the card in front of him, Chen Xu extended his right hand with a smile.</p>
<p>“Oh, no, no, the narrative of 'To the Moon' is what's truly perfect, and your previous game, 'Undertale,' was even more astonishing.” Meng Zuo shook Chen Xu's hand, subconsciously engaging in polite flattery, but then he quickly realized something.</p>
<p>Why did this scene feel so familiar to him?</p>
<p>It was as if it was exactly the same as the scenario he had imagined in his mind a month ago!</p>
<p>Except the roles of protagonist and supporting character seemed a bit off.</p>
<p>Releasing Chen Xu's hand, Meng Zuo fell silent.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu had no time to notice at this moment that he had unintentionally 'wounded' the innocent heart of a fellow designer.</p>
<p>Because some designers nearby, noticing the commotion, came over to talk to Chen Xu.</p>
<p>What surprised Chen Xu was that some of these designers were quite gregarious and showed great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>After some probing, Chen Xu figured it out.</p>
<p>Although these people didn't know him, they all shared a common characteristic.</p>
<p>That was, they had all been publicly attacked online by Zhong Mei before.</p>
<p>Only, they hadn't directly confronted Zhong Mei like Chen Xu did.</p>
<p>They had been unfairly stepped on and had their popularity exploited.</p>
<p>And Chen Xu, through his previous actions, had effectively vented some anger on their behalf.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since Chen Xu had now secured the top spot in this Game Design Competition, it was natural that many designers proactively came to introduce themselves.</p>
<p>After all, everyone was in the gaming industry; having more friends meant more opportunities.</p>
<p>His phone now held a bunch of designers' phone numbers, and he had joined several small designer groups on his messaging app.</p>
<p>While everyone was chatting, the leaders of the Game Department soon arrived in the conference room.</p>
<p>Before coming, Chen Xu had also done his homework.</p>
<p>Chen Xu was well aware of the various leaders in the Game Department, knowing there would certainly be plenty of opportunities to interact with them in the future.</p>
<p>The award ceremony officially began, with Yang Chen, the head of the Modu Game Department, taking the stage to deliver a speech. He was a middle-aged man around fifty, lean, tall, wearing gold-rimmed glasses, fitting the image of a traditional intellectual.</p>
<p>The content of the speech was quite serious and formal.</p>
<p>After the speech concluded, it was time for the awards segment, Yang Chen said solemnly.</p>
<p>Amidst applause, Chen Xu walked forward with a smile. As the applause subsided, Chen Xu received a small red booklet representing the first prize and a small award medal from Yang Chen's hand.</p>
<p>Next was the acceptance speech. Chen Xu had already memorized it, having simply modified the acceptance speech template from last year's winners.</p>
<p>As for whether there would be any overlap in words later, he didn't care; after all, he was the first one to speak.</p>
<p>‘I thank all the leaders. I am greatly honored to receive first place in this Game Design Competition. Standing here at this moment, I am incredibly excited…’</p>
<p>As Chen Xu delivered his speech, the audience erupted in thunderous applause. However, Meng Zuo, who had been sitting next to Chen Xu, had a slightly subtle expression at this moment.</p>
<p>How could this acceptance speech be so similar to his?</p>
<p>After all the Game Designers had finished their speeches on stage, holding their certificates and wearing their medals, and each taking a photo in front of the Game Department staff, the event was essentially over.</p>
<p>Upon leaving the Game Department, the reporters who had been waiting at the entrance became less reserved, swarming around them.</p>
<p>However, the various media outlets primarily focused on Chen Xu, and also on Meng Zuo from NetDragon's Jianhuolei Studio.</p>
<p>After all, among this group, only those two were particularly newsworthy.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, may I ask, what are your thoughts on winning first prize this time?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, do you have any new game development plans after 'To the Moon'? Will it still be a warm-hearted game like 'To the Moon'?”</p>
<p>A group of reporters came forward with all sorts of questions.</p>
<p>However, it was clear that everyone was still quite restrained, and it wasn't an exclusive interview. If Chen Xu answered, essentially all outlets could publish the story; it just depended on who could get their draft out faster.</p>
<p>“Winning first prize was very unexpected and a great surprise. I never imagined the leaders would think so highly of 'To the Moon.' While I'm honored to receive this first prize, I also feel immense pressure. In the future, I will continue to contribute to the domestic gaming industry…”</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu's long-winded speech, the surrounding media grew depressed.</p>
<p>You're such a young designer, why do you talk so formally?</p>
<p>There's absolutely no sensational material!</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu's next words made them even more frustrated.</p>
<p>“As for new games, there's nothing on the horizon yet. Whether it will be a warm-hearted game, I can't say for sure right now. However, I personally enjoy developing this type of game, after all, I've always thought of myself as a 'Warrior of Love.'”</p>
