                <h2>Chapter 468: Mr. Chen Suffered a Huge Loss! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h2>
<p>As time progressed, many other game developers launched their new projects during this period.</p>
<p>For example, NetDragon's previous game, 'Shadow Operations: Communication Interrupted', had been in promotion since the New Year. However, they later chose not to launch it at the same time, mainly to avoid 'Uncharted' and Zeus's 'Element World'. After all, Nebula Games and Atari had too much momentum then, and NetDragon was quite afraid of not being able to compete.</p>
<p>Midway through, while Nebula Games was developing 'Assassin's Creed', this game also underwent a trial play, but the feedback wasn't good, leading to a delay. But this time, after its launch, NetDragon was dealt another heavy blow. Media and player ratings didn't even reach the passing score of 6. Compared to the first installment's mixed reviews, players collectively gave this one negative reviews, mainly due to the game's pacing and narrative. As an open-world game, it severely fragmented the story's presentation. Aside from the game's top-tier graphics, players described the gameplay and content as completely lacking any亮点 (highlights).</p>
<p>However, during this time, on Zeus's VR platform, a linear shooting action game called 'Undercover (Game)' was introduced by a game developer from Switzerland. It not only received extremely high media praise but also saw an explosion in sales, even surpassing 'Medieval: Deliverance', which Zeus had previously released. This game is a gang-themed action FPS linear game where the player takes on the role of an ordinary detective. One day, after work, the exhausted protagonist returns home only to find his house broken into by a group of drug addicts. Amidst his wife's and children's cries, gunshots ring out, and everyone but the protagonist falls in a pool of blood. This prompts him to vow to arrest every scum who manufactures and spreads drugs. He joins the Drug Enforcement Administration and takes on an undercover mission to infiltrate local gangs and criminal organizations. However, during one operation, he is framed for killing his partner, leading him to be hunted by both the police, representing justice, and the evil gangs. Coupled with excellent action, bullet-time shooting gameplay, and a superb story, the complex emotions brought by the intertwined black and white narratives made 'Undercover (Game)' a double success in both sales and reputation, which is no exaggeration.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, with the hot-selling 'Uncharted' trilogy DLC, many gaming industry professionals began to reflect: does an open-world game truly have to be superior? The previous 'Uncharted' had actually started this trend, but for most game designers, open-world was still believed to have great potential, after all, Nebula Games was an anomaly. But this time, the success of 'Undercover (Game)' and the failure of NetDragon's 'Shadow Operations: Communication Interrupted' made many game designers quietly start to reconsider.</p>
<p>Of course, these are considerations for professionals in the gaming industry. For ordinary players, this period has been incredibly joyful. Nebula Games' 'Assassin's Creed' and the 'Uncharted' trilogy, along with Zeus's high-scoring hit, excited many players. It wasn't long before Zeus's platform also released a high-scoring masterpiece. For a time, players on the Huanyu VR Platform and Zeus platforms were locked in intense competition, much like the console wars of a previous life.</p>
<p>Amidst this series of masterpieces, time quickly arrived at the end of October. Players then discovered that Nebula Games had announced new event news again.</p>
<p>This was the double holiday of Halloween and Double Eleven.</p>
<p>Many players were quite surprised, as Nebula Games usually didn't have many events during this period. For Halloween, it was mostly just joining in the fun without much active participation. After all, Halloween is a major Western holiday, and Nebula Games' platform's special offer periods, besides the four seasonal sales (spring, summer, autumn, winter), mostly included the National Day holiday, New Year's Sale, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and Christmas.</p>
<p>And now, Nebula Games was unprecedentedly adding a new special offer period?</p>
<p>Many players, looking at Mr. Chen and Nebula Games' official Weibo account, were in tears. Could they not give their wallets a day off? They had just bought 'Assassin's Creed' and the 'Uncharted' trilogy DLC, and now a platform special offer was here again. There were truly no coins left in their wallets!</p>
<p>Yet, even as they complained, these players were also quite excited about the upcoming event. Players are always like that, saying they'll never spend recklessly again, then instantly clearing their shopping carts. At the same time, this event was genuinely substantial, and unlike the simple and crude -90% green discount symbols of previous New Year's Sales, this event seemed to offer something more.</p>
<p>The entire special offer event was divided into three major parts.</p>
<p>First, there was nothing particularly special: discounts on Nebula Games' first-party titles and other third-party games. Of course, 'Assassin's Creed', 'Uncharted', and their DLC trilogy series were not included in this special offer.</p>
<p>As for the second part, it brought cheers from many players: a rebate event. Based on the amount players spent on the Nebula Games platform, they would receive 10% in tokens. These tokens could only be used to purchase games within the Nebula Games platform. Upon seeing this news, many veteran Nebula Games players nearly cried tears of joy. This was a first! They could actually get money back! Although this money couldn't be withdrawn, it could only be used within the Nebula Games platform. But that was enough!</p>
<p>However, there was a third point that surprised many players.</p>
<p>During the event period, Nebula Games would release a mysterious new game. It would have a VR version and a PC version, with the VR version priced at 88 Yuan and the PC version at 38 Yuan. Any player who completed the game would receive it for free, with the purchase price returned as tokens to the Nebula Games platform. Furthermore, depending on the platform they completed the game on, they would randomly receive a previously released Nebula Games title from that platform ('Assassin's Creed' and 'Uncharted', including their DLCs, were not on the list). At the same time, the game incorporated the Sword Search Event previously held by Atari. Throughout various scenes in the game, treasure fragments would randomly appear. After collecting all the fragments, players could dig up treasure at a designated location. The first 3,000 players would receive a 999 Yuan voucher, and the subsequent 3,001 to 30,000 players would receive a 399 Yuan voucher. The quotas for the VR platform and PC platform were calculated separately.</p>
<p>After reading the entire event, players were stunned.</p>
<p>"Holy cow, this event is pretty awesome!"</p>
<p>"Hahahaha, first time seeing money back! Got over 4000 tokens back, too bad I bought all of 'Uncharted' and 'Assassin's Creed', but at least these tokens are valid for a long time!"</p>
<p>"Exactly, Mr. Chen is really losing money this time! And the third event is quite interesting!"</p>
<p>"Completing it is essentially free, and you can even find easter eggs and dig for treasure? That's kinda cool!"</p>
<p>"Not just free, but you also get a random previously released game from the platform you completed it on, too bad 'Assassin's Creed' and 'Uncharted' aren't included."</p>
<p>"What does that matter? If I'm super lucky and get 'Red Dead Redemption', that's still a massive win!"</p>
<p>"True, this new game definitely needs to be played in VR! Mr. Chen's VR games are all big titles, and even ported ones like 'Monster Hunter: World' have made a lot of money!"</p>
<p>"Also, for the PC version, there are smaller games like 'To the Moon' and 'Undertale' that are 'add one more to their collection' titles. While classic, they're not cost-effective in terms of price."</p>
<p>Many players were excitedly discussing the event. And quite a few had already decided: they wanted both PC and VR versions! What's the big deal about completing it twice?</p>
<p>Of course, the VR version would definitely be completed. As for the 30,000 spots, most players didn't hold much hope. After all, while 30,000 spots seemed like a lot, there were so many players globally, who's to say it would be their turn? But the remaining benefits were things every player could get! The purchase amount was fully refunded as tokens after completion, and they could also randomly receive a VR game. Even if they already owned it, it could be converted into tokens they spent on other purchases. And besides, for 88 Yuan for a VR game, it would still be worth it just to enjoy the scenery inside!</p>
