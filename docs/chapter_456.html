                <p>Chapter 455: Where's the Paid Perspective?! I Paid for This! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Next, Song Ren saw Ezio standing on a wooden pole in front of the church roof.</p>
<p>The map of Florence was updated. Information like shops appeared on the map.</p>
<p>“Leap of Faith? And I can interact to jump down? Won’t I fall to my death?”</p>
<p>Song Ren wasn't too bothered by the map unlocking; after all, unlocking the map from a high vantage point wasn't anything new. What surprised Song Ren more was finding an interactive jump prompt in his vision after the map updated.</p>
<p>From such a great height, wouldn't he be flattened into a meat patty if he jumped straight down?</p>
<p>Song Ren looked down.</p>
<p>Hmm… this height would kill at least 20 Undead, maybe even more.</p>
<p>However, despite the extreme height, Song Ren didn't feel much discomfort at the moment. On one hand, he had activated Awakening Mode; on the other, he had been thoroughly trained in previous Uncharted games. This height was a piece of cake.</p>
<p>Without overthinking, Song Ren chose to interact with the Leap of Faith.</p>
<p>Ezio spread his arms and leaped forward.</p>
<p>Song Ren's perspective followed Ezio as he rapidly descended, the scenery on both sides rapidly blurred upwards in the night sky, and the whistling wind echoed around Song Ren, as if he were truly falling from a great height.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he had fallen countless times in Uncharted. Moreover, when Ezio performed the jump, it switched to a third-person view, and his graceful movements looked incredibly cool and stylish.</p>
<p>He executed a 360-degree spin in mid-air, finally landing squarely in a cart of hay.</p>
<p>At this point, Vieri, who had fought Ezio earlier and looked like the antagonist, also appeared, searching everywhere for Ezio with his subordinates, seemingly wanting to retaliate. Song Ren didn't pay attention to this, as it seemed like a standard city mob setup.</p>
<p>What caught Song Ren's attention was that Ezio, who had just performed a Leap of Faith, seemed completely unharmed. From such a high place, landing in a haystack without a scratch? That's unreasonable!</p>
<p>Song Ren grumbled inwardly. However, he still controlled Ezio to climb out of the haystack and run towards the mission location.</p>
<p>It wasn't a very long distance, and although it was night, there were quite a few pedestrians on the streets of Florence.</p>
<p>The pedestrians' attire fully displayed the characteristics of the Renaissance period, with all sorts of outfits. In a word, eccentric clothing.</p>
<p>In previous promotional trailers, many players had stated that Ezio's Assassin's uniform blending into the crowd without being recognized was completely unrealistic. But in reality, it was normal not to recognize him, because a distinctive feature of Renaissance clothing was that garments were divided into several independently structured components, which were then assembled to create a distinctive individual appearance. There were also various fabrics, so on the street, you could see that every character's attire was different. This was what astonished Song Ren the most; he truly didn't find any NPCs wearing identical outfits, at least not so far.</p>
<p>Moreover, unlike the periods with more unique German and Spanish styles, the fashion style on the Apennine Peninsula during this era primarily came from the fabrics. The textile industry and commercial trade were highly developed on the Apennine Peninsula, so for wealthy people, their clothing often blended woven cotton and velvet. Thus, the flashy appearance of the Assassin's uniform wasn't particularly conspicuous. Of course, the design was indeed cooler.</p>
<p>Song Ren, sighing with emotion, quickly arrived at the mission location: Vespucci Residence.</p>
<p>“Cristina!”</p>
<p>“Who is it?”</p>
<p>“It's me!”</p>
<p>“Ezio! I should have known.”</p>
<p>As Ezio called out, a window in the attic opened, and a beautiful woman in pajamas looked at him with surprise.</p>
<p>“May I come in?”</p>
<p>“Do as you please, but only for a minute,” Cristina said indifferently, turning around.</p>
<p>“A minute is enough,” Ezio smiled.</p>
<p>“Indeed,” Cristina's voice came from the second floor.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Ezio's expression stiffened: “Wait… that's not what I meant!”</p>
<p>Song Ren in the game couldn't help but be amused. As an adult, he understood instantly. At the same time, his mood improved significantly.</p>
<p>Indeed, it's a light and humorous game.</p>
<p>Controlling Ezio to climb to the second floor, Song Ren felt a little anticipation for what was to come.</p>
<p>The nimble Ezio climbed through the second-floor window, looked at Cristina sitting at the dressing table, smiled, and beckoned.</p>
<p>“Come here…”</p>
<p>Cristina shot Ezio a sideway glance, but still stood up from her stool and walked to Ezio's side.</p>
<p>Then, Song Ren's perspective switched to third-person, and an interactive prompt appeared in front of him.</p>
<p>“Holy crap! There's this part too!” Song Ren became a little excited watching the two embracing and kissing passionately in the game. Although Nathan and Elena had a kissing scene in Uncharted before, that was non-interactive, purely watching. But Assassin's Creed had corresponding interactions, and the sense of immersion immediately kicked in!</p>
<p>Ezio and Cristina kissed passionately in the game.</p>
<p>“Oh… Ezio.”</p>
<p>As the next interactive prompt appeared, Song Ren saw Ezio's hands started to get naughty in the game. Slowly reaching towards Cristina's clothes, at the same time, Song Ren's camera slowly moved outwards.</p>
<p>In Song Ren's view, he could clearly see Cristina's pale white back. Then, another prompt button appeared in the game, and Ezio picked up Cristina and walked towards the bed, where the two lay down.</p>
<p>But Song Ren was stunned because his camera had unknowingly moved outside the window in the game. And at that moment, Ezio in the game even turned his head and blew out the candle flame, instantly plunging the room into darkness.</p>
<p>A beautiful BGM melody began to play, covering Ezio's and Cristina's voices. He could neither see nor hear anything.</p>
<p>“Wait! I want a first-person perspective!”</p>
<p>“I paid for this! I want the paid perspective!”</p>
<p>Watching as the camera slowly shifted and night gradually turned into day, Song Ren was completely dumbfounded. He thought there would be some benefits! But this is all it was? Took off my pants just for this?</p>
<p>At the same time, Song Ren also noticed a small detail: from the moment Ezio climbed in until his camera perspective was moved out, exactly one minute seemed to have passed!</p>
<p>“So 'only one minute' was referring to me!?”</p>
<p>Song Ren in the game expressed his pained expressions, especially when he then saw Ezio being chased all over the streets by guards summoned by her father, which made him even more frustrated.</p>
<p>“I didn't get to see anything good! But when he's being hunted down, it's my turn to control him! That's not fair!”</p>
<p>He might complain, but Song Ren still controlled Ezio as he weaved through the streets and alleys of Florence. However, under a wanted status, the more he ran, the more pursuers he attracted.</p>
<p>“Oh, right, climb roofs!” Seeing a climbing spot nearby, Song Ren's eyes lit up. He went to the crates in the marketplace and climbed towards the rooftop. But Song Ren quickly discovered a crucial problem.</p>
<p>“Holy crap, you guys can climb roofs too?!” Song Ren was stunned, seeing the pursuers also climbing the buildings behind him. Fortunately, these pursuers weren't as fast as him at climbing roofs. When he reached the highest point, they lost sight of him, and Song Ren saw a yellow warning box appear on the mini-map. Clearly, he needed to run out of this warning box, just like the wanted status in Red Dead Redemption.</p>
<p>Looking around, Song Ren didn't see anywhere else to go, but the house he was on was right on the banks of the Arno River. Without much thought, Song Ren directly controlled Ezio to jump into the Arno River.</p>
<p>After swimming for a while, he waited a bit under the bridge before realizing the wanted status had been canceled. But then Song Ren found himself in a very awkward situation: he couldn't climb up this bridge. At least, he couldn't find a place to get ashore nearby.</p>
<p>“This isn't Assassin's Creed! This is clearly the unruly daily life of a rich second-generation,” Song Ren couldn't help but grumble inwardly. There was no paid perspective, he had to do all the running, and so far, forget being an Assassin, he was being chased like a dog. What else could he do now? Just swim, find a place to get ashore.</p>
