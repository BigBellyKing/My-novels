                <p>Chapter 236: Is This Really a Hunting Game? (Sixth Update, Please Subscribe and Vote for Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>Before the computer, Chen Xu rested his chin.</p>
<p>Since the decision had already been made to create <code>Monster Hunter: World</code>, he still needed to consider how exactly to go about it.</p>
<p>From a gameplay perspective, <code>Monster Hunter: World</code> was a very special game.</p>
<p>In other multiplayer games, there would always be some PVE elements.</p>
<p>But <code>Monster Hunter: World</code>, on the other hand, was a purely cooperative hunting game.</p>
<p>In <code>Dark Souls</code>, players could even invade other players' worlds.</p>
<p>Moreover, for many <code>Dark Souls</code> masters later on, the fun was essentially in PVP.</p>
<p>However, <code>Monster Hunter: World</code> contained no PVP content.</p>
<p>The game emphasized player teamwork and cooperative hunting of dragon-like creatures.</p>
<p>As for Demon Mode Dual Blades slashing teammates, charging Lances piercing friends, Light Bowguns blowing up a teammate's crotch, Heavy Bowguns penetrating a teammate's defense, or Great Hammer's three-charge home run, all the above scenarios were exceptions, absolutely not PVP content of the game.</p>
<p>From the game itself, whether it was the game's background content, <code>Monster Hunter: World</code> could be said to be a game with a very unique style.</p>
<p>Firstly, the core selling point of this game was its action system and a relatively realistic hunting experience.</p>
<p>These all served to create the overall hunting experience of the game.</p>
<p>In typical games, battles between players and bosses usually lasted a few minutes, at most ten minutes.</p>
<p>However, in <code>Monster Hunter: World</code>.</p>
<p>When facing powerful bosses, for most ordinary players.</p>
<p>A fierce battle lasting fifteen to twenty minutes was considered quite normal.</p>
<p>Of course, speedrunning masters, or <code>Grind Master</code>s who had already ground out a set of powerful equipment to bully smaller dragons, did not count.</p>
<p>Paired with the <code>AI</code>'s performance, Chen Xu believed it could showcase the immersion of hunting even better than <code>Monster Hunter: World</code> in his previous life.</p>
<p>Next was the game's class system.</p>
<p>Or rather, its weapon system.</p>
<p>The game had no distinctions like warriors or mages for classes.</p>
<p>Instead, it had different weapon classifications.</p>
<p>Just like how different weapons in <code>Dark Souls</code> had different attack methods.</p>
<p>In <code>Monster Hunter: World</code>, there were a variety of distinctly characteristic weapons for players to choose from.</p>
<p>At the same time, each weapon had different combo skills.</p>
<p>Much like a fighting game, players needed to execute specific input commands to successfully unleash weapon moves.</p>
<p>Of course, in actual operation, it wouldn't be like fighting games where players needed to memorize long move lists.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it wasn't impossible to play if one couldn't execute weapon combos.</p>
<p>It just meant one couldn't pull off very flashy maneuvers.</p>
<p>Additionally, regarding difficulty, compared to <code>Dark Souls</code>.</p>
<p><code>Monster Hunter: World</code> was much simpler.</p>
<p>Because the game would feature a gradually progressive difficulty pace.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, <code>Dark Souls</code> makes you get abused first and then slowly familiarizes you with the game.</p>
<p>Whereas Monster Hunter lets you familiarize yourself with the game before getting abused, which is considerably more humane.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <code>Monster Hunter: World</code> itself was a very replayable game.</p>
<p>Why was this the case?</p>
<p>When you've farmed for hundreds of hours and still haven't gotten a single Attack Jewel, you'll naturally understand why this game has such high replayability.</p>
<p>Because the game inherently possessed a 'grinding' attribute, but if it were just grinding, it wouldn't be enough to keep players engaged for such extended periods.</p>
<p>Ultimately, even when facing the same monster, each hunt was unique.</p>
<p>There would still be a different experience.</p>
<p>Changes in the battle environment, other bosses potentially intruding, unstable teammate factors during cooperative play, and the monster's own attack patterns.</p>
<p>All these factors ensured that every hunt could unfold differently, preventing it from being monotonous and dull.</p>
<p>The most crucial point, however, was that in <code>Monster Hunter: World</code>, there were actually quite a few clever strategies that allowed players, even if their skills weren't top-notch, to successfully complete the game as long as they understood its characteristics.</p>
<p>Of course, it wasn't completely brainless either.</p>
<p>After two continuous days, having largely completed the design <code>Concept Art</code> drafts for <code>Monster Hunter: World</code>, Chen Xu called Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, and others to the <code>conference room</code> for a meeting.</p>
<p>Everyone arrived early at the <code>conference room</code>, each excitedly discussing in low voices.</p>
<p>"I wonder what kind of hunting game <code>Mr. Chen</code> mentioned earlier it's going to be!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I feel like the setting should lean towards ancient times, with players primarily using weapons like spears and bows for hunting in nature."</p>
<p>"I'm more curious about how <code>AI</code> performance will manifest in hunting."</p>
<p>"Feeling a strange sense of anticipation!"</p>
<p>It was clear that everyone in the <code>conference room</code> had learned about the new game's hunting theme in the past two days, and they all looked full of anticipation.</p>
<p>Just then, Chen Xu pushed the door open and entered, and everyone quieted down.</p>
<p>Sitting at the head of the table, Chen Xu looked at everyone and said: "I believe you all already know some details about the new game, so I won't waste any more words."</p>
<p>"The main purpose of today's meeting is the development of the new game. Please look at the big screen."</p>
<p>As Chen Xu's words fell, the game title <code>Monster Hunter: World</code> appeared on the projector.</p>
<p>"First, let's briefly talk about the game's theme and direction."</p>
<p>"Regarding the theme, this is a hunting game, but the combat system will be quite unique, differing from other action games currently on the market."</p>
<p>"At the same time, within the game, we will create a relatively vast ecological world to showcase a characteristic of <code>AI</code> intelligence."</p>
<p>"Finally, the monsters players will hunt are primarily dragon-like creatures... well, these."</p>
<p>Chen Xu slid his finger across the touchpad of his laptop.</p>
<p>On the projector screen in the <code>conference room</code> appeared a colossal monster, with yellowish-green carapace, powerful wings, and limbs.</p>
<p>Its ferocious claws and sharp teeth made it look incredibly terrifying.</p>
<p>Beside it was an introduction to this monster: [Queen of the Land — Rathian]</p>
<p>Looking at the image on the screen, everyone was stunned.</p>
<p>The sense of shock brought by this wyvern was simply too powerful.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, in the game, players will not have class divisions; instead, there will be different weapons. Simply put, weapons will replace what are known as classes."</p>
<p>As Chen Xu continued his introduction, the images on the <code>conference room</code>'s projector screen also changed.</p>
<p>Great Sword, Long Bow, Dual Blades, Long Sword... a series of weapons appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>Of course, they all shared a common characteristic: all weapons were <code>melee weapon</code>s.</p>
<p>Looking at the depiction in the <code>Concept Art</code>, although the Hunter wearing leather armor held a large weapon, compared to the Rathian from before, it still felt like a younger brother.</p>
<p>Besides this, there were some unfinished sketches. For example, one sketch depicted a colossal <code>Ancient Dragon</code> with outstretched wings covered in thorns, and two horns on its head that were even more chilling.</p>
<p>"<code>Mr. Chen</code>, is the new game... a <code>Souls-like games</code>?" Qin Yi swallowed, asking the confusion in his heart.</p>
<p>Colossal dragon-like monsters, tiny Hunters, and <code>melee weapon</code>s.</p>
<p>Is this really a hunting game?</p>
<p>It's not going to be monsters hunting Hunters, is it?</p>
<p>Don't ask if there's more, just assume there is.</p>
