                <p>Chapter 231: Nebula Games Platform Transformation (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>On the official Weibo account, Chen Xu also announced in advance the news of the Minecraft mobile version and VR version.</p>
<p>Scheduled for release on March 31st.</p>
<p>Of course, this was mainly due to the somewhat special nature of April 1st.</p>
<p>That's why it was set for March 31st; otherwise, it would have been quite meaningful as a two-month anniversary for Minecraft's launch.</p>
<p>As for the pricing, it also pleasantly surprised many players.</p>
<p>The VR version was priced at 148 Yuan, and 29.9 USD overseas.</p>
<p>As for the mobile version, if a player purchased either the PC version or the VR version, it would be automatically activated.</p>
<p>Of course, if players stated they didn't want to buy the PC or VR versions and only wished to play the mobile version, they could also purchase it separately.</p>
<p>Priced at 28 Yuan. However, players who had already purchased the mobile version and wished to buy the PC or VR version would only need to pay the remaining balance.</p>
<p>This pricing strategy made countless players exclaim, "It's so good!"</p>
<p>Similarly, after announcing the news of the VR and mobile versions, Chen Xu didn't pay too much attention to it.</p>
<p>After all, with the PC version's sales figures, the VR version's sales couldn't possibly be too bad.</p>
<p>Moreover, compared to game prices on VR platforms, Minecraft, priced at 148 Yuan, could be said to be a cabbage-level price.</p>
<p>However, in contrast to Chen Xu's calm demeanor, other designers and media outlets in the entire gaming industry were fixated on this, paying immense attention to its data.</p>
<p>The next day, Nebula Games did not release the relevant data as it had with the PC version's Minecraft sales.</p>
<p>However, a third-party statistical company immediately compiled the figures.</p>
<p>The VR version of Minecraft sold 2.41 million copies domestically.</p>
<p>The mobile version of Minecraft sold 1.52 million copies domestically.</p>
<p>April Fool's!?</p>
<p>Many industry designers and media outlets who were paying attention were a bit bewildered.</p>
<p>The figures were simply a bit too unexpected.</p>
<p>The VR version's sales weren't particularly surprising.</p>
<p>According to data compiled by the Game Department, the current number of VR units in China is approximately 30 million.</p>
<p>However, in reality, this 30 million figure is certainly an underestimate.</p>
<p>The reason is that this data counts the activation volume of VR gaming pods.</p>
<p>Meaning, VR gaming pods that have been activated and used.</p>
<p>But the key is that not every player has purchased a gaming pod; VR experience stores and similar venues account for a significant portion.</p>
<p>While the gaming pods in these experience stores are fixed, the players who use them are different.</p>
<p>Therefore, the actual number of potential user players is far greater than this data suggests.</p>
<p>Previously, Minecraft on the PC platform had sold like crazy, and it still maintains extremely hot momentum.</p>
<p>The VR version, offering a better experience and not being particularly expensive, selling so many copies is not surprising.</p>
<p>What was truly surprising, however, was the mobile version.</p>
<p>This counts sales, not the number of players!</p>
<p>This means that over a million players had not purchased the PC version, and these are all entirely new player demographics.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>However, while the industry was filled with self-doubt, Chen Xu at Nebula Games was currently contemplating more important matters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on the display screen in front of Chen Xu, the current games under Nebula Games were shown.</p>
<p>Mirror (Game) (crossed out) Undertale, To the Moon, Overcooked (Chinese title), Sanguosha, Fall Guys, Outlast, Dark Souls, Valiant Hearts: The Great War, It Takes Two, Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame, as well as Don't Starve and Minecraft... hmm, a certain Big Hammer Game was temporarily excluded by Chen Xu.</p>
<p>As of now, the Nebula Games Platform has a total of twelve games it can showcase.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, these games also enjoy immense popularity among the player base.</p>
<p>For a game store, Nebula Games has actually been very successful, much like Blizzard's Battle.net in his previous life.</p>
<p>But for Chen Xu, he clearly had no intention of stopping there.</p>
<p>Simply being an integrated platform for its own games was never Chen Xu's goal; he had always aimed for comprehensive digital platforms like Steam Platform and GOG from his previous life.</p>
<p>102 million registered users, 23 million daily active users, 77 million monthly active users, with an average peak concurrent online users of 8.17 million.</p>
<p>This was primarily due to the recent popularity of Minecraft, which boosted Nebula Games' active user data.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, all these data points indicate one thing: Nebula Games has now developed into a game store with significant influence.</p>
<p>Now fully fledged, and the launch of Minecraft was originally part of this plan.</p>
<p>Including with the Marketing and Operations Department, Chen Xu had already discussed this aspect with Zhang Yida.</p>
<p>Now, leveraging the influence of Minecraft, Nebula Games could finally take this step.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>April 15th.</p>
<p>Although it was a Sunday, all employees of Nebula Games were at their respective posts today.</p>
<p>On major gaming media websites and in game communities, the trending topic was originally still Minecraft.</p>
<p>But soon, the top spot was taken by the term 'Nebula Games'.</p>
<p>Many players who opened the Nebula Games Platform, preparing to enter Minecraft,</p>
<p>As the platform opened, seeing the pop-up message, countless players were stunned.</p>
<p>'Effective immediately, Nebula Games Store will transition into a comprehensive digital game platform, allowing all game designers to publish games on the store and providing corresponding promotion and services for those games.'</p>
<p>'Including features such as cloud saves, user feedback, Workshop (modding platform), and store friend connections, while granting game designers on the platform sufficient autonomy, provided they comply with the rules.'</p>
<p>Of course, these games must first undergo relevant censorship and obtain publishing qualifications before they can be launched.</p>
<p>In simple terms, Nebula Games was transforming from an independent platform that solely ran its own games into a comprehensive distribution platform.</p>
<p>What further excited gaming industry designers were the sales terms of the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>In the Parallel World, just like most game stores in his previous life, the official game store took a 30% cut.</p>
<p>But this was the official store; for large channels like TengHua and NetDragon, it was entirely different.</p>
<p>If they were top-tier game designers or powerful developers, they would naturally get a 30% cut.</p>
<p>But what about the treatment for ordinary game designers and developers?</p>
<p>In his previous life, many people felt that the 30% cut taken by platforms like Steam and Google was very high.</p>
<p>However, for channels like some domestic mobile app stores, the split generally started at 50-50.</p>
<p>Want a 30% cut? No problem, you can list it on my platform, but I won't promote it; then it's a 30% cut. But if you want promotion and use my servers, then it's a 60% cut, okay?</p>
<p>Don't even complain about it being high, because some even more outrageous ones had a 70-30 split.</p>
<p>Developer 70%, channel 30%? What are you thinking?! Developer 30%, channel 70%!</p>
<p>Even more outrageous, you couldn't even control what operational methods your game should adopt.</p>
<p>What? You're saying that wouldn't be like begging on one's knees?</p>
<p>Exactly! If you put it that way, it really is like begging on one's knees, and for this, how many people wanted to kneel but couldn't even get the chance!</p>
<p>Compared to the major app channels in his previous life, the major channels in the Parallel World were also like this.</p>
<p>As for why so many designers were still willing:</p>
<p>There was no other way. Setting up their own platform and selling through an official website completely lacked the budget for promotion.</p>
<p>As for the official game store, while it had a considerable user base, when it came to recommendation slots and rotations, although there was some exposure, the algorithms were quite outdated.</p>
<p>After all, since it involved official bodies, they couldn't directly interfere due to market regulations.</p>
<p>Therefore, unless a game was a genuine blockbuster, it rarely became hugely popular on official platforms.</p>
<p>And yet, most games actually don't possess the qualities to become a huge hit; more often, they cater to the tastes of a specific segment of players.</p>
<p>So even if the channel providers took a high cut, they could at least ensure exposure.</p>
<p>Circumstances are stronger than people, so they could only gnaw on bones themselves, allowing the channels to eat meat and drink soup.</p>
<p>After all, if you're making money, begging on your knees is not shameful.</p>
<p>And now, what shocked gaming industry designers was that in the Nebula Games Store, the revenue-sharing terms Chen Xu offered were surprisingly 25%.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether they were large game developers or individual game designers, there was a uniform 25% cut taken for the platform's daily operations.</p>
<p>As soon as this news spread, it instantly caused a major upheaval in the gaming industry.</p>
