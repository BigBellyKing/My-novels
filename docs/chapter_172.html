                <h2>Chapter 271: A Game Company That Doesn't Make CG Is Not a Good Game Company! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h2>
<p>With the layered armor event and two new quests appearing in <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, and the Kingdom of Lordaeron on the official servers in <em>Minecraft</em>,</p>
<p>It quickly caused a huge stir among players.</p>
<p>Because they felt that Nebula Games was definitely hinting at something.</p>
<p>Although no substantial evidence could be provided,</p>
<p>From the style alone, it was entirely possible to guess.</p>
<p>In <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, whether it was the layered appearance weapons or the monsters like Frost Dragons and Chimeras, they were completely different from the original <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> monsters.</p>
<p>Of course, in terms of difficulty, it was moderate; most players could generally clear them with their own abilities.</p>
<p>The cheesing strategies that failed against Tempered monsters could also be used against Frost Dragons and Chimeras.</p>
<p>After all, there was no need for it to be too difficult. It was essentially a warm-up event, incidentally bringing players some new weapon layered appearances to keep things fresh.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Kingdom of Lordaeron in <em>Minecraft</em> also sparked a lot of discussion among players.</p>
<p>In terms of scale, there were actually already many magnificent structures built by players. For example, in previous multiplayer mode servers, players had built a Sky City and a Lava City, both of which were largely completed and clearly spectacular.</p>
<p>While the Kingdom of Lordaeron was exquisite, it was still some distance from being truly stunning, as players had seen many such creations. However, the key lay in its underlying meaning. After all, it appeared on an official server, and most of the building complexes on the official servers before this were related to Nebula Games.</p>
<p>The 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' and 'Forbidden City' were merely early building complexes created by Nebula Games for demonstration purposes. But what about this Kingdom of Lordaeron?</p>
<p>Searching through all of Nebula Games' released titles, there was no trace of it whatsoever.</p>
<p>So, many players came up with a bold guess:</p>
<p>This might be a new game that Nebula Games was currently developing.</p>
<p>Online players argued heatedly about this.</p>
<p>"There's only one truth, and that is the Kingdom of Lordaeron, along with the Frost Dragons and Chimeras, must be content from Nebula Games' new title!"</p>
<p>"That's unlikely, isn't it? <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> has only been out for a little over a month, and they already have a new game?"</p>
<p>"Why not? Nebula Games isn't a small workshop anymore."</p>
<p>"I still feel it's a bit of a long shot."</p>
<p>"But speaking of a new game, a fantasy theme is a given. After all, Nebula Games excels at making them. But what genre do you think it is? RPG, ARPG, or an action type like <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>?"</p>
<p>"I don't know the genre, but I do know Chen Xu is definitely going to pour his 'love' into the game again. I won't fall for it this time!"</p>
<p>"+1! Whether it's an RPG or action, that damn Chen Xu is simply poisonous. I never expected <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> to be about the monsters hunting <em>us</em>!"</p>
<p>"Heh heh, the two bros upstairs, stop fooling yourselves, okay? Your combined playtime for <em>Dark Souls</em> is over 2000 hours. Do you guys have eight livers for <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>? You've played 210 hours in such a short time since launch? Seriously, that's an average of seven hours a day, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"What can we do? The Attack Jewels just won't drop!"</p>
<p>"Exactly! Besides the one they gave us at the start, I haven't gotten a single one yet!"</p>
<p>"To the two upstairs, if I said I got three in less than 100 hours, you wouldn't get angry, would you? Bros!"</p>
<p>"Spear the Euro player, get out!"</p>
<p>Online players discussed the news about <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> and <em>Minecraft</em> heatedly, while also flooding Chen Xu's and Nebula Games' official Weibo accounts with messages.</p>
<p>They hoped to get some accurate answers.</p>
<p>However, for now, Chen Xu had not responded.</p>
<p>He wanted to let everyone discuss it more; the hype hadn't fully ignited yet, and adding fuel to the fire now would be a bit premature.</p>
<p>So, Chen Xu was currently stable at Nebula Games, focused on the development of <em>WarCraft</em>, or rather, the design of its CG shots.</p>
<p>The framework for <em>WarCraft</em> was gradually being built.</p>
<p>For outsourcing, it was still the same few companies that had previously collaborated with Nebula Games.</p>
<p>For Chen Xu, he preferred to re-collaborate with companies he had worked with before.</p>
<p>After all, it was more convenient, including the handover between employees from both sides. With prior experience, efficiency would also significantly improve.</p>
<p>Of course, re-collaborating with previously partnered companies was also based on their ability to meet Chen Xu's requirements.</p>
<p>Otherwise, no matter how cheap or discounted the price, Chen Xu would not continue to cooperate with them. After all, if the quality cannot be guaranteed, what good is a low price?</p>
<p>Chen Xu also provided detailed annotations for the modeling dimensions within the game, some special requirements, and the action design.</p>
<p>Therefore, the other party's efficiency in both art asset modeling and action was relatively high.</p>
<p>Because they could clearly understand what the client's requirements were.</p>
<p>Although it was an RTS game, Chen Xu had very high expectations for it.</p>
<p>The rest was the CG production within the game, because a game company that doesn't make CG is not a good game company!</p>
<p>Regarding storyboarding, that was typically the CG company's job.</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu planned to design it himself. After all, his current abilities were not bad, and with the various presentations from <em>WarCraft</em> in his previous life, Chen Xu understood better than anyone else what kind of actions, visuals, and expressions he wanted to convey.</p>
<p>As for why he chose CG instead of real-time rendering?</p>
<p>It's simple: for better visual effects.</p>
<p>Many games, both in this world and in his previous life, used real-time rendering for cutscenes.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage of this approach was cost-saving.</p>
<p>Because it utilized only the game's own resources, and with the development of game graphics technology, the effects could be said to be absolutely not bad. However, if you looked closely, you could still clearly see the gap between CG and real-time rendering. Of course, this refers to technology from the same era; comparing CG animation from years ago with real-time rendering from years later would be disingenuous.</p>
<p>For example, the <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em> CG produced by Blizzard in his previous life, even a decade later, could still be considered cutting-edge.</p>
<p>Chen Xu was very serious about <em>WarCraft</em>. With no shortage of money now, he naturally aimed for the best.</p>
<p>Of course, not the entire game would be made with CG animation. That would probably take ten or twenty hours, and Chen Xu truly couldn't handle that. After all, CG is really expensive, and there have been game companies that almost went bankrupt because of CG.</p>
<p>For example, in his previous life, if one were to name a CG animation company hindered by games, many would say Blizzard.</p>
<p>But in terms of CG, Blizzard could only barely be considered second; the true elder brother was Square Enix, the developer of the <em>Final Fantasy series</em>.</p>
<p>Blizzard said, "I spare no expense to make CG animation."</p>
<p>Square Enix said, "What's that? I'm too lazy to even make CG animation; if I'm going to do it, I'll make a CG movie. I'd risk my life for a CG movie!"</p>
<p>A major CG movie, <em>Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within</em>, almost bankrupted the company. If that didn't work, maybe marry an honest person and form a new family with a rich man. After many years, a new idea sparked. First, they tried a 10-minute CG to test the waters. "Oh, it seems to be well-received!"</p>
<p>"So, shall we continue?" This time, they changed their strategy: "Let's play the DVD market, not the big screen." "Oh, we made a fortune!" This CG movie was the famous <em>Advent Children</em>.</p>
<p>Then they got carried away. Square Enix declared, "What do other game developers do for game promotion? Promotional videos? That's weak! We'll go all out with a full-length CG movie!" And then? They almost lost their shirts.</p>
<p>So, while Nebula Games is rich now, doing full CG animation for the entire game would still be too much.</p>
<p>Chen Xu's idea was to choose critical plot points and major scenes in the game for CG production, such as Arthas's transformation, the final epic battle between Illidan and Arthas, Jaina's display of deep father-daughter affection leading to Rexxar killing Daelin in the Battle of Theramore Isle...</p>
<p>Even if only these were made, the cost would still be incredibly exaggerated, but in Chen Xu's view, it was well worth it. Once the <em>WarCraft</em> IP is established, there will be plenty of ways to make money in the future.</p>
