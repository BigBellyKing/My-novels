                <p>Chapter 171: If the Heart Is There, the Dream Is There! (Sixth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Perhaps like Song Ren, everyone thought this area was for staff and cosers' props, so there was no one around.</p>
<p>Song Ren was the first to arrive.</p>
<p>With the staff member's introduction, he sat into the fishbowl sofa and zipped it up. From the outside, it looked as if half his body was contained within a water tank.</p>
<p>“Is it really a new game!?”</p>
<p>He picked up the hammer, Song Ren's eyes widened in surprise.</p>
<p>Because as he picked up the hammer, a display appeared on the monitor in front of him.</p>
<p>Then a Nebula Games LOGO floated past.</p>
<p>A valley interface appeared, with a hammer hooked onto a rock beside it.</p>
<p>Above it were three UI options: 'Enter Game', 'Options', 'Exit Game'.</p>
<p>Look what he found!</p>
<p>A new game! And such an unexpected bonus?</p>
<p>Some nearby players also saw this, all looking surprised.</p>
<p>However, upon seeing that there were still three seats available, players rushed over.</p>
<p>Players who didn't get a spot began to queue up nearby.</p>
<p>But after hearing the staff's introduction, the players immediately protested.</p>
<p>“How can this be!?”</p>
<p>“Exactly! This new game demo only has four spots in total, why is the trial time so long?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, half an hour for a demo is too long, isn't it?”</p>
<p>“Right, right, so many people are queuing!”</p>
<p>The queuing players around them immediately grew displeased.</p>
<p>Because from the staff's mouths, they actually learned that this unknown game had a trial time of up to half an hour.</p>
<p>This meant that even the player second in line would have to wait a full half hour.</p>
<p>And there were only four spots.</p>
<p>Yet, this game looked quite interesting, even featuring motion control, with the big hammer held in hand serving as the input device.</p>
<p>It must be an action game! How satisfying it would be to wield a big hammer and smash monsters!</p>
<p>Noticing the commotion, Chen Xu also arrived.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, it's one thing that you don't have a new Dark Souls title, but this demo time being so long is too unreasonable, isn't it?”</p>
<p>“Exactly! Exactly!”</p>
<p>Seeing Chen Xu appear, many players voiced their opinions.</p>
<p>“Everyone, please calm down first. The reason for setting such a long experience time is mainly because this game is quite special. It requires players to have certain operational skills and sustained perseverance, which is why such a long duration was set,” Chen Xu explained.</p>
<p>Heaven knows, every word he said was true.</p>
<p>“Hmm… how about this, everyone please quietly observe for a bit. Watch for about ten minutes, and you'll all understand. Because this game needs a certain amount of time for its unique features to be felt, that's why such a long time was set, to allow every player who experiences it to feel its characteristics,” Chen Xu reassured the crowd.</p>
<p>Hearing Chen Xu's words, the players at the exhibition, though still somewhat dissatisfied, quieted down and focused their attention on this area.</p>
<p>It even attracted a group of players who were queuing for the Dark Souls Challenge and It Takes Two.</p>
<p>Watching the scene regain order under the staff's management, Chen Xu smiled, then quietly turned and retreated, hiding his accomplishments.</p>
<p>At the same time, Song Ren, as the first to experience it, entered the game with an excited heart.</p>
<p>But the scene that appeared next left him and the players on site stunned.</p>
<p>On the ground were scattered rocks, and a deep black, jar-like object, with a large hammer placed beside it.</p>
<p>The jar then shook continuously, and a person emerged from inside.</p>
<p>It was a bald, tough guy with a small mustache, only his muscular upper body visible.</p>
<p>He gripped the large hammer with both hands.</p>
<p>His appearance was similar to Song Ren's outside the exhibition.</p>
<p>‘This journey is too difficult; there's no way you can climb to the top. Just give up!’</p>
<p>At this moment, a cartoon version of an old man burrowed out from the ground, complaining, just like the Crestfallen Warrior in Dark Souls.</p>
<p>At the same time, the game also displayed the control interface.</p>
<p>Normally, playing only required a mouse, but now the hammer in his hand replaced it.</p>
<p>But isn't this game too crude!?</p>
<p>The players watching from outside the exhibition all grumbled inwardly.</p>
<p>However, they didn't say anything, after all, Chen Xu started with independent games.</p>
<p>Compared to Dark Souls and It Takes Two, weren't Chen Xu's previous games also nothing special graphically?</p>
<p>Song Ren tried swinging the hammer in his hand. Since it was inflatable and only had a motion sensor device installed inside, it wasn't heavy. Moreover, the sofa was specially made and very comfortable to sit on, and there was plenty of room for his hands to swing the hammer.</p>
<p>As the hammer in his hand swung, Song Ren watched as the strong man in the game also began to wield his hammer.</p>
<p>The gameplay wasn't difficult; it was just swinging the hammer and moving forwards, backwards, up, and down.</p>
<p>But this game is so strange!</p>
<p>Not just Song Ren, all the surrounding players had this thought.</p>
<p>The game's objective was very clear: climb the mountain with a hammer.</p>
<p>And the control mode was to swing the hammer in his hand.</p>
<p>However, compared to the players watching nearby, Song Ren, who was experiencing the game, soon felt something different.</p>
<p>That is, the game actually had a bit of difficulty.</p>
<p>Swinging the hammer in his hand and moving forward—that sounded simple enough.</p>
<p>But once he actually got his hands on it, he realized it wasn't as simple as he thought.</p>
<p>Especially the first tree in front of him; he needed to hook the hammer onto a branch and flip over it bit by bit.</p>
<p>But the hammer's point of force application in the game was too sensitive.</p>
<p>The magnitude of movement would all be reflected in the game.</p>
<p>For example, swinging the hammer to make the game's large hammer smash hard on the ground, using the rebound force to make the character perform a jump-like action.</p>
<p>Or hooking it onto the edge of a tree trunk and pulling hard could also allow him to flip over.</p>
<p>Knowing was one thing, but when actually controlling it, the hammer simply wouldn't obey.</p>
<p>The hammer in his hand swung in various ways, but he was stuck at this tree and couldn't get past it.</p>
<p>The other three players currently experiencing the game were basically in the same situation as Song Ren.</p>
<p>And many of the players watching from outside were somewhat amused.</p>
<p>Because they were practically cosplaying, sitting in a fishbowl-shaped sofa, then manipulating the hammer controller, yet the in-game character couldn't get past a single point. This sight was truly quite comical.</p>
<p>“This guy has been stuck here for two minutes!”</p>
<p>“Everyone else is stuck here too, it seems genuinely difficult?”</p>
<p>“No way!? I feel like it should be quite simple; just hook it at the very edge, wouldn't that work?”</p>
<p>Song Ren, holding the hammer, heard the low discussions of the surrounding players and couldn't help but twitch his lips. He really wanted to say, 'If you can do it, you go ahead!'</p>
<p>However, he was a player who had cleared Dark Souls, so he did have some gaming talent.</p>
<p>After two more attempts, he successfully got past the first tree.</p>
<p>Seeing other players still stuck at the tree beside him, a hint of pride appeared on Song Ren's face.</p>
<p>Continuing to advance with the hammer, Song Ren now roughly understood what type of game this was.</p>
<p>It's just clearing levels to reach the end, right?</p>
<p>Only the method of control had changed to swinging a big hammer.</p>
<p>But this game is too simple, isn't it?</p>
<p>There was no sense of urgency, no pressure.</p>
<p>Continuing to control the Jar Man in the game to move forward, Song Ren felt a bit strange in his heart.</p>
<p>Soon, he arrived at a small canyon, and what he had to do next was climb the mountain.</p>
<p>He could clearly see some protruding areas, which were presumably the spots for players in the game to hook their hammers and apply force.</p>
<p>“The controls are a bit strange, but it's actually quite simple; just pay attention to the force of your hammer swings,” Song Ren summarized. At the same time, he saw that the other three players nearby had also successfully passed the first tree.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it definitely has some difficulty, but after overcoming a challenge, there's quite a sense of accomplishment,” another player nearby also said.</p>
<p>“Indeed, it's just like Dark Souls. With games like this, you have to maintain a good mindset, because it's definitely going to get harder later on,” a player said with deep feeling.</p>
<p>“Yep, keep it up, brother! You must play games with a smile,” the last player added.</p>
<p>“Of course, you definitely have to play games with a smile,” Song Ren replied, and everyone seemed full of vigor.</p>
<p>But soon, they noticed something wasn't right.</p>
<p>“Why is this game's modeling so messy?” The players watching from behind voiced their confusion.</p>
<p>Because the scene in front of them was bizarre: a house suddenly appeared on the mountain, and half of it was embedded within the mountain itself.</p>
<p>At the same time, there were also concrete pipes resembling construction elements, looking a bit incongruous.</p>
<p>It felt particularly immersion-breaking.</p>
<p>The overall art style also appeared somewhat grotesque.</p>
<p>Although they found it strange, Song Ren and the others didn't pay too much attention.</p>
<p>Just keep playing, they weren't stuck on a level anyway.</p>
<p>Now they were on a high, steep small slope, with houses, wood, and rocks—many things could serve as points of leverage.</p>
<p>Waving the hammer in his hand, Song Ren climbed upwards bit by bit. With a slight misstep during an operation, Song Ren made a small mistake, causing his in-game character to fall back to the ground, rendering all his previous efforts completely wasted.</p>
<p>However, Song Ren didn't overthink it or get discouraged at this point. After all, this section of the path wasn't very long, so he continued to swing the hammer in his hand.</p>
<p>This time, he was extremely cautious, hooking onto the edge, finding his point of leverage, and then climbing.</p>
<p>“After making a mistake once, you summarize and learn from the experience of failure, just like in Dark Souls.” Song Ren glanced at the perspectives of the other three players next to him and smiled.</p>
<p>One of them, like him, had reached a new height, while the other two were still in the previous area.</p>
<p>“Yep, keep it up, brother!” Another player, at the same progress as Song Ren, also smiled at Song Ren in encouragement.</p>
<p>Calming his cheerful mood, Song Ren continued to control his in-game character, moving forward.</p>
<p>Past a pile of scattered rocks, this time it was a relatively confined space, requiring him to ascend onto a steel plate, similar to one on a construction crane.</p>
<p>Only the passage was extremely narrow.</p>
<p>The protruding areas on both sides looked a little awkward.</p>
<p>Song Ren took a deep breath, slowly raised the hammer with both hands, and then swung it forcefully.</p>
<p>Instantly, the strong man in the game leaped high. Seizing the opportunity, Song Ren swung the hammer in his hand again, hooking it onto a designated point.</p>
<p>Then he prepared to go all out in one go and leap directly onto the steel platform.</p>
<p>The next moment, accompanying Song Ren's hammer-swinging action, the strong man in the game instantly flew up.</p>
<p>According to Song Ren's expectation, he would land on the steel platform, but in reality, the direction of flight was slightly off.</p>
<p>He was flying in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>“No!” Song Ren's eyes widened, and he shouted.</p>
<p>But it was no use.</p>
<p>Just like a falling stone, the Jar Man steadily landed at the bottom of the valley.</p>
<p>In front of him was the starting tree.</p>
<p>Song Ren's mouth was slightly agape, his eyes fixed on the screen, completely stunned.</p>
<p>Then, in the game, the old man who had appeared earlier burrowed out from underground again.</p>
<p>‘You're back again? I told you you couldn't do it. But I think you should listen to a song to relax.’</p>
<p>The next moment, a BGM track started playing in the game.</p>
<p>‘If the heart is there, the dream is there! Witness success and failure, life is grand and bold, it's just about… starting over again!’</p>
<p>His hand holding the hammer trembled slightly, and Song Ren's expression remained somewhat dazed.</p>
<p>And at this moment, another gasp came from beside him.</p>
<p>Song Ren looked over.</p>
<p>How familiar that elegant falling curve was!</p>
<p>The other person, looking at the screen showing the return to the valley, had an expression as slightly dazed as Song Ren's.</p>
<p>At this point, another BGM track started playing.</p>
<p>Only it wasn't Song Ren's BGM from moments ago.</p>
<p>It was another unfamiliar melody.</p>
<p>‘Back to the starting point again, the path you began in memory.’</p>
<p>At this instant, the group of players watching nearby finally couldn't hold back anymore.</p>
<p>Although they really didn't want to gloat, this scene was truly too comical!</p>
<p>“Haha... I'm dying of laughter, Chen Xu must have done this on purpose, right!?”</p>
<p>"I fell for Chen Xu's evil, this game, oh my god!"</p>
<p>"It won't get even worse later, will it? Like climbing to the highest point and then falling off!"</p>
<p>"Given this vibe, I feel it's very possible!"</p>
<p>"Holy crap, I finally understand why they said it was a 30-minute experience!"</p>
<p>First three updates, more updates later (before 1:30).</p>
