                <p>Chapter 334: The Impatient Players (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>“No way? Captain Price isn't going to sacrifice himself, is he?”</p>
<p>Watching the final scene where Soap plunged the dagger into Makarov's photo, and recalling the previous scene where Captain Price was hit by a bullet, Zhang Yi was completely bewildered. To put it a bit dramatically, it was like a sharp knife piercing his heart.</p>
<p>Although, up until now, there was only one level where he truly controlled Captain Price, and that was the sniper infiltration mission in the flashback chapter. But throughout the entire game, Price was arguably the character who left the deepest impression on Zhang Yi. Even more so than Soap, the protagonist. Because Soap in the game basically never showed his face, and it was mostly from a first-person perspective. Captain Price, on the other hand, was completely different.</p>
<p>In the opening cargo ship mission, if it weren't for Captain Price, Soap would have already lost his life. Moreover, in subsequent missions, Captain Price demonstrated extremely strong leadership. Especially on veteran difficulty, Captain Price always led by example, taking him to heights he wouldn't have reached otherwise.</p>
<p>If the deaths of Gaz and Griggs made him feel bad, then Captain Price's death made Zhang Yi feel somewhat unacceptable. Especially at the end, Captain Price stayed behind alone to cover the retreat of Soap and the others. This kind of lone hero storyline made Zhang Yi even more worried for him. Although Captain Price merely fell to the ground after being shot at the end, who knew if he was dead or not?</p>
<p>If it were any other game, Zhang Yi might not have been worried. But in most games, the main protagonist's party usually doesn't die. And Price was clearly a very important supporting character; even if he were to die, it would be much later in the story. This was only the first installment of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare! Only one BOSS, Zakhaev, had died in the game, and he didn't have much presence, appearing only twice in total. Once in Captain Price's flashback, and the other time when he 'got his bento' (died). But the destruction caused by Zakhaev was immense. Thirty thousand Marines were reduced to ashes, and among the SAS squad members like Griggs and Gaz, only Soap and Price remained.</p>
<p>It was precisely because of this that Zhang Yi increasingly felt that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was completely different from other games. Every teammate around him, including the character the player controlled, could die, just like Paul Jackson. So who's to say Price wouldn't be in danger? And the most crucial point was that, from the current storyline, the new BOSS was clearly this person named Makarov. What would the next part of the story be like? Would Soap and the rest of Task Force 141 pursue Makarov because of Price's death?</p>
<p>Zhang Yi speculated. The length of the first installment of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was neither particularly long nor short. Because he had switched to normal difficulty midway, Zhang Yi basically didn't encounter any situations where he got stuck on a level. Yet, he had already played for about nine hours, and he was still quite excited, even though there was only one hour left before the VR gaming pod would initiate the forced offline protection measure. But an hour of playtime was still an hour of playtime. At least let him know whether Captain Price was dead or alive. But as the screen went dark, Zhang Yi froze.</p>
<p>Because the game screen directly jumped to the main menu, besides unlocking new challenge levels, the main story of the first installment was over? What the heck, it couldn't end earlier or later! It ended with Captain Price's fate unknown!?</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>As time progressed, not only Zhang Yi, but all players who had experienced Call of Duty: Modern Warfare erupted in protest. Not just because the game ended on a cliffhanger, but also because of the in-game story. On major forums, Tieba, and gaming websites, whether domestic or international communities, regardless of nationality, all players reached a consensus regarding Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.</p>
<p>Terms like 'Chen Xu the Cliffhanger-Dog,' 'Chen Xu the Warrior of Love,' and 'Chen Xu the Old Geezer' were directly trending topics among players.</p>
<p>Domestic community forums.</p>
<p>“Damn it, I was just getting into it, and then it just ended! That's it! Is Captain Price dead or alive!?”</p>
<p>“Exactly, exactly! And this plot is so damn heartbreaking!”</p>
<p>“Strongly condemn Chen Xu! The game was clearly complete, why make us wait ten more days!?”</p>
<p>“F***, I grinded all day, and now my liver hurts like hell! Not physically, but emotionally! My brother Griggs, don't die, I'll buy you a beer!”</p>
<p>“Ah! Don't even mention it, I burst into tears thinking about Brother Gaz!”</p>
<p>“F***, the old geezer Chen Xu used to stick to physical attacks! Dark Souls, Monster Hunter, and that damn Getting Over It. Now the old geezer Chen Xu is using magic attacks! Thinking about Gaz and the others, I feel terrible!”</p>
<p>“Not just the SAS, but also that nuclear explosion scene.”</p>
<p>“Yeah! That nuclear explosion scene was truly shocking!”</p>
<p>“F***, I pre-ordered all three parts, hurry up and release the rest, damn it!”</p>
<p>Domestic players were in a furious state, and foreign players were no different.</p>
<p>“Who was it that told me this game developer's designer was very considerate of players, pouring love into every game?”</p>
<p>“+1! Earlier, I felt the strong camaraderie, the nuclear explosion shocked me, but in the final battle against Zakhaev, please tell me why it had to be like this!”</p>
<p>“Gaz! And Griggs, why did they sacrifice themselves? Captain Price, why did he sacrifice himself!? I can't accept it!”</p>
<p>“Friends, latest news: I specifically asked my Chinese friend, the title 'Warrior of Love' is just this designer's humble self-description; in reality, it should be understood in reverse. Moreover, most of this designer's game plots, except for a few, are tragedies. Just think about Arthas, Kael'thas.”</p>
<p>“F***! Why did I only learn such important information after finishing the first part!?”</p>
<p>“I don't care about anything else, I just want to know if Captain Price is still alive at the end? I like him and Soap too much, I don't want anything to happen to them.”</p>
<p>Players both domestically and internationally were anxious; they really couldn't stand it! If they hadn't experienced it, and didn't know there were two more parts, it would have been fine. But after playing, all players were shocked by the content of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.</p>
<p>They were stunned by the extremely detailed game graphics, coupled with the incredibly immersive storyline and smooth design experience. This was simply divine! All these factors made players feel like they were the protagonists in a movie, and playing the game was much more satisfying than just watching a movie. After all, movies are just watched, while games are actively participated in.</p>
