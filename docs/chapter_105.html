                <p>Chapter 204: The Choice Is: Minecraft (Seeking Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>He didn't fully explain to the curious crowd.</p>
<p>After a brief chat, Chen Xu returned to his office.</p>
<p>Leaning back in his chair, Chen Xu gazed at the platform data Lin Rou had just sent him on his computer, then narrowed his eyes in thought.</p>
<p>The Nebula Games Platform currently boasted 91 million registered users.</p>
<p>Daily active users, on the other hand, hovered around 17 million.</p>
<p>The highest peak in concurrent online users occurred last year after the gameplay Expo, reaching 4.1 million when Fall Guys was launched.</p>
<p>Of course, this number wasn't for a single game, but an accumulation of users from multiple games.</p>
<p>For a standalone platform, this figure was already quite impressive.</p>
<p>However, compared to channel platforms, it was still modest.</p>
<p>Currently, the top-tier channel competition domestically was primarily between the two giants, TengHua and NetDragon.</p>
<p>Some second and third-tier channels maintained independent operations.</p>
<p>But many had also joined the ranks of the two major players.</p>
<p>Moreover, after Dark Souls: Age of First Fire was launched, both Tencent and NetDragon had proposed acquiring a portion of Nebula Games' shares and integrating it into their respective systems, but Chen Xu had politely declined them all.</p>
<p>And now, Chen Xu felt it was time to take another step forward.</p>
<p>However, this was by no means an easy step.</p>
<p>In Chen Xu's plan, the next games they would launch would primarily focus on player interaction.</p>
<p>They wouldn't be purely multiplayer games, but they needed to provide features and content that allowed players on the platform to interact and share experiences with each other.</p>
<p>Among these, Don't Starve was considered a multi-faceted trial run.</p>
<p>It was a test of player purchasing power when a game was exclusively launched on the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>It was also a test to see if Parallel World players could accept sandbox gameplay.</p>
<p>With 1.9 million units sold in two weeks, reaching 4 million in the first month wasn't difficult, and sales trends remained relatively stable. Various player-created MODs were also slowly being released.</p>
<p>Whether it was Overcooked or Fall Guys, players had demonstrated their creativity, and for players on the Nebula Games Platform, the Workshop had become a very distinctive selling point and feature of the platform.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, considering various factors, Chen Xu felt it was almost time to release a sandbox game that could become wildly popular among players.</p>
<p>And this would also be Nebula Games' trump card for further advancing its platform.</p>
<p>Thus, Chen Xu's choice was: Minecraft.</p>
<p>As for the reasons behind choosing this game, they were quite simple.</p>
<p>Mainly, there were three aspects.</p>
<p>The first point was its overwhelming success.</p>
<p>How successful?</p>
<p>In terms of commercial performance, in his previous life, Minecraft achieved over 200 million global sales within ten years.</p>
<p>Whether on mobile phones, PCs, consoles, VR, or handheld devices, Minecraft's presence was virtually everywhere.</p>
<p>The second point was Minecraft's unique charm.</p>
<p>In Minecraft, the world presented wasn't about lavish graphics and special effects, but rather focused on gameplay.</p>
<p>Take building blocks, for example. Most people have probably played with them, and even if they haven't, they've likely had a similar desire to create a world of their own.</p>
<p>Building with blocks, constructing on paper with a paintbrush, or even creating in one's mind with eyes closed.</p>
<p>Minecraft did precisely this, providing players with such an avenue in an incredibly simple way.</p>
<p>Players could create and destroy blocks in the game's three-dimensional space, crafting exquisite buildings, creations, and works of art.</p>
<p>Of course, if that were its only feature, Minecraft could never have reached such heights.</p>
<p>Its almost limitless modes allowed players to create on various multiplayer game servers or in their single-player modes. There were even many special features, such as Redstone circuits for logic operations and remote actions, minecarts, and rails.</p>
<p>Beyond these, players could also embark on adventures within the game, defeat fearsome BOSSes, and play it as an RPG.</p>
<p>But no matter the gameplay style, Minecraft revolved around one core point.</p>
<p>That was creation.</p>
<p>It wasn't just about building with blocks; it also involved scientific creation, with Redstone circuit gameplay that incorporated logic operations and remote actions.</p>
<p>It's safe to say that Minecraft is more than just a simple game; if you lack aesthetic design and spatial thinking, you can't even build an attractive house.</p>
<p>For instance, other people's bases were always luxurious large villas.</p>
<p>While your house looked like a prison from the outside, and then you walked in... <em>good heavens</em>, it looked even more so!</p>
<p>Just as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time defined 3D games in his previous life, Minecraft defined what a sandbox game truly was.</p>
<p>Consequently, whenever people discussed sandbox games in his previous life, they inevitably brought Minecraft into the conversation.</p>
<p>Even though the so-called sandbox game wasn't pioneered by Minecraft, its success and perfection almost inextricably linked the concept of sandbox games to itself.</p>
<p>In the words of many MC players, playing MC isn't just about treating it as a game, but rather as a toy, and its essence lies in providing a game as a toy.</p>
<p>What kind of game it is depends entirely on what the player perceives it to be.</p>
<p>As for the third point, it was naturally to further enhance the influence of the Nebula Games Platform through Minecraft, and simultaneously, the game itself could be said to be the most compatible with MODs.</p>
<p>Currently, the Nebula Games Platform's operation of the Workshop was already sufficient to support this masterpiece of a game.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>After deciding on the game, Chen Xu also began drafting the concept drafts for Minecraft in his office.</p>
<p>Although it was an incredibly successful game, drafting the concept drafts for Minecraft was actually even simpler than for Dark Souls previously.</p>
<p>Because the game, as a whole, was primarily about creativity.</p>
<p>Everything revolved around this point.</p>
<p>Compared to Dark Souls, which involved every aspect like art, numerical design, plot, and combat system.</p>
<p>While this aspect of Minecraft couldn't be called simple, it wasn't as troublesome as one might imagine.</p>
<p>In about two days, Chen Xu completed the initial draft of Minecraft's design concept.</p>
<p>During this period, Ruan Ningxue, Qin Yi, and others were still engaged in maintaining the Don't Starve MOD community.</p>
<p>After ensuring there were no omissions, Chen Xu called Qin Yi, Ruan Ningxue, and the others who were still working into the meeting room for a discussion.</p>
