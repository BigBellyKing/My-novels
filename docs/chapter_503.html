                <p>Chapter 502: A Grand Film of Creative Suffering (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>The easter egg interactions in the Nebula World before the game's release had players worldwide filled with anticipation, eager to enter the world of Bloodborne and uncover Yharnam's ultimate truth.</p>
<p>Lady Maria, in particular, made many players exclaim that they couldn't wait another minute.</p>
<p>Hunting all sorts of monsters and becoming the pinnacle of the hunter community – this was the fantasy countless players envisioned for themselves in Bloodborne.</p>
<p>However, the cruel reality soon taught them that this world was far from as beautiful as they imagined.</p>
<p>Both VR and PC players, after experiencing the game, logged onto the Bloodborne forum to post. They were either asking for guides or seeing if anyone shared their feelings. The message was clear: the game was absolutely insane!</p>
<p>They could only describe it as authentic, especially the "YOU DIED!" logo after death, which remained unchanged, a classic scene already etched into their DNA. It could be said that every corner of Yharnam held segments of players' creative suffering.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Cathedral Ward</p>
<p>Beneath an old crooked-necked tree, a player suddenly spotted a bright light. He cautiously looked around, observing carefully. He circled from left to right, then from right to left.</p>
<p>After repeatedly confirming that there were indeed no monsters around, ensuring nothing would surprise him when he picked up the item, the player finally joyfully went to pick up the light on the ground.</p>
<p>Upon picking it up, he was pleasantly surprised to find a new set of clothes. Just as this player opened his menu screen, wanting to check the attributes and appearance of his new attire, an invisible, intangible hand seized him, slowly lifted him, and then slammed him violently onto the ground. His already depleted health bar was instantly emptied.</p>
<p>“What the heck was that? What killed me!?” The player looked bewildered at his death screen.</p>
<p>Forbidden Woods</p>
<p>A player walked trembling along a forest path, completely lost. The forest, in particular, was filled with all sorts of eerie monsters, such as a large snake boss that summoned smaller snakes.</p>
<p>Facing these bizarre monsters, the player's Sanity had dropped to freezing point. As he passed through a narrow path and stepped on a wooden plank trap, a huge rolling log trap swung over from ahead. However, the player nimbly dodged it, which slightly improved his near-broken mental state.</p>
<p>“Hahaha, Old Geezer Chen Xu, your scheme has been by me—”</p>
<p>Before he could finish, the rope of the rolling log trap suddenly snapped, and the gigantic log rolled directly towards him. Its super-fast speed and wide impact range knocked him off the cliff.</p>
<p>【YOU DIED!】</p>
<p>“What the heck, why did the rope snap? Can I even play this!?” The player looked utterly bewildered.</p>
<p>Chalice Dungeons Layer 1</p>
<p>After defeating the Blood-starved Beast, a player who had obtained the Pthumeru Chalice and opened the first layer of the Chalice Dungeons was now exploring inside. As a bell rang in his ears, red monsters relentlessly rushed at him.</p>
<p>He was utterly bewildered. Where did all these monsters come from?</p>
<p>After being scraped off a single-plank bridge by three swinging knives and axes, he followed a sewer into an underground area. It was a massive space like a football field, and the moment he entered, countless rats with huge glowing green eyes emerged from the darkness.</p>
<p>“Holy cow! Holy cow! Is this a zoo?! Where did all these rats come from?”</p>
<p>Amidst heart-wrenching screams, the player watched his hunter character being savagely torn to shreds by a swarm of rats.</p>
<p>Upper Cathedral Ward</p>
<p>Carefully exploring forward, suddenly two monsters with large, tongue-like heads rushed out from behind, giving him a loving embrace.</p>
<p>Then, their massive tongues, like straws, burrowed into his head.</p>
<p>From the VR perspective, this player completely broke down.</p>
<p>“Damn it, where did these Brain Suckers come from! My #!@￥!”</p>
<p>Entering the Upper Cathedral Ward with 50 Insight, when he came out, the '0' behind the original 50 had vanished. Because these Brain Suckers really do suck the player's brain, one Insight at a time.</p>
<p>In Dark Souls, there were also such monsters, but none were as terrifying as those in Bloodborne.</p>
<p>It can be said that countless players in Bloodborne gradually walked to the brink of mental collapse. Because this game was too special!</p>
<p>The previous Dark Souls was only insane in terms of difficulty.</p>
<p>But Bloodborne was different; it was not only insane in difficulty but also in visual impact. If the combat mode of the player-controlled hunter were removed, forcing players to be unable to attack enemies throughout, this game would undoubtedly become a horror game, and a very terrifying one at that.</p>
<p>All of this made even the veteran Firelinkers, who thought they had already endured the baptism of Dark Souls, question life itself.</p>
<p>For example, the Forbidden Woods in the game reminded many players of Farron Keep. However, compared to Farron Keep, the maliciousness of the Forbidden Woods was much greater.</p>
<p>Because the entire map was larger and more convoluted. It wasn't just a huge swampy area like Farron Cesspit.</p>
<p>In the Forbidden Woods, players could easily find themselves asking, 'Who am I?', 'Where am I?', 'How do I get out?' – the triple questions of confusion.</p>
<p>Although there was an item in the game called Shimmering Coin, which could be used as a directional marker to tell players they had been here before, it was still not very useful in the Forbidden Woods because it was simply too convoluted.</p>
<p>Of course, if it was just convoluted, that would be one thing. What made countless players even more unbearable was that the monsters in the Forbidden Woods were incredibly disgusting!</p>
<p>From the initial snake-headed humans, to the later piles of small snakes, and the large snake masses formed by countless snakes, many players felt they weren't stuck because of the monsters' difficulty, but because they were scared stiff.</p>
<p>But soon, players discovered that this was just an appetizer. Just like the bonfire party in Yharnam, and Father Gascoigne who taught hunters how to Gun Parry, the later monsters were arguably even worse.</p>
<p>Research Hall, Upper Cathedral Ward, Nightmare Frontier…</p>
<p>Big-headed Sisters, piggies with heads full of eyes, human-headed spiders, centipede monsters, fly-men lunging at your face…</p>
<p>Aside from these disgusting monsters, there was also the extremely oppressive atmosphere. In Yharnam and the Cathedral Ward, the various cries and eerie laughs were already very disturbing.</p>
<p>But upon reaching the Research Hall, where a multitude of patients endured inhumane pain from experiments, emitting pitiful, despairing cries, coupled with monsters that rapidly drained one's Sanity, it pushed countless players to the brink of collapse.</p>
