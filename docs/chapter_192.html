                <p>Chapter 292: Two-Tiered Reversal (Seeking Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>On the main stage of tonight's event, Huang Donglai was truly doubting himself.</p>
<p>"Brother Huang, it's still not too late to repent now, your predictions are a bit inaccurate!" Sun Yixie added fuel to the fire on the main stage, while also expressing great surprise.</p>
<p>Clearly, he was astonished that the Human race and Night Elf race could be played in such ways.</p>
<p>"This shouldn't be!" Huang Donglai was also depressed. He felt that what he said should have been perfectly fine, but why did the results always turn out completely opposite to what he expected?</p>
<p>"Brother Huang, do you admit now that Mr. Chen is a master?" Sun Yixie pressed him.</p>
<p>"Oh, I've always admitted that Mr. Chen is a formidable Warcraft player, but again, Mr. Chen really has a gap in detailed operations compared to professional players." Huang Donglai still maintained that his opinion wouldn't change.</p>
<p>"Eh, but this time, the player on stage is a different story. If it were before, I would definitely think Jie Dong would win, but now it's different."</p>
<p>"To be honest, Jie Dong and I know each other privately, and our relationship is quite good, but I still want to say that among these people, Jie Dong is definitely a 'chicken' (weak player). As for SooB and Satellite losing to Mr. Chen, I don't think they lost in terms of skill, but in strategy. But now I just want to say, if Mr. Chen has any new strategies, Jie Dong might not have an easy time." Huang Donglai sighed deeply.</p>
<p>"Brother Huang, do you mean Jie Dong will lose?" Sun Yixie asked.</p>
<p>"Fifty-fifty, both have a good chance. Although I feel Jie Dong is a 'chicken,' I still think his overall hard strength is stronger than Mr. Chen's." This time, Huang Donglai performed a wave of repeated flip-flopping.</p>
<p>At this moment, they entered the game.</p>
<p>The map was TR, which is a map relatively unfriendly to the Orc race.</p>
<p>Because the large creep camps on the map are all Turtles, melee attacks cause additional damage reflection.</p>
<p>As for the Undead race, it's generally considered average.</p>
<p>After greeting each other at the start, Jie Dong immediately used a Peon for scouting.</p>
<p>Although this round wasn't Night Elf or Human, who knew if the Undead couldn't pull off some fancy tricks.</p>
<p>But soon, Jie Dong noticed one thing: Chen Xu was actually starting with a conventional default build.</p>
<p>First a Graveyard, then a Crypt, followed by an Altar of Darkness and Ziggurats.</p>
<p>This was different from before!</p>
<p>Moreover, the Undead race couldn't really play a Fast Expand strategy, as it's generally acknowledged that Undead is strongest on one base.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Undead race basically couldn't play much in terms of harassment; generally, their strongest push is considered to be at Tier 3, directly selling off all disposable buildings like their mine and Necropolis to Mass Production of Units to 100 Food/Supply for an all-out push. If they win, they win; if not, they don't.</p>
<p>Though puzzled, Jie Dong proceeded with his development in an orderly fashion.</p>
<p>On the other side, Chen Xu was also playing a mostly conventional Undead style, starting with a Death Knight.</p>
<p>However, the Ghouls produced from the Barracks were only used for Chopping Wood, and the main unit type produced later were Fiends.</p>
<p>He took his Fiends to nearby small Creep Camps to attack.</p>
<p>Chen Xu controlled his Death Knight to creep, constantly kiting creeps, which resulted in no damage and decent efficiency.</p>
<p>After clearing, his level reached two.</p>
<p>The skill point allocation was Death Coil and Unholy Aura, which was also a normal build.</p>
<p>Mid-way, Chen Xu also encountered the Orc's Blademaster, who was also creeping.</p>
<p>He was chased and hit a few times, but with Unholy Aura, he had inherent health regeneration and increased movement speed.</p>
<p>The Blademaster and Orc Grunts were too clumsy to catch up, so the opponent didn't pursue further and went back to continue his own development.</p>
<p>Chen Xu, likewise, continued creeping in an orderly manner. At the same time, three Ghouls were already chopping wood at his base.</p>
<p>His base was also about to begin upgrading to Tier 2.</p>
<p>The Ziggurats at his base had been upgraded to Spirit Towers early on, and the buildings were placed cautiously to defend against harassment from the Orc's Blademaster.</p>
<p>The early game was uneventful, with both sides developing without much harassment.</p>
<p>This was considered a basic macro operation, but it left many players, including the commentators, a bit taken aback.</p>
<p>After all, previously, whether it was the Night Elves' multi-expansion strategy or the Human's Fire-Demon Tower build, they were all quite aggressive playstyles.</p>
<p>But now, this Undead play was so conventional!</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen is playing a macro game with Undead this round, a normal opening?" Huang Donglai was a little bored. He thought Chen Xu would bring out something new this round.</p>
<p>"Is he going for an orderly macro game? Then Jie Dong is stable! The Wolf Riders are already out, and Ensnare has been learned." Huang Donglai analyzed the battlefield situation.</p>
<p>"Brother Huang, you're making a judgment already?!" Sun Yixie merely recounted what was happening on the field, without making 'professional' analyses like Huang Donglai.</p>
<p>"Oh, definitely! Mr. Chen seems to be going for Fiends, probably out of concern for the Turtle's damage reflection while creeping. But there are many drawbacks. Jie Dong's Wolf Riders are already formed, and they are so fast that even with the Death Knight's aura, they can't be outrun!"</p>
<p>"And there was a brief probing skirmish earlier; although no units were lost, it was clear that Mr. Chen's hard strength was still a bit lacking!" Huang Donglai analyzed simply.</p>
<p>"Yeah! Mr. Chen isn't training a Lich? He didn't put a point into Frost Nova at Level 1 but chose Armor instead? Doesn't that make him even less capable of killing?" Huang Donglai discovered some differences.</p>
<p>In the game, Chen Xu's Death Knight had been creeping alone for a while after Tier 2, not splitting experience with a second hero, the Lich.</p>
<p>So, the Death Knight was already at Level 3, with two points in Death Coil and one in Unholy Aura, while the opposing Blademaster was only Level 2. At the same time, Chen Xu had already stockpiled 5 Fiends at his base.</p>
<p>Next, Chen Xu directly chose to upgrade the Fiends' attack technology.</p>
<p>Watching Chen Xu's operation, commentator Huang Donglai was a bit stunned.</p>
<p>Generally, the second hero for Undead is very likely to be a Lich.</p>
<p>But almost all of them would learn their first skill, which is Frost Nova.</p>
<p>Because this is one of the highest burst damage hero skills in all of Warcraft.</p>
<p>Combined with the Death Knight's first skill, Death Coil, the opposing hero would usually lose three or four hundred health, and without any items, they would be at the kill threshold.</p>
<p>But why did Chen Xu make his Lich learn Frost Armor now?</p>
<p>This left Huang Donglai a little confused.</p>
<p>"It must be Mr. Chen's strategy; Jie Dong might be in trouble!" Sun Yixie said from the side.</p>
<p>"That should be impossible. Jie Dong has two extra Wolf Riders, and the Blademaster's items dropped quite well. The key is that with this skill allocation, the Lich can't possibly kill a hero." Huang Donglai analyzed the situation on the field.</p>
<p>"They're about to engage! Jie Dong is very aggressive over here! The Wolf Riders are already pushing up, charge! Charge! Charge!" Huang Donglai analyzed the situation on the field.</p>
<p>Near the Tavern in the middle of the game map, Jie Dong's forces encountered Chen Xu's army.</p>
<p>Originally, he was planning to get an item to get his Blademaster to Level 4, then train a Kodo Beast before trying an attack.</p>
<p>But seeing the opponent's forces at this moment, Jie Dong changed his strategy and decided to push all-in.</p>
<p>Because he felt he was very strong right now, and the Wolf Riders had already formed an encirclement.</p>
<p>This Tier 2 stage was a very strong period for the Orc race. Although the Wolf Riders' attack type was Siege, which incurred a slight penalty.</p>
<p>But they had the Ensnare skill; they could directly grab a Fiend, and it would be killed in one round, perhaps not even getting a chance to Burrow.</p>
<p>As Jie Dong attacked, the audience and commentators erupted.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, a huge disadvantage!"</p>
<p>The Blademaster charged up with a Critical Strike (from stealth), hacking away nearly half of the Fiend's health.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, his face is ashen!"</p>
<p>The next moment, a Wolf Rider's Ensnare landed on the Fiend, controlling it.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, terrible formation!"</p>
<p>The Death Knight, all alone, charged into the Wolf Riders' formation.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, fight and retreat!"</p>
<p>The Death Knight, having lost half his health, was about to lose his Frost Armor. At this point, he retreated slightly.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, caught between a rock and a hard place!"</p>
<p>But then, a Death Coil instantly brought the Fiend's health back up, and a Frost Armor was cast on the activated Fiend.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, Blademaster is right in his face!"</p>
<p>The Wolf Riders' attacks on the Frost Armor hardly caused any health loss. The only damage came from the Orc Grunts, Blademaster, and Tauren Chieftain's attacks and Shockwave.</p>
<p>But after being attacked, all units were immediately slowed, their movements as slow as dancing.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, a volley!"</p>
<p>At this moment, utilizing the Death Knight's Unholy Aura, the remaining Fiends instantly created distance and began to focus fire on the Orc Grunts, who posed a threat to the Fiends.</p>
<p>The Wolf Riders surrounded the Fiends to attack, but under the effect of Frost Armor, they took no damage at all.</p>
<p>Moreover, with the Death Knight's Unholy Aura, these Fiends were actually no slower than the Wolf Riders.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, he won!" Sun Yixie described everything happening on the field.</p>
<p>Beside him, Huang Donglai was completely bewildered.</p>
<p>Wasn't it a great situation earlier?</p>
<p>"What's going on? Frost Armor combined with two-attack Fiends is so powerful!?" Huang Donglai couldn't help but ask.</p>
<p>He watched as the Fiends, controlled by Chen Xu in the game, split into three small squads, turned their heads for a volley, and instantly created distance.</p>
<p>The Death Knight's Death Coil, combined with the Lich who had reached Level 2, used a Frost Nova to instantly take out a Wolf Rider.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Death Knight popped an instant potion, and while still under Frost Armor, charged into the Orc forces, constantly chasing and attacking the Orc soldiers.</p>
<p>The battle reversed completely!</p>
<p>Because Jie Dong had already sold his Town Portal Scroll directly in the shop for gold to buy Boots of Speed, he couldn't even use a Town Portal Scroll to save his troops. The Fiends, with the Unholy Aura's speed, were no slower than the Wolf Riders.</p>
<p>Two volleys combined with one spell resulted in the death of one unit, and they were even chased all the way back to the base.</p>
<p>The tide had turned, and Jie Dong immediately called GG.</p>
<p>In the RTS Group Chat, the professional players watching were also surprised.</p>
<p>"This Fiend strategy is quite something! Fiends usually have slow turning and movement speed, but with the Death Knight's Unholy Aura as support, their mobility becomes very high."</p>
<p>"Yes, Fiends are usually afraid of Orc units like Wyvern Riders and Wolf Riders, but with Frost Armor for defense and slowing down opponents, Wolf Riders pose no threat at all. On the contrary, you can freely kite Orc Grunts."</p>
<p>"Indeed, even focus firing to kill them quickly doesn't work, as the Death Knight's Death Coil instantly heals them, and Fiends can Burrow for self-preservation."</p>
<p>"So, Undead can play against Orcs this way!"</p>
<p>"However, Orcs can also counter this by seeing the opponent Mass Fiends and then preparing to produce Kodo Beasts and Wyvern Riders."</p>
