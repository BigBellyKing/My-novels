                <p>Chapter 282: Steady, We Can Win (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>With the launch of Warcraft, the game's popularity soared.</p>
<p>After all, Warcraft could be described as excellent in all aspects.</p>
<p>Whether it was the graphics, story, or gameplay, it gave players a sense of novelty and amazement.</p>
<p>Along with the rise in popularity, came sales.</p>
<p>Especially overseas, although Warcraft launched a week later than domestically, it still caused quite a stir.</p>
<p>After all, the production quality was simply too exquisite; whether abroad or domestically, no RTS game had ever reached the quality of Warcraft.</p>
<p>As for sales, Warcraft had already recouped its costs in its first week.</p>
<p>Many designers in the gaming industry watched in astonishment and envy.</p>
<p>Of course, envy was envy, and astonishment was astonishment.</p>
<p>But truly, few designers or game developers had the courage to undertake such a project.</p>
<p>After all, Warcraft succeeded, but what if it had failed?</p>
<p>High risk, high reward, but the risk was too great; for many game developers, one failure could mean eternal damnation.</p>
<p>During the period since Warcraft's launch, the RTS game market essentially only heard one voice.</p>
<p>Both players and media gave the game exceptionally high ratings.</p>
<p>Both game media and player aggregate reviews maintained scores around 9.5.</p>
<p>‘RTS Ushers in a New Era of Transformation Thanks to Warcraft!’</p>
<p>‘What is the Charm of Warcraft, Recommended by Over Ninety Percent of Renowned RTS Players?’</p>
<p>‘Buy a CG Animation, Get a Game – Warcraft's Shocking Storyline and CG!’</p>
<p>‘Redefining RTS Games, It Undoubtedly Succeeded!’</p>
<p>‘A Simple Analysis of Arthas's Character Transformation and Jaina's Mental Journey.’</p>
<p>All sorts of news articles and topics were related to Warcraft.</p>
<p>Regarding sales performance, game quality, and game content.</p>
<p>For a time, Warcraft was unrivaled in its prominence.</p>
<p>In contrast to Warcraft's glory, Hero Entertainment's Human Wars was looking rather bleak.</p>
<p>A week after Warcraft's launch, Human Wars bit the bullet and released an update regarding its remaster.</p>
<p>Originally, this should have been considered fairly good news.</p>
<p>Because prior to this, Human Wars had announced a free remaster, offering players enhanced graphics.</p>
<p>Coupled with new version content updates, and the fact that Human Wars itself was the number one RTS game domestically before Warcraft, this announcement had been eagerly awaited.</p>
<p>This news had still excited many players, who expressed their anticipation.</p>
<p>But that was before; now, things were completely different.</p>
<p>Before, everyone was just talking, and no one knew who was bragging and who was genuinely skilled.</p>
<p>But now, Warcraft's quality had been revealed.</p>
<p>In comparison, the remastered graphics of Human Wars were somewhat unbearable.</p>
<p>Of course, it was indeed much better than the old version, showing some subtle improvements.</p>
<p>But the crucial point was that during this period, players' tastes had largely been elevated by Warcraft.</p>
<p>Not only was the CG production exquisite, but the in-game models in Warcraft were also very refined.</p>
<p>Faced with the Human Wars remaster, many players' first reaction was to compare it to Warcraft.</p>
<p>And this comparison led to major issues.</p>
<p>"Though it's free, I still want to say if you don't want to remaster it, then don't."</p>
<p>"The higher the expectation, the greater the disappointment. What is this?! Compared to Warcraft, it's completely deformed!"</p>
<p>"To be fair, the Human Wars remaster is still excellent. It focuses on nostalgia, and from the remastered graphics, I felt the same way I did five years ago when I first played the game. Thank you, Human Wars, for bringing back a wave of childhood memories!"</p>
<p>"Seriously, hurry up and release a new version. Otherwise, if you drag it out any longer, I feel like I'll never play Human Wars again."</p>
<p>"+1, Warcraft's multiplayer battles are also very interesting! Oh, and can someone help me tell Human Wars that I can't go back, so don't look for me; I'm afraid Warcraft might misunderstand."</p>
<p>The internet was filled with all sorts of feedback. Even fans of Human Wars had to admit that its quality was indeed blown out of the water by Warcraft.</p>
<p>The main reason players reacted so strongly was that Human Wars' attitude had been overly high-profile.</p>
<p>Judging by their posture, many players thought Human Wars was going to have an Imperial City PK showdown with Warcraft.</p>
<p>Then Warcraft's quality appeared, giving players an incredibly stunning impression, subconsciously raising their performance expectations for Human Wars.</p>
<p>But once it was truly revealed, those expectations instantly plummeted into an abyss.</p>
<p>Inside Hero Entertainment, Zhou Qi was filled with helplessness.</p>
<p>Didn't he know it couldn't compare in quality?</p>
<p>But since it was already done, and it did show improvement, he couldn't just not update and pretend to be dead, right?</p>
<p>As for a new version?</p>
<p>In RTS, let alone a major version change, even a small numerical adjustment has a significant impact on game balance, not to mention adding various units; it all needs to be tested slowly!</p>
<p>"Human Wars feels completely defeated!" Yang Hong, the president of Hero Entertainment, sighed in his office.</p>
<p>On his desk sat a row of collectible figures: Tyrande Whisperwind, Sylvanas Windrunner, Illidan's fangirl Lady Vashj, and Maiev Shadowsong. As for why Jaina wasn't there? Because he didn't like her.</p>
<p>Listening to Yang Hong's words, Zhou Qi, sitting beside him, glanced at the figures on his desk, wanting to speak but hesitating.</p>
<p>He really wanted to say, 'We are ready to fight to the death, why do you surrender first, boss!' even though he himself had registered a Nebula Games Platform account, bought a copy of Warcraft, and had played for as long as 30 hours.</p>
<p>"Half-lost, but not entirely lost yet." Zhou Qi took a deep breath and said.</p>
<p>"Hmm?" Yang Hong looked at Zhou Qi.</p>
<p>Although he privately played Warcraft himself, it didn't mean he didn't want to win.</p>
<p>After all, Warcraft was a competitor's game!</p>
<p>"In terms of quality, we can't compare; in terms of story, we can't compare; in terms of gameplay novelty, we also can't compare..." Zhou Qi paused here, feeling a bit awkward himself. "But it's still the same old saying: the most important thing for an RTS is balance. Warcraft has only just launched, and players are still in a state of exploration, unfamiliar with the game's mechanics and gameplay."</p>
<p>"Once everyone understands the game's mechanics, controversies about balance are bound to arise. That's when Human Wars will have its chance! Emphasize the competitive and fairness aspects of RTS!" Zhou Qi's voice gradually grew louder.</p>
<p>Yes, it couldn't compare in quality.</p>
<p>The gameplay didn't seem as novel as theirs either.</p>
<p>For ordinary players, Warcraft's appeal completely surpassed Human Wars.</p>
<p>But this was an RTS game!</p>
<p>However, Human Wars had one major advantage: its excellent balance.</p>
<p>In the past, there hadn't been a lack of RTS games trying to challenge Human Wars' position.</p>
<p>Yet, he always had the last laugh. Why?</p>
<p>It relied solely on its balance!</p>
<p>Although Warcraft, this dark horse, was incredibly strong, there was still a chance.</p>
<p>And once balance issues arose, resolving them would take time.</p>
<p>Not to mention an RTS game with as rich a mechanism as Warcraft.</p>
<p>Once a balance issue appeared, it would be a case of 'pull one hair, and the whole body moves.'</p>
<p>This interim period was Human Wars' crucial point to turn defeat into victory.</p>
<p>Steady, we can win!</p>
