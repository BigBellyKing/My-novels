                <p>Chapter 324: For the Players, I Can Endure It (Please subscribe for monthly passes)</p>
<p>"Damn it! That's absolutely insane!"</p>
<p>Along with the video's final fade-out, Song Ren's voice, full of shock, came through the voice channel.</p>
<p>"This is called Modern Warfare? This is a World War, isn't it? It's too crazy!" Zhang Yi responded at this moment.</p>
<p>At the same time, he couldn't help but click replay.</p>
<p>This short promotional video, less than two minutes long, brought him an overwhelming sense of shock.</p>
<p>This video was not only played domestically but also overseas.</p>
<p>After all, as Huanyu VR devices' flagship title, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare wasn't just competing for the domestic market, but for the global market.</p>
<p>This time, the game publisher for overseas markets was still Target Software.</p>
<p>However, something was a little different from before.</p>
<p>That is, Target Software now belonged to Nebula Games.</p>
<p>Simply put, Nebula Games acquired a portion of Target Software's shares and is now the largest shareholder.</p>
<p>If it came to selling, Target Software certainly wouldn't want to sell, as their profits were steadily increasing.</p>
<p>But the key point was that the majority of Target Software's overseas revenue came from Nebula Games' titles.</p>
<p>And now that Nebula Games had proposed this plan, it was certainly fine if they didn't agree, but future cooperation would be difficult.</p>
<p>So Target Software, after some consideration, thought, "Why don't we just sell it?"</p>
<p>It's just becoming Nebula Games' shape, and once they adapt to it, it might even be more comfortable.</p>
<p>Under aggressive promotion, this promotional trailer also landed on major overseas video websites, accompanied by multi-language subtitles.</p>
<p>Overseas players were also incredibly excited to watch it.</p>
<p>After all, Nebula Games was no longer an unknown entity.</p>
<p>Earlier titles like Dark Souls, followed by Minecraft, Monster Hunter: World, Warcraft, and the recent Rainbow Six Siege, all received significant attention overseas.</p>
<p>At the same time, among the three most popular game genres overseas: gun, car, and ball,</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare belonged to the most widespread genre: gun.</p>
<p>These explosive scenes instantly ignited the passion of countless overseas players.</p>
<p>Especially those incredibly wild scenes, which sparked global discussion.</p>
<p>Domestic players:</p>
<p>"My god! Is this Chen Xu's new game? It's absolutely insane!"</p>
<p>"I can only say I'll buy it like crazy! And it feels like a completely different style from Rainbow Six Siege!"</p>
<p>"The White House falling, the Eiffel Tower collapsing, the Space Station disintegrating, cities nuked... is there anything Chen Xu doesn't dare to do!?"</p>
<p>"Yes! Chen Xu wouldn't dare to set the background in China! Forget bombing famous buildings, Chen Xu wouldn't even dare to damage flowers and grass!"</p>
<p>"Ahem, be a bit more farsighted! It's not that Mr. Chen doesn't dare, but it's a requirement for the bigger picture. After all, Huanyu VR is aiming for the global market, and setting the background overseas is primarily to better capture the overseas market."</p>
<p>"Never mind all that, I'm more curious about the gameplay content of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Is it more focused on multiplayer or single-player?"</p>
<p>"Multiplayer or single-player, I don't know, I just want it to be exciting. Rainbow Six Siege is fun, but I really can't play it."</p>
<p>"Can't play it +1. I'm more useful watching cameras after dying than when I'm alive."</p>
<p>There were also many discussions overseas.</p>
<p>"Atari just revealed the promotional video for Storm Action, and Nebula Games released content for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare right after, it's so cool!"</p>
<p>"Haha, you're right about the rivalry between Zeus and Huanyu. I was originally going to buy Zeus, but now I have to say I'll have to wait and see. The Call of Duty: Modern Warfare trailer is just too cool!"</p>
<p>"But this company's trailers, they won't actually be misleading, will they? I've been fooled many times before."</p>
<p>"My friend, do you know Dark Souls, Warcraft, Minecraft, and Rainbow Six Siege? These games are all made by Nebula Games, and they never falsify anything in their promotional videos."</p>
<p>"Yes, I specifically went to a Chinese website to learn more about this game company, especially their BOSS, who is also the lead designer for these games. In China, he has a nickname 'Warrior of Love,' meaning that every game contains his love for the players, so he would never do anything to make players uncomfortable."</p>
<p>"My goodness, that's so cool! But even so, to be honest, I'll still have to wait for the game to come out to draw conclusions. However, I have to say that I'm even more excited for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare now."</p>
<p>Clearly, the quality of this game's CG was absolutely world-class, showing many players what "ten years of game development, nine years of CG" truly means.</p>
<p>But while it was cool, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare didn't show much in terms of gameplay, and many players didn't understand what kind of game it truly was.</p>
<p>This was also within Chen Xu's expectations; this trailer was primarily to stir up players' enthusiasm.</p>
<p>To let players know what kind of explosive content this game, named Modern Warfare, would contain.</p>
<p>..............</p>
<p>News about Call of Duty: Modern Warfare spread worldwide.</p>
<p>Players engaged in various discussions.</p>
<p>At this time, Chen Xu was in the Nebula Games office, working with his team on the plot arrangement.</p>
<p>For the game's plot, Chen Xu adopted two presentation modes.</p>
<p>The first was pre-rendered CG cutscenes.</p>
<p>For example, when a scene change required pre-loading, CG cutscenes would be used to help players understand the story's plot.</p>
<p>The second was real-time story progression.</p>
<p>That is, players in game levels would communicate with NPC characters around them to reveal the game's plot.</p>
<p>Rather than simply clearing a level and then showing a real-time rendered animation.</p>
<p>Doing this had both advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>The advantage was a smoother player experience.</p>
<p>The disadvantage was that if a player's attention wandered, for example, if they scratched their foot mid-game, and an NPC character happened to be speaking,</p>
<p>Then some content might be missed.</p>
<p>There was no good solution for this, as everything has pros and cons.</p>
<p>A trade-off had to be made between the two.</p>
<p>Chen Xu's choice was to make the player's game experience smoother.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in VR games themselves, player concentration is higher than in PC platform games.</p>
<p>To some extent, this compensated for the disadvantage.</p>
<p>What remained was the story aspect.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, if this plot is written, players will probably send you razor blades again!"</p>
<p>Yang Xin, responsible for enriching the story in the office, couldn't help but exclaim as she looked at the story outline summary.</p>
<p>Because it was simply too brutal.</p>
<p>Just the highlighted points and script content already made her, being somewhat emotional, uncomfortable.</p>
<p>And as a VR game, with its high sense of immersion.</p>
<p>Players' emotions would definitely explode!</p>
<p>"There's no other way. All of this is to bring players a better gaming experience. For the players, I can endure these misunderstandings," Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Sending razor blades?</p>
<p>Express delivery companies wouldn't even send them!</p>
<p>Moreover, Nebula Games' security forces had been strengthened before the New Year.</p>
