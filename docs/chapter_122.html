                <p>Chapter 221: It Simply Redefined Their Perception! (Sixth update, please subscribe and vote for monthly passes)</p>
<p>After two consecutive official Weibo videos, many players had already guessed that this was Nebula Games' special promotional method for Minecraft.</p>
<p>Players who had previously built houses in the game, stimulated by the two videos 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' and 'Forbidden City,' were even more distracted, unable to eat or sleep.</p>
<p>Various operations ran through their minds; they couldn't wait to immediately go and experience it in the game world.</p>
<p>Although many players knew in their hearts that to complete projects on the scale of 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' and 'Forbidden City,' it would probably be a bit miraculous for them alone.</p>
<p>But some slightly simpler projects, they should be able to do, right?</p>
<p>At this moment, many players who had previously built 'matchbox houses' had completely forgotten their past experiences.</p>
<p>Their minds were filled with magnificent structures.</p>
<p>Just like playing Dark Souls, even though they had just been beaten by Gundyr the Ash in the game, seeing other pros flawlessly defeat Nameless King suddenly made them feel capable again.</p>
<p>It was as if they had learned a great deal, feeling that while they might not be able to defeat Nameless King, going back to fight Gundyr the Ash should be no problem at all.</p>
<p>This was the psychological activity of most players at this very moment.</p>
<p>As for many domestic designers, they were also marveling at this wave of Minecraft's promotion.</p>
<p>Clearly, the recent surge in popularity had shocked them too.</p>
<p>"This move by Chen Xu is really awesome; he's making Minecraft's promotion so creative!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I never expected it, this game could be so shocking. An 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' and a 'Forbidden City,' that's amazing!"</p>
<p>"The key is that everything in these videos seems to be something players can create themselves."</p>
<p>"And this promotion has even broken out of its niche."</p>
<p>"No choice, it's mainly positive and uplifting, and the game's art style itself is very harmonious. Although it has monster fighting content, it's very cartoon-like."</p>
<p>"But no matter what, it's still a block-building game; it's hard for it to change, right?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, no matter what, it's still a block-building game."</p>
<p>"Stop messing around, quick, look at Chen Xu's official Weibo! Holy crap! Minecraft can actually be played like this? I'm totally convinced!"</p>
<p>"What's going on?"</p>
<p>Three days after the 'Forbidden City' video, Chen Xu once again released an official Weibo post.</p>
<p>Many players were extremely excited; in these two days, many players were also discussing whether there would be new promotional videos.</p>
<p>Or what stunning scenes the new promotional video would bring.</p>
<p>There were all sorts of guesses, such as the existing Classical Gardens of Suzhou, the ruined Old Summer Palace, and the fictional Lothric Castle.</p>
<p>All had been proposed by players.</p>
<p>And this time, they finally welcomed a new video.</p>
<p>And they also understood the related pattern.</p>
<p>That is, every three days, there would be a video.</p>
<p>Calculating the time, it seemed this pace was set to continue updating until the game's official release date?</p>
<p>However, when players excitedly clicked on Chen Xu's official Weibo post and the video, many players showed expressions of bewilderment.</p>
<p>Because this third video was completely different from the previous 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' and 'Forbidden City' videos.</p>
<p>The video title was very simple: "How to Play 'To Liva' on a Piano in Minecraft."</p>
<p>Seeing the video's title, many players were stunned for a moment.</p>
<p>Wasn't it about building houses, or ancient cities?</p>
<p>How did this turn into a piano concert?</p>
<p>But after entering the game, countless players were bewildered!</p>
<p>"Holy crap, what did I just see!?"</p>
<p>"What the heck, it can be played like this too?"</p>
<p>"Wait! Isn't this a block-building game?"</p>
<p>"Has it been updated?"</p>
<p>"Don't tell me this is the in-game sound, not added in post-production!"</p>
<p>Countless players watched the screen in the video, somewhat dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Whether it was the Forbidden City or Along the River During the Qingming Festival before, many players, although shocked,</p>
<p>could also imagine through their own mental visualization that those things were built by themselves.</p>
<p>But this current video?</p>
<p>All players were dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Inside the video was a huge piano made of blocks, with 88 black and white keys, a piano case, pedals, soundboard, strings, hammer action mechanism, and everything else.</p>
<p>Although it looked impressive from the outside, compared to the previous 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' and 'Forbidden City,' it wasn't actually as astonishing.</p>
<p>But the most crucial point was that this thing could move!</p>
<p>And it really made sounds.</p>
<p>As 'To Liva' began to play, the black and white keys continuously moved. At the same time, the camera slowly shifted to the interior of the piano, where the piano's dampers bounced constantly, and the hammer action mechanism beneath the strings struck them.</p>
<p>Not only were players shocked.</p>
<p>This time, game industry designers were equally astonished.</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>Isn't this a block-stacking game?</p>
<p>How can it make a piano!</p>
<p>And even produce sound in the game!?</p>
<p>Many game designers were completely dumbfounded.</p>
<p>They had absolutely no idea that Minecraft could be played like this.</p>
<p>Especially players who had already experienced the game for five days; at this moment, they were filled with doubt and quickly opened the Nebula Games Platform to confirm again.</p>
<p>That's right!</p>
<p>I didn't buy the wrong game either!</p>
<p>Then why is this video completely different from my own game experience?</p>
<p>What's the principle behind this!?</p>
<p>However, there were also some more dedicated 'grinders' and hardcore players who figured out some tricks.</p>
<p>It seemed this was utilizing Redstone technology within the game?</p>
<p>Many players had also discovered these in the game's Creative Mode before.</p>
<p>However, not many players paid attention, or rather, hadn't quite figured out how to use them, only knowing that these things could seemingly be used to make some switches in the game.</p>
<p>But now it seems it's far more than that!</p>
<p>As for some ordinary media outlets, they weren't too concerned with what kind of game Minecraft actually was.</p>
<p>But the fact that a game previously created 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' and 'Forbidden City' also made many non-gaming media outlets aware of it.</p>
<p>This time, it surprised many gaming media outlets even more.</p>
<p>A piano was made in the game, and it could even produce sound.</p>
<p>How rare is that!</p>
<p>So these media outlets also reposted it one after another, with titles more attention-grabbing than the last.</p>
<p>"'A Young Man Couldn't Afford a Piano, So He Made One in a Game!'"</p>
<p>"'Have You Ever Seen a Pixel-Style Piano? Turns Out It's...'"</p>
<p>Each one was a veteran marketing account.</p>
<p>However, this also indirectly boosted Minecraft's popularity.</p>
<p>And for gamers who had been following it, it could be said that Minecraft completely redefined their perception of games.</p>
<p>Just watching these videos, they genuinely couldn't believe these things were actually created in the very game they had played before.</p>
<p>At the same time, many players also developed greater anticipation and curiosity for subsequent videos.</p>
<p>That is, this game, are there even more astonishing things in it?</p>
