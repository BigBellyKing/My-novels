                <p>Chapter 9: Woman, Go Away, Don't Disturb My Match-3 Game (Please Recommend)</p>
<p>In the next story.</p>
<p>A young lord from the Warring States period.</p>
<p>Her mission and duty were to protect her family from destruction.</p>
<p>Once, she found a magical bronze mirror that transported her to an incredible place.</p>
<p>Here, there was no war, and everyone lived freely and happily. The bustling scenery dazzled her, and without realizing it, she met him: an Otaku who wasn't entirely useless.</p>
<p>Their first encounter was very unpleasant; the two even got into a fight.</p>
<p>She lost, and by the rules of her world, he was henceforth her husband.</p>
<p>When she was hungry, the Otaku took her out for a meal.</p>
<p>A pork cutlet rice bowl, which surprised her greatly: 'So much meat, that must cost a lot of money, right?'</p>
<p>Because in her world, commoners couldn't afford meat.</p>
<p>Here, she also tasted an alcoholic drink called beer for the first time.</p>
<p>'What is this? It's so good to drink.' She said happily, hugging the beer bottle, a little tipsy.</p>
<p>This was probably her most relaxed moment.</p>
<p>She woke up after a hangover and picked up the bronze mirror that brought her to this world.</p>
<p>She brought the Otaku back to her own world with her.</p>
<p>However, this didn't bring about much change.</p>
<p>In her world, everything remained as before.</p>
<p>The Ketsuno family was still the Ketsuno family on the verge of collapse, with dangerous enemies coveting their downfall.</p>
<p>The only change, perhaps, was this 'husband' who didn't seem particularly capable.</p>
<p>He became the captain of her personal guard, but that was all.</p>
<p>Even with his arrival, the Ketsuno family's demise could not be averted in the end.</p>
<p>Two months later, she sat on the city wall, covered in bloodstains, as the continuous warfare and blood stained the land red.</p>
<p>Outside the city, corpses piled up like mountains, and the cries of slaughter shook the heavens.</p>
<p>Those were the enemies about to breach the city.</p>
<p>Watching the approaching enemies outside the city, she knew that in the end, she had failed to ensure the Ketsuno family's survival in this chaotic era.</p>
<p>'It seems the Ketsuno family's three hundred years of glory are about to be shattered.'</p>
<p>The Otaku was still desperately urging her to escape, but she merely shook her head gently.</p>
<p>'Makoto, I am different from you. From the day Father draped the battle robe over me, I swore... to protect the Ketsuno family's honor with my life.'</p>
<p>The Otaku brought up a pile of examples and reasons, trying to persuade her: 'The world's general trend is that what has been divided for a long time will unite, and what has been united for a long time will divide. You are not the only Ketsuno family to be annihilated.'</p>
<p>'Makoto, you won't understand. Here lies the dreams and efforts of generations of our Ketsuno family. Take this bronze mirror and leave quickly.'</p>
<p>She confessed everything to him.</p>
<p>After hearing it, he insisted that she leave with him.</p>
<p>But she had her convictions; how could she agree?</p>
<p>If she had been willing to abandon those convictions, why would she have returned in the first place?</p>
<p>She closed her eyes, feeling that his voice was no longer around, only the sounds of the enemy about to breach the city.</p>
<p>'Makoto, have you left? You really... left, huh... Actually, I really wanted to go with you too.'</p>
<p>'I also wanted to drink beer with you again... That beer was really good... It was really good!'</p>
<p>Tears welled up uncontrollably in the corners of her eyes.</p>
<p>Memories of that time resurfaced, and a character illustration holding a beer glass appeared in the center of the screen.</p>
<p>'Husband, this wine is truly delicious! How about two more glasses? Look, I've drunk it all up, you should have two glasses too, come on, cheers!'</p>
<p>And in this daze, she seemed to vaguely hear his voice.</p>
<p>'KILL!!!! I am Ketsuno Anna's personal guard captain! Those who block me shall be slain without mercy!!'</p>
<p>Looking at the game that had returned to the main interface, Jiang Ping couldn't help but sniffle, then closed his somewhat sore eyes.</p>
<p>It was a while before he opened them again.</p>
<p>'Are you crazy?!'</p>
<p>'Your game is crazy! It's a Gentleman's Game, why are the character illustrations so good, the voice actors so good, and the Match-3 combat system so well done? Is it free of charge or something!?'</p>
<p>'I just wanted to play a Gentleman's Game, why did you make it so emotional!'</p>
<p>While 'complaining' verbally, Jiang Ping's hands showed no hesitation.</p>
<p>Of course, he wasn't pulling out tissues; he was exiting the game's main interface, then decisively entering the store to leave a positive review.</p>
<p>Although it wasn't yet refund time, clicking on a game review directly would make it impossible to get a refund.</p>
<p>But this wasn't important at all, and he wouldn't even mention the subsequent content.</p>
<p>Just for this, Jiang Ping felt it was worth it.</p>
<p>He even thought that selling it for 10 yuan, the creator was truly an idiot!</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>It wasn't just Jiang Ping; through an unknown overseas forum, many LSP players discovered this game and clicked on it out of curiosity.</p>
<p>And when they exited, everyone was filled with emotion.</p>
<p>Some were for the game's story.</p>
<p>The story of elves and demons made them ponder the good and evil of human nature.</p>
<p>Humans were willingly degrading themselves, while an elf from another race helped them, only to be repaid with enmity in the end.</p>
<p>The story of the Otaku and the female general moved them deeply.</p>
<p>He seemed like a useless Otaku, but when it was time to leave, he burst forth with unimaginable courage and responsibility.</p>
<p>The story of the Dragon Maid and the Knight was a long and wonderful journey.</p>
<p>Whose achievements surpassed those of ancient emperors Yao and Shun? Who could stand with me?</p>
<p>Because of us, evil behemoths dare not harm the four directions; because of us, greedy authorities dare not oppress the common people.</p>
<p>And the story of Caiyun and Mingyue made many LSPs burst into tears.</p>
<p>Even if you are Mingyue's reincarnation, Qingfeng is still Qingfeng.</p>
<p>Two hundred years of waiting, two hundred years of reincarnation; the story of Mingyue and Caiyun should have ended two hundred years ago.</p>
<p>It was clearly a game beloved by LSPs.</p>
<p>Why did it always feel so heavy and sad after playing?</p>
<p>These players understood what the content of those previous posts truly meant.</p>
<p>At this moment, they truly empathized.</p>
<p>Of course, there were also many eager gentlemen who, being bad at Match-3 games, were directly shut out.</p>
<p>'Caiyun Junior Sister, please stop sucking my blood, open the door for me! I am your Mingyue Senior Brother, let me take a look at you!'</p>
<p>These players repeatedly studied the game's Match-3 combat system, constantly grinding for points and money to upgrade and purchase items.</p>
<p>Ultimately, these players evolved.</p>
<p>They no longer paid any attention to the gentlemanly content in the game; instead, they became obsessed with the Match-3 game within it.</p>
<p>Simple and clear, yet full of fun.</p>
<p>For a Gentleman's Game, it was simply incredible.</p>
<p>It's just that the girl next to me is really annoying, blocking me from playing my Match-3 game!</p>
<p>'Woman, get out of here! Move aside quickly, don't disturb my Match-3 game!'</p>
<p>'This time, with my wisdom, I will definitely break my previous score record!'</p>
