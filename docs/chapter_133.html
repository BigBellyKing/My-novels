                <p>Chapter 232: Industry Earthquake (Please subscribe, monthly pass)</p>
<p>Following Nebula Games' official announcement of its platform's transformation, the entire gaming industry instantly erupted.</p>
<p>Whether it was players or designers, or major game developers and channel distributors, everyone was frantically discussing this major event.</p>
<p>"Holy crap, have you heard? The Nebula Games Platform is transforming into a comprehensive digital platform! All game designers' works can be launched on the Nebula Games Platform!"</p>
<p>"How could I not have heard of it? The key is the commission! It's only 25%!"</p>
<p>"Really? It feels too incredible, it couldn't be a scam, could it?"</p>
<p>"What are you thinking? Nebula Games' official Weibo account has already stated it, and the platform's contract terms have been directly released. The entire industry, including players, are watching, so how could it be false? Besides, don't you think this looks a lot like Nebula Games had already planned it out?"</p>
<p>"Indeed! Minecraft directly ignited the attention of countless players, causing Nebula Games' popularity to skyrocket, and at this precise moment, the news of the platform's transformation broke."</p>
<p>"Actually, this can be considered expected. Nebula Games' development has been too smooth in the past two years, and I wonder if you noticed the details from Nebula Games recently? In earlier years, games under Nebula Games basically launched on major channels simultaneously, but their own platform adopted preferential strategies. In the past two years, whether it was It Takes Two or Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame, both first launched on the Nebula Games Platform, and then launched on channel platforms after a period of time."</p>
<p>"That's right! And this time, Minecraft and the previous Don't Starve didn't even launch on channel platforms. Yet, even so, Don't Starve's sales are almost breaking ten million, and Minecraft is heading towards twenty million or even higher goals. At least it indicates one thing: the Nebula Games Platform definitely has a paying user base."</p>
<p>"I wonder what Chen Xu is thinking. With such a low revenue share, is he not making money anymore? Moreover, this is challenging the unspoken rules of the entire industry!"</p>
<p>"It's a price war, of course. Once the Nebula Games Platform establishes itself, it might change the platform's commission. But at least now is definitely a good opportunity! After all, the Nebula Games Platform doesn't have many games yet. Going there now will definitely get some excellent recommendations. With such a large user base there, you're bound to make some money!"</p>
<hr />
<p>Inside NetDragon Games' meeting room.</p>
<p>Ma Lei, as the president, listened to his subordinates reporting some relevant data about the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>"Domestic channels have always followed a 50/50 revenue share rule. If they simply wanted to enter the channel distribution arena, Nebula Games wouldn't need to adopt such a method. Not to mention how much immediate profit they're sacrificing, just the number of channel distributors they've offended in the industry is unknown; it's equivalent to making an enemy of the entire channel industry." Ma Lei's fingers lightly tapped the table as he said in a deep voice.</p>
<p>"But the most crucial point is that in recent years, Nebula Games has steadily progressed. Whether it's blockbusters like Dark Souls, or independent titles like Don't Starve, Fall Guys, Valiant Hearts: The Great War, or mid-sized titles like Outlast and It Takes Two, they've covered them all. Coupled with the explosion of Minecraft, Nebula Games indeed has the confidence. Their user base has already formed. Even if the worst outcome is that the channel war is lost, they will still be in an undefeated position." Yao Guang, as the head of the Platform Channel and Content Business Group, sighed with emotion.</p>
<p>"That's right, mainly because Minecraft is too incredible! Solely relying on this one game is already enough for Nebula Games to establish a firm foothold." Speaking of which, Ma Lei couldn't help but feel helpless.</p>
<p>Since its release, it has maintained its hot momentum, and its end point is completely unknown.</p>
<p>Just with this one game, not to mention other things, it's at least enough for Nebula Games to live off its past success for ten years.</p>
<p>It's not even talking about launching sequels or anything.</p>
<p>Although Minecraft is a buy-to-play game, and its price, except for the VR version, didn't even exceed a hundred Yuan.</p>
<p>But such massive sales have already made Nebula Games extremely profitable.</p>
<p>Moreover, it's not just that; a game's revenue doesn't just come from in-app purchase stores and sales.</p>
<p>For some games, IP derivative income might even be more profitable than the game itself.</p>
<p>Minecraft's inherent block-building gameplay obviously has great development potential.</p>
<p>Collaboration with block toys of the same name, as well as the game's own MOD modules, paired with collaborative toys launched in reality.</p>
<p>For example, adding a QR code or a serial number. Players who purchase physical collectible figures in reality can then recreate their structures in the game. And to differentiate them from ordinary buildings, they can also add some special features, and so on.</p>
<p>Sitting in the office, at this very moment, Ma Lei thought of N different ways for Minecraft to profit, only regretting that this game wasn't NetDragon's.</p>
<p>"So, Mr. Ma, what's next?" Yao Guang looked at Ma Lei and asked.</p>
<p>"First, temporarily stabilize the major independent game designers within the channels, making a lower revenue share an alternative option. Furthermore, we are not the most anxious ones; including TengHua, who are probably watching the show. The truly anxious ones should be those pure channel platforms without research and development capabilities." Ma Lei pondered for a moment before speaking.</p>
<hr />
<p>After Chen Xu announced the Nebula Games Platform's transformation, as the two industry giants, TengHua and NetDragon, although they were watching from the sidelines, strategies aimed at third-party game developers and designers were also being carried out secretly.</p>
<p>This was mainly because NetDragon and TengHua were different from typical channel distributors.</p>
<p>Although both companies are the largest channel distributors in the country, and channel commissions are a major source of their income, they do not rely solely on channels.</p>
<p>But for some purely channel-based platforms, their reactions were much stronger.</p>
<p>First, they directly targeted a large number of independent game designers and third- and fourth-tier game developers, signing exclusive publishing agreements.</p>
<p>At the same time, some channel distributors directly began criticizing Nebula Games and Chen Xu, stating that this was destroying the game market.</p>
<p>This was mainly because Nebula Games put too much pressure on them.</p>
<p>If it were just an ordinary game platform, then even if it played this kind of price war...</p>
<p>No users, no resources – how could you make game designers go to your platform?</p>
<p>Just because your revenue share is low?</p>
<p>You still need to be able to sell the games!</p>
<p>But Nebula Games was completely different.</p>
<p>Whether it's resources, users, or funds, all are sufficient to support its entry into this channel war.</p>
<p>For a time, the entire gaming industry was in an uproar.</p>
<hr />
<p>As for Chen Xu, who was at the center of the storm, he was quite relaxed at this moment.</p>
<p>Inside Nebula Games' meeting room, a meeting was underway.</p>
<p>"First, everyone is aware that Minecraft has achieved tremendous success, but this is just the beginning. I believe Minecraft's potential is not limited to this. As more and more players join and delve deeper into it, this game will have a very long lifespan. So, related operational aspects must be done well."</p>
<p>"Including game history summary programs for players, and the maintenance of the relevant community environment – these are all things we need to do. As for the needs of players and MOD makers, they can be considered as appropriate, but everything must revolve around two core points: 'Freedom' and 'Creation'." Chen Xu said, looking at everyone.</p>
<p>After a pause, Chen Xu continued: "Furthermore, I believe everyone should be aware that Nebula Games is currently facing a significant challenge. So next, we will develop more complex games, and we must also try to accelerate the progress. If there's a shortage of personnel, directly contact the HR department, finalize and conduct your own interviews, and I will make the final decision for the final interview."</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu's words, everyone present was very excited.</p>
<p>Obviously, the Nebula Games Platform's transformation, and groundbreakingly breaking the industry rules of the entire game channel, made everyone in the team feel extremely excited.</p>
<p>As a game developer, it can be said that no one likes the current channels' overbearing style.</p>
<p>And now, without a doubt, Nebula Games is playing the role of a dragon slayer.</p>
<p>This real-life 'RPG,' it must be said, stirred the emotions of everyone in the team.</p>
<p>"Next, about our plans, let me give you a heads-up first: for the foreseeable future, we all need to focus on large-scale games to increase player attention on the Nebula Games Platform." Chen Xu said earnestly, looking at everyone.</p>
<p>What is the cornerstone of a game platform?</p>
<p>Large-scale games?</p>
<p>Not quite. The cornerstone of a game platform is actually various small independent games and small to medium-sized games.</p>
<p>Just like Valiant Hearts: The Great War, Don't Starve, and It Takes Two.</p>
<p>But to support a platform, it doesn't just need one or two such games.</p>
<p>So it will inevitably rely on the participation of third-party developers.</p>
<p>And how to attract third-party game developers?</p>
<p>Nebula Games is currently doing just that.</p>
<p>First, a low revenue share; second, more player users.</p>
<p>And how to attract player users?</p>
<p>The answer is also very simple: that is, blockbusters that can attract players, and exclusive blockbusters at that.</p>
<p>"However, before that, Qin Yi, you all continue your research into new AI technology, which will be applied to new games later." Chen Xu said, looking at Qin Yi.</p>
<p>"Alright, that's it for now. Zhang Yida, stay behind; the rest of you can go back to work."</p>
<p>Inside the meeting room, Zhang Yida was reporting to Chen Xu about some recent developments.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, there have been a lot of news articles discrediting us online, and some narratives driven by internet trolls. We have already signed relevant contracts with Sanyuan and Yihua Law Firms and are preparing to file lawsuits." Zhang Yida said.</p>
<p>Currently, Nebula Games has not yet established its own legal department, mainly because it's not needed for the time being.</p>
<p>So legal matters are outsourced, and these two firms specialize in civil and commercial law, as well as the internet domain.</p>
<p>"You handle this part. As for the platform's operation and promotion, and third-party game designers and developers, also speed things up."</p>
<p>Chen Xu nodded, told Zhang Yida about some important matters, then slowly exhaled, and took out his phone to look.</p>
<p>Various industry chat groups were all flooded with "+999" messages. At the same time, many designers in the gaming industry with contact information were privately inquiring about news regarding the Nebula Games Platform, and on the official Weibo account, people were saying all sorts of things.</p>
<p>After thinking for a moment, Chen Xu opened the official Weibo account, edited and sent a post.</p>
<p>'Regarding the Nebula Games Platform's transformation into a comprehensive digital platform, I'll keep it brief.'</p>
<p>'First, the platform's transformation is actually a reasonable development. All along, the Nebula Games Platform has been committed to providing players with a better gaming experience, a good community environment, a rich Workshop, a review system that can provide feedback on a game, including cloud saves and trophy/achievement records. We have always hoped to bring players the best experience.'</p>
<p>'As for the commission issue that industry peers and players are more concerned about, the answer is also very simple: Nebula Games does not intend to wage a price war, to squeeze out competitors and then seize the opportunity to raise prices. The 25% commission strategy will never change. At the same time, for games that receive excellent player reviews, the commission will continue to decrease, down to a minimum of 12%.'</p>
<p>'As for whether we can make money, I can only say that based on the current platform and community operations, after deducting costs, with the current commission rate, we can achieve a profit of approximately 7%, and as the scale expands, the profit margin can reach 9-10%.'</p>
<p>'The Nebula Games Platform has never intended to monopolize the so-called game channels. Instead, it aims to provide more developers with a more relaxed development environment and bring more interesting and enjoyable games to players.'</p>
<p>Two chapters first, the rest will be the same as before.</p>
