                <p>Chapter 291: Fire-Demon Tower (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>As the Defense Tower entered its upgrade phase, Satellite, who was in the game, was utterly stunned.</p>
<p>In the early game, he adopted a single Burrow fast tech playstyle.</p>
<p>For the Orcs, the biggest characteristic of this tactic was its much faster opening speed compared to normal, essentially allowing them to go Tier 2 tech by 17 Food.</p>
<p>Coupled with early Wolf Riders, they could get going very quickly.</p>
<p>This was considered one of the mainstream tactics developed by Orc players at the moment.</p>
<p>The main reason Orcs could play this way was that the Orc Grunt was the tankiest infantry unit in the early game.</p>
<p>A main hero paired with an Orc Grunt was perfectly sufficient for creeping, and the Orc Shop was also the most fitting for their race; after being on low health, one Great Potion would bring them back to fighting shape in no time.</p>
<p>Currently, Satellite found himself in a very awkward situation. Five Peasants were directly building Watchtowers, even though they were very vulnerable while under construction and upgrading.</p>
<p>But the opponent was building them directly outside the Burrow's defensive range, so even if the Peons entered the Burrow, there was no way to defend.</p>
<p>And his Blademaster, along with his current Orc Grunt, seemed completely outmatched.</p>
<p>In a head-on fight, the Fire Demon definitely couldn't beat the Blademaster, but the opponent wasn't fighting him head-on at all!</p>
<p>While his Blademaster and Orc Grunts were attacking the Fire Demon, the nearby Watchtowers continued to be built, then upgraded to Arrow Towers. The Fire Demon didn't fight him, it just kited around.</p>
<p>If he attacked the Peasants, they would just run away. The Arrow Towers were already upgrading, and the Fire Demon, Lesser Fire Demon, and Footmen were attacking his units.</p>
<p>If he turned back to attack the Watchtowers against five Peasants, he currently only had one Blademaster and two Orc Grunts, with the third Orc Grunt still building.</p>
<p>He was in a bit of a bind.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Burrow was essentially a shoddy construction; at least before upgrading to Fortified Burrows, it was far too easily destroyed.</p>
<p>This was one of the reasons why he built them so far in, as they were too easily harassed.</p>
<p>But now he felt utterly disgusted; he hadn't anticipated that the Human race could even play like this.</p>
<p>At this moment, Chen Xu was also extremely focused.</p>
<p>The Human TR, or Peasant-and-Tower all-in push, was quite an extreme tactic. If executed well, the opponent would be completely suppressed in the early game.</p>
<p>But if they weren't crushed directly, then the initiator was basically doomed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there weren't many units to control in the early game, so his hand speed could still handle it.</p>
<p>The situation on the field was very contested, and with the Arcane Tower, which could drain mana, being completed, it essentially marked the first successful step of the TR tactic. The Human race had already gained a foothold at the Orcs' home base.</p>
<p>As for Satellite, he had actually figured out how to respond.</p>
<p>That was to upgrade to Tier 2 tech, build a War Mill, and counter with Catapults.</p>
<p>But the key problem was that he couldn't hold on much longer!</p>
<p>He needed to make a trade-off between economy and lumber.</p>
<p>If he built Orc Grunts to stall for time, then the production of Catapults and the War Mill would inevitably slow down.</p>
<p>And the speed of the opponent's Defense Towers wouldn't slow down, but if he didn't build Orc Grunts, he wouldn't be able to stall at all!</p>
<p>It was a complete dead end. Looking at the two Defense Towers that had just been erected in front of him, and after a struggling attempt to cut down the Fire Demon, Satellite directly typed </p>
