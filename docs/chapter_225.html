                <p>Chapter 325: The Inclusion of Kingfish Operation (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Following Chen Xu's release of the relevant video materials for <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, Howard Warsaw, the head of <em>Storm Action</em> at atrai and one of atrai's top-tier designers, also closely followed the content of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>.</p>
<p>After all, his <em>Storm Action</em> was launching on the zeus platform, while <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> was launching on Huanyu. Coupled with both being FPS games, this was a direct competitive relationship. If <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> were of the same quality as <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, Howard Warsaw would not have the slightest worry. Because in that scenario, the opponent would have no competitiveness whatsoever. It's not that <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> is bad; rather, in some respects, it's almost too good. Its overly hardcore gameplay destined it to be a delicacy only a few could truly savor. And for an FPS game, if it's tied to being hardcore, it will inevitably not become a mainstream game. The reason FPS is arguably the biggest game genre globally is that most FPS games are actually fast-food style experiences. "Fast-food style" might not sound great, feeling a bit low-brow. But for most people, isn't playing games about relaxation? After work, they want to open a game, not think too much, and just have fun. And on top of this, if a game can also bring players some emotional resonance or narrative depth, then there's no doubt that game can absolutely become legendary. Some overly hardcore, overly deep games might earn player recognition and positive reviews, but they won't achieve mass sales. Howard Warsaw understood this very clearly. And <em>Storm Action</em>, for him, was a game developed purely for sales, specifically to escort the zeus platform. Otherwise, why would atrai bother buying its IP rights? But now, the promotional video for <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> instinctively put Howard Warsaw on alert. Because he had to admit, the grand scenes were truly spectacular. Furthermore, Nebula Games now had a considerable reputation overseas. Howard Warsaw naturally didn't dare to underestimate them.</p>
<p>Soon, <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> and <em>Storm Action</em> began to clash. They engaged in daily promotional pushes. One day, you'd release news about the lead actors recording motion capture; the next, I'd release some concept art. Initially, both sides primarily released behind-the-scenes footage from game development, such as motion capture recordings and concept art. When they ran out of things to promote, even the game designers themselves stepped in for a wave of publicity. As time gradually advanced, with the game content developing, some actual in-game footage was finally released. <em>Storm Action</em> released a combat video, approximately fifteen seconds long, a segment from the earlier escape from a skyscraper, which excited many players. Immediately after, Chen Xu also released a video. In a stormy night, on a freighter, a group of fully armed special forces infiltrated the deck, eliminating various enemies. However, what captivated players wasn't the gameplay, as the duration was simply too short—only about twenty seconds from aerial descent to the deck. What truly shocked players was the incredibly outstanding visuals. The lighting and shadows, the rain, the super high-definition textures—it looked exactly like CGI. Originally, many players, after seeing <em>Storm Action</em>'s demo, were amazed by the powerful capabilities of the new era zeus platform. But after watching this simple twenty-second demonstration of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, all players were dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“Holy cow, these graphics completely blew <em>Storm Action</em> out of the water!”</p>
<p>“If I didn’t know Chen Xu wouldn’t resort to downgrading graphics or using misleading trailers, I would definitely think this was goddamn CGI!”</p>
<p>“My God! This is absolutely stunning. Does this mean Huanyu's capabilities are so much stronger than zeus's!?”</p>
<p>Many players were full of exclamations. Even game industry designers who had been following the developments were startled by this scene. After all, the difference was too obvious. And for them, as game designers, they had all researched the performance of zeus and Huanyu. They knew they were fundamentally not too different. So, they clearly understood what the graphics of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> implied. However, after a brief moment of surprise, Howard Warsaw and other industry game designers generally figured out how Nebula Games achieved this. It was nothing more than concentrating the console's performance for producing linear levels. But the problem arises: doing so would inevitably lead to loading screens. <em>Storm Action</em> also required loading, but it could be masked by real-time rendering. <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> was different. With this level of concentrated performance, although the SSD model used in the new version VR and specially optimized processing made the speed very impressive, a single map would still require at least 20-30 seconds of loading time. In such a situation, switching between levels would disrupt the player experience. So, was Nebula Games sacrificing player fluidity to enhance visual presentation? Many industry designers suddenly understood.</p>
<p>As for Chen Xu at this moment, he was in the middle of testing game content. In the game, Chen Xu was prone on the ground, frantically sweeping enemies from all directions. Bullets struck the ground, shattering green grass and kicking up dirt. Blood stained the earth and grass red. The gun, propped on the ground, left a shallow indentation. This was a level in the game, and Chen Xu was playing as Captain Price. In the original game of his past life, players could only play as Price in two levels: one was a flashback level, the classic sniper mission <em>All Ghillied Up</em>, and the other was the final level of the game. However, compared to the game, there was actually a plot hole. In his past life, Activision dug a hole but never filled it. There were, however, fervent fan players who filmed a short film to complete this part of the story, which received high official recognition, with the developers directly stating it was well-made and could be considered their official plot. Operation Croaker, or Kingfish Operation. Therefore, in the game, Chen Xu officially incorporated it. It would serve as the final easter egg content of the first installment. As for why it was placed at the end of the first installment? Because chronologically, it perfectly aligned with the second installment. Secondly, the game adopted a trilogy format, where Shepherd in the second installment and Makarov in the third were actually connected, with their timelines flowing seamlessly. Only the first installment was separated; wouldn't it be necessary to add some attractive anchors to hook players? (End of this chapter)</p>
