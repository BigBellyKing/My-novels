                <h2>Chapter 224: Characteristics of Different Modes (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h2>
<p>The group continued their tour.</p>
<p>Filled with emotion, after admiring the Along the River During the Qingming Festival.</p>
<p>Everyone arrived at the end, their faces full of surprise.</p>
<p>Because they actually discovered a waiting platform at the end, with railway tracks on the ground, and a sign that read "One train every 5 minutes".</p>
<p>Next to it, there was also a countdown timer and the destination for the next station: Forbidden City.</p>
<p>"This game can even build high-speed rail!?" Wang Han exclaimed, surprised.</p>
<p>"Now, even if you told me this game could build mechs, I wouldn't be surprised at all," Zhang Yi remarked with emotion.</p>
<p>The game builds trains?</p>
<p>How big of a deal is that?</p>
<p>"I'm a bit conflicted now. I really want to try building something myself, but I also want to finish the tour," Song Ren said, expressing his feelings.</p>
<p>After seeing the Along the River During the Qingming Festival exhibition, Song Ren felt a strong urge to build.</p>
<p>He really wanted to personally try his hand at some artistic creation.</p>
<p>While touring earlier, he had already used his phone to capture screenshots of the in-game scenes, planning to recreate them later.</p>
<p>Hearing Song Ren's words, the others next to him couldn't help but nod.</p>
<p>As they were chatting, they heard the mournful sound of a whistle.</p>
<p>A small black dot in the distance slowly grew larger.</p>
<p>It really was a train!</p>
<p>And there were seats available to board.</p>
<p>Filled with wonder, Zhang Yi and the others boarded the train, curiously walking through it from end to end.</p>
<p>At the same time, many players activated flight mode, flying back and forth around the train, seemingly trying to figure out how it moved.</p>
<p>However, it was clear that for them at the moment, it was a bit bewildering.</p>
<p>But the only thing they could feel was amazement.</p>
<p>What else could this game possibly achieve?</p>
<p>If Chen Xu's previously released official videos had left some players skeptical.</p>
<p>But after truly entering the game and seeing these creations, all players had only one thought.</p>
<p>That was, to what extent could this game called "Minecraft" truly go, or what else couldn't it create?</p>
<p>All the players at this moment were filled with intense curiosity and a desire to explore.</p>
<p>"Oh my god, the scenery on both sides of the road has been naturally landscaped!" Wang Han exclaimed in the voice channel.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi and the others looked out through the deliberately designed windows of the train.</p>
<p>The train moved at a steady pace, and outside the window, meticulously landscaped scenery was clearly visible.</p>
<p>Trees were neatly arranged, and along the way, she even saw some wild farms.</p>
<p>NPCs inside were acting as farmers, tilling fields and working.</p>
<p>Finally, as the train entered a deep tunnel, after about ten seconds, accompanied by a mournful whistle.</p>
<p>After the brief darkness of passing through the tunnel, the game's lighting and shadows first appeared as a white screen, then slowly the entire in-game scene gradually revealed itself.</p>
<p>A magnificent city appeared before all the players: Forbidden City.</p>
<p>It was completely different from the Along the River During the Qingming Festival they had seen before.</p>
<p>The scene of Along the River During the Qingming Festival offered more of a detailed experience.</p>
<p>It was a dense scene within a small area.</p>
<p>Various buildings were packed very closely within that small scene.</p>
<p>The Forbidden City before them, however, was a grand scene.</p>
<p>The entire complex was situated on a central axis, arranged sequentially from south to north, grand and majestic.</p>
<p>However, compared to the Along the River During the Qingming Festival with its NPCs, the Forbidden City had an added solemnity but lacked a bit of liveliness.</p>
<p>After admiring it from beginning to end, Wang Han and Zhang Yi continued onward.</p>
<p>Playing the piano piece 'To Liva', and using a functional calculator, a group of players even queued up to personally experience doing calculations with a calculator built within the game.</p>
<p>It can even do that!</p>
<p>This was what Zhang Yi and the others said most often throughout their tour.</p>
<p>Of course, what impressed Zhang Yi and his companions most was the final amusement park.</p>
<p>There were many mini-games to play inside.</p>
<p>They could clear levels like in "Fall Guys", navigate mazes, and shoot targets with bows and arrows while sitting on track carts.</p>
<p>"And look, it seems like this server will also update with new building complexes later!" Wang Han remarked with some emotion.</p>
<p>The amusement park was the last large scene displayed publicly by the official server.</p>
<p>However, they also noticed that the railway tracks still extended further, but beyond them lay vast mountains, empty land, and forests, all in their original "Minecraft" appearance.</p>
<p>But from the extending tracks, they could deduce that Nebula Games likely had further plans.</p>
<p>It was just that no action had been taken yet; otherwise, there would be no need to extend the railway further, especially through mountain tunnels.</p>
<p>"I don't care about what comes next. Since we have a little more time, why don't we go build houses?" Zhang Yi suggested.</p>
<p>This suggestion immediately received Song Ren's support.</p>
<p>After all, having seen so much, he was already impatient.</p>
<p>His hands were simply itching to build!</p>
<p>"So, should we play Survival or Creative?" Joey asked from the crowd.</p>
<p>"How about Survival mode? Creative mode doesn't really give a sense of accomplishment, and I think we could rent a server!" Wang Han said.</p>
<p>"Let's talk about that later. Anyway, I read in the introduction that self-hosted servers can transfer save data. For now, let's just play Survival mode," Zhang Yi said.</p>
<p>"Alright, but I just wonder if these buildings can be moved to our own world," Wang Han said, looking enviously at the amusement park before them.</p>
<p>"Don't you read the introduction? All of these can be downloaded from the Workshop! However, only Creative Mode can directly generate them. In Survival Mode, you need to collect certain materials according to MOD blueprints to generate them out of thin air," Zhang Yi explained.</p>
<p>This was also a specific setting Chen Xu implemented.</p>
<p>For Creative Mode, with infinite materials, it was naturally irrelevant.</p>
<p>But in Survival Mode, players still needed to collect certain materials to build.</p>
<p>Of course, players didn't have to collect all materials to build something.</p>
<p>Instead, it adopted a system of regional division.</p>
<p>For example, for an amusement park theme, assuming a footprint of 1000x1000, players would first need to select a 1000x1000 area.</p>
<p>Then, the structures within the amusement park were also divided into different areas, such as the Ferris wheel, ground, and roller coaster.</p>
<p>Each area had specific material requirements; after collecting sufficient materials, players could choose to automatically generate and build.</p>
<p>Of course, even if materials weren't fully collected, it didn't matter; whatever amount was collected would be automatically built.</p>
<p>After all, in reality, houses aren't built in an instant.</p>
<p>As for players who no longer wanted to collect, that was also fine; the project would simply be left unfinished, becoming an abandoned building.</p>
<p>The same applied to private servers set up by players.</p>
<p>Of course, "Minecraft" itself is an extremely free game.</p>
<p>There was no compulsion on players to do anything in particular. "If I want to build pretty houses more easily in Survival Mode, and I'm just playing by myself without affecting other players, is that not allowed?"</p>
<p>Of course, it's allowed! The prerequisite is that when creating a world seed, you enable cheat mode, and then by entering corresponding command codes in the game, players can play however they desire.</p>
<p>However, these only applied to players' private servers and individual host world seeds. For the official pure servers operated by Nebula Games, players would have to build corresponding structures themselves.</p>
<p>Whether it was Survival mode, where players could unleash their creativity, or the peaceful Creative mode.</p>
<p>All dreams could only be realized by players using their own hands.</p>
<p>First two updates.</p>
