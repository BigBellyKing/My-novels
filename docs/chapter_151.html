                <p>Chapter 250: BOSS Battle (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Zhang Yi didn't go wandering around as a traveler in the New World. Instead, he returned to the base to continue with the relevant story missions.</p>
<p>Following the Investigation Team Leader's hint, Zhang Yi first went to the Processing Workshop and had a conversation with the Leader of the Second Fleet. He used the collected materials to strengthen his Great Sword.</p>
<p>"But why has the Leader of the Second Fleet become a blacksmith?"</p>
<p>"Where are my fellow hunters? Where's the Mohawk guy from before? And my bun-haired teammate, why does she never come hunting with me? Haven't I triggered the corresponding cutscene yet?"</p>
<p>Zhang Yi scratched his head, looking at the newly received quest named 'Crown-crested Dragon Disturbance'. So far, only his Palico, named '123', was accompanying him.</p>
<p>The self-proclaimed Mohawk hunter from the ship's cabin hadn't been seen yet. And his unnamed handler, only called 'partner', always stayed in the canteen or waited in the camp when he went on missions. Could she not be his partner?</p>
<p>Just like before, after eating a Felyne meal and setting off, Zhang Yi couldn't help but feel a little strange looking at his bun-haired handler partner in the camp. However, he didn't think too much about it.</p>
<p>After all, this was just the beginning of the game. Perhaps he would slowly meet his teammates as the game's story progressed? It must be so!</p>
<p>The more Zhang Yi thought about it, the more he agreed. Just like in <em>Dark Souls</em>, meeting Onion Knight and Solaire of Astora also required defeating one or two BOSSes, didn't it?</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter: World</em> must be the same. First, let the players get familiar with some of the game's operations, and then when facing a BOSS, his good companions from the Astera Settlement Hunter's Guild would step forward to help. Thinking this, Zhang Yi smiled and nodded, enlightened. It had to be this way, no doubt!</p>
<p>After finishing his Felyne meal, he entered the Ancient Forest entrance, following the guidance of the green Scoutflies. Soon, Zhang Yi found the target of this quest.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous Jagras, the Crown-crested Dragon in front of him looked much fiercer. The quest required him to kill 3 male Crown-crested Dragons and 5 female Crown-crested Dragons. The male Crown-crested Dragons looked relatively large, but the female ones were considerably smaller.</p>
<p>Instead of immediately confronting the largest Crown-crested Dragon, Zhang Yi sought out a few smaller ones. After all, you pick the softest persimmon first to test the waters with these dragons. There wasn't much difference from the previous Jagras; he dealt with them easily. Seeing the corpses of the Crown-crested Dragons on the ground, Zhang Yi's confidence soared. He turned to face the true targets of this quest.</p>
<p>"This armor seems to be the hardest part of the Crown-crested Dragon? My weapon bounced!"</p>
<p>Because he had encountered a few Herbivores on the way and killed them for a warm-up, plus dealing with some smaller Crown-crested Dragons earlier, the sharpness of his Great Sword had dropped from green to yellow. Moreover, this particular strike landed on a hard part of the Crown-crested Dragon, causing his weapon to bounce. His character was briefly stunned, and his weapon's durability dropped another large chunk.</p>
<p>The next moment, the Crown-crested Dragon charged Zhang Yi, knocking his character to the ground where he rolled. His health also dropped a small amount. However, despite being attacked, seeing the amount of health lost, Zhang Yi instantly became full of confidence.</p>
<p>"Is that all!? Is that all!"</p>
<p>Why be afraid of such low attack power!? Looking at his character who had only lost a tiny bit of health, Zhang Yi controlled him to get up from the ground and brazenly charged at the Crown-crested Dragon in front of him. Dodging? Not happening! Mindlessly charge up for a sword slash, whoever runs is a coward!</p>
<p>In no time, the Crown-crested Dragon fell under his Great Sword. Continuing the Crown-crested Dragon quest, Zhang Yi felt that this monster was indeed stronger than the previous Jagras. But it was only a tiny bit stronger, still not enough to be a challenge.</p>
<p>He would just charge up, slash twice, and it would die. Soon, Zhang Yi had taken down several Crown-crested Dragons, completing one of the quest objectives.</p>
<p>However, the moment he completed the objective, there was no prompt to return to the Astera Settlement like before. Instead, he entered a cutscene. The Great Jagras that had attacked him in the previous cutscene suddenly appeared from nowhere and directly swallowed the Crown-crested Dragon in front of him.</p>
<p>'New Quest: Hunt the Great Jagras'</p>
<p>As the cutscene ended, Zhang Yi received a new quest.</p>
<p>"A Great Jagras!? Is this the BOSS battle then!" Zhang Yi was a little excited. After all, the previous Small Jagras and Crown-crested Dragons had offered virtually no challenge. While it was satisfying, he still hoped for a bit of a challenge.</p>
<p>"It's a shame the demo version doesn't allow for matchmaking; otherwise, teaming up to fight a BOSS would be incredibly fun." Zhang Yi sighed with some regret.</p>
<p>He then followed the Investigation Team Leader's guidance to search for the Great Jagras's location. Unlike typical games, he needed to collect information about the monster on the ground, such as footprints or remnants. Once certain progress conditions were met, green Scoutflies would lead the hunter to find the monster.</p>
<p>This made Zhang Yi feel a bit intrigued; it gave him a sense of hunting but without being overly tedious or troublesome. Following the green Scoutflies, Zhang Yi circled twice within the Ancient Forest before spotting the Great Jagras. At this moment, the Great Jagras was lying there, seemingly resting. From its appearance, this creature looked like a giant lizard.</p>
<p>The gastric pouch, or rather, its belly, which had swallowed something earlier, was now swollen and round, like a toad's puffed-up mouth. All in all, it looked quite disgusting.</p>
<p>"This thing should be the first BOSS in the game. I wonder what its combat power is like!"</p>
<p>"But considering that it was swallowed whole by an Anjanath in the previous cutscene, it's probably a pushover." Zhang Yi judged in his mind from a distance. However, he wouldn't know for sure until he fought it.</p>
<p>Thinking this, Zhang Yi controlled his in-game hunter, ready to approach. But something rather surprising happened: as the hunter nonchalantly walked closer, the Great Jagras, which had been resting on the ground, immediately sensed something. It got up, let out a series of roars, and stared fixedly in Zhang Yi's direction.</p>
<p>Generally, when facing Crown-crested Dragons and Jagras before, they would either charge at him on sight or ignore him if he didn't attack them. But this Great Jagras was different. It didn't attack directly, nor did it ignore him; it was alert. Reason!</p>
<p>That's what Zhang Yi felt. "Is this what Nebula Games calls its AI intelligence system? It definitely feels like there's something to it!" Looking at the monster's behavior, Zhang Yi couldn't help but exclaim in admiration. Compared to before, this hunt was the first time Zhang Yi felt that this monster's AI was different from the smaller ones.</p>
<p>However, it was still a BOSS, and the first BOSS he faced in the game. With a sigh of admiration, Zhang Yi charged forward, ready to test the waters. He wanted to see if the game's difficulty would be as gentle as he expected, or if it would be a bit 'hot'.</p>
