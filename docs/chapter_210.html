                <p>Chapter 310: Hehehe! Little brother, enjoying the scan? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>The match officially began. Although Zhang Yi and Song Ren were completely unaware, Wang Han, who had found the bomb, knew. Though they still had spare drones, at this moment, none of the five had any intention of using a drone to scout further. Their spawn points varied: Song Ren and Zhang Yi spawned on the side street, Joey and Wang Yifan spawned near the construction site, and Wang Han was alone at the riverbank dock.</p>
<p>“Let’s gather at Wang Han’s position. There’s no rush to attack, we have plenty of time, and the bomb’s location is already confirmed. First, we’ll summarize our strategy, then start with a slow push.” As the team’s sole commander and designated scapegoat, Song Ren displayed remarkable rationality and caution.</p>
<p>Just then, as Song Ren was walking towards the riverbank dock, a notification suddenly appeared before him: his position had been scanned and exposed. He immediately froze, then looked around. A 20-meter scan range wasn’t exactly far, but it wasn't close either. Following a series of beeping alerts, Song Ren located a flashing defender camera and shot it down with his AUG.</p>
<p>“Who are you looking at? Haven’t you ever seen such a pretty young lady before? Peeping Tom!” Song Ren chuckled triumphantly.</p>
<p>Although, according to her in-game profile, IQ was already ‘auntie-tier’ in terms of age. But what did that matter? Her character model was simply too impressive! The blonde hair escaping her helmet and her azure eyes were utterly captivating, wasn’t it? So what if she was an auntie? As long as she was pretty enough, even a grandma wouldn't be a problem!</p>
<p>“Everyone listen up! We are professional counter-terrorism squad members, let’s show them our attitude!” Song Ren immediately started hyping them up.</p>
<p>“The in-game sounds are quite realistic. For instance, Old Zhang’s Russian Operator, with three armor and one speed, runs like a tank, immediately giving away his position. So, we need to move quietly. Although there are still footsteps, as long as you’re not pressing against a wall to listen, there won’t be much sound.” Song Ren and the others hid behind a wall, in no rush to attack, instead analyzing their tactical approach.</p>
<p>This was also a detailed feature of the VR version of Rainbow Six Siege. While silent walking still produced footsteps, they were extremely faint and inaudible without careful listening. However, if a player chose to lie prone and press their ear to the ground, or lean against the base of a wall, the reverberations could slightly amplify the sound, making it more realistic. Of course, there were pros and cons. When performing these actions, the player’s position might not be ideal.</p>
<p>“Next, Wang Yifan, you lead with your big shield. Wang Han, use your flash shield on the flank to achieve a blinding surprise attack.”</p>
<p>“Joey, as our breacher, will clear all obstacles in our way.”</p>
<p>“Old Zhang, you cover the rear. I’ll scan to prevent them from setting up any electronic traps.”</p>
<p>After about 20 seconds, Song Ren finalized the plan. Then, Wang Yifan, as the big shield, led the way, shield raised. Wang Han was second, with the remaining three following closely. They slowly moved towards the garage, like a train.</p>
<p>Soon, they arrived at the garage. “There are two drywall sections directly ahead. Smash them open, and that’s the bomb plant site!” Wang Han said.</p>
<p>Before them were two soft walls, one large and one small, neither reinforced with steel plates. Clearly, this wasn’t intentional; nor was it likely that the defenders had forgotten. They simply didn’t know. Just like Song Ren currently had no idea that these walls could be reinforced. Even though it had been taught in the tutorial, for most players, ‘you taught it’ is one thing, and ‘I forgot it’ is another. Teachers give lessons every day in school and teach so much knowledge! But I still might not know it during the exam, right?</p>
<p>“Wait, what’s that sound? Let me scan!” Song Ren was about to deploy their tactics when a ‘dududu’ sound suddenly came from behind the wall, making him confused. What sound was that?! He activated his scanner, which only deepened his confusion. Why was there a signal source in this corner, and so close?</p>
<p>A camera? Who puts a camera in a wall corner? Or did a defender pick a Black Eye, or another Operator capable of placing traps?</p>
<p>“Be careful, there might be a trap here. Should we send a drone… Hey! Wait! Why did the signal source just disappear?!” Song Ren was about to lead everyone to attack through another garage entrance when he suddenly paused, because the signal source had vanished, accompanied by a sound like clothes rustling.</p>
<p>Could it be a person? Is someone inside playing on their phone and watching a camera? But that doesn’t make sense, why the beeping sound then?</p>
<p>While Song Ren was bewildered, the signal suddenly reappeared, accompanied by a ‘kacha’ sound and a series of beeps. At the same time, just behind the drywall, a bald, sunglasses-wearing, cool-looking Operator was crouched, scanning the wall, utterly motionless.</p>
<p>If this were reality, one would surely see the sweat beading on his forehead. Guarding the wall, he was still accustomed to old-school FPS gameplay, lurking in a corner like a sneaky camper. Hearing no movement for a long time, he idly pulled out his Heartbeat Sensor, which was, after all, permanently usable. Like a camera, he scanned left and right. But as he scanned, the ‘didididi’ sound began. Pointing it at the wall, five red heart signal points immediately appeared outside. It scared him stiff. He quickly turned off the Heartbeat Sensor and notified his teammates.</p>
<p>“123 calling teammates, there are five of them outside the door! Hurry and help me! ABC, why did you run to the second floor?!” Pulse, hiding in the corner, called out to his teammates. The other teammates, currently prone-camping on the ground, were shocked to hear this: all five were outside the garage wall? Receiving the information, the group slowly moved towards the garage, afraid to make even the slightest sound.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the player controlling the bald uncle, Pulse, was also a bit puzzled. Why was there no movement from the other side? He pulled out the Heartbeat Sensor again and scanned; they were still there! Was it a bug? Just as he was wondering, a ‘kacha’ sound came from the wall, as if something was embedded in it, accompanied by a clear, rather pleasant sound.</p>
<p>‘Dong… dong… dong… dong… dong!’ Then came. ‘BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!’ The entire screen shook from the blast, and the aftermath of the explosion instantly reduced his health to single digits. Fortunately, in this round, they had chosen Operator Rook, who could provide armor plates to teammates, effectively boosting their health and preventing immediate death. But his teammate, who was also defending in the garage, hiding behind a tarp-covered car, wasn’t so lucky and was instantly blown away.</p>
<p>Before he could recover, there was another loud bang. The fragile drywall was instantly blown open by a breaching charge, and from the wooden plank passage on the right, came the sound of a breaching hammer smashing through planks.</p>
<p>From the front, the big shield and flash shield led the charge, pushing in first, while Fuze, holding a secondary shield, held the passage on his own. “Hehehe! Little brother, enjoying the scan?!”</p>
<p>Performing a pre-fire, Song Ren finished off Pulse in the corner, letting out a laugh worthy of a major villain. (End of Chapter)</p>
