                <h3>Chapter 46: Being Down-to-Earth Doesn't Mean Going to the Underworld!</h3>
<p>Contacting the Motion Capture Studio to produce various assets.</p>
<p>At the same time, Chen Xu led the entire team in the development of <em>Outlast</em>.</p>
<p>The cost of this game was not low, but not as high as imagined either.</p>
<p>After completing the Budget Report, the total development cost of the game, including subsequent Promotional Costs, was tentatively set at 6 million Yuan.</p>
<p>Of course, it might increase a bit, but it wouldn't exceed 8 million Yuan.</p>
<p>For a Horror Game, this figure is quite substantial within its genre.</p>
<p>Naturally, everyone in the team was very excited. After all, this was their first major project.</p>
<hr />
<p>Time passed day by day.</p>
<p>Art, actions – assets were steadily being produced. The Story Dialogue for the game was also completed, awaiting secondary Voice Acting.</p>
<p>Various actions for the protagonist in the game were also undergoing trial and error.</p>
<p>"Now I'm starting to feel a little creepy. How terrifying will the finished product be!"</p>
<p>In the office, Ruan Ningxue sat in front of her computer, looking at the Concept Design Art on the secondary screen, still feeling lingering fear.</p>
<p>These Concept Design Art pieces mainly depicted scenes: a dark asylum building, scenes filled with blood and corpses, a psychiatric patient hiding under a hospital bed in a dark room, and footage shot with DV Night Vision Mode.</p>
<p>These few pieces of Concept Art perfectly showcased the eerie atmosphere of <em>Outlast</em>. Let alone playing, just looking at them sent shivers down one's spine.</p>
<p>During the development of <em>Outlast</em>, she had been sleeping quite late every night. Why? Fear!</p>
<p>That day, she didn't know what she was thinking, but she actually took the DV Chen Xu gave her and tried it out at night. The extremely eerie, underworld-like atmosphere immediately unsettled her.</p>
<p>After all, self-imagination and self-scaring are the most terrifying things.</p>
<p>Of course, precisely because of this, the Concept Art designs she created, following Chen Xu's requirements, were very impactful.</p>
<p>"That's right! And in the game, players can't fight back; they can only run away," Yang Xin, sitting nearby, also exclaimed, listening to Ruan Ningxue.</p>
<p>Chen Xu, who was busy with an action design, smiled: "Isn't that exciting? Plus, if there were guns, it would easily turn into an FPS game. After all, fear stems from insufficient firepower, doesn't it?"</p>
<p>Why do general Horror Games include firearms? On one hand, it's to enrich the game content; on the other, it provides players with a suitable outlet for release.</p>
<p>This approach is actually very suitable. The <em>Resident Evil</em> series in his previous life adopted this model.</p>
<p>But doing so also has significant drawbacks: it easily turns Horror Games into FPS games. After all, fear comes from insufficient firepower; with enough firepower, fear can be suppressed.</p>
<p>This is precisely where the <em>Resident Evil</em> series in his previous life gradually went astray. From the fourth generation onwards, it leaned towards shooting, until the remakes returned to the path of horror, and <em>Resident Evil Village</em> perfected the overall pacing to a remarkable degree.</p>
<p>Of course, for most players, their focus wasn't on how terrifying the game was or how good the pacing was. All their attention was drawn to Lady Dimitrescu and her three daughters.</p>
<p>"But Mr. Chen, when will we start the pre-release hype for <em>Outlast</em>? I see many players online asking about news of the new game," Yang Xin said.</p>
<p>Unlike before, when the R&amp;D department only consisted of the three of them, now with new employees joining the company, they formally addressed Chen Xu as "Mr. Chen" instead of just calling each other by name.</p>
<p>"Yes, the development progress feels very fast. It should be ready for launch around December," Ruan Ningxue added.</p>
<p><em>Outlast</em>'s scale isn't very large. The main workload is concentrated on various actions and Art asset production. This is because the Gameplay Mode is incredibly fast, with almost no trial-and-error content.</p>
<p>Development has been smooth sailing.</p>
<p>"There's no rush for paid promotion and pre-release hype for now. We'll start in mid-to-late November."</p>
<p>"Currently, my official Weibo account has quite a few followers. Also, have you forgotten what day tomorrow is?" Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>What day?</p>
<p>Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue paused, then looked at the bottom right corner of their computer desktops: October 30th?</p>
<p>"It's Halloween! I've already recorded the Pre-release Promotional Materials in advance, specifically waiting for this day to announce them on the holiday."</p>
<p>"After all, players have been anticipating it for a month. Announcing news of our new game on this holiday, isn't that quite down-to-earth?"</p>
<p>Chen Xu said to Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue with a smile, while clicking on a short video he had on his desktop.</p>
<p>The video wasn't long, only ten seconds in total. Initially, the screen was completely dark. The next moment, a picture appeared on the screen, but it wasn't a normal picture.</p>
<p>It was DV Night Vision Mode, with a battery indicator visible in the upper right corner, and a red dot constantly flashing in the upper left corner, indicating the DV was Recording.</p>
<p>The DV footage was Chen Xu's office. Chairs were overturned on the ground, and various documents on the desk were deliberately scattered. The entire video was completely silent.</p>
<p>Combined with the DV night vision footage, it felt incredibly eerie and unsettling.</p>
<p>In the ninth second of playback, the DV's screen suddenly trembled, as if the person filming had been attacked, yet eerily, there was still no sound at all. Then the entire video finished playing and plunged into darkness.</p>
<p>The office was silent. Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue looked at Chen Xu for a long time without saying a word.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, I think 'down-to-earth' shouldn't extend to the underworld," Ruan Ningxue finally said slowly to Chen Xu after a long pause.</p>
<p>This pre-release hype clearly told players that they were about to develop a Horror Game. But the key question was, could this pre-release method be called </p>
