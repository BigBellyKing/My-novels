                <p>Chapter 39: Then We'll Always Meet on the Moon</p>
<p>The background music in the game, for the first time, changed from pure instrumental to a themed song with lyrics.</p>
<p>"Everything's Alright."</p>
<p>It was as if it sang Liva's innermost feelings.</p>
<p>Accomp anied by the sorrowful melody, Liva was gradually removed from Johnny's life.</p>
<p>On the steps of the teaching building where Johnny thought he first met Liva.</p>
<p>The platypus, and Liva sitting on the steps, were gone, leaving only a book about lighthouses rustling in the wind.</p>
<p>Here, Johnny's good friend Nicolas walked through the corridor.</p>
<p>Inside the library, Liva was no longer there, replaced by Joey. The two brothers talked about Transformers and aerospace.</p>
<p>The copy of "The Emperor's New Clothes" that Liva liked was covered in dust.</p>
<p>In front of the cinema where Johnny and Liva had watched movies together, Johnny and his brother Joey walked in, laughing joyfully.</p>
<p>Yes, Liva was removed.</p>
<p>But Eva altered Johnny's memories, replacing Liva with his brother Joey.</p>
<p>At the same time, constant hints and guidance shaped Johnny's dream and goal: to become an astronaut.</p>
<p>Without Liva, with Joey by his side, Johnny.</p>
<p>His future was completely changed.</p>
<p>The horse ranch where Johnny and Liva once galloped together was empty at this point in time.</p>
<p>In front of the lighthouse named Anya, there were only countless weeds, and no trace of the couple who were once there.</p>
<p>Even the rabbit that was hit and killed during their wedding was gone.</p>
<p>In Johnny's memory, his future had been completely altered.</p>
<p>Through continuous training and study.</p>
<p>Finally, Johnny received an employment offer from the Space Agency and visited the Space Agency.</p>
<p>His goal was now within reach.</p>
<p>'Going to the moon,' this goal seemed to be only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Everything Eva did seemed to be working.</p>
<p>But all the players and viewers were silent.</p>
<p>Yes, Johnny would soon be able to go to the moon.</p>
<p>Eva and Neil were also about to complete their mission.</p>
<p>But was this ending truly what Johnny wanted?</p>
<p>Going to the moon, but without Liva.</p>
<p>Did it really have any meaning?</p>
<p>In the future memories Johnny fantasized about, they arrived at the Space Agency.</p>
<p>At this moment, Dong Zhen, and all the players who had reached this point in the game.</p>
<p>Were merely mechanically operating the game characters.</p>
<p>Suffering, there was only one feeling: suffering!</p>
<p>But as Eva and Neil arrived at the Space Agency and toured with Johnny.</p>
<p>'She's not here either...'</p>
<p>'What are you talking about?'</p>
<p>'Anyway, let's go.'</p>
<p>Accompanying Neil and Eva's conversation, Dong Zhen seemed to discover something different.</p>
<p>"Wait! You old hag!"</p>
<p>"This old hag seems to be looking for something!"</p>
<p>In the waiting room, thinking about what had just happened and Eva's words, Dong Zhen had a bold conjecture, one he hoped was true.</p>
<p>But before he could say it in his live stream.</p>
<p>The previously sorrowful game background music suddenly fell silent, replaced by a heartbeat sound.</p>
<p>Cheerful background music began to play.</p>
<p>A girl with an orange-red ponytail appeared at the doorway.</p>
<p>'Ah! This is also our new recruit, Liva, isn't it? It's great you could come.' The unnamed Space Agency director said.</p>
<p>'Hello, I'm Johnny.' Johnny stepped forward to greet her, just as he had before.</p>
<p>At the same time, the last memory fragment was finally collected.</p>
<p>Eva, standing by the window, let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>'Phew! I almost thought she was gone.'</p>
<p>'What are you doing? Eva! But you... deleted her!' Neil said incredulously.</p>
<p>'No, I told you, I merely relocated her. How she plans her life is still up to... her.'</p>
<p>'This new world... is built based on public data and Johnny's personal beliefs. Since Liva belongs to an individual, her data would not have been recorded in public data.'</p>
<p>Accompanying Eva's explanation, Neil also understood: 'So... this entirely comes from Johnny...'</p>
<p>Yes, Liva still came!</p>
<p>Even though their lives had changed, even though Johnny and Liva had no interaction before.</p>
<p>Yet, in this fictional world, Johnny still remembered that promise.</p>
<p>'What if we get lost? Then we'll meet on the moon, silly!'</p>
<p>Yes, they would eventually meet again on the moon.</p>
<p>The tears Dong Zhen had held back earlier threatened to well up again.</p>
<p>In the Space Agency, that tune was no longer "To Liva."</p>
<p>It had a brand new name: "To the Moon."</p>
<p>In the hall, watching Johnny play the piano, Liva murmured from the audience: 'I like that name.'</p>
<p>............</p>
<p>In Johnny's fabricated memory, the two underwent years of training and preparation.</p>
<p>Finally, the rocket was almost ready for launch.</p>
<p>Neil and Eva also invited Lily, Johnny's caregiver, and his doctor, among others, to witness this moment.</p>
<p>Under the sunset, countless people stood on the Cross-river Bridge, watching the rocket launch site in the distance.</p>
<p>With a rumbling sound, the rocket launched.</p>
<p>At the same time, a heartbeat sound came.</p>
<p>A very dull heartbeat.</p>
<p>This was the heartbeat of the critically ill Johnny in reality.</p>
<p>He was about to leave this world.</p>
<p>To the tune of the piano piece "To the Moon," the rocket ascended.</p>
<p>Ahead was their destination – the moon.</p>
<p>Inside the rocket, Johnny and Liva looked at each other in unison.</p>
<p>Then their hands gently clasped together.</p>
<p>"Then we'll always meet on the moon, silly!"</p>
<p>As the moon appeared, the screen went dark.</p>
<p>The next moment, Johnny's past memories flashed by like a revolving lantern.</p>
<p>Watching these memories, recalling Johnny and Liva's story in the game.</p>
<p>Finally, Dong Zhen, in front of his computer, couldn't hold back his emotions. He covered his face with his hands, then pulled a tissue from beside him.</p>
<p>It wasn't his nose he was wiping, but his eyes.</p>
<p>'Damn, damn, damn! Tough guy crying a second time!'</p>
<p>'What the heck, I'm bawling my eyes out!'</p>
<p>'Can't see the screen through my tears!'</p>
<p>'What if you really get lost? Then we'll meet on the moon, silly!'</p>
<p>'What if you really get lost? Then we'll meet on the moon, silly!'</p>
<p>As the game's final credits screen appeared.</p>
<p>In Dong Zhen's live stream, the bullet comments gradually turned into this same phrase.</p>
<p>At this moment, everyone was moved by the game's plot.</p>
<p>Everyone had even forgotten.</p>
<p>This was actually a game participating in a Sci-Fi Game Design Competition.</p>
<p>No one was thinking about whether it truly counted as a sci-fi game anymore.</p>
<p>Everyone was immersed in the story of Johnny and Liva.</p>
<p>Thanks to 'Caiji 2016' for the 1500 reward.</p>
