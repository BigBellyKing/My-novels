                <p>Chapter 211: Promotional Warm-up (Seeking Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Days passed one by one, and Nebula Games began its promotional warm-up for Minecraft.</p>
<p>While players and industry designers were discussing this wave of sandbox trend.</p>
<p>Chen Xu's official Weibo post instantly drew the attention of countless players and industry designers.</p>
<p>Chen Xu's official Weibo post was very simple, containing only three words: New Game.</p>
<p>Following this, a video link was released.</p>
<p>However, upon clicking it, players who had been full of anticipation and curiosity were instantly stunned.</p>
<p>Because it was simply too unexpected for them.</p>
<p>With a melodious BGM, the game screen appeared.</p>
<p>Blue skies and white clouds, oceans, trees, and beaches—under the distant sunset, a small figure rode a pink pig, running towards the foreground.</p>
<p>'Let's go to a world made of blocks.'</p>
<p>As the narration began, countless blocks formed a slide, allowing the block character and the little pink pig to move along it.</p>
<p>'The only limit is your imagination.'</p>
<p>The next moment, the slide collapsed in the middle, scattering blocks, but behind the block figure, red, cape-like wings unfolded, soaring through forests and over mountains.</p>
<p>'Let's go anywhere you want, climb the highest peaks, dig the deepest caves.'</p>
<p>On the beach, the block figure held a cube, placing it down.</p>
<p>'Build anything you want, whether it's day or night, rainy or sunny.'</p>
<p>Gazing into the distance in the desert.</p>
<p>'This will be the most meaningful sandbox game you've ever stepped into.'</p>
<p>The next moment, the scene shifted to a giant castle.</p>
<p>'Build a magnificent castle.'</p>
<p>Inside a mine filled with torches, a winding railway track.</p>
<p>'Research the most advanced machines, take a rollercoaster ride.'</p>
<p>In the forest, several block figures continuously chopped down trees with axes.</p>
<p>'You can play with your friends, build your own community, and craft the strongest armor to protect yourselves.'</p>
<p>In the dark of night, facing monsters that appeared in the forest, the block figures donned armor and charged forward with swords.</p>
<p>'Fight monsters at night; no one can restrict your actions.'</p>
<p>Continuously digging tunnels, magma poured in from underground.</p>
<p>Creating dark, mysterious portals, behind which lay an eerie world.</p>
<p>'No rules to obey; this adventure is yours to decide.'</p>
<p>Accompanied by the narration, the camera slowly moved to the deep blue sea, where a whale made of blocks suddenly emerged from the surface.</p>
<p>Countless blocks formed the game's LOGO and title: </p>
