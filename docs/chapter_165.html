                <p>Chapter 264: You Can Actually Skip Difficulty Like This! (Please subscribe for monthly passes)</p>
<p>There was no doubt that the Long Sword's performance was incredibly cool and flashy.</p>
<p>And in terms of hunting time, it only took about 6 minutes from starting the fight to successfully completing it. It could be said to be quite efficient.</p>
<p>However, many players were still dissatisfied.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, you showed off for nothing!”</p>
<p>“Exactly, exactly! Mr. Chen, if that's the Long Sword's normal operation, wouldn't we all be handicapped?”</p>
<p>“+1!”</p>
<p>Players in the live stream flooded the screen with bullet comments.</p>
<p>Chen Xu said, “Well… skills can be practiced, right? After all, not everyone is born a master.”</p>
<p>“Besides, look at the Long Sword. Isn't it incredibly cool? So graceful and fluid?”</p>
<p>“Such a cool weapon, in anime and manga, is basically always wielded by the protagonist. And you've seen its efficiency in hunting monsters; there's no way its damage is low. It has both a very high ceiling and a very high floor. It's impossible for a weapon to be cool, high-damage, and easy to use. <em>That</em> would be truly unbalanced, wouldn't you agree?” Chen Xu said earnestly.</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu’s words, the Long Sword players watching the live stream were stunned.</p>
<p>So logical! They couldn't find a single point to refute!</p>
<p>“Of course, in the game, there are also weapons more suitable for novice players. And remember to make good use of items!” Chen Xu continued.</p>
<p>Returning to the Workshop area, Chen Xu changed into a set of Tao Chuang clothes, then equipped a Healing Smoke Bomb, crafted a Gunlance, and ate a Felyne Canteen meal for increased defense, before once again heading to Diablos's nest.</p>
<p>“If you're simply aiming to defeat the BOSS, I highly recommend novice players choose the Gunlance, as it's very reliable. As long as your defense is sufficient, you'll be fine. Furthermore, its shelling ignores Hitzone hitzones, and in the later stages, you only need to increase your Artillery skill for damage.”</p>
<p>After entering combat, under everyone's astonished gaze, Chen Xu faced Diablos's digging attack without dodging or evading, simply holding his shield steady.</p>
<p>Next, Diablos burst out from underground, crashing heavily into the shield, but the Hunter in the game only recoiled a small step, and the health bar in the upper left corner only dropped by a tiny segment.</p>
<p>Facing a roar, he raised his shield, then fired.</p>
<p>Facing a Dragon Charge, he raised his shield, then fired.</p>
<p>Facing a two-hit headbutt, he raised his shield, then fired.</p>
<p>He placed a Healing Smoke Bomb on the ground, kept his shield up the whole time, and just went “boom, boom, boom.”</p>
<p>When his health was low, his Palico would also deliver Vigorwasps. If things got really bad, he would disengage, create distance, drink a recovery potion, and continue.</p>
<p>With the Gunlance's shelling, Diablos's long horns soon broke.</p>
<p>The players watching the live stream were also surprised. Why did this game suddenly feel so easy!?</p>
<p>Unlike the Long Sword's various flashy Foresight Slash Helm Breakers earlier, everyone felt that the Gunlance required absolutely no skill. When the opponent attacked, raise the shield, then fire.</p>
<p>It felt like playing a watered-down version of Dark Souls. Hold up a large shield, then get two hits in after the opponent's attack.</p>
<p>It completely transformed an action game into a turn-based game.</p>
<p>After about sixteen minutes of shelling, accompanied by Diablos's wail, the words “Hunt Completed” appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>“See? It's that simple. Besides the Gunlance, the Lance can also do it. However, unlike the Gunlance's Wyvern's Fire which ignores Hitzone hitzones, the Lance requires precise thrusts and has some damage requirements. Of course, as long as you have patience, you can still poke the monster to death.” These shielded weapons basically follow the same routine.”</p>
<p>“Besides that, for ranged weapons, everyone should pay attention to the Light Bowgun, which can accumulate Slicing Ammo.”</p>
<p>“However, its downsides are that it's quite expensive and time-consuming to gather materials.” As he spoke, Chen Xu demonstrated each method in turn.</p>
<p>Under the bewildered gaze of the players, Chen Xu switched to the Light Bowgun, brought in a stack of Slicing Berries and Slicing Ammo.</p>
<p>From a long distance, he fired three Slicing Ammo into Diablos.</p>
<p>After one or two seconds, the Slicing Ammo exploded.</p>
<p>A series of numbers burst forth from Diablos's body.</p>
<p>Diablos was startled awake and launched a Dragon Charge at the Hunter.</p>
<p>But at long range, two quick rolls were enough to dodge it.</p>
<p>Then it was a back-and-forth cycle. Fire Slicing Ammo, and when Diablos dug underground, immediately throw a Screamer Pod.</p>
<p>Similarly, after about sixteen or seventeen minutes, with a wail from Diablos, the hunt was successful.</p>
<p>The previous Long Sword demonstration fully showcased just how high the weapon's ceiling was. Players who mastered it could achieve explosive damage output and incredibly graceful movements.</p>
<p>But all players understood that those were feats only achievable by masters. It was like how Dark Souls wasn't <em>impossible</em> to play like a hack-and-slash game.</p>
<p>But for most ordinary players, it remained a punishing game.</p>
<p>However, the weapons demonstrated later were different! Especially the Gunlance and Light Bowgun; they felt utterly mindless, giving many players the thought, “I can do that too!”</p>
<p>Compared to being brutalized by Diablos before, this had opened a door to a new world for all players. Even without relying on skill, it turns out you could pass so easily by utilizing game mechanics!</p>
<p>Instantly, countless Hunters who were still struggling were shocked.</p>
<p>“Oh my god, is this Diablos <em>really</em> the Diablos I know!?”</p>
<p>“I don't know why, but I suddenly feel a little sorry for this Diablos!”</p>
<p>“The Gunlance can actually be played like this! Coupled with that Healing Smoke Bomb, it's incredibly useful!”</p>
<p>“Haha, I passed, I passed! I passed using the Gunlance! It's simply too effective!”</p>
<p>“I tried it too, but my gear isn't good enough and my defense isn't high enough. Diablos still hits me pretty hard.”</p>
<p>“That last Slicing Ammo was too strong, wasn't it!?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, and the cost of Slicing Ammo doesn't seem that high. It's just a bit troublesome to get Slicing Berries and the Light Bowgun.”</p>
<p>“Although the damage isn't particularly high, it feels incredibly mindless!”</p>
<p>Many players watching the live stream expressed their surprise, and some impatient players even started experimenting themselves while watching. Following the steps throughout, although the process was a bit tedious, they actually cleared it!</p>
<p>In his previous life, there were actually many ways to skip difficulty in <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>.</p>
<p>Among them, the most renowned was undoubtedly the Slicing Ammo cult.</p>
<p>Gear builds involving Rathalos and the Corpse Dragon, combined with the explosive damage of Slicing Ammo, pushed simple, mindless gameplay to the extreme.</p>
<p>Perhaps the pure damage wasn't the highest, but it was absolutely the easiest to pick up and the most mindless.</p>
<p>You could easily get a bunch of Slicing Ammo, and if you ran out, you could always return to camp for resupply.</p>
<p>Coupled with a unique buff, it directly rendered other ammunition types completely inferior to Slicing Ammo.</p>
<p>As a result of this gear build being too overpowered, it was directly nerfed into oblivion. Too overpowered, or nerfed into oblivion.</p>
<p>In Chen Xu's view, both were too extreme.</p>
<p>And the biggest function of Slicing Ammo itself was actually to cut tails, supplementing the lack of cutting damage for ranged weapons.</p>
<p>So, Chen Xu still retained the Slicing Ammo playstyle. However, it was kept at a relatively low level; don't even think about speedrunning BOSSes with this simple trick. It's just a small trick to skip difficulty.</p>
<p>As for the weapons that allow players to skip difficulty, it would actually be easy to modify them, but why modify them?</p>
<p>Moreover, these methods of skipping difficulty are mostly only effective in single-player.</p>
<p>In a team, Slicing Ammo, for example, is a team cancer. If you use it, your fate will be worse than a Longsword Hero.</p>
<p>Just like those who master the Dark Left-Right Spreadshot cult, players would rather team up with a Longsword Hero than with you.</p>
<p>If you played with the Slicing Ammo cult or the Spreadshot cult, without teammates who genuinely liked you, or who were fellow cult members, then you were destined to be a lonely old Hunter.</p>
<p>Of course, it was also possible that while you were fighting, your other three teammates were exchanging barbecue tips from a distance.</p>
<p>As for the Gunlance and Lance, when you're teamed up, holding your shield, waiting for the monster's Dragon Charge, your nearby teammates might ‘accidentally’ hit you. Happy? Surprised?</p>
<p>As for whether these tactics would allow players to always skip difficulty and always feel good, eventually losing the fun of the game, Chen Xu wasn't worried about that either.</p>
<p>In reality, for a grinding game like <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, clearing the game is just the beginning. The various weapon builds and tactical playstyles in the later stages are the core gameplay.</p>
<p>Constantly challenging hunting speeds and farming decorations, it's easy to sink hundreds of hours into the game without even realizing it.</p>
<p>What's more, with the use of game AI performance technology, the subsequent Tempered monsters would be completely different from those in his previous life.</p>
<p>In his previous life, so-called Tempered monsters merely had increased attack and attack frequency. It was purely a numerical change, making the players' margin of error very low.</p>
<p>It was precisely for this reason that the Slicing Ammo cult was so prevalent in his previous life; after all, it was just a matter of mindlessly attacking.</p>
<p>But now? Players who liked to skip difficulty, if they weren't the type to quit after clearing the game but rather those who played continuously, would sooner or later have to make up for the ‘lessons’ when facing Tempered monsters.</p>
<p>What awaited them would be a harsh reality check.</p>
