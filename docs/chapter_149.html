                <p>Chapter 248: This Game is So Easy! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>After traversing a forest path, Zhang Yi couldn't help but exclaim in admiration.</p>
<p>In the distance lay a beach and the lush Ancient Forest, with many Aptonoth gathered on the sands. These Aptonoth were clustered in groups of three to five, each with a long, hammer-like tail. Ignoring the Investigation Team Leader who was waving at him ahead, Zhang Yi ran straight towards an Aptonoth drinking water in the distance.</p>
<p>“I'll start by practicing on you!”</p>
<p>Looking at the Aptonoth before him, Zhang Yi felt a surge of excitement. After all, this was his first actual combat hunt; all his previous moves had been practiced on training dummies.</p>
<p>As Zhang Yi approached, the Aptonoth, still drinking water, seemed oblivious to the impending danger. From previous introductions to <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, Zhang Yi knew that these Aptonoth never attacked proactively; they were docile creatures. Clearly, their purpose was to allow players to practice.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi swung his Great Sword at the Aptonoth and charged it. As a damage number popped up, the Aptonoth let out a cry of pain and retaliated with its tail hammer, attempting to flee. Other Aptonoth nearby immediately scattered in terror. Despite being struck by the Aptonoth's tail, the Hunter's hyper armor state during the charged attack prevented any movement, and the damage was negligible. With a second strong charged swing, the Aptonoth let out another wail and was defeated instantly.</p>
<p>“Indeed, the Great Sword is truly divine! I barely put in any effort, and you're already down!”</p>
<p>Zhang Yi's face was beaming with excitement. This Aptonoth, judging by its size, was as sturdy as two bulls. Yet, he hadn't expected it to be so fragile; the Great Sword's damage was simply explosive!</p>
<p>Even though he knew this monster was just for players to test their blades on, the type that wouldn't fight back or talk back, Zhang Yi still felt a thrill. Especially the Great Sword in his hand—its damage far exceeded his imagination. After just two or three hits, the Aptonoth was gone.</p>
<p>With every strike, the in-game sound effects and action feedback made it feel as if the Great Sword was truly cleaving into flesh. It was incredibly satisfying. As for gore, <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> didn't feature much bloody imagery. While it was a hunting game, making players hack monsters to a bloody mess, and even dismember them afterward, would have been excessive. So, there were appropriate wounds during hunts to enhance player immersion, but without pursuing realism.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game included a damage display system, allowing players to see the damage they inflicted. This system was enabled by default, though it could be turned off to further enhance immersion. It was enabled by default primarily to help players familiarize themselves with the game, as <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> featured Hitzones and weak points on different body parts. Damage indicators made it easier for players to distinguish these differences. Of course, for most current Hunter players, this was completely useless. After all, what good was knowing the weak points if you couldn't hit them? It would still be a matter of hitting legs and backs. Which experienced Hunter didn't evolve from being a 'Foot Massage Master' and 'Back Scrubber Master' first? Hitzones? Weak points? Completely clueless! One word: just charge in first!</p>
<p>After a brief moment of excitement, Zhang Yi sheathed his Great Sword to collect his spoils. He also pulled out his Whetstone to sharpen his Great Sword, restoring its sharpness to full.</p>
<p>Despite taking down his first hunt. After a brief period of excitement, Zhang Yi's mood quickly returned to normal. He knew very well that the Aptonoth was specifically designed for players to practice on. There was practically no chance of failing to defeat it. In such a situation, there was naturally no sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>It was like in <em>Dark Souls</em>, where defeating the Gundyr the Ash BOSS at the beginning brought an overwhelming sense of accomplishment, mainly because he knew that BOSS was a huge challenge for him at the time. He had painstakingly honed his skills through countless hardships before finally defeating that BOSS. Or in some RPG games, where players would painstakingly level up and craft equipment to clear a BOSS due to insufficient stats, which also brought joy and a sense of accomplishment. But now, taking down an Aptonoth that didn't fight back or talk back, and was only slightly stronger than a training dummy—if that could bring a sense of accomplishment, then nothing could.</p>
<p>So, at this moment, Zhang Yi mostly felt that he hadn't chosen the wrong weapon. This Great Sword was simply too powerful. Charged attacks with hyper armor, and off-the-charts damage. It truly lived up to being the protagonist Hunter's weapon in the promotional video. Unlike the three Longsword Heroes at the end of the previous promotional video, who clearly seemed like cannon fodder-level Hunters.</p>
<p>“It’s just that this Aptonoth is a bit too fragile!”</p>
<p>Carrying his Great Sword, he didn't immediately follow the green Scoutflies to find the Investigation Team Leader and complete the main quest, as fifty minutes seemed more than ample time. With the Great Sword on his back, Zhang Yi found and eliminated two more Aptonoth, one after another.</p>
<p>He also wandered around the outskirts of the Ancient Forest and discovered some very interesting things. On the game's large map, there were many interactive elements. Various fruits and foods could be gathered, and even insects and animals on the ground could be captured. He had just used his net to catch a grey Detour Rabbit.</p>
<p>After wandering for half a day, Zhang Yi finally followed the green Scoutflies through a small path and reached the quest location: Jagras's Den.</p>
<p>As soon as he poked his head in, Zhang Yi saw a group of juvenile Jagras, with some larger ones nearby. “So many!” Seeing the pile of Jagras in front of him, Zhang Yi subconsciously felt a little panicked. This was a lingering effect from playing <em>Dark Souls</em>. You see, the most terrifying thing in <em>Dark Souls</em> wasn't seeing a BOSS, but seeing a bunch of small monsters. However, once Zhang Yi actually started fighting, he realized he had worried too much.</p>
<p>“My health bar isn't Photoshopped on anymore! It's so sturdy!”</p>
<p>Accustomed to the <em>Dark Souls</em> health bar that shattered on impact, Zhang Yi instantly grew excited seeing his health barely drop after these juvenile Jagras attacked him in <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>. What did this mean? It meant that <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> was indeed not a high-difficulty game like <em>Dark Souls</em>! The feedback Zhang Yi got from striking the Jagras with his Great Sword further confirmed this. One charged strike knocked the Jagras down, and two more hits finished it off. Monsters barely chipped his health, while he could take them down in two or three hits—this was like becoming a BOSS himself!</p>
<p>Moreover, there were some firefly-like entities in the cave; interacting with them triggered an effect like a flashbang, blinding the Jagras. At this point, the Great Sword's mindless charging was enough, one hit, one child. And his Palico even helped him out—invincible! He'd never felt so satisfied. This game was so easy! It was actually a hack-and-slash game!</p>
