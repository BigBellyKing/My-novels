                <p>Chapter 231: Nebula Games Platform Transformation (Requesting Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>On the official Weibo account, Chen Xu also announced the mobile and VR versions of <em>Minecraft</em> in advance.</p>
<p>They were scheduled to launch on March 31st.</p>
<p>Of course, this was mainly due to the special nature of April 1st. That's why it was set for March 31st; otherwise, it would have been quite meaningful as a two-month anniversary for <em>Minecraft</em>'s launch.</p>
<p>As for the pricing, it also came as a pleasant surprise to many players. The VR version was priced at 148 Yuan, or 29.9 US dollars overseas. For the mobile version, purchasing either the PC or VR version would automatically activate it. Naturally, if players didn't want to buy the PC or VR version and only wished to play the mobile version, they could purchase it separately. It was priced at 28 Yuan; however, players who had bought the mobile version and later wanted to acquire the PC or VR version only needed to pay the remaining balance. This pricing strategy had countless players exclaiming, “It's so good!”</p>
<p>Similarly, after the announcement of the VR and mobile versions, Chen Xu didn't pay too much attention. After all, with the PC version's sales figures, the VR version's sales couldn't possibly be bad. Moreover, compared to the pricing of games on VR platforms, <em>Minecraft</em> at 148 Yuan could almost be considered a cabbage-level price.</p>
<p>However, in contrast to Chen Xu's calm demeanor, the rest of the designers and media in the gaming industry were scrutinizing this area, highly concerned about its data.</p>
<p>The next day, Nebula Games did not release the relevant data as it had with the PC version's <em>Minecraft</em> sales. However, a third-party statistical company immediately compiled the figures. The VR version of <em>Minecraft</em> sold 2.41 million copies domestically. The mobile version of <em>Minecraft</em> sold 1.52 million copies domestically.</p>
<p>April Fool's Day?!</p>
<p>Many industry designers and media outlets who were paying attention were a bit bewildered. This number was simply too unexpected.</p>
<p>The VR version, however, wasn't all that surprising. According to data compiled by the Game Department, the current number of VR users in the country is approximately 30 million. But in reality, this 30 million is certainly an underestimate. The reason is that this data counts the activation volume of VR gaming pods. That is, VR gaming pods that have been activated and used. But the key is that not every player has purchased a gaming pod; VR experience stores and similar venues also account for a large proportion. The gaming pods in these experience stores are fixed, but the players using them are different. So, the actual number of potential user players is far higher than this data suggests. Previously, <em>Minecraft</em> on the PC platform sold like crazy, and it continues to maintain a very hot momentum even now. For the VR version, which offers a better experience and isn't particularly expensive, to sell so many copies isn't actually that surprising.</p>
<p>What was truly surprising, however, was the mobile version. These statistics represent sales, not the number of players! This means there are over a million players who haven't purchased the PC version; these are all entirely new player groups.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>However, while the industry was embroiled in various forms of self-doubt, Chen Xu at Nebula Games was currently contemplating more important matters. Furthermore, on the monitor in front of Chen Xu, the games currently under Nebula Games' banner were displayed: <em>Mirror</em> (crossed out), <em>Undertale</em>, <em>To the Moon</em>, <em>Overcooked</em>, <em>Sanguosha</em>, <em>Fall Guys</em>, <em>Outlast</em>, <em>Dark Souls</em>, <em>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</em>, <em>It Takes Two</em>, <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em>, as well as <em>Don't Starve</em> and <em>Minecraft</em>... hmm, the one with the big hammer (referring to <em>Getting Over It</em>) was temporarily excluded by Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Up until now, the Nebula Games Platform had a total of twelve prominent games. Simultaneously, these games enjoyed immense popularity within the player base. For a game store, Nebula Games was already very successful, much like Battle.net in his previous life. But for Chen Xu, he clearly had no intention of stopping there. A mere integrated platform for his own games was never Chen Xu's goal; he had always aimed for comprehensive digital platforms like Steam Platform and GOG from his previous life.</p>
<p>102 million registered users, 23 million daily active users, 77 million monthly active users, and an average peak concurrent users of 8.17 million. This was primarily due to the recent surge in popularity of <em>Minecraft</em>, which boosted Nebula Games' active user data. Regardless, these figures clearly indicated one thing: Nebula Games had developed into a game store with significant influence.</p>
<p>Now that its wings were fully fledged, and the launch of <em>Minecraft</em> was originally part of this plan. Chen Xu had also discussed this content with Zhang Yida from the Marketing and Operations Department long ago. Now, leveraging <em>Minecraft</em>'s influence, Nebula Games could finally take this step.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>April 15th.</p>
<p>Although it was a Sunday, all Nebula Games employees were at their respective posts today.</p>
<p>On major game media websites and within game communities, the related hot topic was still <em>Minecraft</em>. But soon, the top spot was taken over by the term 'Nebula Games'. Many players who opened the Nebula Games Platform, preparing to enter <em>Minecraft</em>, were stunned as the platform launched and they saw the pop-up message.</p>
<p>“Effective immediately, the Nebula Games Store will transition into a comprehensive digital game platform, allowing all game designers to publish games on the store and providing corresponding promotion and services for them.” “This includes features like cloud saves, user feedback, a Workshop, and store friend connections, while granting game designers on the platform sufficient autonomy, provided they adhere to the rules.”</p>
<p>Of course, these games must first undergo a corresponding review and obtain publishing qualifications before they can go online. In simple terms, Nebula Games was transforming from an independent platform that solely ran its own games into a comprehensive distribution platform.</p>
<p>What was even more appealing to game industry designers was Nebula Games Platform's sales terms. In this Parallel World, much like most game stores in his previous life, the official game store took 30 percent. But this was an official store; for large channels like TengHua Games and NetDragon, it was completely different.</p>
<p>If it was a top-tier game designer or a powerful developer, they would naturally get a 30 percent revenue share. But what about the treatment for ordinary game designers and developers? In his previous life, many people felt that platforms like Steam and Google taking a 30% commission was quite high. However, channels for some domestic mobile app stores typically started with a 50-50 split. Want a 30% commission? No problem, you can list your game on my platform, but I won't promote it; then it's 30% commission. But if you want promotion and server usage, then it's 60% commission, oh. Don't even complain about it being high, because some even more egregious ones had a 70-30 split. Developer seven, channel three? What are you thinking! Developer three, channel seven! Even more outrageous, you couldn't even control what operation methods your game should use.</p>
<p>What? Are you saying that's like begging on one's knees? Exactly! If you put it that way, it really is like begging on one's knees, and even then, many people want to beg but don't even get the chance!</p>
<p>Compared to the major app channels in his previous life, the major channels in this Parallel World were no different. As for why so many designers were still willing? There was no other way; building one's own platform and selling through an official website simply didn't have the budget for promotion. As for the official game store, while it had a decent user base, when it came to recommendation slots and rotation, while there was some exposure, the algorithms were quite outdated. After all, because it was official, it couldn't directly compete in the market. So, unless a game was a genuine hit game, it was rare for one to become widely popular on the official platform. And the truth was, most games didn't possess the qualities of a hit game; they mostly catered to a segment of players' tastes. So, even if the channel providers took a high commission, they could at least guarantee exposure. Circumstances were stronger than people; they could only gnaw on bones while the channels ate meat and drank soup. After all, when it comes to making money, begging on one's knees isn't shameful.</p>
<p>And now, what truly shocked game industry designers was that in the Nebula Games Store, the revenue share terms offered by Chen Xu were a mere 25%. Whether it was a large game developer or an individual game designer, a unified 25% commission was taken for the platform's daily operations. The moment this news broke, it instantly caused an earthquake in the gaming industry.</p>
