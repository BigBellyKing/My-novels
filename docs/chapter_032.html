                <p>Chapter 32: Why Did It Suddenly Get Spooky?</p>
<p>As the two doctors, a man and a woman, conversed, Dong Zhen could finally enter the playable interface.</p>
<p>The simple yet somewhat sarcastic dialogue, including the bickering between the doctors when they approached a squirrel, was quite detailed.</p>
<p>"The details in this game feel pretty good, the dialogues are all very meticulous, exactly like the previous <em>Undertale</em>. Very, very detailed," Dong Zhen commented, controlling his character.</p>
<p>For example, when they saw a signpost, they would even complain, wondering if a sign left in the mountains wouldn't be stolen.</p>
<p>The dialogues were a bit humorous, and also made him, the streamer, feel a little out of a job.</p>
<p>Because that kind of commentary was usually his job.</p>
<p>Goodness gracious, if the game characters did all the complaining, what was left for him?</p>
<p>"Is it a story-driven game? It seems a bit too bland, doesn't it?" Dong Zhen was somewhat curious.</p>
<p>Aside from moving a stone-like object in the middle, the entire game's progression seemed to involve nothing more than walking and simple conversations. There was nothing particularly special about it.</p>
<p><em>Undertale</em> at least had simple bullet-hell combat sequences, after all.</p>
<p>The only truly good part was the game's music.</p>
<p>From <em>Mirror (Game)</em> to <em>Undertale</em> and now <em>To the Moon</em>, the music was truly well-composed.</p>
<p>As for the graphics, <em>To the Moon</em>, created by Chen Xu, had indeed seen some improvements compared to the pixel art of RPG Maker in his previous life.</p>
<p>But it could only be described as average; it was clearly far from outstanding.</p>
<p>While Dong Zhen mused to himself, Doctors Neil and Eva in the game arrived at their destination, a large mansion.</p>
<p>Upon their knock, a middle-aged woman opened the door. According to the introduction, this woman was named Lily.</p>
<p>She was the one who usually cared for the elderly Johnny, and the two children previously playing the piano in the room were her daughter and son.</p>
<p>After speaking, Lily led the two doctors upstairs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the downstairs room, the two children briefly squabbled over who got to play the piano, then sat side-by-side and began playing.</p>
<p>It was the same piano piece played before the two doctors' car crash.</p>
