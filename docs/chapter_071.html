                <p>Chapter 71: The Game Is Great, It Just Costs You Friends</p>
<p>Although it was Valentine's Day, it must be said that many people could only spend it with their 'big and small wives' (left and right hands).</p>
<p>With nothing to do, occasionally opening the Shark TV live streaming channel and entering a live stream room playing <em>Overcooked</em> would reveal conversations like these:</p>
<p>'Hey... hey! Brother Sun, the rice is burnt again, you need to be quicker!'</p>
<p>'Damn it, Brother Huang, you're blaming me for this too?'</p>
<p>'If not you, then me? You burnt the rice, look at the bullet comments, who do they say is to blame!'</p>
<p>'Damn it, this is annoying! Shut up, I have my own understanding.'</p>
<p>'Fine, hey... no! Go wash dishes, don't chop vegetables anymore! Brother Sun, your intelligence is too low!'</p>
<p>'Damn it, I think you're dragging me down, Brother Huang, okay? Don't just talk, let's practice!'</p>
<p>'Ha, am I scared of you? Let's practice, don't rush, I'll go get someone, let's split into two teams, okay!'</p>
<p>'No problem, I'll kick your ass!'</p>
<p>As the game progressed, the so-called boat of friendship suddenly capsized.</p>
<p>......................</p>
<p>Soon, Nebula Games Platform, Official Game Platform, and other third-party game platforms.</p>
<p><em>Overcooked</em>'s sales and reviews began to surge.</p>
<p>Despite being during the Spring Festival holiday, various employees within the company, such as Yang Xin and Ruan Ningxue, were all very concerned about <em>Overcooked</em>'s performance.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, Mr. Chen, how are <em>Overcooked</em>'s sales doing?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, players seem really enthusiastic!"</p>
<p>In the company chat group, Ruan Ningxue and Yang Xin @-mentioned Chen Xu, asking about the game's situation.</p>
<p>"15,000 copies sold in eight hours, of which over 11,000 were sold on our platform, and game sales are increasing hourly." Chen Xu also had a smile on his face.</p>
<p>15,000 copies sold in eight hours—this number isn't huge, but it's not small either.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the sales trend for this type of party-style multiplayer game is completely different from that of ordinary games.</p>
<p>Taking <em>Overcooked</em>'s promotion and distribution as an example, although the promotion wasn't overwhelming.</p>
<p>Yet, there were plenty of promotional videos, media interviews, and advertisements.</p>
<p>For most games, even if the game quality is excellent, the sales trend usually follows a rollercoaster pattern.</p>
<p>It slowly declines from its peak, then surges again once word-of-mouth explodes.</p>
<p>Or, if word-of-mouth is average, it experiences a direct decline.</p>
<p>However, <em>Overcooked</em> is somewhat different from these games.</p>
<p>Because <em>Overcooked</em> is a party game leaning towards a social mode.</p>
<p>For games that require multiple players, initial sales aren't usually very high, but once they become a trending topic, they can sell very well.</p>
<p>This is because every player has their own social circle, and through this radiation among friends.</p>
<p>When a game generates buzz, it can drive broader sales.</p>
<p>This holds true for the Parallel World as well as his previous life, both adhering to this market trend.</p>
<p>"11,000 copies? So many players chose to buy it on our platform?" Yang Xin was surprised in the group chat.</p>
<p>"After all, it's buy one, get one free," Ruan Ningxue said.</p>
<p>"But there's one thing, it was supposed to be harmonious and loving, so why is there such a heated atmosphere after actually playing it?" Yang Xin sent a meme in the group, a cute cat looking bewildered.</p>
<p>"Exactly, exactly! I played it with my cousin during Chinese New Year, it was incredible!" Ruan Ningxue echoed in the group.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, this really doesn't feel like a couple's game! And from the comments I'm seeing, it seems some players have even broken up!" Qin Yi typed in the group.</p>
<p>Watching the group chat, Chen Xu, leaning on the sofa at home, also revealed a slight smile.</p>
<p>On the system's UI interface in front of him, the points were rising rapidly, and this was just the beginning.</p>
<p>Glancing at the conversation in the group, Chen Xu sent a message.</p>
<p>"It's alright, no need to panic. Besides, even if someone genuinely broke up over playing the game, it's certainly not just the game's fault. It means their relationship had already run its course, and their personalities weren't suited for each other," Chen Xu replied in the group.</p>
<p>Although <em>Overcooked</em> was dubbed 'Breakup Kitchen' in his previous life, it's clear that even if some couples genuinely broke up because of playing this game, it wasn't the game's fault.</p>
<p>Rather, their personalities simply weren't compatible.</p>
<p>Of course, it's quite common for <em>Overcooked</em> to occasionally lead good buddies, close friends, and couples into arguments.</p>
<p>After the game's rating was successfully unlocked, players who had purchased it also gave their ratings.</p>
<p>The majority of them gave scores of 9, and some even gave a perfect 10.</p>
<p>Naturally, many players also gave a rating of 1.</p>
<p>And these players, whether they gave high ratings or low ratings.</p>
<p>Their review comments in the game's comments section were particularly interesting.</p>
<p>'<em>Overcooked</em>? This is a breakup kitchen! My girlfriend is gone, Chen Xu, you owe me compensation!'</p>
<p>'This is a fragile love kitchen! After playing it, I'm a single person again!'</p>
<p>'Highly recommend buying this and putting it in your inventory. Take it out and play it whenever you want to break up with your girlfriend.'</p>
<p>'After playing this game, I dumped my girlfriend on the spot and then turned around and played with my close friends all night!'</p>
<p>'What friendship-ending stuff are you all talking about? It's not that mystical! I can confirm, we just had a fight!'</p>
<p>'The game is quite good, it just costs you friends.'</p>
<p>'I fell for another girl, but I was always troubled about how to break up with my girlfriend. Now it's all good! After playing this game together, I successfully broke up with her!'</p>
<p>'After playing, my family is harmonious, cooking is smooth, and I even passed the firefighter exam. It's just that the person I played with was pretty unpalatable.'</p>
<p>'I once had many friends, but since playing this game, I'm glad they all left!'</p>
<p>'Before playing, we were just ordinary friends. After playing, we became life-and-death companions—the kind where if I don't live, then I die!'</p>
<p>Undeniably, some players did experience friction with their friends due to the game's content.</p>
<p>But essentially, most players were just playing along with a joke.</p>
<p>However, it was precisely the spread of these memes that once again boosted <em>Overcooked</em>'s popularity.</p>
<p>Especially with a number of amusing videos, and many streamers getting into arguments over the game.</p>
<p>The spread of this meme was just like with <em>Outlast</em> before it.</p>
<p><em>Overcooked</em>'s popularity could be said to be rising rapidly.</p>
<p>The rapidly rising popularity also drove <em>Overcooked</em>'s sales to continuously grow.</p>
<p>Many players, both those who had heard of it before and those who hadn't.</p>
<p>All learned about <em>Overcooked</em> through various channels and developed an interest in it.</p>
<p>At the same time, among the player community, it also acquired two other names: 'Breakup Kitchen' and 'Friendship Over Kitchen'.</p>
