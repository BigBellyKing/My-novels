                <p>Chapter 86: What the Heck is 'Canteen Time'?</p>
<p>While they were playing "Sanguosha", the "Fall Guys" section next door also had quite a few players sitting in front of the exhibition's experience devices, trying out the game.</p>
<p>Although in terms of numbers, a single "Fall Guys" match required a full complement of 60 players.</p>
<p>But it's important to know that Chen Xu had specially prepared QR codes, allowing players to directly download "Fall Guys" on their mobile phones. Operation-wise, while the feel of on-screen controls still differed from using a keyboard and mouse,</p>
<p>for the current entertainment value, it was definitely not an issue.</p>
<p>As for later, once the official version was released, a cross-platform feature would also be added.</p>
<p>Players on either PC or mobile platforms could choose whether to enable it.</p>
<p>If not enabled, they would only be able to play with players on the same platform.</p>
<p>Besides these points, "Fall Guys" itself was a drop-in, drop-out game.</p>
<p>As soon as a player was eliminated, if they didn't want to spectate, they could immediately exit and start another game.</p>
<p>This cyclical model ensured that even during the exhibition, every player only had to wait a short while to start a new match.</p>
<p>It could be said there was absolutely no shortage of players.</p>
<p>Furthermore, compared to the "Sanguosha" section, "Fall Guys" clearly attracted more attention and more lively crowds.</p>
<p>It wasn't because there were more girls playing "Fall Guys".</p>
<p>Rather, from a viewing perspective, "Fall Guys" was more widely accepted than "Sanguosha".</p>
<p>After all, "Sanguosha" required watching for a while to understand its basics.</p>
<p>For example, the skills of the generals and the functions of the cards.</p>
<p>Although "Sanguosha"'s gameplay was very simple and clear, one could understand it by playing or even just watching one or two rounds.</p>
<p>But it still couldn't compare to "Fall Guys".</p>
<p>This type of variety show obstacle course game had been seen or at least heard of by most people.</p>
<p>Moreover, the game didn't have complicated controls; it was simply about facing various obstacles and reaching the finish line before other players and the time limit.</p>
<p>A group of colorful Fall Guys characters mixed together was absolutely hilarious and comical.</p>
<p>Of course, in addition to the reasons mentioned above, there was another crucial factor.</p>
<p>That was Chen Xu actually acting as a live commentator.</p>
<p>He specifically commentated on the live "Fall Guys" matches for the players.</p>
<p>This evidently attracted the attention of many players, including some from other exhibition areas within the same hall.</p>
<p>This made other game developers and game designers stomp their feet in frustration.</p>
<p>Is there no law, no natural justice anymore?!</p>
<p>For Cosplayers and showgirls, you do something so unique; everyone else has pretty long legs, but you've turned it into a cartoon animal party.</p>
<p>Even with the games, it's so special; everyone else prepares some equipment and demos for players to try out, but you, on the other hand, just put up two QR codes and let players download and play.</p>
<p>Moreover, from the perspective of game completeness, this was clearly a game ready for launch, yet you specifically brought it to the exhibition.</p>
<p>Are you treating the exhibition as your own game launch event?</p>
<p>And finally, the most outrageous thing: you're a game designer, yet you personally stepped in, using that identity to liven up the atmosphere and even became a commentator.</p>
<p>Are you a sore loser?!</p>
<p>Many game designers and company representatives in the same exhibition hall looked at their dwindling number of players, all with frustrated expressions.</p>
<p>What in the world is this?!</p>
<p>Our side is deserted, while yours is a sea of people!</p>
<p>However, Chen Xu and the players clearly paid no mind to the frustration of these game developers and designers.</p>
<p>Both "Sanguosha" and "Fall Guys", along with Chen Xu's personal involvement, attracted considerable player attention.</p>
<p>"Bro, why is everyone gathered in that exhibition area?" Some players who had just arrived from other areas walked over, their faces full of curiosity.</p>
<p>"It's Nebula Games' new title, from the designer and company that made "Outlast" and "Overcooked". Their games don't require queuing; you just scan the QR code and play," a helpful player in the crowd explained.</p>
<p>"Holy crap, that's awesome? What games are they?" A casual player who had just endured an hour of painful queuing only to get five minutes of gameplay widened his eyes.</p>
<p>"Look, two games: "Sanguosha" and "Fall Guys". What's on the big screen is it, just see for yourself."</p>
<p>"Quickly, get ready to matchmake! Chen Xu is about to commentate on a new match. Hope I can get in!"</p>
<p>On the big screen, a little green Fall Guy character successfully grabbed a crown.</p>
<p>Chen Xu also interacted with the players on site, preparing for a new round of matches.</p>
<p>"Haha, I got matched!"</p>
<p>"Me too!"</p>
<p>"Haha, that hamburger head is me!"</p>
<p>"I'm the pineapple head!"</p>
<p>With the new round of matchmaking, many players who successfully got in were very excited.</p>
<p>Song Ren and his group also successfully got matched.</p>
<p>It was exactly Song Ren, Zhang Yi, and Wang Han.</p>
<p>"Old Song, don't screw me over this time!" Zhang Yi said, glancing at Song Ren next to him.</p>
<p>Clearly, he hadn't fully recovered from the previous Zhuge Liang and Liu Bei's Observe Stars, Lightning combo.</p>
<p>"That was just an accident, don't worry about it. Rest assured! I'll guarantee your spot in the finals this round!" Song Ren patted his chest. His 1.92-meter height made him look quite convincing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Wang Han next to him was busy figuring out combinations to make her "Fall Guys" character look better.</p>
<p>Joey, on the other hand, didn't team up with Zhang Yi and the others for matchmaking. She decided to figure things out on her own first and was trying out a custom room mode.</p>
<p>As for Wang Yifan, he was still playing "Sanguosha" with casual players at the exhibition.</p>
<p>He was truly unwilling to accept this; to die without playing a single card, damn it, was simply a disgrace!</p>
<p>"But the controls for this Fall Guys game are a bit tricky!" During the pre-game waiting time, Zhang Yi and Song Ren chatted about their thoughts on the game.</p>
<p>They had just briefly tried it out in the demo.</p>
<p>The basic controls were very simple: a joystick for direction, along with jump and grab buttons. It was extremely straightforward.</p>
<p>But the game's physics engine and control feel were something else entirely.</p>
<p>The little characters inside walked wobbly, making one worried if they'd stumble and fall flat on their faces.</p>
<p>Even their jumping and walking felt like they were made of playdough and springs.</p>
<p>"Stop talking, the game's about to start! This round will eliminate over twenty people. You two better not fail to even get past the first level," Wang Han said, rolling her eyes.</p>
<p>The first level was called "Overcome Obstacles and Rush Through Doors." There were seven rows of doors, and in each row, some were real and some were fake.</p>
<p>Players needed to pass through before the target number of qualifiers was reached.</p>
<p>With 60 Fall Guys characters lined up together before the game began, the scene was quite spectacular.</p>
<p>"Alright, a new round of matches is about to begin. For the first level, the map has randomly selected 'Canteen Time.' As you can see, all the contestants on the field are standing by, ready for action."</p>
<p>On the stage, Chen Xu was commentating in a serious manner, with a microphone clipped to him.</p>
<p>The players who had joined the match, and even those who were just watching instead of playing, immediately burst out laughing upon hearing Chen Xu's commentary.</p>
<p>The beginning was normal, but what the heck was 'Canteen Time'?</p>
<p>Wasn't this level called "Overcome Obstacles and Rush Through Doors"?</p>
<p>All the players were utterly bewildered.</p>
<p>However, they soon understood why Chen Xu had referred to this level in such a way.</p>
<p>(PS: Daily plea for recommendation tickets, monthly passes...)</p>
