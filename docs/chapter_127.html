                <p>Chapter 127: Is This Mr. Chen's Love?</p>
<p>Unlike the previous unanimous online complaints about the difficulty of <em>Dark Souls</em>, in the days since the game's launch, the earliest batch of players who stuck with the game have completely changed their impression of <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>With these first veteran players as pioneers, subsequent players weren't entirely bewildered. They could get answers to some of the most basic in-game content.</p>
<p>For example, many new players, after dying once to the Crystal Lizard in the Cemetery of Ash, would search online and find veteran player guides informing them that this creature wasn't a mandatory challenge. Similarly, many enthusiastic veteran players provided hints through in-game messages on the ground, saving many new players from considerable hardship.</p>
<p>Even the first Mimic chest under the attic still manages to consume new players entering the <em>Dark Souls</em> world. This typically happens for only two reasons:</p>
<p>Firstly, adhering to the most authentic game experience, they completely avoid guides or analysis of level precautions, and entirely disregard messages left by veteran players on the ground.</p>
<p>Secondly, they possess an enigmatic self-confidence, insisting on testing how formidable this Mimic chest truly is. Only after being devoured once do they learn their lesson and cautiously bypass it.</p>
<p>After accepting the difficulty setting of <em>Dark Souls</em>, players' primary discussions quickly shifted from mere difficulty to game content. Topics such as various strategies, hidden items in every corner of the map, shortcuts, BOSS and mob tactics, and even which character to choose for a first playthrough, or whether to prioritize Vigor or other stats when leveling up, gradually became the mainstream content for <em>Dark Souls</em> players.</p>
<p>As for the trending topics online, they were still fermenting but slowly cooling down.</p>
<p>However, what surprised many players was that Chen Xu actually responded to the previous calls from players, instigating him to stream and suffer. Many players had @ mentioned him, but none had truly expected Chen Xu to reply; it was purely for fun and excitement. Now, it's safe to say it exceeded everyone's expectations.</p>
<p>Chen Xu posted an official Weibo message on his official account, which was also reposted by Nebula Games' official Weibo account.</p>
<p>"Many players want to see me suffer, but live streaming is out of the question, as it might prematurely spoil some game content. <em>Dark Souls</em> is a game worth savoring carefully, so I've specially recorded a walkthrough video from the Cemetery of Ash to the High Wall of Lothric, to serve as a reference for struggling newcomers."</p>
<p>Below the text message was a video link.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this message, many players following Chen Xu and Nebula Games' official Weibo immediately got excited. While it wasn't a live stream as they wished, a video was still a good compromise.</p>
<p>The High Wall of Lothric was largely familiar to the earliest players of <em>Dark Souls</em>. But the key point was that this was a video of Chen Xu playing himself, so many players were still quite curious. How did Chen Xu play this video? Was this truly an official guide from the producer? Meant as a reference for struggling beginners?</p>
<p>Curious players eagerly clicked on the video.</p>
<p>After opening the video, many subconsciously glanced at the runtime: not too long, not too short, about ten minutes. At the beginning of the video, many recognized the location. It was the room opposite the Ice Dog BOSS, as players called it.</p>
<p>According to the normal game progression, after defeating the Ice Dog, players face a cliff. To proceed to the next level, a crucial item is needed, obtained by talking to an old woman in the room opposite the Ice Dog. However, if you kill the old woman, she drops a basin. If you then take the dropped basin to the sculpture against the wall in the room, it will directly trigger a BOSS battle against the Dancer of the Boreal Valley.</p>
<p>The blood-stained floor of the room attested to how many innocent, unsuspecting players had been massacred there. Players who unknowingly triggered this BOSS battle without intending to attack usually did so by left-clicking their mouse to initiate dialogue. While clicking, they accidentally ended the conversation and struck the old woman, which led many players to abandon mouse-based dialogue in favor of keyboard input. Consequently, the Dancer was playfully nicknamed the "second BOSS of <em>Dark Souls</em>" by countless players who had suffered her lessons. (Gundyr the Ash didn't count, after all, he was just a trial officer.)</p>
<p>“Dancer One-Shot Kill Tutorial!” The video paused, and a line of text appeared in the center.</p>
<p>Instantly, all the players were shocked.</p>
<p>“I swear! Dancer one-shot kill tutorial? That's fierce!”</p>
<p>“Didn't they say it was a beginner's tutorial?”</p>
<p>The character in the video was a Deprived, without Ember or clothes, dual-wielding Small Clubs. Many players watching were filled with doubts. According to the guides provided by veteran players online, the Dancer of the Boreal Valley was clearly a late-game BOSS, as unreinforced weapons in the early game dealt laughably low damage to her. Although it was possible to chip away at her health without taking damage if one didn't make mistakes, the difficulty was immense. Now, this posture, could there be some big secret?!</p>
<p>The video quickly cut, skipping the intermediate plot and directly entering the Dancer's combat screen. The next moment, the Dancer, like a phantom, instantly appeared beside the game character, and with a swift strike, the health bar was instantly depleted.</p>
<p>Yes… the Deprived's health bar was depleted.</p>
<p>The first batch of players watching the video were stunned, then finally understood.</p>
<p>“Damn, I took off my pants for this?!”</p>
<p>“I want to say something, but nothing comes out, because it perfectly matches the title!”</p>
<p>“That's definitely a one-shot kill!”</p>
<p>“So this is the one-shot kill tutorial? No kidding, I could do that too!”</p>
<p>“Dancer one-shot kill? Isn't that something anyone with hands can do?”</p>
<p>The bullet comments on the video visibly multiplied. Amidst their laughter, players unconsciously felt a sense of camaraderie. After all, how many times had they died like that in the game?</p>
<p>Soon, the cheerful players were drawn to the later content of the video. In the game, a Knight appeared in the Cemetery of Ash. Currently, there were quite a few guides for <em>Dark Souls</em> online, and everyone generally agreed that the Knight was the most suitable starting class for new players. This was because they came with a sword and shield and armor, offering more room for error than other classes, at least when it came to fighting Gundyr the Ash. However, if it was just for fighting Gundyr the Ash, then a Pyromancer with shorter spell casting times would be a better choice. But once you reached the High Wall of Lothric and later maps, the Knight was more comfortable.</p>
<p>In the video, the Knight pulled the Coiled Sword from Gundyr the Ash's chest, officially entering combat.</p>
<p>Facing Gundyr's attacks, the character in the game raised their shield and tanked a hit. Although a large chunk of their stamina bar dropped, their health remained untouched. Then, seizing the interval in Gundyr's attacks, they rolled backward to create distance and slowly recover stamina. After that, they seized an opportunity to land a hit, and without waiting to see if Gundyr had any recovery frames, they immediately raised their shield again. The video then sped up, astonishing many viewers.</p>
<p>Because there was absolutely no fancy maneuvering involved, and the only thing to watch was the stamina bar; don't blindly hold up the shield like an idiot. After the BOSS finished attacking, approach to sneak in a hit, then retreat and continue to raise the shield. Many players watching the video were stunned. Because it was incredibly cowardly and sneaky!</p>
<p>Most players primarily used shields for emergencies or parrying. But to constantly hide behind a shield for the entire duration, as shown in the video, many players had truly never done it. This was practically turning real-time combat into a turn-based game!</p>
<p>When Gundyr the Ash entered his second phase, the Black Firebomb from the burial gifts came in handy. They easily reached Firelink Shrine and then the High Wall of Lothric. Facing the Lothric Knights, many players wanted to see how the video dealt with them. After all, these knights possessed the unique skill of a shield bash.</p>
<p>However, in the video, the Undead character simply attracted the knight's aggro, and once it emerged from the room, a quick roll allowed them to escape. They made their way to the Ice Dog's room without incident, just like with Gundyr the Ash.</p>
<p>Phase one involved attacking its weak point, while phase two meant raising the shield to guard against the Ice Dog's foul breath attack and Rolling Wheel Attack. Then, it was just a matter of slowly chipping away.</p>
<p>The overall feeling throughout was one word: <em>stable</em>! This astonished all the viewers. Looking at it this way, the game actually seemed quite simple! It didn't involve any of those moves that made them feel like their brain understood, but their hands didn't. The entire process was about raising the shield and being cautiously cowardly. While it felt a bit stifling, it was effective!</p>
<p>This video opened a new window of understanding for many new players. It turned out this game didn't necessarily require front-on technical skill. One could completely be a despicable Undead. Left hand shield, right hand sword, all stat points into Vigor and Endurance. Wearing a full set of armor, as long as one could still roll. Other points could be allocated as seen fit, as long as one could wield a shield. In combat, the shield was their home, and as long as stamina wasn't depleted, the shield wouldn't drop. When facing monsters, they suppressed the urge to parry, preventing themselves from showboating.</p>
<p>Some players who had bought the game and found themselves unable to even defeat Gundyr the Ash, felt a surge of renewed activity upon seeing this. One by one, they silently reinstalled the games they had uninstalled. Another group of players who hadn't bought the game, torn between wanting to play and fearing its difficulty, also silently opened the Nebula Games Platform after watching this video. Then, looking at the nearly expired discount coupons in their inventory, the scenes from the video flashed through their minds once more.</p>
<p>As if it were the final straw that broke the camel's back, these players silently clicked on the <em>Dark Souls</em> purchase page and proceeded to checkout. Then, they downloaded and installed the game, immersing themselves in the world of <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>Starting as a Knight, dutifully hiding behind their shield. Advancing steadily, carefully pushing forward. Soon, these players discovered that this strategy actually worked remarkably well! Gundyr the Ash and most of the monsters in the High Wall of Lothric posed little threat, and any insurmountable ones could simply be bypassed. Although it felt extremely cowardly, the continuous progression and the defeated monsters gave these players an immense sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>For a time, many players felt like they experienced the joy that <em>Dark Souls</em> brought them. The entire forum became harmonious and joyful. Many players were beaming, realizing that behind the high difficulty, there was actually a strategy suitable for new players!</p>
<p>Indeed, "Is this Mr. Chen's love?"</p>
<p>................</p>
<p>Amidst the joyful atmosphere online among players, within Nebula Games, during a work break, a group of people were also experiencing <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>"Don't even mention it, this method makes clearing levels so much easier! But it feels like it loses a bit of challenge!" Ruan Ningxue, sitting in front of her computer, said with a chuckle as she watched the BOSS she had just defeated.</p>
<p>"Yeah!" Yang Xin also nodded.</p>
<p>"Lost some challenge? You're overthinking it!"</p>
<p>Hearing their conversation, Chen Xu, who was observing related data nearby, smiled slightly, and Qin Yi perked up his ears. The Shield-holding playstyle was indeed the most suitable for new players, essentially the most mindless type of strategy. But did they really think that just holding a shield would prevent them from being abused?</p>
<p>"Why do you think players find fighting Gundyr the Ash and the monsters in the High Wall of Lothric so easy?" Chen Xu said with a smile. "It's because those who came before planted the trees for others to enjoy the shade! Currently, players are relatively familiar with Gundyr the Ash and the monsters in the High Wall of Lothric. Plus, they have my video as a reference, and the High Wall map is not overly complex."</p>
<p>"But when they encounter unfamiliar maps, monsters, and BOSSes later on, hehe..." Chen Xu smiled meaningfully.</p>
<p>(End of Chapter)</p>
<p>Everyone shivered when they heard Chen Xu's "hehe" chuckle.</p>
<p>Qin Yi, in particular, thought of the subsequent level map design, as well as the monsters' numerical and action design, which made him silently swallow a mouthful of saliva.</p>
<p>(End of Chapter)</p>
