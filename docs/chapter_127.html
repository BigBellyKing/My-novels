                <p>Chapter 226: Ten Million Sales (Please Subscribe, Monthly Pass)</p>
<p>The second day of the Lunar New Year, the sales data for Minecraft had also been released.</p>
<p>Thanks to the initial promotion, especially those special videos featuring 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival,' the Forbidden City, as well as pianos and calculators, all contributed to Minecraft garnering immense popularity even before its official launch. Coupled with its modest price and a month-long pre-sale period that had already begun, these various factors led to Minecraft's sales absolutely skyrocketing.</p>
<p>Minecraft 24-hour sales: 3,212,231 copies. First-day sales of 3.2 million.</p>
<p>To say it was unprecedented would be a slight exaggeration. But it was, at the very least, the best performance in recent years. Even though Minecraft's price was only two digits, and there was an element of clever positioning, regardless, the 3.2 million first-day sales were undeniable.</p>
<p>What amazed many industry designers was Minecraft's incredible gameplay and the players' positive reviews. After the Early Access trial that opened during the pre-sale, Minecraft's player rating was 9.0, neither too high nor too low. Now, however, Minecraft's rating had climbed to an impressive 9.8.</p>
<p>An unbelievable statistic. Although Minecraft's powerful promotion had previously created a 'breaking out of its niche' effect, even many non-gamers became aware of Minecraft. Coupled with early pre-orders, many game industry designers had anticipated Minecraft would achieve high first-day sales. But once those 3 million sales were revealed, it genuinely shocked everyone.</p>
<p>“My god, Chen Xu is too fierce, isn’t he? A pixel block game with such high sales?”</p>
<p>“Stop calling it a block game. Does your block game look like that?!”</p>
<p>“Mainly, Minecraft’s promotion is just too strong!”</p>
<p>“Yeah! It’s the first time I’ve seen a game played so elaborately with its promotion.”</p>
<p>“It’s a textbook example of promotion!”</p>
<p>“Impressive, yes, but it feels like only Minecraft could pull it off. It has absolutely no reference value for others.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, Minecraft could promote itself this way mainly due to the support of its game mechanisms. Ordinary games trying to copy this approach simply couldn’t do it.”</p>
<p>Industry designers who had been following Minecraft closely were all filled with emotion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, inside TengHua's 'Voyage' project room, after receiving the data news about Minecraft, Zhu Yi let out a long breath, feeling a little fortunate at the same time. Initially, he had truly wanted to contend with Minecraft, especially after its trial play ended. However, due to Minecraft's subsequent promotional blitz, he finally restrained himself, choosing to endure for a period, even if it meant wasting previous warm-up promotional resources. Looking back now, this could be said to be a brilliant move!</p>
<p>After all, the gaming industry is a truly remarkable one. No one can ever say for sure what will happen; a highly anticipated blockbuster might suddenly become a Waterloo, while some small-scale games might unexpectedly explode in popularity, becoming global sensations. Such cases basically occur every year. Moreover, Chen Xu himself had an astonishing track record, having created many miracles. Coupled with Minecraft's immense popularity and stunning content demonstrations, Zhu Yi was incredibly cautious, and now it seemed he had made a brilliant move! In a month's time, Minecraft's hype should have largely subsided. Launching his 'Voyage' then would be relatively safe.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>The gaming industry's focus on Minecraft clearly had little to do with players. For players, however, re-entering Minecraft and experiencing it meant more and more content was being discovered. From knowing nothing at first, they learned to build furnaces with stone, use them to cook food, and smelt iron ingots, armor, and weapons. From merely digging a hole to bury themselves, they progressed to digging caves and becoming cavemen. At the same time, some players discovered that the small animals in the game could even be tamed with food.</p>
<p>As time progressed, players gradually uncovered the joys of this game. Of course, there were also some tragic incidents during this process. For instance, dying in the wilderness with a large pile of materials, then being unable to find the death spot to retrieve them. Or finally building a cozy, warm home, only to go on an adventure in the wilderness, get lost, and be unable to find the way back – still alive, but essentially dead. To prevent getting lost and to find their way home after venturing out, many players would build tall structures near their homes as beacons, or erect directional beacons every short distance to guide themselves back.</p>
<p>Then there were even more despairing moments: some players painstakingly built a home, slept through the night, and upon opening their door in the morning, saw a Creeper squatting right outside. Before they could react, the white flash and hissing sound had already appeared. Simultaneously, posts and videos about Minecraft were dominating all major communities and video platforms.</p>
<p>“My Minecraft First Experience: Basic Tutorial to Understand How to Play!”</p>
<p>“Dig Three Fill One, Cavemen, Using Local Materials: Which of These Have You Done?”</p>
<p>“Step-by-Step Guide: How to Build a Duplex Villa!”</p>
<p>“MC Infrastructure Team: Rebuilding the Great Wall!”</p>
<p>On major video and community websites, the relevant posts generally progressed from simple to complex. Initially, most were tutorial-like videos and posts for new players. These were primarily players who understood the game's basic rules, providing explanations for newcomers. However, as players quickly grew familiar with the game, more and more videos began to flourish in diverse ways. There were various humorous parody videos, technical videos on building houses, and strategy videos simply teaching players how to survive better in Survival Mode.</p>
<p>At the same time, Minecraft was also experiencing a surge in popularity on major live streaming platforms, with many game streamers playing it in their spare time. Naturally, countless players were also enjoying Minecraft in their own preferred ways. Some players treated it as a pixel-style block game, activating Creative Mode or joining peaceful pure servers to build structures with like-minded players. Others regarded it as a survival adventure game, gathering resources in Survival Mode and carefully exploring the unknown. Some considered it a unique multiplayer game, forming factions and developing extensively within multiplayer mode. And then there were players who treated it as a tourism game, admiring the magnificent structures currently created by Chen Xu, as well as those openly shared by other players.</p>
<p>Of course, online arguments were inevitable. For example, some players kindly opened servers without setting them to 'indestructible,' only to have them maliciously damaged by others. There are bad apples in every crowd! However, compared to other games, Minecraft could be said to be one with the least animosity. Even the multiplayer mode, which was most likely to cause disputes, was significantly more harmonious than in other games. Chen Xu, for his part, didn't pay too much attention to this. After all, where there are people, there is contention; players' issues should be left for players to resolve.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>As time progressed, Minecraft's subsequent sales data was quickly compiled by some third-party organizations. First-week sales: 10.12 million copies. Weekly active players: 8.62 million. Although Minecraft's popularity was clearly palpable during this period, the moment this data was released, it still astonished everyone. What?! First-week sales of 10.12 million copies, and more importantly, weekly active players as high as 8.62 million?! What kind of monster is this?!</p>
<p>It's worth noting that for some heavily promoted games, first-day sales often account for the majority, perhaps even half, of their total sales. But this rule seemed to have no effect on Minecraft. Because its trend was simply too stable.</p>
<p>In NetDragon's and TengHua's two separate studios, Meng Zuo and Zhu Yi, upon seeing Minecraft's related data, both felt a bit of existential doubt. Especially Zhu Yi, who had originally planned to launch 'Voyage' after Minecraft had been online for a month. He had even worked out how to promote it afterward with limited funds. But Minecraft's escalating popularity had completely scared him. While he had sensed that Minecraft's sales would be formidable, the ten million sales in the first week still startled him. Even though Minecraft's price wasn't high, this was only the first week! Moreover, the momentum showed no sign of cooling down, even surpassing the initial craze of Fall Guys. If it continued at this growth rate, wouldn't Minecraft become the best-selling game of all time? Furthermore, Minecraft's so-called sandbox gameplay was entirely different from what the industry had previously focused on discussing! In that instant, he felt a flicker of confusion.</p>
