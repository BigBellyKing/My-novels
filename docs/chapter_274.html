<p>Is the RTS market large?</p>
<p>It is still a relatively large market.</p>
<p>Not just domestically, but also overseas.</p>
<p>But it's difficult to enter.</p>
<p>For the same reason, RTS-type games aren't hard to make, but they are hard to make well.</p>
<p>Moreover, RTS games are different from typical ARPGs and RPGs.</p>
<p>For a typical RPG game, if there's a good one and a slightly inferior one, it doesn't mean the inferior one will necessarily fail completely.</p>
<p>Because the content of these games is limited.</p>
<p>After players experience one, if they're still interested in the same type, as long as it's not too outrageous, a portion of players will usually still get their hands on it.</p>
<p>This is also a characteristic of single-player games; the market is not a zero-sum market.</p>
<p>But RTS games are different.</p>
<p>Because RTS is a competitive game, not just about single-player content, but more about player versus player confrontation.</p>
<p>In this situation, an excellent RTS game can often sweep the entire market.</p>
<p>Unless there's an equally excellent and evenly matched RTS on the market, or one with unique characteristics.</p>
<p>For example, if my RTS has a modern warfare setting and yours has an ancient warfare setting, this difference can attract different player demographics, but this is based on the condition that the gap isn't too large.</p>
<p>But once there's a significant disparity in balance or player experience, one RTS will inevitably dominate the entire player market.</p>
<p>Because when the number of players decreases, it signifies a shrinking player pool.</p>
<p>It becomes increasingly difficult to match with players of similar skill levels; new players and veteran players get matched together, directly leading to a deterioration of the competitive environment.</p>
<p>Of course, when the deterioration reaches a certain point, the environment will gradually improve again.</p>
<p>Because by then, only players who are deeply invested in the game will remain, with no new players at all.</p>
<p>Everyone is evenly matched, forming a small circle.</p>
<p>For players who still love the game, this feels like a good thing.</p>
<p>But for a game developer and designer, when a game exhibits such a phenomenon, it essentially has one foot in the grave.</p>
<p>Any sequels are basically out of the question in the short term; perhaps after five or six, or even seven or eight years, one could try to see if player nostalgia could be sparked for a sequel or remake.</p>
<p>It is precisely because of these characteristics that, although the RTS market size is not small, truly few game developers, both domestically and internationally, are willing to venture into it.</p>
<p>But now that Nebula Games is suddenly making an RTS, it's clearly not a decision made on a whim.</p>
<p>The crossover with Monster Hunter: World, and the crossover with Minecraft, are enough to prove that Nebula Games is playing for real.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on the Channel Alliance's side, the game with the highest concurrent players currently is </p>
