                <p>Chapter 562: Saving This Wife Wasn't in Vain! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>With this wave of shenanigans from Resident Evil Village, players' enthusiasm for discussion soared.</p>
<p>News about The Witcher: Wild Hunt's DLC 'Blood and Wine' and 'Hearts of Stone' hadn't quite spread yet, and many game developers had chosen game delays to avoid Nebula Games during the same period.</p>
<p>As for the previous Super Mario Maker, no matter how hardcore its high-level operations were, to most ordinary players, it was still perceived as a 'juvenile casual game'. So, naturally, driven by this wave of major buzz,</p>
<p>Players' attention naturally gravitated towards Resident Evil Village.</p>
<p>Moreover, the previous Resident Evil game's performance was quite impressive.</p>
<p>It scared the pants off a large number of players worldwide, with Chen Xu pushing the sense of thrilling horror and excitement to its extreme.</p>
<p>At the same time, compared to the original Outlast, this Resident Evil had more collecting gameplay, offering players some fun while being scared.</p>
<p>Now, Resident Evil Village, and that man, Hand Sanitizer Warrior: Ethan Winters, were making their return.</p>
<p>Many players were curious about what kind of story Ethan Winters would encounter in the new game.</p>
<p>Amidst players' anticipation, Chen Xu and Nebula Games soon released more new information.</p>
<p>Nebula Games didn't disappoint players with their shenanigans; following the so-called parody theme song, Nebula Games also released a related puppet show.</p>
<p>Through the new puppet show, players understood some more detailed game content.</p>
<p>That is, in the game, similar to Mia and the Baker family in the previous Resident Evil, the new game seems to feature the so-called Four Heavenly Kings, who are the four characters that appeared in the puppet show.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Holding onto various expectations, time flew by to November 1st, a familiar date.</p>
<p>It was the familiar atmosphere: Halloween.</p>
<p>Exactly one year had passed since the last Resident Evil.</p>
<p>“It's finally unlocking!” Song Ren excitedly rubbed his hands while chatting with Zhang Yi in the voice channel.</p>
<p>Even though it was midnight, Song Ren's mindset had changed somewhat compared to before. Previously, he was purely terrified, but now, alongside the fear, he felt excitement and anticipation.</p>
<p>He was looking forward to what new story the Hand Sanitizer Warrior would bring after a year. He was also curious about the 'great innovation' in Resident Evil that Chen Xu had mentioned at the Carnival Direct Presentation.</p>
<p>As a veteran fan, he knew very well that Nebula Games wouldn't just brag. Since Chen Xu publicly stated that Resident Evil Village would have some gameplay changes, it had to be different from the previous title. The exact differences were what made him curious.</p>
<p>“Old Song, take it easy. Don't scare yourself sick,” his bro Zhang Yi's laughter came through the voice channel.</p>
<p>“Heh, do you know what a tough guy is? Horror games don't stress me out at all! You, on the other hand, Old Zhang, are such a coward, don't you dare faint from fright.” Subconsciously, Song Ren blocked out the memory of once being scared to pee his pants.</p>
<p>As a child, one remembers the food but not the beatings, forgetting the pain once the wounds heal.</p>
<p>It's the same situation when one grows up. Just like when you're looking at learning materials on your computer and accidentally get a virus, next time you tell yourself you absolutely mustn't look again! But when the moment truly comes? Forget the viruses, just look first!</p>
<p>“I'm not worried. If I faint from fright, someone will take care of me. I'm more worried about you, Old Song, because it would be terrible if you get scared while living alone,” Zhang Yi said with a light cough.</p>
<p>Listening to Zhang Yi, Song Ren was silent for a moment: “I'm not going to argue with you anymore! The game's about to start! Hanging up!”</p>
<p>Without waiting for Zhang Yi to speak further, Song Ren directly hung up the voice channel. That conversation died a quick death!</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Song Ren opened the Nebula Games Platform.</p>
<p>Compared to before, the Nebula Games Platform had updated several times in the interim.</p>
<p>For example, The Witcher: Wild Hunt's scenes had already been added to the Nebula World, including the in-game islands, which had also expanded from their initial state.</p>
<p>Checking his inventory, Song Ren customized his island space while also anticipating the content of Resident Evil Village.</p>
<p>Although Resident Evil Village's promotional model had been characterized by unconventional marketing stunts during this period,</p>
<p>It had also interspersed a good amount of the game's actual content. From the leaked footage, it was evident that the overall quality of the game was very high.</p>
<p>If there was anything seemingly amiss, it was the lack of explicit 'Resident Evil' content.</p>
<p>Mia and Evelyn in the previous game were creations of a company called The Alliance Corporation, so was Resident Evil Village also related to that mysterious organization? Song Ren was quite curious about this, especially since the promotion, particularly the content from the previous Carnival Direct Presentation, seemed to be related to dark fairy tales.</p>
<p>But what about Bat Lord, Deep Sea Fish King, and Forest Witch? How were these connected to biological horror?</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Carrying this curiosity, the game quickly officially unlocked.</p>
<p>Following the previous entry method, Song Ren stepped into the portal on his Nebula World island.</p>
<p>After a brief darkness, a corresponding UI interface appeared before Song Ren's eyes.</p>
<p>The main part was the settings for difficulty options and other content.</p>
<p>First, he cranked up the game's brightness. As a horror game, Song Ren knew without a second thought that there would definitely be many dark scenes in the game.</p>
<p>Although in VR mode, the brightness couldn't be as distorted as it could be on a PC platform,</p>
<p>It had to be as bright as possible.</p>
<p>Next was the game's difficulty. Unlike wanting to break a sweat in The Witcher: Wild Hunt, this time Song Ren directly chose the easiest difficulty.</p>
<p>Referencing the previous Resident Evil game, although Song Ren claimed not to be scared, he was still a little apprehensive when truly entering the game.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the previous game had firearm settings, and as the saying goes, fear comes from insufficient firepower.</p>
<p>If he chose easy mode, the monsters' health wouldn't be as high, and he'd have more ammunition and firearms, wouldn't that reduce the sense of fear?</p>
<p>After selecting these settings, Song Ren officially entered the game.</p>
<p>The opening immediately showed the dark fairy tale book from the previous Carnival, Mia's voice, the little girl in the dark forest, and finally, the witch.</p>
<p>Song Ren didn't have the chance to be there in person, only able to watch via video, so he couldn't experience what it was like with full holographic rendering.</p>
<p>However, through the immersive VR viewing experience, Song Ren truly felt that eerie atmosphere.</p>
<p>Then the screen gradually brightened, and a gentle, virtuous, beautiful woman appeared before his eyes, leaning on a sofa, telling a fairy tale.</p>
<p>Soft golden hair cascaded over her shoulders, she wore a casual nightgown, and a baby, who had just fallen asleep, rested in her arms.</p>
<p>Mia!</p>
<p>“Ethan's a dad! Saving this wife wasn't in vain!”</p>
<p>Looking at the gentle and beautiful Mia before him, and the baby sleeping peacefully in her arms, Song Ren instantly became excited.
