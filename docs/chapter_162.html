                <p>Chapter 261: Ten Thousand People's Blood Petition to Buff the Long Sword! (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Naturally, besides complaining about the sudden increase in the "water temperature" (difficulty) of <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, countless players were also complaining about another matter.</p>
<p>This particular group of players was none other than those wielding the Long Sword.</p>
<p>Long Sword players arguably accounted for the highest proportion of weapon usage in <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>.</p>
<p>As for the reason?</p>
<p>It was simply because it looked cool!</p>
<p>However, the plight of Longsword Heroes had always been rather grim.</p>
<p>While the Long Sword's damage output wasn't actually low, especially after reaching the Red Blade state, its damage was quite considerable, even if not quite on par with the Great Sword or Charge Blade.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Long Sword could deliver effective hits against monsters' Hitzones.</p>
<p>In particular, the damage from the Helm Breaker, as long as it hit a BOSS's Hitzone vulnerable to cutting damage, was no lower than the Great Sword's Charged Slash or the Charge Blade's Amped Element Discharge.</p>
<p>However, compared to the Charge Blade and Great Sword, the biggest difference was that the Long Sword's prerequisite for high damage was achieving its Spirit Gauge State.</p>
<p>And to achieve that Spirit Gauge State, one had to unleash the Spirit Roundslash, a move so wide-reaching that it "leaves no blade of grass growing within a five-meter radius."</p>
<p>Other weapons, like the Charge Blade and Great Sword, charged their own phials or attacks, unlike the Long Sword that relied on this wide-sweeping move.</p>
<p>So, previously, Longsword Heroes often felt a little lonely.</p>
<p>As for why it was only "a little" lonely?</p>
<p>Because some players would occasionally carry a Longsword Hero or two.</p>
<p>After all, the earlier monsters weren't a significant threat. Even if a Longsword Hero accidentally hit a teammate, it would at most result in some comical situations.</p>
<p>Everyone would just laugh it off, because wasn't the hunt successful in the end anyway?</p>
<p>And for Longsword Heroes, what did it matter if you didn't bring them along?</p>
<p>The strong don't need companions; I alone am an army!</p>
<p>Traversing the Ancient Forest, roaming the Wildspire Waste, from the high plateaus of the Coral Highlands down to the Rotten Vale – where could a Longsword Hero not go?</p>
<p>But when facing the Diablos and Rathalos, the world in the hearts of Longsword Heroes suddenly changed.</p>
<p>Because the Diablos and Rathalos were simply too brutal, truly earning their title as "new player harvesters."</p>
<p>So, many players chose to team up, as it was more efficient.</p>
<p>And just like that, Longsword Heroes were completely awkward.</p>
<p>They couldn't defeat them solo.</p>
<p>And when it came to teaming up, absolutely no one wanted them anymore.</p>
<p>After all, with earlier monsters, even if a teammate was accidentally hit, it mostly led to some funny moments.</p>
<p>But facing the Diablos's burrowing attacks and Dragon Charge, or the Rathalos's double headbutt – hitting a teammate by accident could be fatal.</p>
<p>And Long Sword users were precisely the ones most prone to hitting teammates.</p>
<p>Whether it was using Foresight Slash to fill the Spirit Gauge or anything else, it always ended with a Spirit Roundslash.</p>
<p>To maintain damage output, one had to constantly stay in the Spirit Gauge State.</p>
<p>After all, Helm Breaker directly consumed one level of the Spirit Gauge.</p>
<p>So, in team mode, Longsword Heroes, in order to ensure the safety and damage output of their teammates, generally wouldn't use the Spirit Roundslash.</p>
<p>But how would you fill your Spirit Gauge then?</p>
<p>With such low damage output, and easily hindering teammates, what good are you!"?</p>
<p>"If I team up with a Great Sword bro, I can draw aggro for him, then he unleashes explosive damage with his Level 3 Charged Slash.</p>
<p>Or get a Light Bowgun bro to plant three landmines near the monster's head.</p>
<p>Or team up with a Hammer bro to stun the monster and then furiously bash its head. Wouldn't that be wonderful?</p>
<p>If all else fails, a Hunting Horn user, a man with his own BGM, can at least buff all teammates.</p>
<p>Even an Insect Glaive user can at least perform some acrobatics."</p>
<p>Although, in the game, it was actually impossible to see the exact damage output of other characters.</p>
<p>After all, this was a cooperative game focusing on co-op, and there was no so-called damage output leaderboard.</p>
<p>But even though the final statistics couldn't be seen, one could still guess.</p>
<p>"You, a Long Sword user who never fills their Spirit Gauge, with only Overhead Slash and Thrust Attack as your means of attack – how much damage can you possibly deal?"</p>
<p>"What? You say your damage output is really high, either first or second?"</p>
<p>"Pah!"</p>
<p>"Why don't you go take a piss and look at yourself!"</p>
<p>"How big is your ego!?"</p>
<p>"Even bringing a Palico would be more useful than you!"</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, facing increasingly powerful BOSSes,</p>
<p>Long Sword players became even more like "empty-nest elderly" (isolated).</p>
<p>An empty continent; wanting to find someone to hunt a dragon with, making such a decision, it's loneliness that resides with me.</p>
<p>It's clearly a four-player game, yet I (the Long Sword) can never truly have a name.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>On Chen Xu's official Weibo account and in the community forums,</p>
<p>There were all kinds of messages from players.</p>
<p>Basically, they were all complaints.</p>
<p>If all complaints were a single stone, Long Sword players would claim eight-tenths of it.</p>
<p>The remaining two-tenths: one part was complaining about the game's difficulty suddenly rising.</p>
<p>After all, veteran Dark Souls players were already used to it, and even secretly a little pleased.</p>
<p>And the other tenth came from players using other weapons who felt their weapons were a bit weak. Of course, the reason this portion was so small was mainly because the Long Sword was there to act as a baseline, making them feel better by comparison.</p>
<p>Thus, a peculiar sight appeared on the forum community.</p>
<p>That was: "Ten Thousand People's Blood Petition to Buff the Long Sword!"</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, aren't you going to respond? Many players are talking about weapon imbalance."</p>
<p>In the Nebula Games office, Qin Yi looked at Chen Xu with a hint of expectation.</p>
<p>As for why his gaze was expectant, it was naturally because he himself was a Long Sword player.</p>
<p>He himself clearly understood the suffering of those Longsword Heroes online.</p>
<p>If it weren't for everyone being colleagues, absolutely no one would take him to hunt dragons.</p>
<p>Chen Xu chuckled: "It's nothing. Players just haven't figured out the Long Sword's gameplay yet."</p>
<p>Qin Yi was speechless: "So, Mr. Chen, does the Long Sword really not need to be changed? The damage is too low!"</p>
<p>"Compared to the Great Sword and Charge Blade's base damage, it's indeed lower. But I'm not the one who entered the numerical data!" Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>Qin Yi was immediately speechless: "Mr. Chen, I entered the numerical data, but you were the one who made the final decision!"</p>
<p>Listening to Qin Yi's complaint, Chen Xu picked up a bottle of soda nearby, opened it, took a sip, and said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Low base damage doesn't mean low overall damage."</p>
<p>"Moreover, once the Spirit Gauge is filled, the Long Sword's damage instantly ramps up. Plus, the Foresight Slash combined with fast Spirit Gauge filling, and the burst damage of the Helm Breaker—do you dare say the Long Sword's damage output is low?"</p>
<p>"Besides, the Long Sword itself is a very cool weapon."</p>
<p>"If you want to maximize damage output, you definitely need skill. Otherwise, if it's powerful yet brainless, what's the point of other weapons?"</p>
<p>"So, skilled Longsword Heroes are a symbol and glory of a master!" Chen Xu stated as if it were a matter of course.</p>
<p>Listening to Chen Xu's explanation,</p>
<p>Qin Yi remained silent.</p>
<p>It seemed what he said indeed made a lot of sense!</p>
<p>Alright, at least he was convinced.</p>
<p>Watching Qin Yi slink back to his workstation, Chen Xu also smiled.</p>
<p>Is there a problem with game balance?</p>
<p>Well, there are indeed some minor issues.</p>
<p>But they're actually harmless in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p>After all, no game can achieve perfect balance.</p>
<p>Moreover, <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> itself is not primarily a competitive game.</p>
<p>Its main focus is a PVE co-op mode.</p>
<p>However, this controversy still needs to be addressed!</p>
<p>This perfectly good Monster Hunter game was being talked about by players as if it had become "Monster Abuse Humans."</p>
