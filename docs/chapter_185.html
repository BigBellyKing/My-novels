                <h1>Chapter 184: Who Am I? Where Am I? (Fourth Update, Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</h1>
<p>After experiencing <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em> for an entire afternoon, Song Ren, having exited the game, couldn't help but take a deep breath as he glanced at the darkening sky outside the window.</p>
<p>It was truly too "enthusiastic"!</p>
<p>This was the experience he summarized after playing all afternoon.</p>
<p>Let's not mention the slightly embarrassing incident of first entering the Catacombs.</p>
<p>But after much hardship, when he finally arrived at Undead Burg, he had only one feeling.</p>
<p>That was, the residents of Undead Burg were simply too enthusiastic.</p>
<p>The local residents, armed with straight swords and axes, enthusiastically welcomed the visiting Undead.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, along the way, Black Knights also offered a warm reception.</p>
<p>Especially when players reached the Prison Tower, facing the uninvited Undead, Havel didn't get angry; instead, he picked up his Dragon Tooth "massage stick" and gave the Undead a full-body massage.</p>
<p>What players didn't know was that Chen Xu had made some slight modifications regarding Havel.</p>
<p>In the original version, there were actually several ways to deal with Havel, such as the door-trapping strategy, the poop-throwing strategy, and the somewhat despicable stair-exploiting strategy.</p>
<p>Among these, the easiest was the stair-exploiting strategy: players could run to the Watchtower stairs, then jump down when Havel came up.</p>
<p>Players would take fall damage, but Havel, due to wearing heavy armor, would also lose a significant amount of health from falling down the stairs.</p>
<p>But since players had Estus Flasks and Havel didn't, Havel would ultimately die tragically under the 'despicable' Undead's scheme.</p>
<p>Chen Xu also made some slight modifications to this.</p>
<p>After all, when drinking an Estus Flask, the Undead now don't stand still like in the original version.</p>
<p>So, Havel still takes fall damage but it's reduced somewhat. Additionally, Havel's recovery speed is faster than before, and the condition for him to 'jump' rather than 'run' down is stricter, effectively increasing the difficulty for players.</p>
<p>And when the Undead made their way up to the city wall, things got even more intense.</p>
<p>Amidst the arrows of two Hollow Soldier mobs on the city wall, they invited the Undead to a Minotaur feast—though this particular feast was a bit "hot" to eat.</p>
<p>And later, on a wide bridge, a Red Dragon sweeping across the sky spared no expense to light up a fireworks show for the Undead.</p>
<p>"I thought that having Linked the Fire before, I was already invincible. Turns out I was overthinking it!"</p>
<p>Leaning back in his chair, Song Ren opened the game's group chat and sent a message, sighing with emotion.</p>
<p>As if his lament struck a chord with others, messages started pouring in.</p>
<p>'Exactly! This <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em> is simply filled with malicious design!'</p>
<p>'Yeah, all sorts of traps, it's impossible to guard against them all!'</p>
<p>'The first time in Firelink Shrine, I gave up my first death directly in the New Londo Ruins!'</p>
<p>'Then you're not so good! I already gave up my first death when facing that big-butt demon in the Undead Asylum!'</p>
<p>'I wonder when fast travel will unlock in this game, I'm so not used to it!'</p>
<p>'Yeah, yeah!'</p>
<p>The entire chat group was filled with lamentations, with everyone recounting their tragic experiences in the game.</p>
<p>And it wasn't just the players in the chat group; the same scene played out across major forums and communities, with countless first-batch players who entered the game wailing in despair.</p>
<p>As part of the first batch of players to purchase and enter <em>Dark Souls: Age of the First Flame</em>.</p>
<p>They were mostly Veteran Players, like Song Ren, who had already played the previous <em>Dark Souls</em> series.</p>
<p>For them, before entering the game, they were brimming with confidence.</p>
<p>After all, they were completely familiar with the game <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>They had basically cleared the game, some even on their second, third, or even eighth playthrough.</p>
<p>These <em>Dark Souls</em> Veteran Players were quite confident in their abilities.</p>
<p>As excellent Firelinkers, they had no idea how many hardships they had endured.</p>
<p>Whether it was the Nameless King, the Soul of Cinder, or the Farron Undead Legion, they were all just pushovers in front of them.</p>
<p>Which one hadn't they defeated?</p>
<p>They even reached a point where <em>Dark Souls</em> became a dress-up and progression game for them.</p>
<p>So, beating a prequel would be a piece of cake, right?</p>
<p>However, after entering the game with this mindset, they clearly understood that they were wrong.</p>
<p>And they were terribly wrong!</p>
<p>Regarding the combat system, Chen Xu primarily adopted the style of the previous game, rather than the original version.</p>
<p>After all, many actions in the original version severely affected the player's smooth experience; the most direct example was the Undead having to stand still while drinking an Estus Flask.</p>
<p>But what good was a familiar combat system?</p>
<p>For a game like <em>Dark Souls</em>, its greatest charm lay in using a simple action system to make the game's difficulty both reasonable and challenging.</p>
<p>Simple basic attacks, heavy attacks mostly unused, and weapon arts only employed in specific situations.</p>
<p>Coupled with shield blocking, parrying, and rolling, all combat systems were actually very simple and easy to understand.</p>
<p>The real challenge primarily lay in the various attack patterns of the BOSSes and monsters.</p>
<p>Brand new monsters, brand new BOSSes—even with the original action system retained, if players didn't know how to deal with them and couldn't understand a BOSS's opening moves to predict its attacks, they were still bound to suffer.</p>
<p>Moreover, there was an even more crucial factor: the map of <em>Dark Souls 1</em>.</p>
<p>It could be said that the most commendable aspect of <em>Dark Souls 1</em>'s content wasn't its combat, BOSS design, or story.</p>
<p>Of course, it's not that these aspects were bad, but rather that one particular element shone so brightly it completely overshadowed them.</p>
<p>That element was the exquisite level design, filled with puzzle elements, and of course, omnipresent traps.</p>
<p>The entire scene map was crafted into a massive, perfect whole, divided into multi-layered, three-dimensional structures, with the relationship between scenes resembling a Mobius strip.</p>
<p>And Firelink Shrine was conveniently located at the center of the entire map, with connections in all directions.</p>
<p>Precisely because of this, it was necessary to design it so that bonfires could only be used for fast travel between other bonfires after first going to Anor Londo and obtaining the Lordvessel.</p>
<p>Because the entire map of <em>Dark Souls 1</em> was interconnected, if the bonfire settings were changed to allow players to fast travel anywhere, it would be difficult to experience the brilliance of the game map and its level arrangement.</p>
<p>After all, <em>Dark Souls 3</em> had a more linear map.</p>
<p>If <em>Dark Souls 3</em> didn't have fast travel, players would spend a lot of time traversing the map to get from one location to another.</p>
<p>But in <em>Dark Souls 1</em>, it was completely different; the entire map was full of shortcuts connecting everywhere, making it very convenient to reach many places.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the ability to fast travel only after acquiring the Lordvessel served as a reward for players.</p>
<p>Of course, current players clearly hadn't fully appreciated the map's brilliance yet.</p>
<p>Currently, for most players, their most intuitive feeling was:</p>
<p>Who am I? Where am I?</p>
<p>On the first day of the game's launch.</p>
<p>So far, the fastest players had, with the help of Solaire of Astora, defeated the first Gargoyle and rang the first bell.</p>
<p>Of course, these were players with stronger skills, while more ordinary players were still being "enthusiastically welcomed" by the villagers in Undead Burg.</p>
