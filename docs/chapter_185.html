                <p>Chapter 284: RPG Maps and Competitions (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Qin Yi felt a bit bewildered looking at the several different documents in front of him.</p>
<p>Regarding the Map Editor in Warcraft, Qin Yi and the others were somewhat aware of it.</p>
<p>Because during development, Chen Xu had already instructed their development team to reserve a dedicated port for the future inclusion of the Map Editor.</p>
<p>But what were these now?</p>
<p>"Maps like the single-player campaign?" Qin Yi and the others looked a bit lost.</p>
<p>It was clear they had no idea what these maps actually meant.</p>
<p>"More or less, they're leisure-oriented maps. You can think of them as large levels within a single-player campaign," Chen Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p>As a Map Editor, how could players discover its interesting points more quickly?</p>
<p>The best way was for them, as the official developers, to "cast a brick to attract jade" (offer an example to inspire others).</p>
<p>For these maps, Chen Xu had also chosen ones with distinctive features.</p>
<p>Mini-games, defense maps, RPG dungeon-crawling maps, and fun casual maps – all of these were quite distinctive.</p>
<p>These maps were released officially, but many interesting maps would still be needed in the early stages. So, later, Chen Xu planned to release some classic maps from his previous life as an ordinary player.</p>
<p>He would also open up corresponding permissions, allowing other players to make secondary modifications to these maps.</p>
<p>This would compensate for the lack of maps in the initial phase.</p>
<p>"I've clearly outlined the characteristics of these maps for you. The main core is the gameplay. You'll handle the numerical design. Additionally, the art department can add some models to the Map Editor for replacing scene maps and hero models," Chen Xu said, looking at the several individuals.</p>
<p>Chen Xu didn't intend to create these maps from his previous life himself; he just needed to make sure everyone understood the core gameplay.</p>
<p>As for the numerical aspects, they weren't strictly necessary.</p>
<p>Because the balance of these player-made maps wasn't inherently high.</p>
<p>Weak heroes would struggle to complete them solo, while strong heroes would find it easy.</p>
<p>With Qin Yi and their abilities, controlling the numerical design of these maps would be no problem at all.</p>
<p>These maps were more about entertainment than numerical balance.</p>
<p>It also served as a good exercise for Qin Yi and the other two's abilities.</p>
<p>"Then what about you, Mr. Chen?" Qin Yi instinctively asked, scratching his head.</p>
<p>"Me? I'll watch you work," Chen Xu said confidently.</p>
<p>Everyone: ????</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Of course, Chen Xu wasn't truly just standing by and watching Qin Yi and the others work.</p>
<p>He would occasionally offer guidance.</p>
<p>Qin Yi and the team had basically participated in the entire production of the Warcraft campaigns.</p>
<p>They weren't unfamiliar with developing these map contents. Moreover, Chen Xu had streamlined Warcraft's Map Editor during this period.</p>
<p>While it couldn't be called a completely idiot-proof version, the learning curve wasn't steep, especially for Qin Yi and his team. After a brief familiarization, there wouldn't be any significant issues.</p>
<p>Most of the time was spent on shaping heroes and adjusting the gameplay of the levels.</p>
<p>Especially in these maps, the design of hero skills was completely different from regular Versus system.</p>
<p>Yet, at the same time, they had to slightly conform to the hero's setting.</p>
<p>For example, in the 'Guard the Sword Pass' map, the setting is the Three Kingdoms era. You couldn't possibly design Lu Bu to be a Healer, could you?</p>
<p>Fortunately, Chen Xu didn't set strict standards for skill combinations, which often led to creative brainstorming from the team.</p>
<p>If the effects were too imbalanced and difficult to restrain through numerical design, they would simply turn it into a BOSS for players to fight.</p>
<p>After all, for a BOSS, it's quite reasonable for its skills to be a bit stronger, isn't it?</p>
<p>Over the next few days, Chen Xu remained quite relaxed.</p>
<p>It was a long-overdue few days of rest.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lin Rou also reported to Chen Xu about the upcoming event at Shark TV.</p>
<p>The relevant regulations had basically been settled.</p>
<p>And not just Shark TV; several other domestic live streaming platforms had directly collaborated to host this event.</p>
<p>The name of the competition was: Golden Monthly Tournament.</p>
<p>Held once a month, the prize money would be provided by Shark TV and other major platforms, along with some equipment sponsors, and so on.</p>
<p>It was divided into 4v4 team matches and solo matches.</p>
<p>Of course, the 4v4 team matches didn't refer to a free-for-all brawl, but rather an arena battle.</p>
<p>Each side would send 4 players, and each player's match would follow a Best of 3 (BO3) format.</p>
<p>For the team competition, the champion would receive 150,000 Yuan, the runner-up 100,000 Yuan, and third place 40,000 Yuan... the rest would be reduced according to their ranking, but all teams entering the Elimination Round would receive prize money.</p>
<p>Naturally, for those at the bottom, the prize money would only be a three-digit consolation prize.</p>
<p>As for the solo competition, it would last a total of four weeks: the first week for tryouts, the second and third weeks for Points Matches, and then players would be directly eliminated or placed into the Winner's Bracket and Loser's Bracket based on their scores.</p>
<p>The group stage would adopt a Best of 2 (BO2) format, with 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for a loss.</p>
<p>The elimination rounds would be Best of 5 (BO5), and the semifinals and finals would be Best of 7 (BO7).</p>
<p>The champion would receive 50,000 Yuan, the runner-up 30,000 Yuan, and third place 10,000 Yuan.</p>
<p>The first monthly tournament would use a tryout system.</p>
<p>In the future, a combination of invitation and tryout modes would be used.</p>
<p>Any Warcraft player with a Ladder Score of 2000 or above could register.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Shark TV platform had also specifically applied to Nebula Games for a dedicated server.</p>
<p>Currently, the participants for the first monthly tournament had largely been selected.</p>
<p>However, whether for team or solo matches, all participants were clubs that had just established Warcraft divisions.</p>
<p>This wasn't very surprising. After all, there was a considerable gap between ordinary players and even skilled players compared to those who treated gaming as their profession.</p>
<p>Entertainment was a hobby for most players, but for competitors, it was a profession.</p>
<p>Most of the participating players were familiar faces from the RTS scene, transitioning from other RTS games to Warcraft.</p>
<p>Chen Xu even saw some foreign players among them.</p>
<p>"There are foreign players? Are they playing with latency?" Chen Xu was a bit surprised.</p>
<p>Although the Parallel World's network technology was much stronger than his previous life, there was still physical civilian network latency across the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>"Although they are foreign players, the clubs they've joined are domestic. And Target Software also mentioned that some overseas organizers want to acquire the licensing for Warcraft tournaments to host their own competitions," Lin Rou explained to Chen Xu.</p>
<p>Chen Xu nodded without speaking, but he couldn't help but feel a little emotional; the Parallel World was far more professional in esports events than his previous life.</p>
<p>He had initially thought that the events organized by platforms like Shark TV would be similar to internet cafe competitions, but they were actually quite different.</p>
<p>Commentators, screen-switching perspectives, and even specially made competition tools.</p>
<p>For example, viewers watching the live stream could click on screen plugins in real-time to understand the attributes of unit types and various units in the game, instead of having to wait for the director to switch to that view.</p>
<p>There were also dedicated analysts; these introductions were incredibly thorough. For this, Chen Xu even looked up some famous RTS game tournaments from previous years.</p>
<p>Although those RTS games now had little popularity, and Chen Xu hadn't played them either.</p>
<p>Just by listening, he could still grasp the general idea.</p>
<p>Without being completely lost.</p>
<p>In this regard, Chen Xu had to admit that the Parallel World was indeed much more professional in organizing competitive events.</p>
<p>Chen Xu felt that the well-maintained scope of RTS in the Parallel World was not unrelated to its mature esports ecosystem.</p>
