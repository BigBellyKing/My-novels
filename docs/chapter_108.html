                <p>Chapter 207: First Test DEMO (Sixth Update, Request for Subscriptions and Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>As time progressed, Chen Xu also held several meetings with Qin Yi and others.</p>
<p>He further elaborated on the gameplay and core concepts of Minecraft.</p>
<p>A mobile version and subsequent VR version are planned.</p>
<p>However, the PC version remains the primary focus for now.</p>
<p>After all aspects of Minecraft were finalized, the entire R&amp;D department inevitably entered an overtime phase.</p>
<p>After all, time was quite pressing.</p>
<p>However, compared to the Minecraft segment, what was completed first in half a month were two DLCs for Don't Starve.</p>
<p>The Reign of Giants and Shipwrecked versions introduced some entirely new creatures and gameplay.</p>
<p>The content in these two versions wasn't actually that extensive.</p>
<p>Given the existing game framework and the detailed concept drafts provided by Chen Xu.</p>
<p>It didn't take much effort.</p>
<p>New maps, monsters, and some added content.</p>
<p>All rekindled players' enthusiasm for Don't Starve.</p>
<p>In the gaming industry, apart from Don't Starve players who rejoiced over the DLC.</p>
<p>Some developers and teams successively announced new developments regarding sandbox games.</p>
<p>This included TengHua and NetDragon, with their respective studios also getting involved.</p>
<p>Not much content was revealed, but from the disclosed information, it could only be described as a wide variety of themes.</p>
<p>Chen Xu took some time to observe this, and the actions of many game developers and designers left him speechless.</p>
<p>For instance, some directly copied Don't Starve's model, with the same survival theme, but changing the art style and camera from a top-down God's-eye view to third-person over-the-shoulder and first-person perspectives, and marketing it as a sandbox game.</p>
<p>This also left Chen Xu speechless. It wasn't that he immediately dismissed them as bad games; it was just that from the promotional content, they seemed more like simple survival games mixed with a touch of open-world concepts, yet they were directly labeling themselves as sandbox games due to the current popularity of the genre.</p>
<p>There were also many such games; some didn't follow the Don't Starve route but instead introduced minor innovations.</p>
<p>For example, some set the background at sea, allowing players to play as pirates building their own pirate ships, drifting on the ocean to find various legendary creatures, fighting pirates, and searching for mythical treasure-filled islands.</p>
<p>Others set the background in a post-apocalyptic world, also survival, but with the targets being various zombies and mutated creatures.</p>
<p>Still others turned it into an RPG, where players took on the role of demigods, going on quests to defeat various legendary monsters, with the ultimate goal of killing the Olympian gods.</p>
<p>Clearly, Don't Starve's performance in the sandbox genre also gave many designers in the gaming industry significant inspiration.</p>
<p>However, many games that Chen Xu felt had nothing to do with sandbox were uniformly labeled as such in their promotions.</p>
<p>It was quite reminiscent of his previous life, after Rockstar Games made GTA the benchmark for open-world games, where a large number of games on the market, regardless of whether they were previously action-adventure, FPS, or RPG, all called themselves open-world games, insisting on riding the coattails of the open-world trend.</p>
<p>In major player community forums, many players were engaged in various discussions.</p>
<p>'What the heck! I'm sick of it. How many have been advertised this month? Another sandbox game?'</p>
<p>'My goodness, Don't Starve really kicked off the sandbox genre. How many companies are making them now?'</p>
<p>'But honestly, as a graphics enthusiast, I find these a bit more acceptable than Don't Starve.'</p>
<p>'The graphics are certainly good, but I wonder about the gameplay.'</p>
<p>On the community forums, players complained one after another.</p>
<p>However, complaints aside, except for some sandbox games that looked rather crude from their project proposals.</p>
<p>Many publicly announced projects attracted significant player attention and gained considerable buzz.</p>
<p>Clearly, the sandbox game, this entirely new genre, felt very fresh to many players.</p>
<p>They might say 'there's too much, I don't want it, I can't handle it,' but their bodies reacted honestly, even actively embracing it.</p>
<p>But one thing was certain: with numerous sandbox game projects being initiated, this wave of sandbox fever would inevitably see some projects die on the beach.</p>
<hr />
<p>Chen Xu paid brief attention to the sandbox fever in the gaming community, then dismissed it.</p>
<p>His main task at hand was still to complete Minecraft.</p>
<p>The full version of Minecraft obviously wouldn't progress that quickly.</p>
<p>However, a DEMO for a phased test on PC had already been produced.</p>
<p>In the current DEMO, many features hadn't been made in time.</p>
<p>Not to mention the technology content in the game, even crafting and other related content weren't included.</p>
<p>Simply put, this current version was essentially a heavily stripped-down version of Creative Mode.</p>
<p>The entire game was very rudimentary. Currently, there were no art assets, and naturally, no UI, making it a complete mishmash.</p>
<p>Elements of Don't Starve and Dark Souls could be found, making it look very out of place.</p>
<p>But Chen Xu didn't pay much attention to it; it could be replaced later.</p>
<p>After all, most initial game demos looked like this.</p>
<p>After entering the game, Chen Xu began to experience it.</p>
<p>He quickly entered the game. The in-game 'Steve' wasn't actually Steve yet; it was just a block.</p>
<p>Yes, a simple plain white block, without any facial pixel details, looking very eerie.</p>
<p>Controlling the in-game character, Chen Xu flew into the sky and looked around.</p>
<p>Basic terrain generation for rivers, mountains, forests, and grasslands was done randomly.</p>
<p>Of course, while called random, there was actually a self-consistent procedural generation logic.</p>
<p>It couldn't be truly random; there were various formulas for resource calculation.</p>
<p>Because if it were completely random, a world might be generated with no water, or entirely ocean with no land.</p>
<p>Although the probability was very, very small, it was still possible.</p>
<p>He exited, then re-entered.</p>
<p>After repeating this a few times and observing carefully, Chen Xu nodded slightly.</p>
<p>As of now, no major issues were found.</p>
<p>Of course, more sample testing would be required later.</p>
<p>As for the art assets.</p>
<p>The mainstream configuration of players in the Parallel World was significantly higher than in his previous life.</p>
<p>There was no need to worry about hardware specifications; many aspects could be improved.</p>
<p>After all, good graphics were part of the gaming experience.</p>
<p>While retaining gameplay features, no player would say 'I don't need garbage 4K, I prefer sharp 360P resolution and jagged graphics.'</p>
<p>'Regarding the art, make the blocks more textured, and also improve the related textures for different materials.'</p>
<p>'Also, ensure special materials like lava, seawater, and ordinary blocks have a consistent art style. Lighting is also key: the effects of fire, sun, and other light sources should allow some in-game materials to provide more realistic feedback, such as glass and seawater.' Chen Xu said to Ruan Ningxue.</p>
<p>Without a verbal response, Ruan Ningxue nodded and jotted down the key points.</p>
<p>'Alright, you guys go ahead and get busy. Qin Yi, stay for a moment. I'll explain the upcoming crafting and technology systems in detail to you, and we'll make a DEMO prototype for that first,' Chen Xu said, turning to Qin Yi.</p>
