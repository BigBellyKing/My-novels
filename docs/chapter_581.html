                <p>Chapter 580: After all that fun, it's time for the heartache? (Requesting Subscriptions, Monthly Passes)</p>
<p>Without a doubt, this was absolutely the most exhilarating BOSS battle since the game began.</p>
<p>The empty plains were filled with fire and explosions.</p>
<p>Fires intersected, and it was clearly visible that some of Heisenberg's metallic joints, after his transformation, had turned dark red.</p>
<p>In the game, this would almost be a clear signal to players: this spot is the BOSS's weakness, attack quickly.</p>
<p>But at this moment, Song Ren didn't really want the battle to end so quickly.</p>
<p>It was simply too satisfying to drive that tank.</p>
<p>This level fully proved the truth of the saying: 'Fear stems from insufficient firepower.'</p>
<p>There wasn't a hint of fear, only extreme excitement.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the entire battle was still very thrilling and exciting.</p>
<p>Because in the middle phase, Heisenberg entered a new stage, and whether it was a plot kill or something else, in this stage, Heisenberg condensed his magnetic power, absorbing all surrounding metal into his core.</p>
<p>In this phase, Ethan, who was on the armored vehicle, fell off, becoming engaged in on-foot combat.</p>
<p>However, even though it was on-foot combat, ammunition supplies were abundant.</p>
<p>The ground was littered with shotgun and sniper rifle ammo. After continuously bombarding the transformed Heisenberg with a grenade launcher, Heisenberg quickly entered his final Rampage Mode.</p>
<p>Once again, he created a magnetic tornado, drawing everything into his core. The scene was incredibly shocking.</p>
<p>Even Ethan was pulled up this time.</p>
<p>“You should have taken the chance I gave you! Goodbye, Ethan Winters!”</p>
<p>“Say goodbye to Rose in your next life!”</p>
<p>“Once I kill that vile woman Miranda, Rose’s power will be mine!”</p>
<p>Across the entire open ground, the magnetic tornado, created by his magnetic power, sucked all metal into it, a truly stunning spectacle.</p>
<p>Even the tank that Chris had built was pulled into the air.</p>
<p>At this moment, Heisenberg was utterly arrogant.</p>
<p>But what he didn't know was that Ethan, in mid-air, had surprisingly managed to get back onto the tank.</p>
<p>At this point, Ethan struggled to grip the tank's cannon lever with both hands.</p>
<p>“You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p>
<p>In the air, Ethan pulled the cannon lever.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>With a loud bang, the cannon fired from the brass pipe, directly hitting Heisenberg's central core, unleashing a violent explosion.</p>
<p>Accompanying the explosion of the core, a scream erupted from Heisenberg's mouth, filled with unwillingness.</p>
<p>“No! No! This can’t be my end! I… still… have to… kill her!”</p>
<p>However, time was no longer allowing Heisenberg to vent his inner resentment.</p>
<p>A second explosion struck again.</p>
<p>Flames soared into the sky, and the massive explosion completely engulfed Heisenberg in the central area, leaving behind only a mechanical-like crystal.</p>
<p>Ethan, lying on the grass, struggled to his feet, breathing heavily.</p>
<p>Just then, Chris's call came through.</p>
<p>“Ethan? I just saw the explosion on your end. Are you alright?” Chris’s voice came from the phone.</p>
<p>“I just dealt with Heisenberg. Now I’m going to find Miranda and rescue Rose,” Ethan answered the phone.</p>
<p>“I’m coming with you. It’s too dangerous for you alone. Wait there, understood?” Chris said on the phone.</p>
<p>However, just as Ethan was about to reply, he suddenly heard the cry of a baby.</p>
<p>Recognizing the sound instantly, Ethan knew it was his daughter Rose crying.</p>
<p>“Rose…”</p>
<p>Chris, on the other end of the phone, heard Ethan's whisper, immediately sensed something amiss, and urgently shouted: “Ethan! Do you hear me? Ethan! Ethan! Answer me!”</p>
<p>But at that moment, Ethan had no mind to listen to what Chris was saying on the phone. Instead, he anxiously looked around, desperate to find the source of the crying.</p>
<p>However, in the next second, just as Ethan turned his head, a woman appeared before him.</p>
<p>Ethan was stunned: “Miya?”</p>
<p>It was Miya walking towards him. Miya approached Ethan, speaking as she walked: “Our child… she’s the most important thing in the world, right?”</p>
<p>“She’s my everything!” Ethan replied without hesitation.</p>
<p>“Me too, but Heisenberg is dead, and your lead is gone. What are you going to do next?” Miya asked.</p>
<p>At this point, Ethan also realized something. He pointed his gun at the 'Miya' in front of him: “I don’t know, but I will definitely save Rose!”</p>
<p>“Hmph…” The Miya, or rather Miranda, in front of him, let out a disdainful chuckle: “You're always clueless, aren't you? Even after I replaced Miya in your home!”</p>
<p>“Where are Miya and Rose?!” Ethan fired immediately.</p>
<p>But in the next second, three pairs of black wings sprouted from Miranda's back, enveloping her. The bullets struck them but couldn't harm her in the slightest.</p>
<p>Moreover, on the surrounding ground, vast black viscous liquid surged, forming plant root-like structures, just as in the previous game when facing the final Evelyn.</p>
<p>“Do you remember Evelyn?” Miranda paced back and forth, switching forms after only a short while.</p>
<p>She cycled through forms: Miya, Miranda, and the old woman encountered earlier in the village.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Ethan recalled memories from three years ago, pointing his gun at Miranda.</p>
<p>“Rose inherited her abilities… No, rather, Rose is the most complete form; she can fully control humans. And I want to possess her!”</p>
<p>“Go to hell, you crazy hag!”</p>
<p>Listening to Miranda’s words, Ethan was utterly enraged. Even though the firearms in his hand couldn’t pose any threat to Miranda, Ethan kept firing, as it was the only thing he could do at the moment.</p>
<p>“Calm down. Rose will be saved. Because the Mold entity has recorded everything about us, but then she will be reborn as my daughter,” Miranda scorned Ethan like a condescending emperor.</p>
<p>“She’s my child! Not yours!” Ethan was furious, but he had no power to resist in Miranda's hands.</p>
<p>“You little guinea pig are useless now.”</p>
<p>“Miranda, get out here!” Ethan was incredibly angry. He didn't care about anything else, nor did he want to know about Evelyn or the Mold entity; he just wanted to save his Rose.</p>
<p>But the moment his words fell, the elusive Miranda appeared before him.</p>
<p>Then… 'Squelch!'</p>
<p>Sharp claws instantly pierced Ethan's chest.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Ethan, your day of death has arrived.”</p>
<p>“You will be added to the Mold entity’s records…”</p>
<p>A still-beating heart was pulled out by Miranda.</p>
<p>“I will record your blood sample. When the ritual is complete at dawn, I will become her true mother. This bloodline will be eternal!”</p>
<p>Accompanied by Miranda’s maniacal laughter, Ethan finally couldn't hold on any longer and collapsed to the ground. The scene before his eyes blurred, eventually fading into darkness.</p>
<p>And Song Ren, who was playing the game, was completely stunned.</p>
<p>Dea…dead?!</p>
<p>Ethan is dead?!</p>
<p>Mr. Chen, you're at it again, damn it!</p>
<p>One moment you let players experience an exhilarating mech-on-mech battle, and the next you stab them in the heart with a cruel plot twist.</p>
